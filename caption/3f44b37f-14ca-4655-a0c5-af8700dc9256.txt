1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,040
Like you said, it raises everything I would say that people buy.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:13,370
And it's just like I said, I only really like to launch on my here.

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:24,300
You're around the corner. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,530
I think they're trying to save.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:38,730
I think I can just cause I was scared to be in there because I, like, I just didn't do it over my head and were doing it.

6
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:45,150
Oh, it's go.

7
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,740
All right, we have it here for us, Troy, that you drive.

8
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,900
I drive my car. They have it in my room.

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,960
And she has only.

10
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:17,720
Yeah. It's not different.

11
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,800
It isn't. It's just.

12
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:43,710
It's a different. I like.

13
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:54,890
Okay, well, there's chairs over there, and I can help you move that table.

14
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,210
I don't know where we would really put it, so.

15
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,780
Oh, okay. Okay.

16
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:12,950
Is the point. Well, I think there's an extra seat right there.

17
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:43,520
Oh, yes.

18
00:02:50,660 --> 00:03:06,050
Oh, there's just so much.

19
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:24,200
Just the other day, it was like she was like, kick us out without doing anything.

20
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:32,899
Okay. So we're going to get started. So welcome to the first discussion for you guys.

21
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,950
The discussion section, this is discussion section eight.

22
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:45,320
So I hope everyone's the right spot and we're just going to go over like what we would be doing in discussion section every week,

23
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,390
but we will be actually turning anything in. So it'll be a easy day for us.

24
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,220
So yeah, we can just introduce ourselves and go over the course of it all.

25
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,010
Hi. Are you guys here for the 513 class?

26
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,740
Yeah. Okay, we just have different classrooms.

27
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,630
Are you guys in different discussion sections? Okay.

28
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,610
Oh, my. Oh, my. Central 7908.

29
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:31,280
But thing I think they're okay with is anyone else who says, yeah, okay,

30
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:38,030
if you're in nine, I think you're you're supposed to be in town discussion section.

31
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,700
So that is I can find room for you. There's one that's loaded than two.

32
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,530
Okay. Yeah, it'll be that. Yeah. Oh, sorry.

33
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,030
I'm sorry. This is what if anyone. Okay. Is everyone in a.

34
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,930
Just make sure. Okay. The. The. Yes, please.

35
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,110
Sure. I think we all understand. I definitely agree.

36
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:10,400
Yeah. Sorry. All right.

37
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:23,600
Well, that's okay. There's never going to be rates for every time you have a day or so, you have to see.

38
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,150
Do we have enough seats if no one else comes, I guess.

39
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:37,310
Well, yeah, there's like a yeah. I don't love that situation with like, you know, but I guess there's like three people.

40
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,350
Yeah, I don't know. I'm sorry. You know, if that's an issue, you know?

41
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,920
Yeah, we'll see. But yeah, I think.

42
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,440
Well, one person was here, but then there actually, I was just kind of seconds, so that cleared up a seat.

43
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:56,570
All right. All right. Well, I wanted to stop by and welcome me.

44
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,540
Um, I have lots of families, right? Section.

45
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:07,160
So we're going to have to start my downswing by some time or send me an email if you like.

46
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,650
That's a real pleasure to have them course this year and I will let you get on with your section.

47
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,700
With that. You can have a great weekend, everyone, and see you here.

48
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:31,610
Okay. So, yeah, we're to go over what we would be doing every week and then we're going to make your group assignments for the rest of the semester.

49
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,059
So we're going to have to introduce ourselves again if you are doing it this week.

50
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:48,110
Sorry. So I'm Maia. I am a second year dual degree in Hfp and I am also in urban planning and I'm from Massachusetts and I'm

51
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:55,250
really interested in housing and health and how like where you live really determines your health outcomes.

52
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,690
So is everyone here in nutrition? Actually. Yeah.

53
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:08,330
Okay. Yeah. So don't say your department. Just so just say like your name, your pronouns, maybe where you're from and like,

54
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,079
you know, don't say why you're in this class because it's required as a whole.

55
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,100
So say, like, you know, maybe wording or degree or what your interests are.

56
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:33,830
Can we start back there? Okay. Um, I love, I think while this part is kind of funny about how to promote the house around the public,

57
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:41,930
where what I introduce in response to this, that was hopefully you got it.

58
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,680
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Oh, hi. My name's Laurie, and I don't think she left her house.

59
00:07:52,280 --> 00:08:01,610
Um, actually, I'm not sure, because I wasn't into the work, so I just thought it was so and learn more about it.

60
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,399
There was not children or anything related to nutrition.

61
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,770
And actually, my my career goal is to help people in a situation like that.

62
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:25,210
That's really cool. Well, um. Hi, my name is and wife two and then husband especially on the insurance.

63
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:41,100
And that's what we always need to do for our patients to let them have access to her and just somebody coming from a different side.

64
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:50,320
I'm glad you refer them to her. I'm interested in how nonprofits kind of impact the policy development process.

65
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:55,940
My mom worked for the American Cancer Society for years, and so I never understood her job.

66
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,850
And so I, you know, I'm interested and I think that's cool.

67
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,099
There's actually a class in Nation PE about nonprofit management and people say it's really good.

68
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,500
So if you're here, it's like six or nine.

69
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:17,960
And so she her pronouns and then I'm interested in that one.

70
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,670
Consistent and good execution plays out in public.

71
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:28,850
There's private and other types of education models. Hello, Marilyn.

72
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:37,250
She was someone to learn how to manage multiples, and it was an interesting process.

73
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,530
I think there's there's a chair. There's chairs over there if you want to just, like, pull up this space.

74
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:52,459
Are you in section eight? Yeah. Okay, great. You're in the right place. Hi.

75
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,520
My name is Leah. I want to show you her.

76
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,300
And I'm interested in global health and learning about food security.

77
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,370
Um, I guess I. Hello, I'm Melissa.

78
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:12,229
Um, I'm from California, and I'm interested in dietetics, so I have to take this class.

79
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,070
But I think, you know, in chronic disease prevention.

80
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:27,410
Sorry, I think you have to be here. Here I am.

81
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,150
Nutrition. Yes. Yeah, everyone.

82
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,060
Yeah. Are you also nutrition now on the agenda? Oh, okay.

83
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:43,310
I think what I hope to get out of this class policy in logistics, that's the fun stuff.

84
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:50,030
I don't really know what to expect. I don't. My name's Emma.

85
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,200
Um, she. Her.

86
00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:04,200
I'm from Ann Arbor in nutrition. And I also don't know what this does to surprise for almost.

87
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,570
Do you want to go just like your name or pronouns like. Hi.

88
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:29,910
My name is Karen Maginnis, and I'm going to bring more of our health care policy plus plus, any closer to the Affordable Care Act.

89
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:43,040
So, Lindsey, she announced her medical and I'm interested in research as a career.

90
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,290
And in terms of your research, especially with regulatory action, with environmental exposures.

91
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,520
My name is Jim and I use shares, pronouns and media.

92
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:04,540
And I think one thing I hope to learn from this, I guess about policy and like health care, but anything else?

93
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:19,070
Oh, my name is Laura and she has programs and I'm hoping to learn about using research findings to inform decision for policy making.

94
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,829
So my name is more bizarre pronouns.

95
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,470
So she her. And I'm hoping to learn more about the public health policy.

96
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,140
My name is Maya. I'm. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my God.

97
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:41,120
Thank goodness we need to speak. I will introduce herself into the lecture, and I was like, Oh, my God.

98
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,929
But I'm interested in maternal and child health.

99
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,700
So I'm kind of just interested in actionable policy, I think in this class mixing the more nitty gritty.

100
00:12:49,700 --> 00:13:02,090
So my name is the I also she her pronouns and we're we like to do like health policy next thing I think I know nothing about them or anything.

101
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,750
It's okay it's so confusing right now.

102
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,370
I'm really I also she her pronouns.

103
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:22,280
The thing I'm most interested in and learning is more advocacy work in the policy center that I I'm Elizabeth I also and she her pronouns and

104
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:30,960
kind of similar to Hayley I'm interested in advocacy and more specifically like what makes pieces super compelling when you're presenting them.

105
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,169
I sorry. I also use your pronouns on something I'm interested in.

106
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,480
Writing is just like public health organizations such as in organizations.

107
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:53,059
I'm Hannah. I also if you your pronouns and I like so I mean I really know what to expect and I remember I is she her

108
00:13:53,060 --> 00:14:06,140
pronouns stop around Justin is I just like I like a good health outcomes and kind of disease prevention.

109
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:22,490
Hi, I'm Cammie. I use her pronouns. I'm from Chicago, interested in practice and counseling, and I don't really have any background in public policy.

110
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,990
So I think it'll just be interesting to see how it works and how to use the service.

111
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:36,860
Well, I am Christiana and I use she her pronouns and from Ypsilanti in Ann Arbor and I'm

112
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:45,670
interested in nutrition security specifically and how NGOs can work with policy to try

113
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:52,790
and you know I use either pronouns who sterling heights Michigan and I guess they want

114
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,020
to learn more about the specific intersections between policy and the medical field.

115
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,040
And one day I want to be a clinical dietitian and specialize in diabetes management.

116
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:11,510
And when I come a contract in Michigan and I want to go into community nutrition so I should accessible.

117
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:23,390
The name is Michelle and yes uh oh maybe that would be my first an information.

118
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:32,170
So I want to learn the general percentages of another class moving into this one.

119
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,850
Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for introducing yourselves.

120
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:43,280
And I, I have another discussion session on Wednesday, so I have all of their names in my head to it's like,

121
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,270
I'm going to put your names in my head and I hope I remember all of them, but I might not today.

122
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:57,590
And so just for general things, Dr. Kenny really wants you guys to use canvas if you have questions about the class.

123
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,929
So there's like a discussion board and you can just ask the question there and then someone will answer it.

124
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:08,570
And you know, most likely if you have a question, someone else gets the same question and there's a way to make it anonymous.

125
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,550
I'm pretty sure he don't want anyone to know that you asked that question.

126
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:18,450
But also, I mean, you can obviously always email me or any of the guys so, you know,

127
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:22,350
more personal things, but you can also e-mail slip like class questions as well.

128
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:28,260
You know, and then these are the discussion expectations that we made on Monday.

129
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,810
I just compiled a lot of them from all of the groups,

130
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:39,659
but I really appreciate these and I just really do hope everyone keeps them in mind as we come back to them.

131
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:49,110
Because a lot of the cases that we talk about, you know, people just often feel really strongly about certain health care issues or health topics.

132
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,500
So it is really important to keep these in mind as we have kind of like sometimes intense discussions.

133
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:05,340
And so this is just kind of, you know, what we talked about on Monday, but does anyone have any questions about like the course in general?

134
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,720
And if I can't answer them now, I can like answer them at another time.

135
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:19,560
But if not, we would just go into the case. Yeah. I was wondering about the course part like that is definitely required for us to get.

136
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:25,140
Yes. I'm glad you brought that up. Yes. So the course cap is required.

137
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:29,280
You have to buy it from Harvard Business School.

138
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:38,430
It's like $50 and it's required because all of the cases in the pack are cases that you'll like, you'll read the case,

139
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:43,110
and then on Friday, you'll come in here and we'll do a case based on the ones that you just read.

140
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:56,690
I can't suggest anything, but I feel like if everyone gave $2, you know, but you can do whatever you want with that.

141
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:03,980
So you do have to buy the stock, though, and you do need the readings for it to like do the whole course, basically.

142
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:12,760
So yeah, moving into the case analysis from the readings in the course pack,

143
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:19,940
you'll have one case a week and then you will make a case every week in this class about what you read.

144
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:27,530
Basically, it's if anyone's written like a policy memo, it's a little bit like a policy memo, but in the PowerPoint.

145
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,819
And so all the work we'll be doing is in class and then you'll turn everything in after

146
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,530
class so you won't be doing any work outside of this course for discussion section.

147
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,799
And there's like a ton of different ways to do each case.

148
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:47,150
So I wouldn't really compare with other groups because both of you can get 100%, but right, different things.

149
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,980
And there's also no need to do external research. Everything that you need to know will be in the case.

150
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:58,940
And so, yeah, just make sure you turn your slides and if you're a group member, so when you make your case with your group,

151
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:07,069
write down everyone's name who is present, and then if you're not in discussion session, you'll have to do your own individual case.

152
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:13,790
And I don't think you get a lot of excuse absences for discussion section, so I would try and show up every week.

153
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,580
And so these are the main components of the case analysis.

154
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:25,270
Um, I'm going to go through all of them a little quickly, but you know,

155
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:32,270
we can talk about it and all the examples that I'm going to be using are from a previous case that was about the opioid epidemic.

156
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:38,780
And they're just examples to help you understand, like, what you would write in your potential case.

157
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:48,020
And we do want you guys to keep it at like six slides, but you don't have to do so.

158
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:57,880
Okay. So the first part is the situation and then this is when you would kind of identify if the the problem or I don't do them.

159
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:05,000
Like the topic of your case is a problem, a decision or an evaluation for the example that we'll be using, it will be a problem.

160
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:10,400
But this is literally only one point. You don't need to spend too much time on it.

161
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:19,160
You just have to give like a brief background of your topic and why you believe it is a problem, decision or evaluation.

162
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:24,469
And a lot of them, you can get the point for as long as you just say like,

163
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,910
this is a decision and like why you think it's a decision and then you'll get the point for it.

164
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:33,170
Yeah. Well these like before I hear this. Yes. What's your name again.

165
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:40,249
Sorry. Here and then these are the definitions of a problem decision evaluation.

166
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,290
And it's from the reading, I think it's called a case analysis or something.

167
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:51,260
I think you guys I don't on campus. So that is a really helpful reading if you want to understand more about how to make a case.

168
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:58,350
And so using our example of the opioid epidemic, you would say like, this is a problem.

169
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:08,309
And then you give kind of background on why you believe it's a problem and you're not really going deep into why it's happening or anything.

170
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,820
Just a brief overview of like what's going on basically.

171
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,309
And then the next section are required questions and support contacts.

172
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:27,219
So this is where you kind of brainstorm with your group about all of like the underlying causes of why you think this is a problem.

173
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:34,060
So you go into like the why and you still don't need to do any outside research because everything is in the case again.

174
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:39,460
But you are kind of bringing up multiple ideas and multiple reasons for why you think it's happening.

175
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:47,320
And then there's also a health equity component to this. So you do have to mention that.

176
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,370
And then you can't just say like there are inequities present.

177
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:57,490
You also have to go into like, why, why you think this is happening and why you believe there are inequities.

178
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,100
And so you go to like, what's the problem you're trying to address?

179
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:08,940
And it could be like an increase in overdose deaths from synthetic opioids.

180
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,660
And then you can talk about who's responsible for the problem.

181
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:18,840
And these are a bunch of different like a bunch of different options of what you could say.

182
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:23,010
But this is the time where you really kind of like gather all of your information.

183
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:31,670
So why you think this problem is happening? And then when you get to the hypothesis section,

184
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:38,420
you'll take kind of all the information that you just gathered from the last section and pick like your strongest,

185
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:44,870
your strongest one and you'll say, okay, we believe this is a problem because X, Y, Z,

186
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:54,140
and this is like a main point of the case where you you set your hypothesis and then

187
00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:00,950
later on you will explain why and give recommendations for what could go differently.

188
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:07,730
So this is just one example of an hypothesis with the opioid epidemic example.

189
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:13,550
So like improving physicians pain management training could be a way to reduce overdose deaths.

190
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:21,230
It could also be like increasing transparency or changing reimbursement in payment schemes.

191
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,650
And then the next section is the proof in action.

192
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,600
So the proof is kind of the evidence to support your hypothesis.

193
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:39,349
So if your hypothesis was changing payment schemes, your proof would all be related to that one hypothesis.

194
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:47,300
And we want you to choose just one hypothesis, even though we gave three examples, like just choose one and stick with it for the rest of the case.

195
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,350
So your proof is the support you have for your hypothesis,

196
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:57,260
and then your action is basically your recommendations and like how you would implement this.

197
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:09,040
So for the proof, you could give stats on opioid consumption or data or like an explanation of payment methods,

198
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,469
and then the action could be a way to change.

199
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:18,780
These things are essentially like fix the topic that you're discussing.

200
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,370
And then the last section is alternatives and weaknesses.

201
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:31,490
So you have to give one weakness to your hypothesis and then to alternatives what you're recommending.

202
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,920
And then you have to discuss how the alternatives would strengthen or weaken the case that you already have.

203
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:45,680
So all these could be some alternative examples, like restricting the use for certain groups or strengthening oversight.

204
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:55,760
And then a weakness could be, you know, pushback from the private sector because they want control and they don't really want transparency.

205
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:04,910
And then so to go over everything in your case, you need to have like these six slides,

206
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:10,840
the cover slide situation, questions and brainstorming hypothesis proof and action alternatives.

207
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:16,150
And you can obviously have more than six slides if you want. Like you could have 20 slides, but.

208
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:25,780
At minimum, you need six and. 20 is great, but you need six at least, and it's more work for you if you make 20 slides.

209
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,840
So any questions about the case? And like what you'd be doing.

210
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:39,000
Okay. So this is just the policy for late work.

211
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:46,290
Everybody gets one extension for any reason at all for these assignments.

212
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:52,980
And just tell us in advance, you don't have to ask, but just let us know.

213
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,450
And then we may grant additional extensions on a case by case basis.

214
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,710
Um, and is anyone graduating this year?

215
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,400
Okay, Matty, see you.

216
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,380
Oh, no. Lindsay Okay. I'm talking to you three.

217
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,970
Do you see that date? Yeah.

218
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:23,950
So. Start early on the cyber hit because you'll be graduating and nobody wants to work for you graduate.

219
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:29,440
And then if you have any questions about any of this, I mean, you can always be me.

220
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,120
These are the ones. No. So these are individual statements.

221
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,370
And the case is a group assignment that you'll do in here.

222
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,760
But these are separate assignments just for class.

223
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:49,560
Are you just going in one case to work on throughout the semester or do you have multiple that you are going okay?

224
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,620
Yes. Sorry. So every week you'll have a case.

225
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,549
So next week we'll do a case and then it's a different case every week.

226
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,910
So next week you're reading about B and it gives a great health system.

227
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:04,510
And then the following week it will be a completely different topic and you'll

228
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:10,510
have a bunch of cases throughout this and each group presents on the same case.

229
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:17,890
Or Oh, I should mention that too. I'm so sorry. No one is presenting, so you don't even need to come here and talk.

230
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:22,660
You're just. Yeah, no one is presenting.

231
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:26,680
You're just making a case, and then you submit it and then I look at all of them.

232
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:38,560
Yes, great question, Maya. And then for attendance, obviously, to, you know, make the case you need to be here in class.

233
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:43,540
So we really want you guys to show up, but things happen, so just let us know.

234
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:48,910
But there is a makeup assignment, but you only get like to make assignments basically.

235
00:27:50,200 --> 00:28:00,249
And then yeah. So for next week, the course pack needs to be purchased and you will be reading for this case.

236
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:07,300
So read it before Friday and then in class we will be like doing the case in your groups.

237
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:13,450
And then this is just an extra reading for how to analyze a case and how to make a case.

238
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:20,410
It's really helpful with the converse. Oh, crap.

239
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,420
Sabrina. Sabrina. Okay, Sabrina, I don't know if she's a mystery lecturer.

240
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:31,770
What are we supposed to look for in lectures or or lecture on Monday or before class session?

241
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,030
Before the lecture on Monday. Okay.

242
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:40,420
I will say, if you are kind of struggling with time management for this class and like there are a lot of moving parts,

243
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:49,060
I would prioritize the case at least because you literally need to like read that for lab.

244
00:28:49,150 --> 00:29:00,430
So I would prioritize that. But yeah, you want to read you want to watch the recordings by Monday and any other questions?

245
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:12,700
Okay. Also. So on Wednesday, the HBO people said Thursday 1130 to 1230 was good for office hours.

246
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,850
Is that work for you guys or not as much?

247
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:19,590
I don't know. I mean, is there like a big class? Everyone's in.

248
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,700
30. I don't know. Okay. Okay, great.

249
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:29,920
So those will be my office hours. And then if that doesn't work for you, you can always email me and it'll be by appointment.

250
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:35,200
I'm going to try and do definitely on Zoom and then I'm going to try and reserve a classroom somewhere.

251
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:43,140
Okay. So we're going to make your groups for. So this is basically your group's the rest of the semester.

252
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,480
Do you guys prefer to make your own groups or.

253
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,100
Yeah. Okay. Marilyn wants to make her.

254
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:55,729
Okay, so you guys can make your own groups. It has to be 4 to 5 people.

255
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,100
So you can have three. You can have six people.

256
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:05,360
And then when you're in a group, write down everyone's name and then give me that list of everybody in your group.

257
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:12,040
And then are there any other questions? Where can we find this slide?

258
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:21,250
Back in campus. I can post one of videos as opposed to like by tomorrow or something so we can.

259
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:28,480
Okay. You can make your groups then if there are no other questions.

260
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,230
Just make sure you write down everyone in a group. Give it to me and then we're good here.

261
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,820
I'll see you next week. Yes.

262
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:45,720
I mean, yeah. Yeah, that's right.

263
00:30:49,950 --> 00:31:11,500
I know. Yeah, I didn't I didn't climb down, but I look, I feel like I haven't really done.

264
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:25,060
You know, I was like, okay, okay.

265
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:37,480
Oh, yeah, I. I mean, I know, honey.

266
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:42,330
I know they were trying to find a girl, so. Oh, okay. Sorry I'm late.

267
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:53,440
Sorry. Hey, why don't you tell me what you think?

268
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,820
Well, we're giving it to her. I don't know. Oh, yeah. I like it.

269
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:05,830
Oh, one of those things, I mean, that is a really good question.

270
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:19,740
Yeah, it'll be nice. I don't know how I feel about.

271
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:36,540
Right. But what if, you know, you say, well, okay, now I know.

272
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:42,360
You know. Yeah, yeah, that's right.

Oh, my God. Did you go to high school now? Yeah, I did.

284
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:20,459
I. So I was wondering, where is Massachusetts?

285
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:31,440
Your first and second question is. I did not know the schedule this place and I will not be here Friday, February 24th.

286
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,020

288
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:51,120
Yeah, and I don't think you're going to let me go.

289
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:59,060
That's just a day that I didn't know. And then I don't think there's anything I was honestly like that would be paid.

290
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,010
So you just have could I submit like I will do?
