1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,860
Okay. We're going to get started, but help yourself. Now on the other side.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,090
So thank you all for coming. If you haven't been this semester, this is the professional development course.

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,810
This is for anyone, whether they're interested in a Ph.D. or a job.

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:27,780
So it's for everyone. And today specifically, we're going to talk to a number of our second year masters students about summer internships.

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,970
And so I have a few questions prepared that I'm going to ask specific members of the panel,

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,500
and then we're going to make sure that all of your questions are answered as well.

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,150
I am recording this, so it will be up on canvas for future reference.

8
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:51,750
And we're also going to try to send out to all students soon asking about their internship experiences and then kind of starting like an internship

9
00:00:51,750 --> 00:01:01,080
database that our current students can look in to find opportunities and places to go to see where those are for a bit more information.

10
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,600
Somehow we didn't have that already, so we're going to try to do that to give you all more experience.

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,510
So often we would have this kind of panel in what's called the Brown Gang Seminar, which is organized by students.

12
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,900
And so we want to make sure that you still get to hear about these opportunities.

13
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,420
And a lot of times in the past, we've really focused on college students, and we want to make sure that,

14
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,790
you know, that there are opportunities for masters students even after your first year.

15
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,980
And so that's why we have our summer masters students here at as of today.

16
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,560
So at first, I just want to ask everyone to give a brief introduction.

17
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,050
So if you just say your name, we all know you're a second year master's students advisor, so you don't have to say that.

18
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,020
But you can tell us a little bit about your background in terms of like, you know,

19
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:55,140
the undergrad and what was your major and then what you think you'd want to do for your career.

20
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,330
Like what? What do you think your next steps are?

21
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:04,980
Okay, so maybe a little bit of your undergrad or previous background and your career aspirations also visible.

22
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,530
I name is this about how do you see your pronouns?

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:22,620
I came directly from my undergrad. I went to Smith College and I studied statistics and data science that I was my career aspirations for.

24
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:32,459
Now, as I answer the question, my career aspirations are being able to consider what they would want.

25
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:41,670
So I work for a company that is able to process some sort of informative process when it comes to health care policies in the United States.

26
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,280
Great. Rachel, everyone. I'm Rachel.

27
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,860
I came directly from undergrad as well.

28
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:56,640
I went to Georgia State University, where I got my bachelor's in math with a concentration in statistics and my career aspirations.

29
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:03,010
I'm hoping to work somewhere like the CBC or NIH. So federal government should be.

30
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:10,630
How I write my name is to go there. Oh, sorry. Oh, yeah.

31
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,350
Oh, my name is. Go there. And you can also comment zero second year masters here.

32
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,810
And before that I got my bachelor degree from Beijing, China study food science.

33
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:31,389
But I'm not very good at cooking and there is I did is bridge because I want to expand my data skill and

34
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,860
my logic thinking and I wonder it's very different culture and I thought I came to the U.S. last year.

35
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:42,470
I got lucky. I had a lot of knowledge to analyze the Internet.

36
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,809
And after this internship it was fun. I was drawing interest and then consolidating.

37
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:55,010
So after graduation I wrote to in Consortium Burlington Group based in Boston.

38
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,300
So yeah, I think that's why that would be my career path of the future.

39
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,870
Great quote on before the break we wanted to have in person. So you just sit you said I should have asked you to stay where you're going.

40
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:12,110
So you said your internship was at Eli Lilly. So let's go back to Isabelle and Rachel to get their answers to where was your internship?

41
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,450
My internship was at a company called Premier. They focus on health care improvements in hospitals.

42
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,170
And my internship was with the U.S. Census Bureau.

43
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:29,120
Okay, got it. Hi, everyone. I'm Cathy. I use her pronouns, and I also became directly from undergrad.

44
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,960
I studied chemistry at the University of Texas at Austin.

45
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:41,509
So this past summer I did my internship at a startup based in San Francisco, but it was remote due to COVID, where I worked.

46
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,089
Like in between. I worked in a computational group,

47
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:52,160
but I was like a statistician on that group and I worked kind of cross functionally between science and like bio and then not modeling.

48
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:59,720
So I kind of like that space in between science and math and trying to figure out what kind of roles are out there between there.

49
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:08,990
That's kind of where I see I want to do statistics and I want to be in the dry lab, but what my specific task is still to be determined.

50
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,229
So hi. I'm seeing and I directly come from my undergrad.

51
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:20,990
I took two year in New York State. I studied computational biology and I'm winner in mathematics.

52
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:27,080
And then I study and I spent another two years in Cornell, which I focus on computational biology.

53
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:40,250
And I did a internship that is called grill is so like comedy that the alumni and then is I'm doing like about informatics

54
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:47,900
and data science intern and what I'm doing in this comedy is more like router classifier to like detect cancer.

55
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,350
Earlier you have your blast output and I just do classifier.

56
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:55,579
I do machine learning things to tell you like what the probability you're going to have

57
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:03,440
a cancer and and in in that internship from that internship I really like into the

58
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,879
data science so I'm like to merely like apply for that that a scientist and also I'm

59
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,550
also interested in about asthmatic manic so I'm also like apply for that kind of thing.

60
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:25,110
Okay. So I want to ask you about how you found out about your internship.

61
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,420
Right? So where do you even start to figure out where these opportunities are?

62
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,440
So in particular, where did you find out about yours?

63
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:38,850
I specifically found my internship through LinkedIn and I originally started my search looking at just like bio statistics roles,

64
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:48,420
and I realized I was very limiting. So then I started doing stuff in between, like computational biology, and I think that's my specific role.

65
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,239
Computational Biology Intern But bioinformatics.

66
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,719
I also had kind of good luck getting internships or it's just like going through those different key terms and seeing if they have the role.

67
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:05,790
Seems like a stats role. I've had lot great visibility and I spent a lot of time on handshake,

68
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:11,340
the University of Michigan Partners on Handshake, so they have a lot of different opportunities there,

69
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:17,490
though I did apply for so many internships and I didn't hear back from any of them, so I had to switch up the amount that I was doing.

70
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:23,700
And fortunately for the company company premier, they actually had a courier service from okay.

71
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,650
So I was able to talk with people from the companies more and more about the internship that I was interested in.

72
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,780
And from that I was able to ask questions, talk to them,

73
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,629
they got to see my face and afterwards I went on LinkedIn and I reached out to

74
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,060
the person from the panel that is about I applied to this internship like,

75
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,610
can you let me know what else I can do to get this opportunity?

76
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:50,280
And they actually spoke to the recruiter about me and were like literally e-mailed me the next day, what do you do?

77
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,000
So a little bit of a mix initiative, though, right?

78
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:59,489
Initiative paid off. They're like, you don't feel like you can't reach out, right.

79
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,820
And remind them of who you are and what you applied for. It was very important.

80
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:10,170
And Rachel, yours is a little bit different, right? Yeah. So I actually found my internship through an email that was sent out by Nicole,

81
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:14,549
and I'm sure you guys have seen her work with my job posting that we might

82
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,820
be interested in or internships that we might be interested in applying for.

83
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,140
So I would definitely encourage you to actually read those and consider applying for some.

84
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,709
There are a lot of really great opportunities that she knows about. Yeah.

85
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:33,210
So if you often see Nicole and also faculty send out things and a lot of times they're like, you know, for an academic position or whatever,

86
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:39,450
but don't automatically delete it, read it first because there are some really useful opportunities sometimes.

87
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:46,350
Okay. So I think we right once you figure out where to go, where to apply,

88
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,750
then there's often some hoops to jump through in terms of the interview or application process.

89
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,030
And so I want to ask you about what was that process like for you?

90
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:10,520
So far, my search said I learned a thing and just round around interviewing just one interviewer and it's about 45.

91
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:20,549
It is and is more how they love a sound contract is more traditional during question and

92
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:27,720
also you have the passion and how you hire like there's a whole lot to this position.

93
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:38,790
Why you want to go to this is called something like that and yeah and then a Florida request as part of their zoning declined.

94
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:48,600
I mean, their shared experience. And how do you handle a different idea in teamwork?

95
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:59,580
And yeah, I think that's also someone that also asked me about Sue, your future in school and your future,

96
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:05,100
because at that time, I, I don't have like because I came as different background.

97
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,919
I don't have a strong like data skill or technical skill or lacked the programing

98
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,310
language or I don't at that time I didn't know how to use Python Seiko.

99
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:22,980
I just learned, wow, you know, and so I would've focused on like my future,

100
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:30,240
kind of like what kind of course I'm going to take because there is the two semester before the summer intern.

101
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:39,540
So I want to show my passion, my and I want to make myself be professional in the future.

102
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,170
Yeah. So that's like, what my interview like.

103
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:48,329
So you made a comment like you hadn't had a lot. So what, what was the timeframe of this like?

104
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:55,530
When were you looking for this and interviewing? I think I applied out of position.

105
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:00,150
I met this position, mentored by a recruiter, even in the grandparents.

106
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,089
And I just very interesting is that there is the I of this position.

107
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,159
So I just had the whole afternoon,

108
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:18,650
I mean to frame my resume for some six and a half and I just apply them and keep following up with my recruiter and then I just the resumes.

109
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:27,550
Interview. After two or three days, a duet inspired a crack at its interior interviewer opportunity.

110
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,729
And after this interview, it takes about three or four weeks to get a notification.

111
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,930
So I got this offer before Christmas.

112
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:45,340
So it's kind of a good Christmas gift. I was pretty lost.

113
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,540
So if people want so for something, they should be looking now.

114
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,069
Right? I think so.

115
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:58,920
I think the sooner the better, especially for I think some of the pharmaceutical companies are going to be like, you know, okay, yeah.

116
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,610
How about what was the application and interview process like for you and I?

117
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,739
I really agree with Tanja that you should apply sooner because I really relate

118
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,790
and it was like I didn't got to interview and to you like the end of semesters

119
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:23,320
I was like during the final exam and at that time I have like to around like totally stuck to around three four on this that I have a team member in.

120
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,239
And to just ask me like what my goal I create goal.

121
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:39,520
And she asked me like has she have like a specific question about the things that I did, the research I did, like what I write in my résumé.

122
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:45,520
And then she had to ask me some like a statistical questions like and yeah,

123
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:51,790
some easier like linear regression and also like general like regression or something like that.

124
00:12:52,090 --> 00:13:03,010
And then I got the feedback like about two weeks later, I know about one weeks later and the second round took me like two, 2 hours, sis.

125
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:10,030
I took me like with four people, five people and the second round actually half full round.

126
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:19,540
And the first round is I met with two people or two team members and I just have a presentation of a research I did like from end to end,

127
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:28,659
like how I gathered my, how I got there, my dada to like what the pipeline of running had, what cold and marrow using and whether it's elections.

128
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:36,250
And then you asked me like specific question about details that about like some math or some modeling method I'm using.

129
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,249
And then the second round like, all right, easy,

130
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:50,650
cold or you is not leave cool questions or just like the the the just want me to use but either are all python so that's how I would choose art.

131
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,420
So it's like some simple, simple sentence called modeling questions.

132
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,280
So they were asking you like to do some or simple things?

133
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:10,959
I think so. So I was like, not that hard. And then I have another round with another team member that she was like last year.

134
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,380
She was a mentor for the intern.

135
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:21,790
And so she just asked me something about like I think as a behavior questions and she also like asked me whether I have some questions for her.

136
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:31,570
So that would take me only like 20 minutes. And then the last round of actually was with the person was my mentor at that time, I don't know.

137
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:37,480
But she just asked me some specific questions about the program, like what the project I've been doing.

138
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,959
I really like that laid her that one. I really did the internship.

139
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,460
She just asked me some actually some difficult problems she's actually facing at that time.

140
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:52,750
So she want to like ask whether you have some specific idea and whether you idea is quite like valuable.

141
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:58,209
And I think that was really important like for the whole decision process because she's the

142
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:04,300
one that actually decide who she want to mentor and who she want to do that with her project.

143
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:12,760
So yeah, that's great. So varying degrees of technical questions, right at your, at your interviews.

144
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:21,850
So not the next few professional development courses or whatever weeks are going to be focused on career services.

145
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:29,110
Some of them career services is going to come and help us figure out how do we use all the resources at hand and make sure that our materials,

146
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:36,189
written materials are up to date. And then in the winter, which maybe is too late, given this timeline, we're really talking about interview skills.

147
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:43,690
So we will talk about both the behavioral interview and one session and then the technical interview and another session over the winter,

148
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:50,200
too, to better prepare you for those next year, I guess, or this year, if you if you apply later.

149
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:57,190
Okay. So I want to know a little bit more about what was expected of you at your internship, Rachel.

150
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,009
What what was expected of what were you doing? Yeah.

151
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:08,650
So I'm a previous intern for my team, had combined 14 years worth of data from a specific survey into a longitudinal data file.

152
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,780
And my task was to clean that file and get it ready to be sent to the sponsor for analysis.

153
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:18,460
And then my second task was to just make some recommendations for how they could.

154
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:24,060
Redesign the survey based on some of the data quality issues that I found during the cleaning process.

155
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,480
Candy, what about you? So I was really lucky and I got like a clean data.

156
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,799
The only thing that I really had to do was to collect metadata.

157
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,330
So that was more of communicating with this lot of scientists.

158
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:44,310
What metadata would make sense to put into the models that I was creating?

159
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,200
And I was just like, that was a big part of the project and also learning how to present it.

160
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:56,030
So I had two main presentations and I think maybe like other internships are like this one was more general for the entire company.

161
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,550
The company that I worked for was only 450 people, so they do all hands.

162
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:05,190
So learning how to communicate with non statisticians or just giving the baseline.

163
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,540
And then I had one in front of like computational science where it had to be a little bit more heavy.

164
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:17,760
But I think one of the key things that I talked to my mentor about was like, how should I use like what I learned in the internship to apply for it?

165
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,740
And that was something that I had to do to take initiative in, and that was with networking.

166
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,200
So I had a remote job, so it's slightly different,

167
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:31,290
but I was kind of in charge of networking with people and like getting what I want out of so constant communicating and then

168
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:39,090
asking what people I wanted to meet and kind of what I wanted to get out of the internship outside of my specific project.

169
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,550
That's a great suggestion in terms of again, taking initiative, doing the networking.

170
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:49,620
So not just doing the work but putting in the work so that this can pay off in the future.

171
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,400
Right. Of getting that that network. Okay. And Tanga, how about you?

172
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:01,580
About that. What was expected? Like what were you doing? Yeah, I think I would answer this question like in two main parts.

173
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:08,300
So the first one is the technical part. The other part is more like the culture and the economy.

174
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:17,990
So for the technical part, I think the my work is a kind of folded up flow like from the claiming and data manipulation,

175
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:25,050
data analysis at the model building and family data visualization.

176
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,110
And the we create a kind of interactive dashboard.

177
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:37,919
And then just a final presentation. So it's just like doing a product they expect me to are signing into a team.

178
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,469
And I just do like to support this team and focus on the vendors.

179
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:50,400
But I think form the companies like they don't they didn't they don't just the family tree.

180
00:18:51,240 --> 00:19:00,030
But it's kind of interested to be a very professional contributor because we're just like it's a new, we are just a new genre.

181
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:11,489
So I think they just want me to show one. I want to show that we are a quick learner and a way to communicate well with the team is very good.

182
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:18,750
Like the team members. I think that that's what they want to use to perform as part of your project.

183
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:24,299
They don't want you to be a very like a professional, very high strung technician.

184
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,790
I think this from what they expect an informed company is that I was thinking they

185
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:35,339
wanted like for Eli Lilly they want their an internship to to love their company.

186
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:42,000
They want their intern to come back after after the after graduation.

187
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:52,319
So they hold a lot of social events like Night of Work event because networking is very important in an Eli Lilly especially,

188
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,170
they really wants you to communicate against people like the leadership.

189
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:06,060
And also they encourage the intern to start one out by meeting with people from different departments.

190
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,990
So I just take advantage of that at home.

191
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:20,879
People from different departments kind of factoring in regulation and marketing, those kind of education gave me a very a whole company perspective.

192
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,530
I think that's my right part of it could help me learn quicker for this industry.

193
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:32,460
So I think for the companies that they want you to just love this company and come back in the future.

194
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,870
I think that's the two main presumptive expectation for internship.

195
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,160
That's great.

196
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:47,250
And that leads into our next question of did it seem like there is the possibility of hiring you after this internship is available for you?

197
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:57,360
Yes, they expressed interest and I think for me especially there is a really huge company and they have a bunch of different names.

198
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,839
I was in the Applied Research Team and this was actually their first summer

199
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,399
hosting interns and you can tell like it was like they literally they're like,

200
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:11,610
read this paper and find typos. I'm like, you're like not you know, these are the best that my degree.

201
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:18,450
And so I was like very keen and I noticed that they had recently transitioned from SAS to art so.

202
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:23,970
A lot of their research scientists do not know how to use are. So I would say, hey, you need help making a graph, an art.

203
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,540
They need help. Analyze it just in art. I can do that for you. And so I created, like, possibilities for me to show that my skills,

204
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:37,160
because they weren't given me an opportunity with me and they were just like, wow, like, this is very valuable.

205
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,410
Like, would you want to come back? Or. And I was like, Yeah, for sure. So I'm still doing like kind of consulting for them.

206
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,420
So whatever they need like a visualization or they need help.

207
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:51,239
And I'm like, I'll go and talk to them and we'll see if that leads to a job down the line.

208
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,320
But for now, like they still are. That's awesome. Kathy, what about for you?

209
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:06,350
So for my company, since it's like a startup, they're mostly hiring middle ground people, but they're also in a state where they are hiring.

210
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:11,200
Like when they're when they put a job application, they need to validate as soon as possible.

211
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:17,900
So it's not like a direct pipeline. But they opened up the door. I talked to my boss about it and like this is where like the networking matters.

212
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,480
I talked to my boss about it and her boss about it.

213
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,270
Like they were like if there was a position that you want to play for like definitely reach out to us and anyone that

214
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:32,569
you talk to because it could be like not their team specific but other team and they will help me through the process.

215
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,500
So it's not like a direct. Yes, but it's also like they left the door open.

216
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:43,280
And if I want to reach out to any of the companies they work for and the current company or for the entrepreneur, that's great.

217
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,280
Okay, this is the last prepared question and then we'll open it up.

218
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:55,970
But Shannon, can you tell me what was the best part of your internship and what was the maybe least favorite, the best part of it?

219
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,030
Think there are like two main part.

220
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:06,590
The first one is I got really good practice with like our program and pipeline and about Linux and really like struggling Seoul on

221
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:13,639
time like rhythm and excitement like before that if someone like want me to learn Linux like do something and then experiment,

222
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,140
I'll be no stone.

223
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:25,370
And then this internship, I must do that because it's like we need to do everything actually in our like company environment is under the annex.

224
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:32,260
So I would just push myself to do that. So I think that matters a lot to me because I really like master something about Linux.

225
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:42,080
I won't be so scared of it. And the second part I really look into that is the, the lunch is really good and yeah, we have free lunch.

226
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:49,480
It was like really nice and, and maybe the thing is always like ab maybe I really like that,

227
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:56,540
but I think maybe sometimes I need to work over time is like maybe into the evening sometimes

228
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:01,640
because we have like some we have the project that we must report weekly and monthly.

229
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:11,420
So sometimes before deadline you'll be like us with Biomet here that maybe you want to do more because she has idea and they'll say,

230
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,930
Yes, I'll do that. And then maybe sometimes I need to work in the evening.

231
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:24,350
But that happens a lot. But it happens sometimes and especially during the final week is like my mentor is really, really super nice.

232
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:30,020
She just gave me like so many ideas about my final presentation and so I need to adjust some things.

233
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,829
And now present, I present to her next week and that's today.

234
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:40,070
So tomorrow, sorry. So it's like I need to work into like sometimes late night, but I still love that.

235
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,760
That's great. Rachel, how about for you? What was like the best thing about it?

236
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,780
What was your least favorite?

237
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:52,640
Yeah, I think I really enjoyed the challenge of getting to apply my programing skills to a really, really messy and imperfect dataset.

238
00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:00,469
I thought it was really fun. And then I think my least favorite thing, I didn't realize that the Census Bureau doesn't actually analyze data.

239
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,620
They just design surveys and collect data for the most part.

240
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:10,460
So that was a little bit disappointing that I didn't get to do any analysis, but I still really enjoyed the cleaning process.

241
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:16,310
That's awesome. Okay. So that those were the questions I wanted to make sure we addressed.

242
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:22,340
But if you have any other questions and or you want to ask one of those questions to somebody else who didn't answer,

243
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,550
please feel free to speak up and ask away.

244
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:33,940
Yes. I have a question about the I guess the question, everyone.

245
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:44,420
But why did you feel like your work life balance was I know you want to kind of address that, but like where the like any expectations, for example.

246
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,849
I think I like it.

247
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,850
I really like that it's it's a perfect.

248
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:59,650
So there's no like the time like a check in time or check out time that usually you want

249
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:07,759
to work maybe after four or five and and you kind of work just isn't as high right now.

250
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,270
Maybe you can just need to show up in the office like two or three days.

251
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:19,730
Actually, if you don't show obvious, I think it's still not a big problem because your boss want to be off everybody and yeah,

252
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:27,559
and that's like the work life balance. And also I think also there are also like other benefits.

253
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:34,879
So for example, if you have a summer shutdown, so like after that they are independent.

254
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,000
They signed on for us and they gave us like a four, four days off.

255
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:46,310
I guess the pay off so combined with two weekends is like nine days off totally.

256
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:52,900
So it's very good. And also to have interns shut down like passing in time around Christmas time.

257
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:58,190
So I think the work life balance is is perfect.

258
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:09,310
Yeah. And also the work is very intense as I think as a like a traditional pharmaceutical company, you don't have too much work load every day.

259
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:15,800
Yeah, it's our second that for Premier they had a really good work life balance.

260
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,389
The team that I work for is completely, remotely having a role in before the pandemic.

261
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,969
So like everyone was like all over the states.

262
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:29,390
And so the only thing you had to be mindful of is like when you had team meetings because you had to be present for

263
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:36,020
that other than not like as long as you work 40 hours a week and did the work that you need to do in a timely fashion,

264
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,590
they really didn't care. Like when you were.

265
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:47,170
I think they also provided a really good work life balance because they didn't receive an email after 5 p.m.,

266
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:51,560
which was really nice because I didn't feel the pressure to be on after five.

267
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:57,350
And another thing I really liked about Premier was that they give their interns 40 hours gift of time,

268
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:02,330
so I could use that any point in my during the ten weeks that I was there,

269
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:08,840
if I was sick or if I needed to travel like I could still get time off and I can just use my gift of time that day.

270
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,840
So I did a lot of traveling this summer because it was remote, so you became really good.

271
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:19,430
You Yeah. And I had a similar experience with working at the city bureau.

272
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:27,980
Something that was kind of different was actually give. You have something called like flexible scheduling where instead of working five days a week,

273
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,999
8 hours, you can choose to work four days a week, 10 hours, which is what I did.

274
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,799
So I had every Friday and just working Monday through Thursday and that was really nice.

275
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,950
And a lot of people who worked on my team also were on the same schedule.

276
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:47,240
That's awesome. Other questions. Yeah.

277
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,950
Oh. Where you working with other interns as well?

278
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:59,960
Or was it mostly like you and your mentor or like who did you interact with most regularly?

279
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:08,150
And really, I was the only intern on my team, so I was mostly working with my supervisors.

280
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:16,040
But we also had weekly meetings with the other interns across the Census Bureau who weren't necessarily on my team,

281
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,780
but we're working with other people at the census, so I got to interact with them as well, which was nice.

282
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:28,630
Okay. I told you earlier, I think usually my work is, is my is my mentor.

283
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:33,250
But like, um, I mean, kind of like big teams.

284
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:45,280
So there's also other interests. And I think for one cohort this summer, I think there are about trough or 10 to 12, like a master internship.

285
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:51,510
So you don't work very closely because you have your own project, but you got out,

286
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,829
which has just made time into office and you're just quicker to communicate what you are working out.

287
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:09,070
It is done for the project. I have been I work with very closely with our mentor and also with a stakeholder and she is from a travel background.

288
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:14,860
So some have been to meeting and just to talk about some, maybe not.

289
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:23,110
They don't know too much about that stuff. So sometimes we need to explain our concept to them I think is just like a real business work.

290
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,889
But you need to team work with people from different backgrounds.

291
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:32,170
So sometimes just like has a that you need to explain to others that why that it makes

292
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:36,550
sense they don't care too much about your detail like what kind of motor you use.

293
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:43,680
They want to make sure how could you work, make business impact, especially for the for the leadership.

294
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:46,780
It is also what I learned from my final presentation.

295
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:52,540
The introduction part is very important because. Like for the leadership.

296
00:30:52,600 --> 00:31:00,430
They don't care too much about detail, but the amount of work has a business impact and then you need to explain that very explicit.

297
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:05,240
I think that's also what I learned from this internship. Yeah.

298
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:11,610
I mostly worked with my like my mentor and like the people she said, like these are the main collaborators for this study.

299
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:19,440
But I did like I found an intern buddy. So when we had to do the companywide presentation, it was only 5 minutes.

300
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:22,709
It had to be very concise, it had to be very general.

301
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:28,230
And I had to like, as you said, the like the business impact or like the impact on the actual product itself.

302
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:32,129
So it's nice to make friends in other fields.

303
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,620
So he was interviewing you just to like do your presentation for us.

304
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:41,639
So you know that like this makes sense and this is interesting because that's what they don't know what other people don't know us stuff,

305
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:53,090
not decisions. So for me, every one, like every intern in my team or small like works on their projects.

306
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,670
So we don't actually collaborate on that lot.

307
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:06,959
But I just work with my mentor and I also have like close connection with the person in one team because we need to like

308
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:16,050
communicate like how things is working with their line and how I can help them to like make some improvement based on my results.

309
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:23,950
So yeah, I actually have like connection with those two team and yeah, that's.

310
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:33,170
My company had four interns in their applied research team, so two Ph.D. interns and two Master's interns.

311
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:38,870
But we each had our own mentor, so we had weekly meetings where we interacted with each other,

312
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:43,209
which is really nice, but mostly it was individual projects.

313
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:51,410
So working by myself, the company all had like interns from all over the different areas and we would have daily meetings with them,

314
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:59,299
which was quite a time, but it was really cool because I got to learn about the different areas like the business area,

315
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,480
the analytics area, so you got to see what other people were doing.

316
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,630
Are there other questions? What about Virginia and.

317
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:22,200
How did you find issues with being an international student and trying to find opportunities for internship?

318
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:30,750
Yeah, I think yes. Because for a international student like Ben, you'd like to sponsor a script.

319
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:40,799
So I think it's better to I think it's a little different with the internship and the full time, but I think for full time, of course,

320
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:52,590
we need the company to sponsored the visa in the future, so it's better to ask them before you apply if they didn't see that in the job description.

321
00:33:52,590 --> 00:34:01,470
But for the internship, I actually really used the same P.A. so actually we don't need to sponsorship from a companies perspective.

322
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,179
They want their intern to come back in the future. I think for most the companies.

323
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:11,760
So they also think about if they don't sponsor you don't they cannot sponsor you.

324
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:23,140
Mostly they want to hire like international interns, but it doesn't mean like they just don't have it is there is a lot of like a special case.

325
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:27,360
So but I think generally speaking, a continent is probably a big company.

326
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:33,780
They if they want to sponsor their internship, I think that's totally fine.

327
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:40,709
But if they don't sponsor like I think you could send an email to the recruiter or ask them, you know,

328
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:47,520
possible where it's impossible to hire international intern or they just usually don't do that.

329
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:59,580
I think it's better just to ask them. Yeah, generally speaking, sponsorship is is kind of a requirement for internship and full time job.

330
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,270
Yeah, that's what I think. So, you know, so let me just clarify.

331
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,429
You don't need the sponsorship for the internship.

332
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:13,530
However, since they're looking for people to hire after, usually if they don't expire and sponsor their new hires,

333
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:17,340
they won't invest time in you as an intern or internship.

334
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,610
You just need to apply for CBT, which is kind of like a course here.

335
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:28,440
Yeah. And also from the government for try to work legally inviting you for a full time job you don't need.

336
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,389
You also don't need to do the sponsorship because you have OPD, especially one program,

337
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:39,070
you have this three year old, but if they don't sponsor you after three years of available,

338
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:44,670
maybe you just go back to your country or something like for there is is a big cost

339
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:48,490
because they spend money at the time to train or to be a professional all year.

340
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,790
But after three years you will go so far. How many is person?

341
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,280
Probably.

342
00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:02,400
That's why they if they don't sponsor you, they also take that just so they just don't take the international student for it for a full time.

343
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:09,220
But I've actually some I would say yeah, because like even for domestic employees,

344
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:15,989
maybe they want to work for three years and they will maybe switch to another company but like for three years,

345
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:22,229
like for an international you after three years you have to go like this of Maybelline's product.

346
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:30,790
So I think that's why companies, they don't want to sponsor you if they they don't have money or something like that.

347
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:37,389
Yes. I really grew as time goes, like and this is like a big problem.

348
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:41,530
Like you will have this problem when you want to find a full time job there.

349
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:46,800
So it's like I think the things like my suggestion is more like apply more

350
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:52,480
just like more opportunities like limited that this gave you like a theater.

351
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:58,479
If this comedy doesn't support you, then absolutely I don't recommend you apply for that.

352
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,440
But if that's a big company, like if you really like a tattoo, a company,

353
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:07,960
I think surely that internship, even if you don't, won't have like a return offer.

354
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:15,040
But that would be really good experience. And with that big title, you will be like a little easier to apply for a job.

355
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,050
So if you're like comedy, you want to apply for internship.

356
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:22,750
It's like a big title company even they don't have like a sponsorship.

357
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:27,879
I, I suggest maybe you could apply, but it's like it's not a big title.

358
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:35,590
Companies, just maybe some startups you need to like ask the recruiter whether you have like sponsorship, whether there is opportunity.

359
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,890
I can have like a return and then you can sponsor me.

360
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:43,360
And I also have that is suggestions is maybe you can look into like the companies

361
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:48,429
apps that you will see some companies they have like the name of their employers.

362
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:53,240
Maybe you can see whether there are so many international people and that's it's really some

363
00:37:53,380 --> 00:38:01,720
good and indicator of whether the offer sponsorship so yeah and I also want to add on like if

364
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:08,350
you really like if they don't say like this sponsor I think if you want to is should email to

365
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:14,530
that recruiter you could just ask more direct like do you take like the international student.

366
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:23,800
I think they were also else like wearing it directly that if they take or they would consider I think they do like to answer it.

367
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:28,690
So I think you can just asking directly for the job description.

368
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:36,010
Sometimes they don't want to say it out of our directly that we just don't want international student handles.

369
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:50,029
There are other questions. Okay.

370
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:54,380
So then if there are no more questions, I'll ask each one.

371
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,970
Each one of you up here.

372
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:05,670
What's your best piece of advice for those sitting in the audience for either finding an internship or on the interview or during the internship?

373
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:09,800
What anything having to do with an internship? What's your best piece of advice?

374
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:16,130
Isabelle Sargeant I would say just create opportunities for yourself.

375
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:23,240
I think I applied to who knows how many internships before I actually got the acceptance in this one.

376
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:30,770
So don't close doors for yourself. Like just apply to everything they think you're interested in, even if you don't fit the description.

377
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:35,540
Like it's fine. Like you are more than capable of learning how to do those things.

378
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,010
So I'll just apply.

379
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:43,700
And once you're in there, like, if you don't like what you're doing, just be very vocal about it and keep your ears open for opportunities.

380
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,060
It's great. Rachel, how about your advice? Yeah, my advice would be to take advantage of the career center.

381
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:57,080
What? It sounds like you're going to talk about that in the future, but they have people there who will review your application materials,

382
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:01,250
like your cover letter, your CV, and give you feedback on how to improve it.

383
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,300
And I personally thought that was really, really helpful during the application process.

384
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:11,170
It's great like to give a suggestion, maybe not only for finding an internship.

385
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:17,350
It's for like maybe the the curb pass. I think I need to spend time,

386
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:27,740
take time to think what's really interesting and what's something that we have passion on instead of just following most of people's choice.

387
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:41,210
Because I think we need to take one advantage off our own case because I think people have a different advantage and people are different.

388
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:47,300
Someone, they are really smart and they are very good at researching or doing different research.

389
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:52,820
Some others like they are really good at communicating. They like to be the bridge of people.

390
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:58,660
So whereas a neutral spouse, sometimes a single mother, we are really good at.

391
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:08,120
For my sister and for my example, I think after this internship I just want I, I can do coding, I can do data analysis,

392
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:13,759
but I don't want to spend 100% of the time I can sit sitting in front of my laptop

393
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,740
doing the coalition and I say some work I want to do more like communication,

394
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:22,960
like more teamwork, and also I want to expand my horizon.

395
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:29,510
I think that's very important for me. So I want to go into a consulting firm which I could be exposed to a different case.

396
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:40,309
So because I think I'm not very smart, but I love communicating or I'm not that type of person,

397
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:47,560
but I love to know that you here before so that there are different skills, right?

398
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:51,880
You're smart. You can be smart in different ways. Yeah. So I said, yeah.

399
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:59,380
So I think we need to just go to our web browser and do it and we have that.

400
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,740
That's my research aspect. Yeah, that's great.

401
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:11,360
Besides the laptop. Yeah. And also I think the funding worry in the way that interests you.

402
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:17,690
It doesn't mean it's very simple or easy, but I think if you have passion for that,

403
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:26,780
that it could help you to see that that a pass when you meet the difficult, you could just stick your head down and overcome that.

404
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:34,640
But if you don't have the interest of it, once you are chosen for it, if you made it, the difficulty is that you would just run away.

405
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,690
So I think that's that's why we really try to find our own passion.

406
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,800
Yeah, it's great. Cathy, how about for you? What's your advice? I have a few pieces of advice.

407
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:50,450
I actually found my internship or I got my internship late May right before I started in June.

408
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:55,459
So don't lose hope if you don't after everything.

409
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:00,020
And I actually had a lot of interviews, but I had a bad time.

410
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:04,489
So always be prepared. Have your material ready. I like to have a coding sample.

411
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:10,010
So my internship that I had and you have like have a clean coding sample that

412
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,710
doesn't like conflict with any of the rules that we have for our classes like you,

413
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:18,290
some things that you're not allowed to share, but like have that, have everything prepared.

414
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:25,999
Because I had interviews when I had COVID on vacation and just be prepared and don't lose hope.

415
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,440
And then my last piece of ice, what you're thinking about two different internships.

416
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,590
That's what I had to go through when I was got my internships.

417
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,600
Try to pick the one where you like your boss. The boss.

418
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:40,189
I had to choose between two good internships.

419
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:48,250
And what ended up happening was I chose the one where I felt a bigger connection to the manager and you can kind of tell during the interview process.

420
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:54,870
So definitely. Ask them about their mentoring style and what expectations they have for the interns because that definitely

421
00:43:55,230 --> 00:44:01,920
somebody out for success because me my manager but really well I think you kind of today as well.

422
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:10,800
Yeah but I really like the suggestion about be brave because like in the job description when you like really search values,

423
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,770
they are like at least two years like experience impact on at least two year experience in school.

424
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:24,280
At least two you're like over and like so many they have so many on premise and they also said maybe like for like

425
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:30,690
also like some has a knowledge about like the natural language processing even the title like Bali formatting.

426
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:38,900
So I know some people like some H.R., they don't really write that the job description really well because the,

427
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:43,110
the you like from the job description you were saying maybe no I'm not qualified,

428
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:49,259
I don't know anything about like natural language processing, I don't know anything about that machine learning model.

429
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,390
And it's like it's like it's not that hard.

430
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,270
They don't expect that much from you.

431
00:44:54,570 --> 00:45:02,100
But the reason they actually hearing from like first year master's student also Annegret, they don't expect you to be master in everything.

432
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:06,570
Just be brave. But they just want to like, are you a fast learner?

433
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:14,880
So you just, if you believe yourself, really interesting that you will be like really passionate about learning that you will be obsessive learner.

434
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:23,730
So just don't be shy. Like in my, like in my interview, I really got some question I don't think is really answered that well,

435
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:30,870
but then I just show my passion that really like it's not like that, yes or no question.

436
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:36,870
But I'm really passionate about learning that. So I, I think maybe that's the passion.

437
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:41,249
I, it's really like how we got the job of gather internships.

438
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,430
So yeah, this is just, just be brave, reach out,

439
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:50,759
apply and then if you have the interview that mean you're qualified, just be brave to have the first round goes.

440
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,820
Don't be like nervous. Like I'm not prepared.

441
00:45:54,630 --> 00:46:01,770
We have a just great job description like that. You want I got the interview either so don't be afraid the already are like see trust me.

442
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:05,250
And they gave you the chance that you are qualified. So. Yeah.

443
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:11,040
Thank you. All right. Well, if there are no further questions, then we will wrap this up.

444
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:17,460

445
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:23,999
And as I said, the next few weeks will continue to build upon this in terms of career services coming and

446
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,870
talking about your resume and how to search for jobs and then interview skills and all that.

447
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:33,240
Check out the syllabus, but we will help you in this journey.

448
