1
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,590
In today's session of HPP600, the health services system.

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:14,240
We will be talking about National Health Expenditures in the US.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,820
So our objective for this session is to describe

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,284
the levels of health expenditures in the US and

5
00:00:23,284 --> 00:00:28,091
the patterns in those levels over time in the US and

6
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:33,145
really to define terms related to health spending.

7
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:39,567
So we have a clear understanding.

8
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:43,651
In 2018, the most recent data,

9
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:50,897
we have the US spent a total of $3.6 trillion on health care and

10
00:00:50,897 --> 00:00:56,070
health spending in the year 2018.

11
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,349
That is averages to about $11,000

12
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:06,130
per person in the United States.

13
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:13,770
And it comes to 17.7% of our gross domestic product.

14
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:21,830
Gross domestic product is a measure of the overall productivity of the US economy.

15
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,912
And so we are spending 17.7%

16
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:34,370
of that total economic activity on health care.

17
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:42,100
And this graph just shows that percentage of GDP on health expenditures over time.

18
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:48,250
And so you can see that our spending on total national health

19
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:54,031
expenditures has been steadily increasing over time.

20
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,910
So just what do we mean here?

21
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:04,398
You will hear the terms expenditures and spending expenditures

22
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:09,190
meaning how much is spent, spending how much is spent.

23
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:15,390
And so those two terms are interchangeable spending and expenditures.

24
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,657
Health care expenditures is a measure of all that spending,

25
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:26,133
all of those expenditures for health care goods and services,

26
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:31,300
public health activities, government administration,

27
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,313
the net cost of health insurance.

28
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:38,970
And investments related to health care.

29
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:45,689
Now let's just take a second to define the net cost of health insurance.

30
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:52,526
What that means is it includes not only all the premiums paid for

31
00:02:52,526 --> 00:02:57,170
health insurance as well as the amount paid

32
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,303
out in benefits for health services.

33
00:03:01,303 --> 00:03:07,779
Plus any insurers costs related to the administration of a health plan,

34
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:12,778
the advertising, the billing, any kind of sales etc.

35
00:03:12,778 --> 00:03:18,122
Related to the administration of a health insurance

36
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:24,803
plan is part of what is meant by this net cost of health insurance,

37
00:03:24,803 --> 00:03:29,539
which is one of the factors that contributes to

38
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:33,810
this overall health care expenditures.

39
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,352
And when we talk about health care expenditures,

40
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:38,970
you might be talking about various measurements.

41
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,238
So we can talk about annual health care expenditures,

42
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:46,510
annual total health care expenditures.

43
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:52,720
The average health care expenditures per capita in a country for

44
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,020
example we can talk about those as a percentage of GDP.

45
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:03,343
And we can use these to compare not only the same country over time,

46
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:08,480
but we can use this to compare countries to each other.

47
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,940
Something important to keep in mind that healthcare expenditures or

48
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:20,269
health care spending is not the same as healthcare costs or health care prices.

49
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:27,281
So in another session we'll be talking about pricing and costs of health care,

50
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:33,578
but today we're talking about health care spending or expenditures.

51
00:04:33,578 --> 00:04:36,681
So just go to go back health care expenditures.

52
00:04:36,681 --> 00:04:41,006
This is our total annual Health care

53
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:46,790
expenditures in 2018 of 3.6 trillion.

54
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:55,810
That comes to an average of about just over $11,000 per person or per capita.

55
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,775
And a percentage of the GDP, the percentage of all of this

56
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:05,747
spending as a percentage of our gross domestic product.

57
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:14,081
Okay so when we talk about all of that spending that $3.6 trillion.

58
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,430
What are we spending it on?

59
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:24,424
So these are the categories of spending that we spend our healthcare dollars on.

60
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:29,237
So about a third of all of that, all of those dollars.

61
00:05:29,237 --> 00:05:34,070
I should just recognize that this is 2017.

62
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:38,220
The data I just showed you previously overall was for 2018.

63
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:44,330
But these categories and percentages are very similar in 2018 to 2017.

64
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:52,590
So this was just an easy way to to see what we spend those healthcare dollars on.

65
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,680
So about a third of all healthcare expenditures are for

66
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,370
hospital care, 20% for physician and other clinical services.

67
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,100
These are not surprising that's what we think of as health care.

68
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,506
Another 10% of all of those

69
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:17,833
$3.6 trillion 4%

70
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:22,390
are on dental services.

71
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:27,571
We have about 5% are on nursing care facilities and

72
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:33,270
those related to ongoing care in elder communities.

73
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,255
But here you can see that about 8% of this,

74
00:06:37,255 --> 00:06:42,534
of our total expenditures are spent on the administration

75
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:47,931
of government health plans and private health insurance.

76
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,993
And in addition this includes about 5% of dollars that

77
00:06:53,993 --> 00:07:00,630
are invested toward health insurance and healthcare resources.

78
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:08,873
This big category of 14% of other health care expenditures is for

79
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:14,224
medical equipment, for home health care,

80
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:19,600
for personal and residential healthcare.

81
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,963
Which as you can see down here, residential care facilities,

82
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:32,080
home health care expenditures that are delivered in particular places.

83
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,436
And then I think interestingly given our experience

84
00:07:38,436 --> 00:07:44,793
in 2020 is public health activities account for

85
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:53,040
about 3% of overall total national health expenditures n the US.

86
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,998
Another way we can think about that total spending is to think

87
00:07:57,998 --> 00:08:01,130
about where those dollars come from.

88
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,850
The source of that expenditure.

89
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,460
Again, this is a summary from 2017.

90
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,980
But the data and these percentages for 2018 look very similar.

91
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:20,730
So a big chunk of all health care expenditures come from health insurance.

92
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,972
So the source for that spending is health insurance,

93
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:30,441
private health insurance, public health insurance, Medicare and

94
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:35,731
Medicaid services at the federal and at the state and local level.

95
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,022
And then we also have other health insurance plans,

96
00:08:40,022 --> 00:08:44,098
the chip plan that we've talked a little bit about the children's

97
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:47,850
health insurance plan, but then this also includes the VA.

98
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,181
And the health insurance for the Department of Defense.

99
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:01,493
So 75% of all health care expenditures come from a health insurance source.

100
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:06,698
Other sources of health expenditures include 10%

101
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:11,438
out of pocket, which means from individuals and

102
00:09:11,438 --> 00:09:16,180
individual households related to co payments,

103
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,920
deductibles, etc out of pocket spending.

104
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,990
Then we also see here again, those public health government,

105
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:32,796
public health activities, fund are the source of 3% of our health expenditures.

106
00:09:32,796 --> 00:09:38,168
We have some other third party payers that are not lumped into this

107
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:43,451
health insurance because they operate somewhat differently.

108
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:48,363
So we have things like the Indian health service workers

109
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:53,277
compensation, some work site healthcare delivery and

110
00:09:53,277 --> 00:09:57,668
some other sources here in footnote 1 account for

111
00:09:57,668 --> 00:10:01,764
these other third party payers and programs.

112
00:10:01,764 --> 00:10:05,994
So these are the sources of those national health expenditure funds.

113
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:14,021
If we look at total national health expenditures

114
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:19,562
here as an average per capita, per person over time,

115
00:10:19,562 --> 00:10:27,076
we can see how much national health expenditures have gone up over time,

116
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:31,670
have been steadily increasing over time.

117
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,271
These lines are essentially both the same.

118
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:39,614
The blue line is holding constant to

119
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:44,682
compare in the same pricing level overall

120
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:49,630
purchasing power of a 2018 dollar.

121
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:55,322
So the blue line means that in 1970 average per capita

122
00:10:55,322 --> 00:11:01,975
national health expenditure was about $2,000 per capita.

123
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:09,353
And today it is up, as we said, about just over $11,000 per capita.

124
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:18,337
We can also think about looking at national health expenditures here again,

125
00:11:18,337 --> 00:11:22,935
per capita, but projecting forward to think about where

126
00:11:22,935 --> 00:11:27,464
national health expenditures are going in the future.

127
00:11:27,464 --> 00:11:29,822
So, we just looked at the past and

128
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:35,660
saw that health expenditures have been rising steadily over the past 50 years.

129
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:43,053
And we can see that projections from 2018 on show a continuing rise or

130
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:49,015
in increase in national health expenditures per capita.

131
00:11:49,015 --> 00:11:54,029
So, the blue line is the actual projection

132
00:11:54,029 --> 00:12:00,017
of what we expect to see, which means by 2027,

133
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:05,173
we might see per capita health expenditures

134
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:09,651
close to $17,000 per capita.

135
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:16,231
The dotted lines above and below show the difference

136
00:12:16,231 --> 00:12:23,348
that a 1% point change could make in overall health expenditures.

137
00:12:23,348 --> 00:12:28,846
So, an increase of just 1% point In national health

138
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:34,101
expenditures starting in about 2020 would see

139
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:39,487
us get to over 18,000 per capita by 2027.

140
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:46,880
But similarly, by reducing health expenditures by just 1% point,

141
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,391
we have the potential to hold down that rise in health

142
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:57,800
expenditures to under 16,000 by 2027.

143
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,186
So, slight changes can make a pretty big difference.

144
00:13:04,812 --> 00:13:09,631
And I'll just end with this slide to remind you and

145
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:14,337
all of us that while our health expenditures have

146
00:13:14,337 --> 00:13:18,381
been going up rapidly in the US over time.

147
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:23,358
We it's also important to remember how our national

148
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:28,109
health expenditures here shown as a percent of GDP

149
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:33,110
over time compared to other countries in the world.

150
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:38,840
So, these are compared to other industrialized countries in the world.

151
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,700
And on average, you can see those countries have had an increase

152
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,480
in their health expenditures as a percent of GDP over time.

153
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,884
However, health expenditures in the US

154
00:13:52,884 --> 00:13:57,932
are rising are not only higher at every point,

155
00:13:57,932 --> 00:14:03,241
they are rising faster than in other countries,

156
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:08,179
up to the most recent estimates in 2018.

157
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:12,450
So in another session, we'll talk more about these country comparisons.
