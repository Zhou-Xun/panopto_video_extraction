1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,942
Now, what I'm gonna talk to you about today is one particular portion of this,

2
00:00:04,942 --> 00:00:07,481
and it's called the Door to Balloon Time.

3
00:00:07,481 --> 00:00:12,101
And what I mean by door and balloon, is the door is that moment in which a patient

4
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:14,420
arrives in New York Hospital, right?

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,277
There's all that other stuff that happens before, but

6
00:00:17,277 --> 00:00:19,232
the door is when that person arrives.

7
00:00:19,232 --> 00:00:23,292
And then the balloon is that balloon that I showed you, that goes up in the middle

8
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:26,590
of that vessel, breaks up that blockage to the liver and stent.

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,381
And what it all started with is this goal of well, if somebody comes in with a heart

10
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:36,120
attack, let's try to get that treatment period squished as much as possible.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,278
And there's a whole variety of reasons based on kind of clinical ethic studies

12
00:00:40,278 --> 00:00:44,247
that were done, where the thought was, if we do this in less than an hour and

13
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:48,594
a half, we have the greatest potential to kind of optimise myocardial salvage and

14
00:00:48,594 --> 00:00:50,061
improve patient.

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,610
All right, so that's the background.

16
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,236
And so the first storey I'm gonna tell you today is the storey that

17
00:00:57,236 --> 00:00:59,837
is actually a really important one in again,

18
00:00:59,837 --> 00:01:03,010
this small area that I've been really involved with.

19
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,378
And it's a storey that starts in Boston, and

20
00:01:05,378 --> 00:01:07,628
it involves a woman named Cynthia Kline.

21
00:01:07,628 --> 00:01:10,182
Now, Cynthia Kline was a woman who was in her fifties and

22
00:01:10,182 --> 00:01:12,151
she actually had an elective stent put in.

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,484
And so, she goes home and a few days later,

24
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:20,930
she starts to have this crushing chest pain, really feeling awful.

25
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:26,240
She knows something bad has happened, so she calls 911, the ambulance arrives.

26
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,380
So, the ambulance gets there, they see her, she looks critically ill.

27
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,009
They put her in the ambulance and they start taking her.

28
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,980
And at the time in Boston, you had to go to the nearest hospital,

29
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,740
that hospital was Cambridge Hospital.

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,572
So, this is around the fall of 2002.

31
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:44,337
So, she goes to Cambridge Hospital, right?

32
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:48,712
And when she's there, as she's going right through the door, the doctors and

33
00:01:48,712 --> 00:01:51,652
nurses there immediately recognise what she needs,

34
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:55,940
she has a blockage in that stent and she needs to go to the cath lab.

35
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,788
And the problem is that Cambridge hospital, they don't have cath lab.

36
00:01:59,788 --> 00:02:01,089
So, they get on the phone and

37
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:03,487
start calling every place that they could imagine.

38
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:07,301
Now remember, she's at Cambridge Hospital which is in Boston, which is really in

39
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:11,021
the shadow of some of the world's greatest healthcare organisations, right?

40
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:14,748
And we're talking about the Mass General which is just a few miles away,

41
00:02:14,748 --> 00:02:18,794
the Brigham and Women's Hospital, and there's lots of potential sources.

42
00:02:18,794 --> 00:02:20,912
The problem is that at that point in time,

43
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:23,521
none of those hospitals were accepting patients.

44
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:26,601
And so, over the course of the next hour well, again, nurses and

45
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:29,401
physicians are frantically trying to get her out of there,

46
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:32,661
she slowly decompensates and then ends up dying about an hour later.

47
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,660
So, this happens, it's an awful storey.

48
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,905
It's actually chronicled by Jonathan Cohn in this really amazing book, Sick.

49
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:44,705
Jonathan actually is in actually at this point,

50
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:48,320
a senior editor with the Washington Post.

51
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,761
And, the storey is really amazing, it's actually in the front of this book.

52
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,281
And if you had told me this storey, right?

53
00:02:56,281 --> 00:03:00,137
I mean, actually in 2003, I was a fellow in interventional cardiology here at

54
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:03,843
the University of Michigan, I would have been, wow, that's an awful storey.

55
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:05,430
But you know what?

56
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,357
Stuff happens, right?

57
00:03:06,357 --> 00:03:09,829
Stuff happens when you show up at three o'clock in the morning versus three

58
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:12,858
o'clock in the afternoon, and it really is kind of in the stars,

59
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:14,361
it's not our responsibility.

60
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,231
But if there's one thing I can really tell you to really remember about this lecture

61
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:22,751
when you've forgotten everything else about it, it is that at least for me,

62
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:24,503
this was a transformational moment.

63
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:27,704
Because the whole storey about this is really special,

64
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:32,575
because it comes down to this, the famous William Shakespeare quote, the fault,

65
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:35,862
dear Brutus, lies not in our stars, but in ourselves.

66
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:39,442
Because for a long time, the interventional cardiology community,

67
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:43,689
the cardiology community, even the emergency department community was always,

68
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:44,492
you know what?

69
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:49,085
If they show up, then I will do the best I can, but how that patient gets to me,

70
00:03:49,085 --> 00:03:51,985
how that patient arrives at my cath lab table, so

71
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:56,570
that I can put these wires up and open up these arteries, that's beyond me.

72
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,425
And this kind of moment in which people actually started to say, no,

73
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:01,900
that's not acceptable.

74
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,504
That there's gotta be a better way,

75
00:04:04,504 --> 00:04:09,124
was really a special thing that happened, and how this all kind of

76
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:13,770
played out was was really fascinating after Cynthia Kline died.

77
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,934
This actual storey was actually picked up by a few Boston globe reporters in

78
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:22,031
a series that they were doing about the kind of broken nature the US health

79
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:23,340
care system.

80
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,299
And what happened was the storey caught a lot of press and

81
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,641
a lot of attention, ultimately made it up to the State House,

82
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:32,940
who started to put pressure on the community itself.

83
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,290
And one of the most remarkable things is within a few months,

84
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,217
Peter Moyer who was an Emergency Medicine Physician,

85
00:04:41,217 --> 00:04:47,550
director of the Boston EMS Services got probably and was, impossible task, right?

86
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,551
I mean, he actually got all the Harvard hospitals to cooperate with each other and

87
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:56,695
figure out, okay, how are we gonna do this along with Tufts and DU?

88
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:57,820
To say that you know what?

89
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,721
If a patient with a heart attack is having that kind of symptom,

90
00:05:00,721 --> 00:05:03,894
they would just go to the next hospital, they go to the best places for

91
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:06,540
them where they can receive definitive care.

92
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,986
What happened in Boston around that time isn't something that's special and

93
00:05:11,986 --> 00:05:13,561
unique to that place.

94
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:17,261
It was actually happening all across the country in lots of different pockets.

95
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,298
Even here, we were starting to think about the same kinds of things and I can tell

96
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:26,373
you that one of the running jokes we used to have was that, there's a hospital here

97
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:30,800
that we would always say it's 30 minutes by car and three hours by ambulance.

98
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,325
I mean, it was as soon as you got that page, you were like, all right, I'm gonna

99
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:40,011
still have dinner, go work out and then I'll show up at the hospital and probably.

100
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:43,498
And so, I think that what's really fascinating about this is,

101
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:45,831
all of this was happening at the same time.

102
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:48,240
It was really driven by data.

103
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,760
It's interesting because the anecdote of Cynthia Kline was powerful.

104
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,014
Like I said, there were other anecdotes around that were happening, but

105
00:05:56,014 --> 00:05:57,491
the data were also really clear.

106
00:05:57,491 --> 00:06:03,141
This is just a study that was published in the mid 2000s.

107
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:07,960
It used some of the first hospital based data on process measures that were

108
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,190
happening across hospitals.

109
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,978
You can see that in this slide, they're showing some of the measures

110
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:18,108
around to keep myocardial infarction or heart attack care and pneumonia.

111
00:06:18,108 --> 00:06:21,680
And what I have kind of circled up there is the mean time to PCI, so

112
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,140
this is that Door to Balloon Time.

113
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,557
You arrive at the hospital, you get that balloon inflation at the end, and

114
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:30,675
over there it's minutes, right?

115
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:36,070
420 minutes was the average time in the third quarter of 2002,

116
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,376
and that slightly improved up to about 300, right?

117
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:44,202
So it was like five hours that it would take on average.

118
00:06:44,202 --> 00:06:48,020
And a lot of this was driven by extreme outliers because patients would sit there,

119
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,140
they would be having symptoms consistent with the heart Attack.

120
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,494
No one would really triage them or find them appropriate for definitive therapies,

121
00:06:55,494 --> 00:06:59,260
and then there would be all sorts of delays throughout the whole system.

122
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,050
So this was kind of the motivation, this was a big problem, everyone knew it.

123
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,551
And and as I mentioned, people were thinking hard about this issue.
