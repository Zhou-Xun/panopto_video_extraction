1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:07,590
Reporting. Waterslides. We're good to go.

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,260
Hello, everyone. Today we have a guest lecturer, Dr. P.T. PEREIRA.

3
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:23,100
Dr. PEREIRA is a research assistant professor of environmental health sciences in the

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,720
School of Public Health in the Department of the Department of Environmental Sciences.

5
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,820
So her primary research interests are in the field of environmental epigenetics.

6
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,650
We've talked a little bit about the genetics.

7
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:44,639
So she seeks to identify epigenetic changes that result from environmental exposures at critical times of life into these phenomenon,

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,430
to broader implications in human health and disease,

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,620
which fits in pretty well with what she's going to talk about today, which is developmental toxicology.

10
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,580
She is particularly interested in studying something called p p interacting RNA, right?

11
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,260
Kiwi RNA, which is a class of non-coding RNA.

12
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:10,720
So like really interesting ways that gene expression is regulated in various parts of the body.

13
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:20,520
So pretty cool stuff. And she aims to identify molecular mechanisms associated with toxicant exposures that contribute to impacts on human health.

14
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,630
So, yeah, join me in welcoming Dr. PEREIRA.

15
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,510
Thank you so much for being here. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for having me here.

16
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:39,599
Besides all the things that Dr. Harris mentioned, I did my Ph.D. on a concept called genomic imprinting,

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,250
which is closely related to developmental biology and developmental toxicology.

18
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,430
And the project that I'm currently working on is a developmental in utero project.

19
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,490
That means it's during embryogenesis, during pregnancy.

20
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,420
So it kind of goes hand-in-hand with your lecture today.

21
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,020
And I have some I got some exciting data yesterday.

22
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,380
So I have at the end, if we have time,

23
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,930
I'll go through the project that's ongoing so they can have an idea of what we really do in the lab and

24
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:15,450
what kind of data we see and how that that can inform some of the things that you're learning today.

25
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:23,640
If you have any questions, feel free to raise your hand and ask and and that will not offend me.

26
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:32,280
So I try to keep the lectures that I do very informal that that answers the questions that you have.

27
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,540
So even if I can't go through the entire slides, it's that that's fine.

28
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,670
I would rather you understand that concept rather than running through the material just to cover something.

29
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:49,800
Okay, everybody's good. So this is an overview of what the concepts I will be covering today.

30
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:59,850
We'll start off with growth and development. We'll revisit some of the bio, some of the biology of management way back when,

31
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,610
and then jump right into developmental toxicology stages of development.

32
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,200
So going through the biology of how a mammal will develop.

33
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,040
And we'll go through some classic examples of human trauma attitudes.

34
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,820
So how chemical exposures can impact human health.

35
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,870
And and couple of slides on DOE head are you familiar with still have the developmental

36
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,040
origins of health and disease but we'll cover boy talked about it a little bit.

37
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:41,999
Okay. Well, we'll go through it a little bit. Two slides and then the case study is what I am working on now, which is lead exposure.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,410
And if we can't get to it, that's fine. I have my contact information.

39
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:52,620
You can always email me or come meet me in my office and I can go through the slides with you.

40
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:59,860
Any questions? Okay. So going right into growth and development.

41
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:12,310
Human development is very complex. You start off with an egg that is fertilized with the sperm and then it gives rise to an entire human being.

42
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,820
It's very complex, but amazing. We are here today because of growth and development.

43
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:30,710
Right. But how does this happen? Adults have about 37 trillion cells in their body and hundreds of different cell types.

44
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,060
So there are different cells in there in our body that can do different functions.

45
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,870
And if any one of these cells in any one of these functions are messed up,

46
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:47,320
that can cause functional outcomes or physical outcomes that you see here today where we are.

47
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,910
I hope all of us are healthy adults, but if this is messed up, we might not be healthy adults.

48
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,490
Any questions? But all of this happens with what's called a stem cell.

49
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:15,070
Does anybody know what a stem cell is? It's just like an undifferentiated cell that can be so many different cell and undifferentiated.

50
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:28,030
Right. What does undifferentiated mean?

51
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:45,920
What is differentiated? But does Thomas differentiate you?

52
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:53,690
Because from that is where the other cells get all the different stations from everything.

53
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:02,550
Yeah. So that means it doesn't the undifferentiated cell or a stem cell doesn't have a final.

54
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,950
Oh, this is my job. This is what I'm going to do. Let's say a hard sell knows how to pump, right?

55
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:13,480
It has to. The muscles are the differentiated cell type.

56
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,530
That's the cell. By definition, what? What end? And then it knows what to do.

57
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:24,230
It needs to kind of pulse for your heart to pump blood throughout your body.

58
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:35,300
But an undifferentiated cell doesn't know its job, but it knows that it needs to make some differentiated cells, heart cells, for example, later on.

59
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:44,540
So it's kind of like the it's kind of poised there to make an army of muscle cells or neuron cells.

60
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,360
So an undifferentiated cell or a stem cell is kind of there to make more of it so that you can have

61
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:58,040
more cells to make a certain cell type that will make a tissue that will make an organ to do its job.

62
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:11,030
Does that make sense? Okay, good. So a super cell can replicate itself and that process is called self-renewal.

63
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:20,560
What does self-renewal mean? Anybody you can guess.

64
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,030
You don't have to be right. That's why you're here. Any guesses?

65
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,940
You have a hand here. It replicates itself. What can it make more of?

66
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:51,610
It is that cell replicates itself because they need to feed another cells for another organ to still growing out,

67
00:07:51,950 --> 00:08:01,160
for example, or regenerate another organ that they are going to have the differentiated cells once.

68
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,970
Close. Close. So the word is self-renewal.

69
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:21,160
Self-Renewal is when a cell makes more of itself replication, it makes more it duplicates itself, replicates itself.

70
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,780
So a self-renewing stem cell.

71
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,850
Is another stem cell. It's undifferentiated. Okay.

72
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:39,370
So stem cells can make more of themselves so that it can make more of these other cells that it can make.

73
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,650
They're called progenitors, which you don't really have to go too much into detail about.

74
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,260
But it needs to replicate,

75
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:57,550
make more of other stem cells so that those stem cells can go and propagate either different cell types or differentiated cell types.

76
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:04,510
Got it. Two concepts can make itself and it make more of others that can do work for them.

77
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:14,610
So there's another concept when we talk about stem cells that call that's called potency.

78
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,370
When we talk about differentiation, potency, when you define potency, it's a number of possible fates that a cell can acquire.

79
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:31,760
We've heard. I think you might be familiar with what's called toad important pluripotent stem.

80
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:42,240
So the word is potent. The number of cell types or different states that it can give rise to.

81
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:57,090
So a tiny, potent cell can give can give rise to any type of cell versus a pluripotent cell type can give rise to an embryonic lineage.

82
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:10,290
Cell types, cellular properties, potency can decrease as you grow old, and it can also decrease its differentiation or specialization.

83
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,980
So a word that's kind of used interchangeably throughout these slides is special specialization,

84
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:23,520
which also means like a differentiated cell type, a cell that already has its fate already set.

85
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,130
Any question so far about differentiation, stem cells?

86
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:36,690
So here's an example of what I called potency.

87
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,170
So you have a tawny potent embryonic stem cell.

88
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:48,460
It is capable of dividing and developing into developing to form a complete and mature organism.

89
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:55,800
So it can be any type of cell. And then you have pluripotent embryonic stem cell.

90
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,910
That's kind of one step differentiated version of a 2014 cell.

91
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:11,410
And they can give rise to what's called germ cells, germ layers, three germ layers that any organism would have.

92
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,410
So these are called endoderm line, mesoderm line and ectoderm line.

93
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,710
Have you heard these words before? Are you familiar with it?

94
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,830
What does this mean? Endoderm ectoderm and means again.

95
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,490
Well, I guess it's it doesn't matter which one, two and three.

96
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,240
Just remember that it's about entertainment news about.

97
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:10,230
So these are three different layers of our body that gives rise to all all of our organs and tissues.

98
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:20,490
So whenever an embryo goes through development, if it has these three germ layers, that gives rise to all of these tissues that we have today.

99
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:31,110
So, for example, the endoderm. Gives rise to ultimately your pancreas, liver.

100
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,490
So any type of tissue that has a lining.

101
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:42,660
So two different layers. They come from an endoderm lineage.

102
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:58,750
A means undermine is gives rise to tissues that muscles connective tissues so blood and bone all of that comes from you know, these are germline.

103
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:09,340
ECTODERM line is my interest, which is basically your central nervous system brain, spinal cord and also skin.

104
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:19,960
There are multiple. We obviously have more organs, but all of those organs come from one of these three cell lineages.

105
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,120
Does that make sense?

106
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:33,760
And we'll revisit the germ layers when we go through the biological developmental process of an embryo, which we have later on in the in the slides.

107
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,070
So we start with the 2014 cells. That isn't committed to anything.

108
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:47,970
It can become become any different cell type. These can become a pluripotent stem cell.

109
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,370
They can be these three different lineages capable of forming many different cell types.

110
00:13:54,030 --> 00:14:01,260
And those pluripotent stem cells can become these multipotent stem cells, which can give rise to any of these tissues.

111
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,300
So stem cells that are committed to give rise to differentiated cells.

112
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,850
So that cell fate is this. Any questions?

113
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,590
Okay. Maybe it's too early in the morning.

114
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,100
We talk a little bit about this in the mail reproductive section.

115
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:27,190
We talked about the sperm cells where there's the sperm stem cells that divide to

116
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:32,080
give rise to more of themselves or differentiate into the sperm matter sites.

117
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:42,310
And we talked about how if a toxicant impacts the stem cell population, it's going to cause I'm sorry, it could mess up like pretty much the entire B.

118
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,499
Yeah, it could. It can lead to sterility if it's if you're impacting the stem cell population,

119
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,660
whereas if you're exposed to a chemical, it's only impacting the differentiated sperm out of size.

120
00:14:53,080 --> 00:15:00,610
If you take away exposure to that chemical, you could build your your supply of sperm back up, so to speak, over a long enough time period.

121
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,920
So it's a real difference between what could be permanent damage versus damage that you can recover from.

122
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,690
And that goes into sort of the dynamics of the way these stem cells work throughout the body.

123
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:20,260
So the progenitor, as I kind of mentioned before, it's like these undifferentiated versions of these cell lines.

124
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:24,130
So it's kind of like they're like, let's say a brain progenitor cell.

125
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:33,400
It knows it has to make neurons, glial cells, different types of neuron cells, but it knows it's its fate is going to be a brain cell.

126
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,990
It cannot be a liver cell at any point. So it's a brain progenitor cells.

127
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:45,350
So we need to have a lot of brain progenitor cells so that we can have a lot of memories.

128
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:50,859
So the cells, then the fate is then then the cell goes for it's like it can be more specialized.

129
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:56,470
Is it responsible for long term memory, short term memory, blood circulation, even in the brain.

130
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:04,840
So it's kind of like they're poised there to make more of themselves as well as make more of the workhorses that do the work in the body.

131
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:13,080
So by definition, self determination or a cell fate.

132
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,670
It is determined to do what?

133
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:28,810
So here's a question How does a stem cell know how to become a specialized cell type, for example, a neuron instead of a blood cell or liver?

134
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,830
So it's a question for you to answer.

135
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:40,530
How do they know? Substitute like epigenetic markers and tags.

136
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:49,300
Epigenetic tags. What else?

137
00:16:51,940 --> 00:17:04,719
This is a question I have when I defended point thesis, I was sitting there, I was like, I went to the blank and I was like, Look, you're going down.

138
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,840
You're coming to. I graduated from LSU, coming to LSU.

139
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,309
You're sitting at something. What does that say?

140
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:18,910
And I'm like, What are you talking about? But they were trying to go like, get me to say was that I'm sitting at a traffic light.

141
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,900
What does that tell me to do? It signals me, right?

142
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,130
So signaling. So the cell gets a signal from somewhere.

143
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,670
I know they are seeing the sentence singled out, but.

144
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,000
Typos. Figure it out. Cell signaling.

145
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:48,330
There's a signal that comes out of the cell that tells it, hey, make more of yourself or hey, go ahead and differentiate.

146
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,630
Oh, hey, stay as you are. Don't differentiate. We won't. We want more of stem cells.

147
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:58,650
Anything else? That's my answer. I need to start to sort of make an additional point.

148
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,080
So this is like think about the hormone signaling we talked about back and repro

149
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,970
of the testosterone and estrogen signaling that plays an important role here.

150
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:16,910
Anything else? Anything about Danny?

151
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:24,330
Yeah, go ahead. Well, you know, when when a fetus is developing, where is the signal coming through?

152
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,300
Is receiving a signal to check to become a specialized?

153
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,750
So I'm asking questions from the sediments.

154
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,259
Oh, yes. So we talked about epigenetic tags.

155
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:44,150
That's one way. And there's another way that you can see as I'm kind of get you to answer weak.

156
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,329
But you have. Who knows?

157
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,950
Central dogma of molecular biology. Where is all of our information stored?

158
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,820
In a cell. I'm getting to your answer, Danny.

159
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:09,820
We're getting somewhere. We thought we'd be in there. Then what? Is that information enough?

160
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,700
What does DNA do? What's the second layer?

161
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,660
How does that information get to what we want?

162
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,440
We talk about this this coming year a lot.

163
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,430
What are injections? Rate of irony?

164
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,950
There you go. Why is irony important?

165
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,880
What do they do? What do they make? Proteins.

166
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:49,970
Proteins. These words central dogma of molecular biology is here, DNA to RNA to protein.

167
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:55,370
So to answer your question. What are genes?

168
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:04,820
We've heard about gene expression, right? Gene expression is another way for an embryo to know what to me, embryo to know what to do.

169
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:09,440
So what's important? Irony encodes for genes.

170
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:20,970
Genes can make protein. So if any of that is disruptive, you can have some complex problems in development problems when you're born.

171
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:31,590
So keep this in mind, because this is a main reason the concept for all of what we're learning in toxicology, biology, all of it.

172
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:39,370
So the answer I kind of told you the answers.

173
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:56,640
Gene expression, and I did not know the answer on the slide because I wanted you to pay attention to.

174
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:06,820
So a stem cell that is undifferentiated and specialized can become a differentiated neuron.

175
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:20,230
So I can, after this is determined, it can undergo differentiation to become a specialized cell type that can happen through epigenetic regulation,

176
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:26,570
cell signaling from hormones or environmental stimuli.

177
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,010
So that's why it's important for toxicology,

178
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:41,260
because those signals can be disrupted or an exposure can turn a gene on that should be turned off at that specific stage or vice versa.

179
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,790
So gene expression is in question. Yes.

180
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,510
First, signaling doesn't work directly like other receptors that can change the fate of a stem cell.

181
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:57,430
Or does signals change like the epigenetics or the gene expression?

182
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:05,379
Good question. Complex question. So like anything in biology, there are always exceptions.

183
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:15,520
So I can't give you a direct yes or no answer. So when you talk about epigenetic tags, epigenetic tags themselves can serve as signals.

184
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,180
What is epigenetics? You've learned epigenetics.

185
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:27,300
What is epigenetics? Come on, now.

186
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:33,450
It's not that early. I'm going to stand here until someone spits something out.

187
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,720
Yes, go ahead. Reversible changes to DNA structure.

188
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:44,820
Yes, reversible changes with DNA structures. But I'll also tell you a way to remember it in an easy way.

189
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,390
It be genetic, literally means it's a Greek word.

190
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,150
EPI means on top of on top of your genetics, on top of your DNA.

191
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:58,650
So these are signals or modifications that's on the DNA.

192
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:06,729
That does not change the DNA. So there if an environmental influence happens, it doesn't necessarily change your genetic code,

193
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:12,640
your age, Etsy, but it can change whether that age is going to be expressed or not.

194
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:20,140
So epigenetics is a way that gene expression can change without altering your DNA.

195
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,890
Does that make sense? So they literally sit on top of your DNA.

196
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:34,830
We're stopping other proteins to transcribe the genes, like stopping them from either binding to the DNA or by letting it bind to the DNA.

197
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,400
So we'll revisit that in a little bit, too.

198
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,760
But that's what epigenetics means. But it is reversible.

199
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:47,250
It can turn genes on or off based on environmental influences.

200
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:58,230
So epigenetic signaling those those are modifications on the DNA and change so that can serve as your signal.

201
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:10,210
And also, as Dr. Harris pointed out, hormones, because a lot of our regulate, like all the proteins that's in our body, is very tightly regulated.

202
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:19,190
Right. So you need a certain amount at a certain stage around that, what we call normal, right?

203
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,390
You don't want it to be too low. You don't want it to be too high.

204
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,970
So bodies are very sensitive.

205
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:34,460
So if there's anything that disrupts that, even hormones, there's a certain dosage that we need to make whatever it needs to make.

206
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:46,850
So if that dosage or signal is messed up, then that can cause alterations in your gene expression or, you know, cell differentiation, whatever.

207
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,550
But this are just the small point.

208
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:57,170
So I think I think all the examples that we've talked about this class so far have been examples like for the case of hormone signaling,

209
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:01,820
have the end result would be a change in gene expression.

210
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:08,509
Um, so if that's I think that was part of your question was what's the actual like,

211
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:13,910
is the signaling itself causing the change or is that leading to a change in gene expression?

212
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,890
There are probably examples where the signaling is causing some other different change.

213
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,320
Other than gene expression, I can't necessarily.

214
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:29,120
It could be protein and cell signal that that tells like, like you said, receptors that can make more of certain protein.

215
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,540
That protein is needed to make that gene. Right. Ultimately, it is gene expression.

216
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,830
Yeah. But you can have signaling that's like gene protein, protein, protein, Arnie's.

217
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,899
Yeah. There's all kinds of interactions that could happen.

218
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:47,389
But I think for the for the purposes of what we talked about so far, most of it, like where the rubber meets the road,

219
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:53,270
is an alteration in gene expression via one of those types of mechanisms that that makes sense.

220
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,130
There's no problem. This is what I like. I want you to ask questions.

221
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,200
So differentiation requires changes in gene expression there.

222
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,520
Your answers kind of. Protein.

223
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:20,230
Because gene expression leads to your protein expression, structure and function, protein structure and function of your organ or cell type.

224
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:24,990
Any questions so far? Okay.

225
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,240
I hope they're all following. Otherwise, you are all very confused.

226
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:39,380
So since we we kind of touched base on epigenetics, you might have seen this picture in a lot of talks.

227
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:44,060
This is Conrad Washington's epigenetic landscape.

228
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:50,900
It's also very important for it's an important concept for embryonic development.

229
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,110
Does anybody know what this is? Have you seen it before? If you have.

230
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:59,970
Just raise your hand. Two people have seen it before.

231
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,010
What does this. What does this mean? Do you remember?

232
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:11,129
Yeah. It's kind of like the ball can go down one path and then after that, there are kind of other options.

233
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,300
It kind of like branches out and kind of depicts like the soul as you were showing,

234
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,310
like can differentiate in one level and then it can differentiate further and further into more specialized cell types.

235
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,690
Great job. That is the answer. Yes.

236
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:31,980
So going with the examples that we had before, a pluripotent stem cell which can literally become any different cell type.

237
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:45,450
But in this landscape vertically, vertically where looking at a cell that is undifferentiated, becoming a differentiated cell as it comes down this.

238
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:53,300
Hill, I guess. Yes, but the mountain, the hill that has all of these valleys.

239
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:58,790
So it's kind of like water dripping down the valley, you know, because it can go through different parts.

240
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:03,830
Like you mentioned, it branches out. It can become any different face.

241
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,640
And then this pluripotent cell can become a multipotent cell.

242
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:19,040
You know, a germ cell, a multiple organ cell and become its ultimate so differentiated cell heart, cell, liver cell, brain cell, whatever.

243
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:26,310
So this landscape is just to show that this is a very dynamic environment.

244
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:37,250
It can also be influenced a lot by epigenetics, where a cell is given its fate via epigenetic signaling.

245
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,190
So here we are. Epigenetics. I already covered what it is.

246
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,110
So can someone explain what these three mechanisms are?

247
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,600
I think you might be familiar with this from previous talks.

248
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:02,810
What is the intimidation? Start with that. The Cancer Lecture.

249
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:10,490
What is a meditation? Basic chemistry? Yes. Is it that the area that turns on and off the area of DNA?

250
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:17,450
Yes. So DNA. Which is it?

251
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:22,700
How many bases are there in DNA that we should know for?

252
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:37,520
What are your full bases in your DNA? What is a adenine greeny?

253
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:46,330
Cytosine thymine? Right. We thought we said that turns genes on or off in DNA.

254
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,760
That is correct, yes. What actually is methylation?

255
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:55,470
Chemistry. We've taken basic chemistry. General chemistry. What is the methylation?

256
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,770
What is the middle group? Stage three.

257
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:05,790
Stage three. Who said that? I'm looking at phases.

258
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,810
Yes. It's three. Correct. This is a metal group.

259
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:15,149
Carbon. Three hydrogens. You don't really see the hydrogen.

260
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:22,170
So all of that is just the carbon. So in the cytosine residue, you can have a methyl group.

261
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:28,920
That's kind of the easy way to show it. Instead of drawing these structures that sticks out from your site.

262
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,950
Missing base. Nitrogenous base. DNA.

263
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:36,029
It has a phosphate backbone, a sugar and a nitrogenous base.

264
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:41,130
Right. So this methyl group comes out of your right towards it in space.

265
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:47,810
So I just want the seed base there with. Anybody.

266
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,760
It has to be way with one of these three. So you have a 75% chance.

267
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,300
I mean, 25% chance of getting something right.

268
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,879
Come on, give me something. What?

269
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,930
The sea bass. Where is it? G. R, t. G.

270
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:11,230
G g. Yes. So let me talk about DNA methylation.

271
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:16,450
We call it a c, c, p g site, c, g.

272
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:23,200
So there has been this methylation happening between a C and a G that's closer together.

273
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:27,100
A lot of these genes are there in promoter regions.

274
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:33,520
So turning genes on and off this region of being methylated can most likely turn a gene

275
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:40,270
off and then it being unregulated can most likely turn a gene on active repressing.

276
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:48,490
So the way that it how it happens is, is this methyl group kind of sticks out from your cytosine residues, right.

277
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:59,260
What it what it does is it prevents your DNA polymerases from binding your DNA there so the polymerase cannot go in transcribed or gene.

278
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:05,980
So the gene is not turned off because you can't be transcribed because these methyl groups are sticking out,

279
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:11,710
preventing your proteins from binding from where the gene is supposed to start.

280
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,840
Does that make sense? Okay, that's DNA methylation.

281
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,530
And most of what we're talking about is going to be on DNA methylation.

282
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:28,360
So here I'm glad all of what I said makes the slide itself great.

283
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:36,130
So here's a methyl group. I did not look at this, but I'm glad it kind of goes with what I was talking about.

284
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,590
Usually happens between the c g site that can be manipulated.

285
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:51,910
So here's a gene. Most likely this gene is going to be active or repressed, so on or off, because it has a lot of these methyl groups there.

286
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,550
Most repressed,

287
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:04,240
it's probably going to be off because there is a lot of these methyl groups stopping the proteins from binding and transcribing that gene.

288
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:07,300
Right. That's one.

289
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:12,880
And another way, again, does this really change the DNA itself?

290
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:19,780
No. Right. Because it literally just puts this ch3 carbon and three hydrogens on your site.

291
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:26,110
It doesn't change your C, it just modifies your C.

292
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:32,800
And the next way that epigenetic regulation can happen is histone modifications.

293
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:38,380
What are histones? I don't think we've talked about histones too much.

294
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:44,440
So if they want to help them out. And you'll know his stones.

295
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:51,280
It's okay if you don't know. So his tones are these proteins that rap your DNA.

296
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,750
So if you unwind your DNA, it's. It can fill a football field.

297
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:05,490
It's it's a large amount of information, but all of that is compacted into this two micron thick cell.

298
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:11,399
All of that is in a nucleus of a cell. It is very highly compacted.

299
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:24,780
Right. So what it does is your DNA that is, you know, double stranded and type parallel wraps around these proteins called histone proteins.

300
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:34,080
So and these histone proteins kind of like huddled together to kind of fit all of your DNA into your nucleus of a single cell.

301
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:46,680
So the way that these histones are wrapped around and kind of closer to each other can determine whether the genes are expressed or not.

302
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:55,680
So this is a second form of regulation. So, for example, if you look here, this is the concept of what's called open and closed chromatin.

303
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:03,060
The easiest way to understand it is if these histone proteins are kind of closer together, huddle together.

304
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:09,989
The the the other proteins that transcribe the genes cannot access the DNA.

305
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:13,380
Right. It's all kind of crunched together.

306
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:22,350
Your genes cannot be expressed then. But if it's kind of far apart like this, where DNA is accessible, if you look right here,

307
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,390
then your genes can be read by the proteins that transcribed those genes.

308
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:33,960
So here is an example of open chromatin or where a gene can be turned on.

309
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,980
And here is a closed chromatin formation where a gene is most likely turned off.

310
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:47,270
So all of this is because of your accessibility to your DNA.

311
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:52,430
Is there DNA readily accessible for other proteins to transcribe or is it not?

312
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:57,980
So here's one level of gene expression control DNA methylation.

313
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:04,100
This is a second level level of gene expression control, which is from histone modifications,

314
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,040
which I will not go into too much detail, but I can go on and on.

315
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,290
Talk hours about histone modifications.

316
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:28,249
Just know that there is a histone code where it tells the gene the code is based off of what is the single most prominent energy promoter,

317
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:35,000
for example. Oh, it is histone three that is methylated three times at a circuit chain.

318
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,630
What is one amino acid? That lysine? Yes, lysine.

319
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,630
So we call it H three, Kim K nine, try methylation.

320
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:50,780
So it's the ninth lysine that has three methyl groups sticking out in the histone tail.

321
00:36:51,350 --> 00:37:00,139
So these that's just one example. So there are multiple A's, three canine translation, it's three K 16 acetylation translation,

322
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,590
all of these ations, it's like modifications on the histone.

323
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:11,930
There's a code most of that is found in gene body or is it in the promoter or is it in an enhancer?

324
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:21,380
There's a code so that the scientists, researchers would know, Oh, if I find this specific signal, this is more likely a gene promoter.

325
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:34,830
Just know that there is a histone code and the last is noncoding RNA which I am specialized in, but I will not talk about today.

326
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,850
Just know that non-coding RNA on short segments.

327
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,410
Oh, I just erased it.

328
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,910
RNA usually codes for protein. Right, imani, but there are some RNA that don't code for protein.

329
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,610
So they could be long or they could be short.

330
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,860
So though this class of RNA is called non-coding art.

331
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:05,710
Non-coding means non protein coding RNA. They're there.

332
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:14,120
They don't that their sole function is to kind of regulate other genes so they can be long.

333
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:21,770
Non-coding irony or short non-coding irony. So all of them are important in gene regulation and I won't go into too much of that.

334
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,690
We can talk about it later if you want me to. Questions.

335
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,700
This is a big concept. I hope you understood it.

336
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,600
The main take home is DNA. Methylation happens between C's and G's.

337
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:41,630
It's a methyl group that sticks out of a C most almost all the time.

338
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:48,970
More methylation, more DNA methylation. Equals gene repression or turning a gene off.

339
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:54,430
Less DNA methylation means your proteins can transcribe that gene.

340
00:38:54,430 --> 00:39:02,850
That means that gene is most likely turned on. Main concept histones are there and I'm putting on an easy there to regulate gene expression to.

341
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:13,230
A is the age of the growth of the organism or the person that it has anything to do with it.

342
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:17,520
The DNA methylation or the is still modifications.

343
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:21,630
Does he have to be with the age changes with age?

344
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:28,080
Correct, yes. So we talked about how epigenetics is very dynamic, reversible.

345
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,130
So there is what's called an epigenetic age.

346
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,430
So there's a search for any gene.

347
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:44,370
If you look at it, if you really record the DNA methylation for, let's say, a brain cell, a certain brain cell from a baby to a 70 year old,

348
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:52,200
it'll it'll be a DNA methylation will most likely increase over time or decrease or whatever projection.

349
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,260
It depends on how that what that cell does.

350
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,480
If it's a cell that's very important for early development,

351
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:08,010
that cell gene expression or DNA methylation is more likely going to be lower so that the gene can be expressed a lot more.

352
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:13,400
And then kind of depends on the stage. So there there is what's called an epigenetic age.

353
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:17,790
So at a certain age we can do like a cross section and see, oh.

354
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:24,300
And for a normal human being, this brain cells are supposed to be at 50% DNA methylation.

355
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,129
If that is either higher or lower can determine, oh, it's epigenetic.

356
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:33,930
Age might be a little different from what the actual age is.

357
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,310
Good question. That's the same with. Oh, yeah. Have you are you familiar with like epigenetic clocks?

358
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:53,579
Yes. Yes, yes. There's these, like algorithms for that that people are developing for like looking at patterns of methylation to sort of the idea

359
00:40:53,580 --> 00:41:00,299
is to tell someone like you can tell someone's real age or like whether they're they have like accelerated aging,

360
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:07,130
quote unquote, compared to like they're sort of they're strictly like annual, you know, number age based on the number of years alive.

361
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:12,420
And it's a way that their thinking may be able a way to, like, sort of identify,

362
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,660
you know, certain risks for certain disease outcomes and things like that.

363
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:25,740
But I think at the stage and correct me if I'm wrong, but like I think it's still kind of at an early stage where they haven't really taken enough

364
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:30,479
samples and really developed enough of of a knowledge base to really be able to use them,

365
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:37,350
like really practically. And also facing a lot of limitations similar to what I talked about in the kidney lecture

366
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:42,690
where like we're taking samples from like specific sort of demographics and we don't,

367
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:48,810
we're not sampling from like across a lot of different, you know, age groups or racial categories and things like that.

368
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:55,139
So all of this stuff is really dependent on the sort of the studies, you know,

369
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,260
what we've actually looked at and what we know, and that can change over time.

370
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:04,170
So but yeah, this this epigenetic aging concept, it's really fascinating.

371
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:09,030
But I think it's still kind of in its early stages from for my understanding, that makes sense.

372
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:14,700
But the idea is like you have these patterns of epigenetic changes change as an individual ages.

373
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,790
Sorry. While you were talking, I think graphics flavors.

374
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,340
I'm not good at explaining what I'm good at. Right.

375
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:33,840
So here in the X-axis, we're looking at the expression, expression as in like DNA amount of DNA methylation going from lower to higher.

376
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:40,910
This is not based on any data, this is arbitrary, just made up data, but just to show it concept.

377
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:47,800
So as a person age, you can have in this like a straight line,

378
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:55,880
I'm showing what the DNA methylation should be like at this age for this person at that cell, for that tissue.

379
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:01,520
Because each tissue can have its own DNA methylation pattern.

380
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:06,200
Each cell type can, even within a tissue, can have its own medication pattern.

381
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:13,750
Just like gene expression. So at this stage, the DNA methylation is, let's say, supposed to be whatever it is.

382
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:18,770
Let's say this is 30 and this is like 50. Let's say this is 30.

383
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:25,820
So the for a normal person for that cell type to function at, it's at its best.

384
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:32,150
When the person is at X number of age, it's supposed to be at 30% DNA methylation.

385
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:41,060
But for some reason, being a biological disease, being an environmental exposure.

386
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:48,340
That DNA methylation for that cell type for another human being can be at 50%.

387
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:55,649
This changed it being what normal should be 30.

388
00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:04,380
But for some reason this person's like 50 might be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on what higher DNA methylation means.

389
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:14,130
So suppose this is a disease and higher DNA methylation means that your the functionality of that cell type is deteriorating.

390
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:20,970
That person having that higher DNA methylation in that brain cell might not be good for them.

391
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:25,380
That might be an Alzheimer's disease marker. Right. So we talked about clocks.

392
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:30,210
We find biomarkers for certain genes.

393
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:35,370
When we screen human populations, we look that's how biomarkers are made.

394
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:45,060
We figure out what a normal trend line would look like and figure out an unknown function based on that unknown expression.

395
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:51,820
And if you look at any for best example, that's not genetic is BRCA1.

396
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:56,890
We all know BRCA1 three through this.

397
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,790
Oh my god. I have so much about the BRCA1 expression is associated with breast cancer.

398
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:13,930
Right. How do we know that? We've sequenced multiple people DNA and found that BRCA1 gene is mostly expressed in cancer patients with breast cancer.

399
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:17,770
Then we can associate that with breast cancer.

400
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:22,450
Then once you see that association happening more and more, then it becomes a biomarker.

401
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:31,990
Same concept with DNA methylation. So to do that, we need to have hundreds and thousands of people,

402
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:37,780
DNA methylation for that specific gene, for that specific tissue sort of sense of baseline.

403
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:43,540
Exactly. Yeah. Yes. So forgive me, Mike.

404
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,740
I don't know, but I'm not a biologist and I'm an engineer.

405
00:45:48,160 --> 00:46:00,910
But I'm always thinking if if that markers that you say that that says, well, that at that age is going to change something.

406
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,090
For example, in the brain, like with Alzheimer.

407
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,510
And if it is identified that the marker.

408
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:21,710
Is it possible that. You can identify the marker and do something with that so it won't develop an Alzheimer.

409
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,280
Just doing before the Alzheimer's starts.

410
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:29,000
Let's say at 48 or something like that.

411
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,330
Can you identify the marker? Yes.

412
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:41,960
That is risk assessment. Right. That's the the idea we'd like to be able to identify early where we can employ some kind of intervention diet.

413
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:45,770
Yeah. Type B two and on RNA therapeutic.

414
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:52,370
You know, we're trying to find interventions. Mostly most of the interventions that has been working.

415
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:57,170
For example, let's let's get all toxicology right. Some more toxicology example.

416
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:00,830
Who knows about BP? Everybody. Everybody.

417
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:06,409
Why is BP a bad. Endocrine disrupting endocrine disruptors.

418
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:11,630
Where was it mostly found before it was banned from some equipment?

419
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:16,040
Glasses, yes, but mainly baby bottles.

420
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:20,340
Right? And having BPA baby bottles was bad.

421
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:30,240
So one of the risk is this DNA methylation problem in the babies that are fed in bottles with BPA.

422
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:39,479
And one of the solutions was for the the even during pregnancy, if the mom is exposed to BPA,

423
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,530
a way a possible way to reverse that was through methyl donors.

424
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:51,690
So that was found from mice. So a lot of the times, what is a main methyl donor that pregnant women have?

425
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:57,240
I forget the word, but there's one little donor.

426
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:03,600
What is folic acid only fully full of metal donor.

427
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:09,150
So that is like an intervention to fix the problem that's caused by the toxicant.

428
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:16,770
So not not a lot of full solution, but a final solution to mitigate some of the harmful effects.

429
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:23,310
At least the baby can be born. You know, some of the exposures are embryonic, lethal.

430
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:26,940
That means the embryo never gets to see the light of day.

431
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:36,860
It just the miscarriage, basically. Anyway, we kind of crawled right back on track so that you could talk about things that I want to cover.

432
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,290
Yeah, sorry. This is like a really good conversation, though.

433
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:44,000
Like with the BPA, we talked about it as an endocrine disruptor, but there's these other effects,

434
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:48,649
like impacts on methylation that may be related to it's endocrine disrupting effects

435
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:53,060
or it may be something a different mechanism of action that toxicants can have.

436
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:58,280
So some toxicants can be endocrine disruptors, but they may cause inflammation as well.

437
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:04,340
So there's these multiple mechanisms that that we need to understand that that are,

438
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,690
you know, chemicals don't know that they're supposed to only act or one specific mechanism.

439
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:15,140
Yes, that makes sense. Yeah. And to go one comment on what you were talking about doing biomarkers.

440
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:25,940
So we're entitled to head hypothesis. Developmental origins of health and disease is to identify when later life disease outcomes earlier

441
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:33,889
in life based on biomarker expression so you can or like gene expression or DNA methylation.

442
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:41,750
Usually it's DNA methylation that's found. So if there's a certain DNA methylation change in that gene in the brain,

443
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:47,780
if it's a predictor for Alzheimer's disease, for example, then that is a risk assessment.

444
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:51,920
And that person is highly likely to get Alzheimer's at this age.

445
00:49:52,790 --> 00:50:01,580
So then that person can prepare themselves either by supplementation or exercise or whatever it is to prevent that from happening,

446
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:08,990
or that the doctor would know, Oh, this person has a higher risk for Alzheimer's or diabetes,

447
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:14,150
then you can prepare yourself for it for a treatment procedure.

448
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:19,100
Most likely that person might not even get Alzheimer's because treated early.

449
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:26,720
So that's another aspect of what we do for biomarker assessment and identifying these biomarkers.

450
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:38,840
But actually there is nothing that really is going to win, for example, Alzheimer's.

451
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:43,310
Otherwise we wouldn't have any Alzheimer's at all.

452
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:52,790
But really, I suppose there's not really something that that the biologists have identified it, that that it is.

453
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:57,250
And we can avoid that or something, too.

454
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:00,260
Another thing we need to understand is all of us are not the same.

455
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:11,300
If you talk about precision medicine, everybody has to have their own personalized medicine, which is why it's not a one shoe fits all we all have.

456
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:15,620
It's not just Alzheimer's disease that's in that patient. Maybe there's a sugar problem.

457
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:23,870
Maybe there's a triglyceride. So it's like you can't treat every patient in the same same way because every patient has different issues.

458
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:26,900
Right. So that's why this is harder.

459
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,490
That's why we can't find a proper solution. That's not a one size fits all.

460
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:39,260
So that's why in future, we think that we will step into what's more personalized medicine, which also incorporates some of these,

461
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:45,290
you know, instead of gene sequencing, you also have epigenetic sequencing to kind of figure out what's going on.

462
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:53,040
So to kind of go with the concept we had before, talk about gene silencing with epigenetic markers, right?

463
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:56,570
Talk about DNA methylation, which is what's what's highlighted here.

464
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:05,550
So you have these popsicles, open circles mean it's on methylated DNA and close circles mean it is methylated DNA.

465
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:15,120
So here, for example, an embryonic stem cell can have pluripotency gene that's turned on developmental regulators.

466
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:21,060
That's place. What can you say about DNA methylation at those two stages?

467
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:26,210
Is it on or off? This.

468
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:38,240
It's an embryonic stem cell. It's on. So here the the the the circle is unregulated, CPGs.

469
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,760
So here's your active gene expression, Mark. It's an embryonic stem cells.

470
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:55,490
So the next thing you will do is activate the pluripotency genes, have these developmental regulators in at hand to make it more somatic later on.

471
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:01,010
But the somatic cell genes are all turned off because it's not a somatic tissue.

472
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:06,200
It's not a heart tissue. It's not an erotic tissue. It's just going to become one later on.

473
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:16,440
Does that make sense? Vice versa in a somatic cell, somatic cell, meaning it's a differentiated cell that is from a circuit.

474
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:25,979
Whatever tissue, whatever cell type, it will have its full potential developmental regulators turned off by DNA methylation.

475
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:31,980
So here's a US sign and here is your activation sign for all the genes.

476
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:46,980
That's important for somatic cells. So this is the, the basics for epigenetic regulation in cell differentiation approaches.

477
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,140
Hi. Can I finish? Okay.

478
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:01,350
So conversation? Oh, yes. So let me switch gears to talk about developmental toxicology.

479
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:15,090
It's the study of pathogenesis or start starting out or outcomes that come from an exposure to agents or conditions leading to abnormal development.

480
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:23,220
So anything that can screw up your normal function mainly from toxicants or environmental exposures.

481
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:28,320
That is a definition of developmental toxicology.

482
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:39,100
So when we talk about birth defects, these toxic forms that cause birth defects are called term additives.

483
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:49,720
So the word Terada means it comes from a Greek word, meaning monster, meaning it's kind of like abnormal.

484
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:55,330
So to read in Genesis is the process of abnormal prenatal development.

485
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:00,490
So when you call on Organogenesis, that's the development of organs cameto.

486
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:11,890
Genesis is the making of your gametes. So Terry, as a Genesis is making off the Terada so of the more abnormal development.

487
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:16,420
So Terror Gene is an agent that causes that abnormal development.

488
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:22,090
This is important for developmental toxicology because we study.

489
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,600
The effects of travel agents that can cause birth defects.

490
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:38,360
So these are just examples showing how people have been always been interested in it since time in.

491
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:44,760
Look, Karen, many times. I'm not good with history, which is why I'm majoring in science.

492
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:49,410
So the scope of the problem. Why is this so important?

493
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:53,010
This is from a book chapter. It's just some statistics.

494
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:58,800
Successful pregnancy outcomes happen at at a very low frequency.

495
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:12,660
More than 50% of the the conception shows, I guess after fertilization, more than 50% of the the babies are not born.

496
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:16,800
So that is a big problem. So here are some statistics.

497
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,760
31% of the pregnancies are loss post implantation.

498
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:29,940
2 to 3% of major birth defects are observed at birth and 6 to 7 until the baby is one year old.

499
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:36,510
And approximately 14% of live births have minor birth defects.

500
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:42,090
This may be caused by Teratogenic and or it could be genetics as well.

501
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:47,880
7% of the life birds are at low birth weight.

502
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:56,759
So that's also a problem. And a little over 1% of infant mortality happens prior to the first year.

503
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:03,780
So that that statistic goes hand in hand with this 6 to 7% right before they turn one.

504
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:11,670
And 16 to 17% have abnormal neurologic function, which is also a bad thing.

505
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:20,010
And a lot of the times, exposure studies also focus on measuring intellect.

506
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:28,920
Right. They have measurements with a certain exposure to see how well the neurologic function is.

507
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:37,230
So the chemical, biological, dietary and genetic factors have all been linked to adverse developmental outcomes.

508
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:42,510
So when we talk about chemical, we're talking about environmental exposures to chemicals.

509
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,760
You have a question, what qualifies as a minor?

510
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:53,670
Bringing with it minor birth defect would be, if I remember correctly,

511
00:57:54,870 --> 00:58:03,870
it's defined as an outcome that does not that can still have normal day to day functions for a human being.

512
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:11,980
So, yeah, so for example, I guess, do I fall under a minor birth defect?

513
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,750
I don't know. The doctors say that I have had this since birth. I had holes in my retina.

514
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:19,820
So that would be a minor birth. But it's fixed now.

515
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:31,830
But that would be a minor birth defect. It doesn't stop me from being and acting like a normal human being, healthy human being.

516
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:45,080
So another concept. 15 is that that the book kind of talks about is this general principles of travelog.

517
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:55,360
Note that this was found. James Wilson came up with this in 1959 and this still holds true today.

518
00:58:55,690 --> 00:59:00,780
We still don't know how the director Jones impact human health.

519
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:13,240
And there's a lot that's not known. So with human x and exposure to chemical, what can be impacted by an exposure to chemicals?

520
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:19,370
First one kind of right there susceptibility to terms of Genesis depends on the genotype of the concept.

521
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:25,760
So their DNA, their genetics and a manner in which this interacts with adverse environmental factors.

522
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:32,270
So how can an environmental factor, let's say a chemical BPA, for example?

523
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:44,510
How can that affect the DNA of or gene expression of a certain baby, let's say, or in development during pregnancy?

524
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,410
I'll go through all of this and I won't waste time.

525
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:57,200
And the second is the susceptibility that to the chemical that varies with the developmental stage.

526
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:10,820
So kind of talking about this, how the chemical, for example, a chemical, environmental chemical can change what's normal at a specific stage.

527
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:18,910
And that can lead to an adverse influence on gene expression or protein expression.

528
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:28,320
And these agents can have specific mechanisms.

529
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:36,330
So we've talked about receptors. Or epigenetic mechanisms where the genes can turn on and off.

530
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:45,780
Ultimately, ways genes can turn on and off on developing cells and tissues to initiate sequences of abnormal development.

531
01:00:46,380 --> 01:01:00,570
For example, if there is an agent for a known agent, an example will be telling the mind, which was used as a sleep aid in the 1960s in Germany.

532
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:07,110
And when the pregnant women used it, they had babies with limb defects.

533
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:12,060
So the agent would be thalidomide.

534
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,650
The mechanism would effect certain cell type.

535
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:22,710
So the stem cells that give rise to limb development.

536
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:29,520
So that was messed up so that the mechanism is related to certain lineage of cells.

537
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,590
We talked about our germline, so right.

538
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:40,380
So that lineage of cells, you can see the outcome after birth or before birth if it's like embryonic lethality,

539
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,790
an outcome or pathogenesis that's caused by the the teratogenic or the chemical.

540
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:55,659
The excessive adverse influence to developing tissues depend on the nature of the influence.

541
01:01:55,660 --> 01:02:01,110
So that goes hand in hand with the example I just talked about, the amount of exposure.

542
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:08,660
And the fifth point talks about outcome.

543
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:12,290
The four manifestations of deviant development are death.

544
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:16,190
So embryonic lethality malformation, for example,

545
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:25,550
limb development with a wide growth retardation and growth deficit for a lot of the developmental toxicology research.

546
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:29,850
One of the main outcomes is. Growth.

547
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:36,600
We care about the growth of the embryo, growth of the placenta, growth of the baby when it's born.

548
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:41,010
That's why low birth weight, having low birth weight was a problem.

549
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:51,420
So prenatal developmental development, early postnatal development, all are influenced by developmental toxicology.

550
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:59,040
Reading back to what our topic is today. Lastly,

551
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:05,309
manifestations of these deviant development will increase in frequency and decrease

552
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:12,660
as and degree as dosage increases from the no effect to the totally lethal effect.

553
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:21,960
So the whole point here is that the dosage is important, the stage is important, the tissue is important, the chemical is important.

554
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:28,530
All of these play a role in how bad that chemical may act upon a tissue.

555
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:35,520
That's the bottom line. Any questions so far?

556
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:39,600
Because this is a very important concept for developmental toxicology.

557
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:47,010
It's hard to of a more specific question, like in terms of what would be considered a tradition in this case.

558
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:55,460
Like, I think stress follows each of these steps in the sense that your genotype or determine,

559
01:03:55,470 --> 01:04:02,549
like your exposure can determine the effect of stress on your body and that it also causes low birth weight and other developmental issues.

560
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:08,400
But is it considered a tradition in this case? Because it's not necessarily like something that you can measure.

561
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:16,919
And then also it compounds like based off of situations of your birth and then situations of your mother's birth and your mother's life.

562
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,790
So like, would that be a teratogenic or does that not?

563
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:24,119
Or I guess, you know, a toxic in this case as well or.

564
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:31,320
No. Yeah. I mean, I don't psychosocial stress is like I think that's what you're talking about again.

565
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:37,440
Yeah, right. Um, I was just going to say that that plays into the whole DNA methylation aging thing as well.

566
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:45,060
So that is, you know, we talked about the expose of in the first lecture about how we're starting to pull together all these different factors that,

567
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:48,660
you know, psychosocial stress can be due to your environment. Right?

568
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:54,690
Um, and so we kind of think about that, you know, in an expose, um, sense,

569
01:04:54,690 --> 01:05:01,530
in a way as a component of our environment that can cause, you know, changes to our health or impact our health, right?

570
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:08,249
Um, I, we probably wouldn't call it a tradition per se, because it's not a physical like sort of molecule,

571
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:12,420
you know, it's, it's something different, but certainly things like stress hormones.

572
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:18,480
Again, I'm not sure if you'd call them traditions per say since they're endogenous to the body.

573
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:23,819
But if you're disrupting certainly like levels of things like cortisol or what have,

574
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:33,440
you can have adverse effects if you're knocking off the knocking things off track in terms of the normal dynamics of cortisol signaling, for example.

575
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:41,130
So I don't know if you'd call it a tradition per se, but it could have a teratogenic effect potentially if it's causing that same effect.

576
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:44,840
So, yes, I don't have anything to add.

577
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:52,470
It's a really good point. I'm not an expert on transitions, but based on what I read off the book chapter, which I did read.

578
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:59,549
It's it's, it's not considered teratogenic classic teratogenic.

579
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:04,020
Because like Dr. Harris pointed out, it's not a chemical.

580
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:07,980
It's like an outside exogenous chemical exposure.

581
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:16,100
But with that said, I also gave a lecture on psychosocial factors in epigenetics like last week and next Thursday.

582
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:21,360
So, yes, it does affect your point is very true.

583
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:29,850
It can affect your hormones. It can it has shown effects in birth, low birth weight, premature births.

584
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:38,820
That's all linked to also epigenetics. But there then according to the book, it's they're not considered as classic traditions,

585
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,870
but they do influence birth, which is why we look at it a bit.

586
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:48,090
If geneticists look at it, sorry, this is like, yeah, you jump at it.

587
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:52,409
But these are good conversations to have in our Superfund Center grant that we're

588
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:58,020
we're trying to put together for some of our for some of the research we do,

589
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:02,610
we we focus on a cohort of pregnant women in Puerto Rico.

590
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:08,070
And so one of the things we've talked about is because psychosocial stress plays such an important role on pregnancy,

591
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:16,139
how we want to understand how potentially environmental exposures to environmental toxicants be in

592
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:23,610
an additive or synergistic way is combined with psychosocial stress to impact things like birth,

593
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:30,419
weight, preterm birth, etc. So we're trying to think more holistically, but the problem is that it's hard to model in the lab, right?

594
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:33,660
So like how do we stress out our placental cell model?

595
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,729
Like with a psychosocial, you know,

596
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:43,230
I actually when I first came here working with my with read a lot Caruso who I did my postdoc with, I talked about,

597
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:51,270
you know, the psychosocial stress component and like thinking about how we bring in cortisol in maybe another exposure to these models we have.

598
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:58,950
But we ended up kind of backing away from it because it was very complicated and very hard to sort of model that in a lab type of environment,

599
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:02,040
but you could do it in like an AP type of study, right?

600
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,270
So yeah, I work with myself or my. Yeah.

601
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:15,960
So yeah, this is. Yeah, thanks. So we like these questions and feel free to ask questions and that's okay to be stuck in the class.

602
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:20,340
Now the main things I need to cover today,

603
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:30,450
they were elemental toxicology I think we kind of cover this is characterizes is characterized by a rapid change in size change biochemistry

604
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:41,250
physiology gene expression function protein function that are a consequence of a sequential pattern of that exposure on the gene expression.

605
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:52,300
So anything that disrupts this complex system. So we talked about central dogma, molecular biology, terrorism can disrupt that.

606
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:58,430
Right. And anything that disrupt that can produce developmental toxic toxicity,

607
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:04,070
including the disruption of I'm not going to ask you these questions because we already talked about it.

608
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:10,520
It can be a number of cells. We've talked about cell differentiation, cell proliferation.

609
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:22,059
Right, cell replication. And we talked about signals can be hormones can be receptors, other factors, for example, psychosocial factors.

610
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:25,540
Right? It can be gene transcription.

611
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:33,940
This is very important. We kind of talked about this theme of how gene expression is changed from any of these factors

612
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:40,420
and ultimately protein expression that can lead to a certain physical outcome that we see.

613
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:48,850
So Gene transcription talks of a genotype that affects protein expression, which influences your phenotype, right?

614
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:52,060
Physical expression of your genes.

615
01:09:56,490 --> 01:10:01,469
Zoom through this. I gave you a classic example of humanitarian events already.

616
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:03,630
So it's half covered.

617
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:13,410
And we already talk about the DOE head hypothesis and the the role that environmental toxicants play on this DOE head hypothesis.

618
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:18,120
Well, forget about the case study for that for today. Well, stages of development is important.

619
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:23,280
So there are key stages of development starting from mutagenesis.

620
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:30,189
What is the mutagenesis? Making off the gametes.

621
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:33,909
What are the gametes? Sex sells. Sex sells.

622
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:38,900
What are sex sells? Come on, we know this.

623
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:48,250
Eggs and sperm. Right. So making of your eggs and sperm fertilization, I'm not going to go into that.

624
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:51,940
Then preimplantation gastrulation.

625
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:58,620
Organogenesis making all of your organs. And the fetal period.

626
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:07,840
These are key developmental time points in developmental toxicology or developmental biology.

627
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:14,950
Zoom through this because we already kind of touched base germ cells on your eggs and sperm.

628
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:23,080
They're haploid. That means it is 23 chromosomes, right?

629
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:31,060
Sperm has all of your dad's DNA. Eggs have all of your mom's DNA to make a diploid organism.

630
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:36,590
That is two and half comes from mom. Half comes from dad.

631
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:40,440
Right. You have two copies of every gene. From Mom.

632
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:48,640
From Dad. So give me the genesis is a process involving formatting that haploid cell or your gametes,

633
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:56,440
the sperms and the eggs and these gametes feels by fertilization to make your

634
01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:02,979
diploid cell a fertilized egg is what gives rise to an embryo ultimately.

635
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:11,200
Right? A fetus. Here's an important concept the maternal and paternal genomes.

636
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:20,780
So your sperm the sperm DNA that comes from your dad, eg DNA that comes from your mom is actually not equivalent.

637
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:25,940
It's not the same and the contribution is different.

638
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:30,140
And that can be explained why what's called genomic imprinting.

639
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:42,590
So here's an example of a mom. Mom has a maternal alarm that's shown by m a paternal alarm that's shown by P.

640
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:46,310
So mom has far a gene to alleles.

641
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:55,639
Mom's mom and mom's dad right and then has to illegal's for that same gene that comes from dad's mom and dad's dad.

642
01:12:55,640 --> 01:13:05,930
Right. So there are several genes that are primarily expressed from one alil, one parental aleo.

643
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:15,950
For example, this gene is exclusively expressed from the paternal oleo.

644
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:25,580
So maternally express gene, that means what should happen to the other allo that should not be expressed.

645
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:32,670
Going back to epigenetics that we talked about, what do you think should happen to that oil, that gene?

646
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:39,780
To look at my line. Yes, it will be methylated.

647
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:47,890
That is what's called imprinting. So genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process that occurs during the mutagenesis,

648
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:57,010
conferring to a certain genes expressed from one illegal exclusively depending on their maternal paternal origin.

649
01:13:57,670 --> 01:14:07,240
So having this methylation on this oleo, this is a maternally imprinted gene that is potentially expressed.

650
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:11,170
That is the whole concept of genomic imprinting.

651
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,900
Very hard concept. But you all know it now.

652
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:25,750
So during the mutagenesis egg and sperm formation, this pattern or imprint maternal Alito being silenced is passed down to the baby.

653
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:29,650
And this happens from one generation to another. Always.

654
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:39,340
And if there's an environmental toxicant and environmental exposure that can disrupt this process,

655
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:44,950
it can ultimately lead to problems in fertilization.

656
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:48,630
I think you kind of talk looks like you talked about it before, but.

657
01:14:50,980 --> 01:15:00,400
Yes. Following fertilization, the embryo moves through the fallopian tubes or redux to implant into the uterus.

658
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:05,080
And then the pre-implantation. It starts where the cell.

659
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:07,960
This is also called a blastocyst stage,

660
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:17,080
where you have cells that that will ultimately become the placenta and also cells that ultimately will become the embryo.

661
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:24,970
Both lineages are here. So here's an micrograph under the electron microscope.

662
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:34,030
This is kind of how it really looks like. Here's a the inner cell mass just called the embryo blast that gives rise to the embryo.

663
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:42,639
And also it's it has this trove of glass cells that ultimately gives rise to other cells besides the embryo,

664
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,760
which basically means it'll become the placenta one day.

665
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:55,090
So this period is important for increasing cell number through multiple cell divisions.

666
01:15:57,490 --> 01:16:00,850
And it is generally thought to be more resistant to toxicity.

667
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:08,140
And I will skip through epigenetic reprograming because we don't have time.

668
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:13,380
Don't worry about me. But Gastrulation is the next step.

669
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:17,730
Following implantation, the embryo will go through Gastrulation.

670
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,120
This means that the embryo will become.

671
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:27,720
Well, we'll form the three germ layers. So what are our three germ layers?

672
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:37,400
It's arguing here in the economy that our. And it also forms what's called the.

673
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:47,600
Oh, my God, primitive streak, right? Yes. So during gastrulation, when the embryo is formed.

674
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:51,080
It has to make what's called a neural plate.

675
01:16:52,640 --> 01:17:00,200
And before the neural plate, it kind of pinches in the embryo to kind of make the three germ layers.

676
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:04,100
The ectoderm is what kind of differentiates first. So like your brain.

677
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:12,150
So the neural lineage, that's where the neural plate is formed, but neural plate is formed in the next set, not gastrulation.

678
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:21,320
I think this organic genesis, it's important for organic Genesis, but this primitive streak is what kind of helps make that the two division,

679
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:26,930
it kind of makes the embryo dividing to two kind of pinches off at the ends.

680
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:35,450
So this period is very susceptible to transitions and if anything would impact Gastrulation,

681
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:44,239
it's ultimately leading to most likely would lead to embryonic lethality because it will have malformations in the eyes,

682
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:51,040
brains and face because remember, it happens before like that neural place form.

683
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:56,840
So a lot of brain and facial craniofacial deformity deforms happens because of that.

684
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:06,050
So this is what I wanted to kind of talk about. Organogenesis is the formation of organs, development of organs.

685
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:14,480
So the the gastrulation happens at like this is a picture of mouse embryo development.

686
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:18,220
So this kind of like area that pinches off,

687
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:26,180
this is the primitive streak that helps develop what's called this neural plate that kind of makes the embryo of dividing to half.

688
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:33,260
And once that primitive streak and the neural plate is formed in,

689
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:38,300
the embryo ends up developing like your your brain and the three germ layers kind of

690
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:44,060
starts differentiating and makes their own cell types and organs starts to develop.

691
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:51,419
So this is a very rapid change that requires cell proliferation, cell migration,

692
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:56,520
cell to cell interactions and a lot of morphogenesis tissue remodeling.

693
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:05,300
So a lot of organ development is what's impacted by environmental exposures at this stage.

694
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,550
So maximum sensitivity.

695
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:18,210
So if it's a cell type that's mostly influenced by the mind and limb development, it probably happened during this time period.

696
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:26,210
And the sensitivity of malformations. It extends to 3 to 8 weeks of gestation in humans.

697
01:19:26,230 --> 01:19:35,830
Even though my example is on mice, it's harder to see all of this in humans because there aren't we can't really euthanize moms for that.

698
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:40,390
Right? So fetal period is the last stage.

699
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:46,180
It's also highly influenced by impacted by stratagems.

700
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:55,629
And this is the the stage that's primary for tissue differentiation, growth and physiological maturation.

701
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:59,800
So day 57 to birth in humans like late life,

702
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:11,319
third trimester developmental time point and toxicant exposures during this is like I said is is very bad for you and functional

703
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:19,600
abnormalities to the central nervous system that's what CNS stands for so brain and cognition problems with that reproductive organs,

704
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:26,680
behavioral, mental and motor deficits can happen in exposures impacting this time period.

705
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:35,260
But it doesn't necessarily impact a lot of embryonic lethality,

706
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:43,990
but it does decrease fertility because by this point, the baby or the the the fetus is going to be born.

707
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:51,260
So I have a link to a YouTube video that kind of goes through all of this.

708
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:57,260
So I'll stop there. This is just to show time is up.

709
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:03,460
That timing is very important. I think we already touched base on that, that the exposure effect,

710
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:11,650
the stage or the timing that's impacted by that exposure can impact what outcome we would see when they really spawn.

711
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:15,490
And we'll stop there. All right. Thank you.

712
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:20,740
Sorry. This is. It's a really good conversation.

713
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:24,340
It's good to have conversation. Thanks, everyone.

714
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:36,310
I don't have any announcements simply. Monday we're going to talk about pesticides and yeah, office hours and you know, if you have any questions.

715
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:40,599
Always of them. So thanks again. No problem.

716
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:49,360
Anything. I want to talk about this and if you have more questions, here's my office and I'm almost always there and my email.

717
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:58,410
Thanks, everyone. It's good to have the conversation.

718
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:04,480
So, you know, I can always you know, I can just go through.
