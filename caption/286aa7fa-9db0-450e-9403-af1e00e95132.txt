1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,300
And I'll say, no, I'm not. So.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,410
Okay. All right. So we're back to recording.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,840
And what? So everyone has the PowerPoint pulled up.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:27,540
So I'm in the unit to PowerPoint and I am going to start on the right slide, which I think is where we left off, which would be for me at slide 14.

5
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,220
But I think the way I downloaded it, so it's just cereal grains where it says rice, you want that one?

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,860
Okay. We are going to get going here.

7
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:43,860
So anybody have any fun, food stories, any labels that read that's really interesting this week, any product that they came across?

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:01:01,020
Any anybody, make anything, combine anything, substitute anything that's worth or is that dark brown?

9
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,250
Oh, you use brown virus. You brown the butter itself. Huh.

10
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,090
That's interesting. That's great. Yeah, usually. So what would brown butter?

11
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,340
What do you think brown butter did in terms of, like, changing the way it might taste like.

12
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,370
Yeah. Like a deeper flavor. Right, right.

13
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,340
So kind of like deepens the proteins in it. Right.

14
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:30,819
So kind of similar to when you're making like a roux, which is a combination of like fat and some type of starch that's used for thickening.

15
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:37,750
We're going to talk about starch just a little bit today. It changes the properties of the way the starch thickens and often doesn't thicken as much.

16
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:43,420
But anybody from Louisiana or eat any of like the brown gumbo and brown roux.

17
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:51,790
So they they are known for actually changing the properties of the starch specifically and by using the different,

18
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,849
you know, butter fats in there to brown them to make a different consistency and flavor and a deeper flavor.

19
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,360
So that's what that would be for. I just have to be really careful on what you were also doing with that.

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,630
I'm sure you're like we talked about last week and I do have a couple of slides on fat selection in baking too.

21
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,280
But you know, butter has like about 15% water in it.

22
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,969
So by browning it you're actually evaporating the water and you're having a more concentrated source of fat.

23
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:26,440
But what does that mean then when you think about it, when there's less water available, water actually binds things like sugars and other properties,

24
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:34,450
provides water that you might need for gluten formation, also would provide water for structure.

25
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,979
So you might see some changes with that. Other things you have to think about.

26
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,330
Like if you're making like did you have eggs in your product? Yeah, there were two eggs.

27
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,200
And then I also an apple. The up 2% Greek yogurt.

28
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,070
Oh, good. Yeah. And then a cup of coffee. Uh huh, that sounds great.

29
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,210
Yeah. And then you're left with another half of a can of pumpkin to do something with, right?

30
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:02,050
I need something I like. I might heard that.

31
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,250
That's really great.

32
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,350
But the other thing I was going to say is, you know, you just always have to be careful if you're using eggs in baking, in your heating,

33
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:16,030
anything prior to adding it so that you're not actually cooking and curdling the eggs and coagulating them before you actually get it in the oven.

34
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:23,530
So that's funny that you say that when my kids were little, they used to love sweet potatoes more so than any type of green vegetable.

35
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:29,710
And they literally did like a lot of times babies will like turn from the pigmentation, like orange color.

36
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,440
And the first thought in my mind, being a medical person is, oh no, they have a liver failure and they're jaundice.

37
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,799
You know what's wrong? Not knowing, you know so well.

38
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,670
Good. Thanks for sharing that. I wanted to share in terms of recipes.

39
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,090
I get the Sunday New York Times. It's the only paper that I get delivered.

40
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,159
But they had a nice little insert that you guys can take a look around if anybody ever saw this.

41
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:57,850
I think it's nice to have this in the print version than on the the web version.

42
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:03,489
So this is really interesting. So it's 24, 24 recipes with minimal ingredients.

43
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,969
And I would have to say, with the exception of I don't eat meat really that much,

44
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:12,910
though with the exception of some of the meat recipes, they're very interesting and maybe you can be inspired by it.

45
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,920
And there's a pumpkin soup in here that has peanut butter in it that I thought was an interesting take on it.

46
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,930
But you could also substitute tahini.

47
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,110
So those are the types of things I kind of want you to start thinking about is like, okay, if this has peanut butter and I don't have peanut butter,

48
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,099
but I'm allergic, what could I put on that that would still give it that roasty nutty flavor.

49
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,679
Oh, tahini. So you're mine. If you're not, like, developing recipes, you might think that way.

50
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,700
So. So I'll put this here and we can pass that around the other little food fact that I wanted to kind of share because I had

51
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:48,040
promised at the beginning of the semester that I would have you share things and that I would also share different things.

52
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,279
So this time of year is are the Jewish holidays. I don't know if anybody celebrates time, but my my husband is Jewish.

53
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,640
So we try and do things for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, which is next week.

54
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,750
But a traditional a traditional Rosh Hashanah dish.

55
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:09,999
People often will do like briskets and things like that. But we've always done something called Chicken Marbella, which is a silver palate recipe,

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,760
which is kind of like a very famous chicken dish that is marinated overnight and

57
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,700
also includes like things like capers and prunes and olives and bay leaves.

58
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:25,350
Then, you know, the beauty of it is in the marinade kind of soaking into the meat.

59
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,629
But with that being said, when we cover our meat unit,

60
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:34,990
we know that marinades only penetrate very much the outer layer and don't unless you're injecting chicken with,

61
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,230
then that does happen where you can actually take a syringe and inject it.

62
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:44,229
You're not getting that much flavor. But since I don't have since I don't really we don't eat chicken anymore.

63
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:48,879
I substituted a cod fish with it, which, you know, different cooking time,

64
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,480
don't want to marinate it too much or it would turn it into civic, which means you would cook it with the red wine vinegar that's in it.

65
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,469
So and I also thought I'd throw some tempi and just to see how that would be.

66
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:05,890
Tempi doesn't have any absorb ability, so it takes on the flavor of the sauces, but it doesn't actually absorb any of the sauces.

67
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,520
So that's all well and good. But it turned out great, actually.

68
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,870
But it took me down a rabbit hole because the recipe calls for prunes and.

69
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:19,450
Prunes are something that I often think of of the elderly eating because the elderly would eat it for constipation.

70
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,710
And then, you know, my food science mind started thinking a little bit more about prunes.

71
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,490
Okay, where what? Our proteins. Who knows what happens?

72
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,850
Yeah, right. As a dry plant. Right.

73
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:39,399
So why then don't we think about like using as dietitians if somebody were to come to you and it's Michigan and we grow a lot of stone fruit here and,

74
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,790
you know, they're available in the summer and somebody says, I'm really,

75
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:49,060
really having problems with constipation and you would recommend plums instead of prunes because they're more readily available.

76
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,200
Do you ever give this any thought? No. Okay.

77
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,690
Well, this is good, Brian. So we're going to think about it. So. So there's a lot of just like, all different kinds of fruits.

78
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:08,230
There's a lot of varieties of different fruits. And the stone fruits you probably have seen like peaches and cans that are called clean peaches.

79
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,850
Well, that has to do with how the pit adheres to the flesh of the peach or the other stone fruit.

80
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:21,850
So stone fruits are grown in a variety of ways, those that separate really easily from their pit,

81
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,060
and then those that, you know, kind of cling to their pits.

82
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:33,820
Well, it turns out the types of plums that they use to dry to make prunes are different than the plums that you would consume.

83
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,950
And plums have three grams of fiber in them, but something like three grams.

84
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:44,590
Prunes have about three grams of fiber for 100 grams. A serving of prunes is about 3 to 5.

85
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:50,559
I could never sit down and think of eating 3 to 5 plums, but 3 to 5 prunes seems doable.

86
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:57,540
Yeah. So that's the same thing for grapes. Do they use different types of grapes for trying to make.

87
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,110
Yeah. Yeah, they do. Yeah. And actually when we get into the Fruit Unit,

88
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,329
what's interesting about that is a lot of that is determined whether or not you add

89
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:12,430
sulfur to them if they're yellow grapes or if they're yellow raisins or red raisins.

90
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:20,740
So but yes, different types and different treatments to make them different colors, too, in terms of the the sulfur that's used for oxidation.

91
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,590
But with the plums, there's actually salt.

92
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:31,990
The fiber is the same, you know, and we know fiber is you can aid you hollow and fiber can aid you in constipation.

93
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:38,110
What do you think is different about the plums that might help somebody who's suffering from constipation?

94
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:47,839
This is something that I actually learned, too. So. So it's actually the type of sugar.

95
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:54,049
It's a sugar alcohol that plums contain. I just read like maybe in your MBTI classes, you might read a case study on this.

96
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,840
There's case studies of people who chew excess,

97
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:03,739
like smokers who change from smoking to chewing gum and then chew instead of instead of smoking two packs of cigarets a day.

98
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,030
They will chew two packs of gum a day and gum is known.

99
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,810
Usually we've tried to take the sugar out of most gums for dental caries.

100
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,260
So. So gums have a lot of sugar alcohols in them.

101
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,400
So what prunes have in them is a very high amount of sorbitol.

102
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:30,049
And what we know that Sorbitol does is it attracts water from your intestine and that increases frequency so that you're not constipated anymore.

103
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:36,380
And like usually anything over about five grams of sorbitol can have this laxative effect.

104
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,959
And it turns out like a serving of prunes actually has about 12 grams of sorbitol in it.

105
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,750
So, so it's just like but then you as dietitians, as you get into the GI unit and M.A.,

106
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:56,629
you'll start learning about the Fodmap diet and Polyols and all of the sugar alcohols and the problems that we have with those with GI distress.

107
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,940
And you could see why, like some people who have too much of the food would have too much of the sorbitol

108
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,690
it might be sensitive and how that might not go with like a fodmap diet.

109
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,620
But when I think of polyols and sorbitol cells and xylitol,

110
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,459
xylitol is a very common gum ingredient now because it's actually there's research

111
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:18,440
where it's now knows that actually can reverse dental decay rather than prevent it.

112
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,850
So it's very cool. Like the School of Dentistry has done some studies on it.

113
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,770
Bree is the name of the gum that contains xylitol, so you can usually only find it at Whole Foods and specialty stores.

114
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,770
But, you know, it's just something to think about when you're doing your think like,

115
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:38,209
oh, this 24 hour history, these patients have these types of problems.

116
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:45,800
What could I possibly learn from it? Well, you can learn actually a lot by knowing what the functional ingredients of the different foods are.

117
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:52,640
So I want to share that story. Yes, I. Shana, I have a lot of images.

118
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:00,090
Mm hmm. Just like, you know, I like to contain a lot of.

119
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,670
Yeah, but it's like. Do you think that has been said?

120
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,360
Mm hmm. Mm. Levels, those levels.

121
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,430
Because, like, your diet obviously is trying to like why.

122
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:25,250
Right. Right. Yeah. I'm not as up to date in terms of like the sugar alcohols effect on diet, on diabetes control and glycemic index and such.

123
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,440
I do know that the most successful and I don't know if Dr. Mancuso has talked about this,

124
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,729
but the most success that we've seen in the research around keto diet is around

125
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:40,520
diabetes control and whether or not that is directly related to the kind

126
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:48,950
of like substitute sugars that are placed in there or the lack of actual starch and sugar and simple sugars and processed sugars that's available.

127
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:54,049
So but sugar alcohols are kind of funny. A lot of people have very adverse effects to it.

128
00:11:54,050 --> 00:12:00,800
And you know, the other thing like from a food science standpoint that I think about when you mention like ice creams that have substitutes in them,

129
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:11,090
like primary ingredient ice cream is fat. When we go to make like lower calorie ice creams, we do what we usually do fat replacers in them.

130
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:16,130
And the fat replacers are often carbohydrate based replacements.

131
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,960
There are some that are carbohydrate based and there are some like not absorbable fats.

132
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,090
We'll talk about that in the dairy unit a little bit.

133
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:30,880
And they often, often will cause like, you know, kind of like lack of control of the bowels to the point where,

134
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:36,799
you know, you have like very greasy diarrhea that's associated with that because it just passes through your intestine.

135
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,120
It's not absorbable. So yeah, interesting.

136
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,709
All the great all of these ingredients that the food industry uses to change products,

137
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:52,100
to make them what we think are more accessible to people with specific diets, have a lot of actual problems in there.

138
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,879
But what I think was fascinating just to wrap up the food story is I think what's

139
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,890
fascinating about that is that is naturally containing sorbitol because what we always

140
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:07,700
think about as we think about sorbitol and other sugar alcohols as being ingredients

141
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,110
that are added food additives as opposed to naturally present in the product.

142
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,910
So, okay, so onto cereal grain, so cereal grains.

143
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:22,310
Shane, we're, I'm having problems with the computer here, so we're just pulling up.

144
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,360
Yeah. And we're on the cereal grain slide.

145
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,280
We're going to plow through some of these things. So the one that we didn't talk about last week was Rice.

146
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:42,170
So, so most of all, the cereal actually in the in the world is most of all, most consumed cereal grain in the world is actually rice.

147
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,590
So there's over 40,000 different.

148
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:51,520
Varieties. And what's interesting about rice is the way that it's classified is.

149
00:13:52,920 --> 00:14:02,970
By its length. So and there are three kind of general classifications of length, and that is the dimensions of its length to its width.

150
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:09,990
So in general, a long grain rice is roughly about four times as long as it is white.

151
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:16,080
So a ratio of about 4 to 1 where as opposed to a short grain rice is about 2 to 1.

152
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:21,840
I mean, you can see that when you see rice, some are kind of short and stubby and some are long and thin.

153
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:29,520
But what what what we think about in terms and we talked briefly last week about how rice is grown.

154
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,590
And when I think about rice, I think about rice being grown kind of in really soggy environments.

155
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:40,740
And you think, well, gosh, rice must thrive when it is actually when the base of it is sitting in water.

156
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:48,150
But it actually doesn't necessarily need that high level of water, but generally it is grown that way for pest control.

157
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:55,799
So if you have it sitting in water, then the pests can't get to that root because we have these highland rices that aren't sitting in water.

158
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,480
And then the most of the rice that's grown is in Asia and it's on these lowland rices that are flooded.

159
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,270
But it really is more for pest control. But it happens to actually be able to thrive in that environment, too.

160
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,620
But it's not necessary.

161
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:20,909
But the the length of the grain, which is how we classify it, also determines the glutinous nature of it or the stickiness of it.

162
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:27,719
So and that has to do with the various different AMLO's and AMLO packed and ratio ratios that are in it so long,

163
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,470
grain rice actually has more AMLO, which is less sticky.

164
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:37,560
So think about we'll do a couple of slides of starch, you know, and kind of talk about the two different types of starch.

165
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,540
AMLO and AMLO, pectin and all starches contain various different percentages of these.

166
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,360
So these long grain races are less sticky.

167
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,269
And the prices that come to mind when I think of long grain are often rices that are considered like specialty rices,

168
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:59,099
like jasmine and basmati, very aromatic. The thing that you need to know and to remember that in populations that are consuming most of

169
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,390
their rice in this long grain varieties that are like jasmine and basmati and the aromatic,

170
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,900
they're not enriched. So they generally kind of fall out of that enrichment act.

171
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:16,650
And when we think about enriching flours, which we talked about last week, which is in wheat flowers, is mandatory in the United States.

172
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,930
How do you think rice is enriched if you're consuming it in its long grain format?

173
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:30,450
Think about it from a food processing standpoint. It's a really cool application.

174
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,569
It's actually you're spraying all of the vitamins on it.

175
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:38,700
So so what it does is you process the rice, you get this beautiful long grain rice.

176
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,830
If it's not an aromatic special to rice,

177
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:49,710
then it's enriched by kind of like a thin layer of spray that goes on that and often that is actually held sometimes in like a starch matrix.

178
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:55,920
And when we think I'm going to try and like I've slides on starch, but I want to kind of integrate these starch applications throughout.

179
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:01,229
When you think about like a piece of not like a chick lit type chewing gum, but back to chewing gum.

180
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,549
If you think of a stick of chewing gum, you've noticed that it has like a little powder filament.

181
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:14,040
And often those are other spray starch applications that provide, you know, prevent stickiness, etc.

182
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,519
So so these kind of spray applications are really prevalent.

183
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,659
So yes, I know. The short range.

184
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,100
Grace. Mm hmm. Short grain rice. When you cook it in a race.

185
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,410
You're supposed to wash your rice. Uh huh. Do that.

186
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,989
Type away the enrichment. So it does. Yeah, and it can.

187
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,180
And there's lots of different schools of thought of, like,

188
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:41,760
depending upon often your ethnicity, whether or not we do that or we don't do that honestly,

189
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:49,170
like short grain rices because of the low pectin content in it tend to be stickier by nature because it really is that ratio.

190
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:54,030
And even if you were to rinse it, you're still going to get a sticky rice because the rice is what it is.

191
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,200
So enjoy. And there's a whole other category of rice that are glutinous.

192
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,399
Rice's once I was at it's not that I was buying sushi grade sticky rice and I was

193
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,200
buying glutinous rice and it's a very clear rice and it's very gummy and very pasty.

194
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,590
And that has to do also with the animals and low pectin content.

195
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:18,390
But in general, the more we talk about pasta in a couple of minutes, like a lot of people will say, like drain your pasta and then rinse it.

196
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:24,569
Well, essentially, many of the vitamins actually are coming into your water as you're boiling it.

197
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:30,480
That's why we like to make recommendations of reusing that water if you're making soups, because it is pretty vitamin and mineral rich.

198
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,180
But if there is any that's retain to that pasta and you're rinsing it, you're actually rinsing that off, too.

199
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:42,000
So my general rule of thumb is to cook the rice in the water, to keep the nutrients in there and in a rice cooker,

200
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,049
anything's being absorbed back into it because, you know, it might be negligible,

201
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:50,700
but there is would be some loss in that for those that have been sprayed,

202
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,349
because that's really the only way you're going to get the nutrients back in if you're taking off the brand in the germ,

203
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,440
kind of back to the whole grains, you know, you have to put it back in some other way.

204
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:05,790
And there's no way to in like inject a rice crown or, you know, using a needle to get those back in.

205
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:10,019
So, yeah, kind of like thoughtful sometimes cookery seems so simple,

206
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:16,860
but when we think about optimizing the number of nutrients that we want to consume, there are definitely things that we can do to optimize that.

207
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,889
So yes, there are. There are. But there are other benefits too, of like soaking grains before eating on the starters,

208
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,960
like breaking down certain things like, no, no, no, you're right.

209
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:33,770
So I know like one thing for enrichment, but I thought like, I mean, I was always taught to like,

210
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,250
I mean, ideally that all of your grains would be so before you look at them.

211
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:45,030
So we talked a lot. So if we think back to one of the conversations we had last week with fighting acid,

212
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:51,719
so when we soak grains that contain phytic acid, we actually we we decrease the amount of acid in there.

213
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,400
So that is one reason you can soak things to sprout them.

214
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:01,650
You know, from a nutritional standpoint, the primary purpose for soaking is really just to decrease cooking time.

215
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,340
So by soaking them, you can also decrease the amount of cooking time.

216
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,190
And it also depends, you know, it really depends upon what are you doing with the water that it's soaking in.

217
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:20,100
So if you're soaking beans, so if you have dried beans to purposes for soaking those dried beans want if you want to soak them overnight,

218
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:27,400
it will decrease the cooking time, but it also can decrease the amount of flatulence that people experience by, you know,

219
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,530
kind of decreasing some of those chemicals to start to break it down so that

220
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,999
your body doesn't have to use the enzymes to work as hard to break it down.

221
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,670
So exactly easier. It's almost like you have the enzymatic process that's starting and starting in the soaking process.

222
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:46,139
So then. Right, I mean you still, like many of these products,

223
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,310
still will have resistant starches in them that one way or the other a body is not going to

224
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:55,170
absorb and they're going to be metabolized into short chain fatty acids in our large intestine.

225
00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:00,749
But it can ease the process and kind of ease ease the digestion in some ways.

226
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,469
Yeah, it's also but it's time consuming too. So I mean,

227
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:09,000
the other grain that we didn't really talk about last week in terms of this

228
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,360
will come up and it will come up when we're talking about egg replacements.

229
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,790
Do specifically in your recipe where you're going to be modifying a recipe into a vegan recipe.

230
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,260
But, you know, there there's a debate about whether or not we should rinse quinoa.

231
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,700
You know, so Keene was known, mentioned it briefly last week to have some opponents in it,

232
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:33,059
which are these soapy substances that sometimes cause a bitter taste and also caused some indigestion.

233
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,950
So most of the quinoa that we have is already rinse those that you're going to get packaged.

234
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:45,479
But if you're buying it in any kind of bulk, it hasn't been. So also, if you're rinsing that, that gets rid of the high tech acid that's in it, too.

235
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,810
So again, it's like that's that debate. That's why when we talk about fighting acid, we talk about the good, the evil, you know,

236
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:58,860
and then kind of like the benefits of that and definitely the consuming foods that are rich and fight against it.

237
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:05,820
The benefits outweigh that any type of risk of nutrients that might be found in that unavailable.

238
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,220
And one big thing we didn't talk about last week,

239
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:14,160
that is we talked about there seem to be a big increase in the availability of heavy metals that are in some of our foods.

240
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:20,550
Whether or not that's from growing industrial pollution that settles in soils processes that.

241
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,530
You know, might involve chemical equipment in plants.

242
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:31,750
That that is one really good thing about fighting acids is not only do they bind the minerals that we don't want found that we want available,

243
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,170
but they will bind also like lead and cadmium.

244
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:41,170
And there has there was some, you know, if anybody has done any research or work with anybody in the Flint water crisis.

245
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:45,040
But, you know, we talk about mitigation of lead toxicity, you know,

246
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:51,370
and there was some thought about like foods that are really rich and fight with acid to bind some of that lead.

247
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:56,860
But that would be only working if it's binding in your intestine as opposed to binding throughout your bloodstream.

248
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:05,630
Okay. Okay. So. So basic gist of the grains here is how it's measured.

249
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:10,700
The difference in the Amazon, the AMLO packed in polished rice.

250
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,860
You know, definitely removing the brand and the germ.

251
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:19,850
And obviously the various different cooking times will vary depending upon whether or not it's a whole grain or not.

252
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,640
So most of the U.S. rice is enriched with iron and B vitamins that are spray coated.

253
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,300
So we did cover that. So one thing that I always like to kind of take, so going on to the next slide of how do I help my client?

254
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:39,110
So, you know, I want you to be able to think about what you read last week, kind of the importance of whole grains in the diet.

255
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,460
Hopefully everybody had a chance to listen to the gastro pod episode, the whole the wheat versus white.

256
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:51,200
Any immediate feedback from that? That was the one I mentioned last week that I actually had as a required reading.

257
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,639
I think from a public health standpoint, I really like that podcast.

258
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,110
Thought about it good, bad, indifferent. Yes, I like that thought.

259
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,530
I'm kind of shopping because like growing up talk about the history you.

260
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:10,000
Um. I don't know. I guess also like being from Washington and hearing him talk about WSU.

261
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:17,490
Mhm. Like, uh, the politics and all the wheat and everything that's grown out there is kind of cool to hear about.

262
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,180
Yeah, I know it's there, but. Right, right, right.

263
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:28,380
I learned about it. Yeah. So anything else, anything else in the podcast that kind of resonated with you?

264
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,199
I always think of podcasts and books like that.

265
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,420
If I'm still thinking about it in the shower or on a walk a couple of days later, that it's really powerful or meaningful.

266
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,910
Anybody else have anything that stuck with them?

267
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:47,520
Can you just like the reversal of how white bread was like a luxury item and like queen and for the wealthy again.

268
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,330
Yeah. Like the. Yeah. And then it just, like, reverse it.

269
00:24:51,330 --> 00:25:00,490
Not like it's the opposite. Where the wealthy, like, these, like, are just, like, artisan loaves with, like, all this whole grain crunch and.

270
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,899
Right. That was kind of the opposite. Yeah. Yeah.

271
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,380
And it also it's like, okay, we can build these loans, but are people going to eat them?

272
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:13,140
I thought that was also like, what is the practical implications of that?

273
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,050
Like, people still want sliced bread. They still want to have.

274
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:22,200
I mean, I know when I treat myself and go to Zingerman's for a loaf of bread, I'm not going to get the bread that has the big holes in it,

275
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,240
because if I want to use that for sandwich bread, my toppings are going to fall through,

276
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,550
you know, so like some, some things like that have to be considered.

277
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,160
I thought the all of the eugenics and the immigration issues were really very interesting in that.

278
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:41,070
So if you haven't had I know what you guys don't always get a chance to do your required reading before I that's

279
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:48,389
definitely worth it as is the whole grain article you know for future use because I kind of want to teach you about this,

280
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,830
but I also want you to apply it.

281
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:56,460
So kind of going, going back to that in terms of like what you could do with your clients, you know, in terms of increasing.

282
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:03,570
I just have some some tips here. We don't do enough talking about the whole grain stamp.

283
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,130
So you can actually click on that and that takes you to the whole grain website.

284
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,920
It's somewhat confusing because there's so many different stamps out there and it is not mandatory.

285
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,409
So you might not see it on all products,

286
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:22,530
but for those manufacturers that really want to talk about the amount of whole grains they have, they use that.

287
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,559
So I think it's also like when you think about, okay,

288
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,090
why did I have you watch the grocery store video I'll so you're doing that one day and you want

289
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:36,270
to teach clients in the bread aisle how to consume like the bread that has the most whole grain.

290
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,439
People just think if it says, oh, it says wheat flour in it, that must be it.

291
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,570
So, I mean, I think educating people about ingredients, educating people about the amount of fiber,

292
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:52,950
knowing that fiber recommendations are changing and the way we label fiber, teaching people really simple things like how to read a label.

293
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:59,250
So you have to be able to kind of know it yourself and then, you know,

294
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,760
just again like thinking about like easy substitutions, the familiar with the unfamiliar.

295
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,499
We're going to keep using that as we try and introduce new foods.

296
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:13,670
So simple things like, you know, like how would I substitute a white rice for maybe a barley?

297
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,989
And what does that give me nutritionally, again,

298
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:22,500
like exposing people to these minor substitutions that actually they might get more nutrients from them.

299
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,840
So just keep going back to that. When we do a little break out later, I'm going to go on to the pasta slide here.

300
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,610
Also, I want you somebody had a really good question.

301
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:36,959
I can't remember who asked it over here like it might have been.

302
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:44,070
Jackie, like I said, if somebody had said, like, I struggle with knowing what a serving size is, remember we had that question.

303
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:50,070
So when you're when you're going, when you're creating your nutrition facts label, like something that completely slipped my mind.

304
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:55,889
And then the answer to that and again, building on curriculum, when you think back to community nutrition,

305
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,760
you talk probably a lot about in your needs assessment about the dietary guidelines.

306
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,030
So we know that there are dietary guidelines for 2020 to 2025.

307
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,959
Most people only read the first couple pages of those guideline guidelines,

308
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,060
but that PDF document and I have it linked later in the PowerPoint is hundreds of pages long,

309
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,200
but in the appendix always think about the resources that you have.

310
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:23,159
So in the appendix it talks about energy requirements for various different age groups, macronutrient distribution.

311
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,360
It can be really broad, but depending upon activity level and age group.

312
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,959
So always think of that as a resource, put it in your back pocket.

313
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:41,550
And when you're thinking about something like a one pot meal for dinner and you want to get like an average amount of calorie distribution,

314
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:49,050
you know, you have to say, okay, my intended client as a 24 year old man and he might need X amount of calories.

315
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:52,260
So what percentage does this one pot dinner give?

316
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,320
And then that can be your serving size again.

317
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,939
Serving sizes vary depending upon appetites and how many meals people eat a day.

318
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,170
So but so there is a little bit of subjectivity, but always think about what.

319
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,649
Are the tools that you have for an objective evaluation. Okay.

320
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,490
So go back to that. So let's go on to pasta.

321
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,160
There are these two really great videos.

322
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:22,960
I'm not going to take class time here to go through them, but one that is kind of coming out of some engineering shape shifting pasta.

323
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:29,429
Now, if you've seen that, there's a whole part of culinary nutrition called molecular gastronomy,

324
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:36,239
so which is basically taking foods that you wouldn't normally think about and changing them

325
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,420
so that you have culinary applications that would be seen in very expensive restaurants.

326
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,850
Let me give you an example. So there's this process called Spheeris verification.

327
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:55,950
So basically when you think about something like caviar, it's like little round balls of fish eggs or roe.

328
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:01,530
And let's say you want to change the application with something like melon juice.

329
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:07,079
So you take like a melon juice and you put a particular ingredient in it to bind it,

330
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:13,920
and then you kind of push it out through these extrusion holes that create little bubbles, almost like tapioca, and it's orange.

331
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,520
And you put it on top of something where people, as they eat it, might think, Oh,

332
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,969
it's going to be salty and a little crunchy like a fish egg, but it's really an application of melon on top of that.

333
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:31,080
So it changes the way you think about things. So it's not something like in the realm of public health that we think about,

334
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:36,090
but you can't like talk about culinary science without thinking of molecular gastronomy.

335
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,640
So it's there's all different types of applications. We'll talk a little bit more about it later.

336
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:50,870
But one of the applications is in this pasta video where it basically like they have a lab that's creating pasta that just the minute you touch it,

337
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,140
it's how we kind of think about like starch, starches that have been gelatinous.

338
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:03,540
But the minute it touches water, it changes shapes and then like it can go into water and then curl around little pieces of,

339
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,860
like, caviar, and then you take it out and all of a sudden you have pasta with caviar in it.

340
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:15,209
It's a little like elitist, I guess I would say, but it's very interesting technology.

341
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,450
So take a couple minutes to look at that in your free time.

342
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,780
It's only about a four minute video and you can watch it at one and a half speed.

343
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:28,800
And then also, just like the serial videos that I find, I could go down a rabbit hole with them making pasta videos.

344
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:38,670
So but I think it's important principles to know about in the food industry, about how extrusion works, how batters work, how something simple.

345
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:45,809
Talking about pasta, all pasta is made from durum wheat. We I think I showed you an example and I have one here of what semolina is.

346
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:48,810
So semolina is the flour that's made from durum wheat.

347
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,739
Why do we use durum wheat for pasta? It has a higher protein content.

348
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:58,680
We'll get into that a little bit, but it also has this beautiful yellow color because of the carotenoid pigments that are in there,

349
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:05,430
which actually provide more antioxidants also. And it just has really nice workability because of that high protein.

350
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:10,080
It can be extruded through these shapes and it can be dried really nicely.

351
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,330
Pasta in its fresh format obviously has a much higher water content in it.

352
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:22,650
But what all pasta is done in order for it to be shelf stable and there's basically no expiration date of something like

353
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:30,120
pasta because when we think about food safety and a lot of it has to do with the water content and pastas dried to 12%.

354
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:36,159
So once it's dried to 12%, then the water is on a bit unavailable for bacteria and it's never going to go bad really.

355
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,260
You can sit on your shelf forever. So those are kind of the important things to think about.

356
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,200
Pasta as another grain always made from durum wheat.

357
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:50,940
Remember, wheat is classified by the season that it's grown and the hard versus softness nature of it and the color of it.

358
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:58,320
So it's usually I think it's usually like a a hard oh, let's see.

359
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:04,139
Oh, no, it's a it's a spring wheat that's grown a hard variety of spring wheat with the high protein content.

360
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,490
So and it's also like when we talk about different types of flowers,

361
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,660
the purposes of the flowers are basically based upon the protein contents of them.

362
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:21,809
So this type of durum wheat that's used for taste is a 13% protein, which is very similar to bread, which has this great gluten development.

363
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:29,700
And we don't develop pasta dough in the same way that we would develop bread dough, but we also don't add yeast to it also.

364
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:34,980
And the simplest manifestations of pasta are basically just the flour in the water.

365
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:42,690
You know, that you can add things like beet puree and spinach puree, right, to kind of enrich it and to fortify it with more nutrients.

366
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:49,770
But the only other thing to kind of keep in mind from a food science standpoint is like the terminology noodle.

367
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:54,090
So the FDA actually has regulations over whether or not you can use the term noodle.

368
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:58,980
And the term noodle can only be used if it's about 5.5% egg products in it.

369
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,990
So you can find you can find egg free noodles.

370
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,950
But the packaging has to say egg free because you can't technically use the word

371
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:12,149
noodle if it doesn't have egg in it and most pasta doesn't have egg in it.

372
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:19,559
That's being sold on the shelves. But where you can buy them are like kind of like I think of them as soup noodles that are common.

373
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,210
They're often added to like things like matzo ball soup and other chicken soups that are actually made with eggs.

374
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,230
So just know that that's kind of the way the FDA regulates that.

375
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:35,250
I mean, I grew up saying the word noodle as opposed to saying the word pasta, but you can't technically say it if it doesn't have eggs.

376
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,150
All right. So I think that's pretty much all.

377
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:48,180
But just take some time. The other thing is so durum wheat flour is also for those of you, anybody, a pizza baker at home.

378
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:52,770
Yeah. So do you ever use semolina when you're actually making pizza on a stone?

379
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:56,819
No, I use for real. Okay.

380
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,760
So kind of similar to that. So semolina can be ground into different coarseness.

381
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:09,959
That coarseness and the finer the finer particles are used for the pasta making, but more coarse is not used for passing.

382
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,050
It's used for coating things and bread products to prevent sticking, kind of much like you would do your cornmeal.

383
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,160
So. So that's another application of it. So okay.

384
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,400
So moving on here to this flour slide.

385
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:31,560
So what I just wanted to show you here, I think this is from Food and Nutrition magazine from quite a while ago, but nothing has changed.

386
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:36,270
And just like we talked about last week, by definition, flour is a finely ground grain.

387
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,330
But we know that flour can be made from any starch, you know,

388
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:46,800
specifically nuts like almonds in terms of like people who make macaroons now claims they are mostly made from almond flour.

389
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:57,660
So some other other than wheat, really popular flour mixtures are those that are made from tubers such as potatoes.

390
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:03,260
And potatoes are kind of interesting also in the different types of starch that they have in them.

391
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:14,010
We'll talk about that in a minute. And what you know, the tubers are actually defined botanically by the thickened portion of the underground stem.

392
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:19,020
So we'll talk more about kind of these definitions in plants and vegetables.

393
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:26,640
But it's these underground portions that actually of the stem that are called tubers where the store starch is actually stored in them.

394
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:34,829
Some of those would be like yams, potatoes, cassava, Acoma Jerusalem, artichokes and arrowroot.

395
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:38,310
Arrowroot is one of the prime examples of that.

396
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:44,250
We know that other flowers are made from cereal grains like we talked about, primarily wheat.

397
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:51,870
And then the reason why some of you took maybe the chickpea rice that I offered last week

398
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,519
is because that's an example of how legumes are ground into different types of flour.

399
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,809
So just keep that in mind.

400
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:06,389
Kind of get even though we're talking about content of nutrients based upon the utilization of wheat and wheat flour specifically for baked goods,

401
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:12,750
know that there are all these different applications of them. So the next slide is about milling of flour.

402
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,739
And I what what I really liked, there was a nice description.

403
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:22,559
I don't need to go into a lot of detail in the podcast that you listen to about how milling has changed and how

404
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:29,040
milling actually controls the availability of the different types of wheat and flowers that are grown nationally.

405
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,919
And it used to be all of this was done by hand. It was basically two stones that ground together,

406
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:44,010
and there was a hole that actually the wheat berry like I showed you and I still have the wheat very here would actually be like, this is over a week.

407
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,130
And these are the wheat that's gram.

408
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,549
Here's one wheat very here. You know, these wheat varies would be poured in.

409
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:55,530
The two stones would kind of go together. It would actually break it into smaller, coarser pieces.

410
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:04,139
And the more you wanted it ground, then, the more you would you would operate that stone that all kind of changed to like these milling centers,

411
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:10,320
which were usually by rivers, because you would use water as a source to run actually the mill and to grind the flour.

412
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,829
And we've come back to some of this like hand grinding.

413
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:20,909
So some people actually will do this in their home where they actually take the wheat berries that they buy in bulk and grind them.

414
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:28,370
But it's not as efficient. And then what ends up happening is when you have all these pieces that are on ground, what they do is, you know,

415
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,420
what we're trying to do in bread making is, you know,

416
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:35,370
we're trying to create these beautiful little pockets that can hold air and make it light and fresh.

417
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:39,719
But if you are using a whole wheat bread that has that germ and that brand in it,

418
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,680
those are going to like actually poke those pockets so that you can't retain that.

419
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,919
So that's why products that are whole grain tend to be somewhat problematic in terms of bread baking,

420
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,730
because you'll get a denser low in a loaf as opposed to a fluffier loaf.

421
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,860
I thought it was pretty fascinating.

422
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:03,810
At the end of the podcast, he talks about how long it took to perfect a whole a true whole wheat crescent and the deliciousness.

423
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,530
I thought that was kind of interesting because that can't be something that's easy.

424
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,050
Because usually a course that would be made with a very fine pastry flour instead of a whole wheat flour.

425
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:17,700
So. So this is kind of like the old fashioned way of milling flour.

426
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:22,440
And then if you move to the next slide, this is actually how flour is milled.

427
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:30,180
And I think I think what I like to point out in this particular diagram, if you look under the label of it and then underneath it,

428
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,830
it says a simplified diagram, while this diagram does look anything but simple to me.

429
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:40,830
So to break it up into like five easy steps. So we're obviously not really using the stone.

430
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,910
We're not using these beautiful mills that are on water sources anymore.

431
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:48,960
It's all been mechanized and it's been mechanized and broken into like five steps.

432
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,520
And just to simplify that for you, even more than this simplified diagram here,

433
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,510
it's like, well, break, it was a little break or the brand in the germ or reboot.

434
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,040
And one of the main technologies that happened after breaking because you think about like

435
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,200
those stones that you would send it through would really break that grout or that wheat berry.

436
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,590
But what became like a really in the Industrial Revolution,

437
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:15,990
what became actually really fascinating is just the simple invention of really gentle fans.

438
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:22,350
So the next step after breaking is called purifying because they're still really fine layers of brand that are there.

439
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:28,500
So the purifier would blow air to kind of, you know, think about the weight of things and those brands are lighter weight.

440
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,650
So that would push the brand out of the way to purify it more.

441
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,349
And then you would reduce it so you would grind more so that you wouldn't have it.

442
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,179
You get all the brand out of the way, hopefully all the germ out of the way.

443
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,990
You have different channels where you're sorting that to sell it, to package differently,

444
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,930
and then you're purifying it anymore so that you have like a fine stream and then you start sifting it.

445
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:56,790
And, you know, I like before I started teaching food science, I never really thought a heck of a lot about these little growths, you know,

446
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:04,650
and when you think about the tiny little germ that's inside of it and then all of the endosperm that comes in after the brand and it's so little,

447
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:08,550
but there are different layers of the endosperm if you look at it under a microscope

448
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,440
and the different layers of the endosperm actually have different protein content.

449
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:21,089
And then that protein contents of those flours of the endosperm flours actually sorted in different directions for different

450
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:28,460
purposes because the protein contents of the flour determines how you're going to use that flour in baking or cooking.

451
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:35,430
So, so there's like there's different types of flours that like the first and the second runs are of higher quality.

452
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:44,430
The endosperm flour that's closer to the germ actually has higher protein content as opposed to that's on the outside of the ENDOSPERM.

453
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:49,259
So all of that is known and used in sifting these different flours.

454
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:56,700
And then even after they're sifted, they're recombined to give you the protein content of a particular flour and then labeled in that way.

455
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:06,750
So, so that. So those five steps are break, purify, reduce, sift and then classify.

456
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:12,419
Okay. And then that leaves you with this, which is, you know, last week when I sent the actual examples.

457
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:21,560
So basically these are six different pictures that show different steps in the processing of wheat.

458
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:26,340
So a I mean, anybody know what a so remember this is a wheat.

459
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:34,470
What would a be? What a would be like the bury, the groat, the actual whole grain.

460
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:38,550
And now we're going. We're kind of like going down in the classification.

461
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,940
Then B is if you would sift off the.

462
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:51,440
What do you think is? Remember, there's three components of a wheat berry.

463
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:55,340
There's bran germ and endosperm. So what is B?

464
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:05,780
B is bran C is the fat soluble part, which is that the fat containing is germ, right?

465
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:13,510
D. So this is the start of the end of sperm, but it still has that little bit of bran in it.

466
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:22,390
E again would be like another one of those flows where you're getting a little bit more of the branched off of it.

467
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:26,410
And that would be like fine white flour that doesn't have any bran or germ.

468
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:34,500
So those are the way. So, so like E and F would be sorted differently depending upon their purposes and how you would label them.

469
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:39,370
So just so that, you know that, um, let's see if there's anything else.

470
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,130
O The other thing that I want to say and I do have,

471
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:51,400
we can look at these during the break in about 5 minutes is what historically when flour was milled,

472
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,990
it actually is milled and it has a lot of the pigmentation in it.

473
00:43:56,350 --> 00:44:00,850
And then usually what ended up happening is that fresh flour that was milled would sit for a long

474
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:07,059
period of time and would oxidize and it would whiten as we started using more like consolidating,

475
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:14,260
having less milling places that we and using more flour and having industrialized bread we needed.

476
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:18,610
We did have the space where all that flour could sit and be oxidized.

477
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:25,770
So and the reason why you want it to sit is freshly milled flour isn't as good for using in baked goods,

478
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,000
so it doesn't have the properties that we need.

479
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:34,870
So now as you're thinking about the one of the big projects that we're going to do in the semester coming up in the next month,

480
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,580
which is the food additive project,

481
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:44,140
I want to kind of direct you to starting to look at flour packages that you have because there's a myriad of various different

482
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:54,820
additives that are in flour packages that can actually promote kind of the the usability of the various different flours.

483
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:00,250
And there are some flowers that are always bleached and some that we don't bleach at all.

484
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:02,800
And usually the finer flours, like a cake,

485
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:09,940
flour and pastry flours tend to be bleached because it actually makes for a finer product and a more workable product.

486
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:16,360
So so I just want you to take pay some attention to the various different every country bleach.

487
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:22,300
Some countries don't bleach their flour at all. Every country that does bleach their flour.

488
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:28,610
Bleaches them different ways depending upon the chemicals that are and are not approved.

489
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:32,120
Historically, Bromate has been used as a bleaching agent.

490
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,160
Just like sweeteners,

491
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:41,030
some sweeteners are approved in Canada and some sweeteners are approved in the United States for various different cancer causing properties.

492
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,479
It's the same way for bleaching our flower in general.

493
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,630
Now most flower in the United States is bleached using gases, using specifically chlorine gas.

494
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:59,600
So that's the way it is. It retained within the flower, but it's used to bleach it to make it a better flower.

495
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:07,370
And then there's a lot of other like dough conditioners and other things that are used mostly in industrial flower that's used for bread making.

496
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:13,850
Did you have a question. So I mean it was almost everything is blanched.

497
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:17,660
Mhm. So is blanching. That's similar to.

498
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:26,690
No, no, no blanching is really it's it's almost like a well when we think about different products are blanched in different ways,

499
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:31,400
but the typical way of blanching would be actually to immerse it in hot water.

500
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:39,259
So just to kind of soften it so in some ways and to change the flavor of it as opposed to roasting it.

501
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,649
So the outer part of the almond, right.

502
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:47,950
So it's like certain almond flour skins. Yeah. The skin is removed and the common meal has the skin.

503
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:50,550
Yeah, yeah, right, right.

504
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:59,000
And so like some people don't like that and that can also interfere with so, so in the blanching of the, of, of that type of flower,

505
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,479
especially if you're using it for like the fine purposes of a macaron,

506
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,770
you would not want the outer layer on it because it could interfere with the development.

507
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:11,780
So yeah, but that is not bleaching. Bleaching is really only related to flowers.

508
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:16,910
So why do we bleach felt like I feel like that's weird with chlorine, like that's weird, right?

509
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:21,430
Or no like that. It just seems like the chemical would would somehow stand.

510
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:28,010
Yeah. I mean when they look at like the, the particles that are available of chlorine after the product has been bleached,

511
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,140
it actually, you know, the the assumption is that they're airborne and they're not present in there.

512
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:38,150
And you will see even on the labeling, those that are bleached it often like this,

513
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:42,290
this gold metal flower will say it's enriched, it's bleach, it's pre sifted.

514
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:47,780
And then if you look at the ingredients on here, it will not tell you what it's bleached with.

515
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:53,270
It just says bleached wheat flour. This one actually has malted barley flour in it.

516
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,180
And then it talks about the vitamins that are enriched in it.

517
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:01,310
I have another slide where my talk a little bit more about the details of the various different additives in there.

518
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:07,610
And there's a lot of school of schools of thought about whether or not people want to consume bleached versus like there's a lot of

519
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:15,139
bakers out there that will only use like the King Arthur on bleached flowers because they feel like it makes for a better product.

520
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:20,240
Whereas those that are working mostly with fine, delicate pastries will only use the bleach flour.

521
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:29,749
So, yeah, it's, it's, it's and the reason why, I mean, we definitely could do a whole class on the additives that are available,

522
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:34,010
but the reason why I throw it out there is because it sparks awesome like here,

523
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:39,260
like curiosity as to why it's used and what is it safety and what is the evidence around it.

524
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,780
And that can be really that can be used to build a really beautiful white paper where you can kind of take a deeper

525
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:49,160
dove into it because there are so many food additives that we don't have the time to do that with all of them.

526
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:54,710
So the next let's see.

527
00:48:55,610 --> 00:49:00,200
Oh yeah, this is the great this is where I'm going to start before our break out here, before we take a little bit break.

528
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:05,059
So this is a really good so the next is just a picture of all the various different slides because what I've been

529
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:11,630
eluding to all the time is the various different protein contents and the way we treat flowers for different purposes.

530
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:17,570
So most importantly, the difference in the is the protein content in these which dictates its purposes.

531
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:28,340
So not all of the ranges are set in stone because it really depends upon the company and the type of wheat that's being used for the protein content.

532
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:35,930
But in general, the the flour that actually would have the highest protein would be what's called vital wheat gluten flour,

533
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:42,080
which is often used to actually add to a product to increase the protein.

534
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:48,620
But where you also see this utilized is in in products like Saturn PSI.

535
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:51,740
And so which is a protein substitute.

536
00:49:52,070 --> 00:50:01,310
It's often used in school lunch meal programs to to kind of like bulk up beef and to reduce the cost because it's a good protein substitute.

537
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:06,319
So that's where you'll see that. Then when we move on to the different category.

538
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:17,240
So whole wheat flour, which has the brand and the and the and the brand and the germ intact, has a range of protein from about 11 to 15%.

539
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:22,250
And it works better in things like recipes that I would say are heartier.

540
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:29,550
So things like. Carrot cakes and crackers and ginger breads where that color is a little browner, but it can be hidden in those recipes.

541
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:38,610
Bread. Flour generally has a protein level of 12 to 14%, so it kind of overlaps with that whole wheat flour.

542
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:42,990
And it's usually made out of hard red or hard white or these blends.

543
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,770
And again, it's best for like bagels and dinner rolls and breads.

544
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:55,139
You would not want to take a bread flour and make a crescent out of that because the gluten is dependent upon the protein content.

545
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:58,290
And the higher protein content would not make for a really tender product.

546
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:05,009
Most of the flour that we have on our shelf and these two examples are what's called all purpose and off brand.

547
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:11,430
And then like the classic gold medal brand and all purpose flowers are about 9 to 12% and they're the most versatile.

548
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:15,990
And you can actually take an all purpose flour. If you have that at home, you can make bread out of it.

549
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:22,080
It might it might not have the same gluten development as the bread flour would, but it's doable.

550
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:26,219
Then we kind of go down another notch and protein content, we are pastry flour,

551
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:31,620
which is about 8 to 9% protein, and it's usually used only by professional bakers.

552
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:40,290
But you can find like a Bob's Red Mill brand, and you use this when a baked good needs structure, but you also want it to be delicate.

553
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:44,880
We don't want that gluten development and that would be like tarts and cookies.

554
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:52,320
And then kind of the the finest would be a cake flour, which is that swan's down and that's about 7 to 8%.

555
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:58,980
It is milled from the innermost part of the wheat. It has the highest starch, the lowest protein.

556
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:06,450
You can buy it bleached and unbleached. But the bleaching does make for the lightest cakes because what it actually does is it

557
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:12,629
weakens the gluten and it lowers the page and that provides you with a finer texture crime.

558
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:16,050
So it's all chemically related by the bleaching, actually.

559
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:21,690
You know, that's why a lot of the bread flowers are not breached, bleached, because we don't want the gluten to be weakened.

560
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:30,450
We want it to be strong. Other things that you'll find on the shelf, self-rising flour, self-rising flour kind of came about in the south.

561
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:34,079
And basically what it is, it has the leavening agent and salt added to it.

562
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:39,059
So it usually has baking powder, baking soda and salt added to it.

563
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:47,520
So you don't have to add it already. Most people aren't using it, but a biscuit people who make biscuits will swear by using that.

564
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:52,830
And then in terms of like the starch and the the kind of pretreatment of flours,

565
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:55,770
there's another flour that you might see on the market called one draw.

566
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:04,139
And one is a flour that has actually been treated so that when you mix it with water and you want to make a gravy out of it,

567
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:08,850
it makes it very quick, very smooth. Very is a very powerful, thickening agent.

568
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,400
So that's another type of flour.

569
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:18,000
So I don't know if you've ever paid attention to those of you that maybe don't bake a lot or don't have like a lot of various different,

570
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:25,319
you know, experience with baking. But there's a myriad of different flours out there and they do have different purposes.

571
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:31,709
And it's really important in terms of food science. So I'm just going to take 2 minutes here because this is a slide where I have

572
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:35,250
just a little bit more information about different ingredients and flour.

573
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:40,320
So like I mentioned earlier, Bromate was used until the early 1990s.

574
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:49,620
So this is one of those examples where millers in Canada stop using it after health concerns raised by the FDA in the United States.

575
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:53,009
Bromate is allowed in some states, but it's banned and other.

576
00:53:53,010 --> 00:54:00,240
So the regulations really vary. So which makes it very confusing depending upon where you live, if you're concerned about it.

577
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:05,430
Another ingredient that you might see in flours is called ADA and some of our students.

578
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,200
It's a Zodiac Powerbomb car bomb and car dynamite.

579
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:15,870
That's a mouthful. But it's been approved in the United States since 1962, but it's banned in Europe.

580
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:20,190
So ADA falls under the food additives permitted in Canada.

581
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:27,750
So it's a fast acting flour treatment and it results in this cohesive dry dole that tolerates high water absorption.

582
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:33,420
So that's why manufacturers would use that. There's amino acids that are used as dough conditioners.

583
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:38,489
The one popular one is l16. It speeds up reactions within the dough.

584
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:42,050
So basically everybody's impatient. You want the reactions to happen fast.

585
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:49,380
You want your bread to, you know, proof quickly. So when you're manufacturing and you want a quick proof, you might add that to it.

586
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,680
Simple things like ascorbic acid are actually added, which will also alter the page.

587
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:01,560
It was noted that actually old lemon juice added to dough gave better results because it improved the gas retention.

588
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:09,390
We want gas retention because we want to have this light, airy crumb, other additives, calcium peroxide.

589
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:15,120
It's another dough maturing agent that you might find various different glisser rides.

590
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,990
There are multipurpose additives that are used in cake mixes and yeast doughs.

591
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,710
They're also known as surfactants. So they.

592
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:26,339
Have these surface acting agents and inbred dose.

593
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:33,480
Their main function is a crumb softening agent, and that relates to breads daily so that bread doesn't go stale.

594
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:39,300
So lots of different things that are added that you may never see in the ingredient list,

595
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:44,670
but they do exist in some of the industrial manufacturing of various different mostly breads.

596
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:53,640
Yeah, but that's why. Oh, so that is, that was actually just some notes that I'll share with you that are on the flour slide.

597
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,120
So yeah. Just have this. Yeah, yeah, I'll put that,

598
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:02,130
I'll put the notes in there for you so that you can have those and you can look those up in case you want to use them for food additives.

599
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:06,240
I mean, I usually take notes in the PowerPoint are able to upload.

600
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:11,580
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can definitely upload if that's easier for you.

601
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:15,150
I can upload that. So so why don't we take a break, guys?

602
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:25,049
Take a break and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about like gluten and gluten development and the various different leavening agents.

603
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:28,980
I want to make sure we spend some time on that before you go next week in separate class.

604
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:35,920
So. Two things I really want to show that blueberry pie.

605
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:41,660
She's losing her mind. I love that.

606
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:49,350
She's like the next. No, no, it's okay.

607
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:56,580
I really can't. It was supposed to happen next Friday, but I'm going to do that.

608
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:02,680
I'm sorry. Okay.

609
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:12,150
Everyone else is doing the original time, which is why I said it was ten.

610
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:20,280
But like I said, I was looking at the following.

611
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:24,560
You know, you're not stupid.

612
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:33,830
That's. There you go. It's not a398 this like 078.

613
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:44,750
Yeah. I used to send away from me for that. Yeah. So like for the so yeah I got, I have to go.

614
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,590
So I'm going to set it up two years after that.

615
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:59,060
It just has to be there to put everybody on the same page over there.

616
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,720
Are you not going to be very helpful to my age. Okay.

617
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:10,669
So, so like I think like it is in the sweet.

618
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:19,130
Yeah. Just like now and then maybe my favorite but it's going to be in the community will be kind of to make sure your

619
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:29,220
audience meets the thing that I mean that's like basically where we are at a certain Central Park is not fair.

620
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:37,960
Okay. So it was really great to talk with her, though.

621
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:49,370
I just love working with her. I wish I knew what I wanted, you know?

622
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:53,900
So Instagram around. What have you said?

623
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:59,530
Well, yeah, yeah.

624
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:03,250
It's I feel like the guy is going to contribute here. 8000. Yes.

625
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:06,910
I didn't know that. I thought it was 11,000 flags.

626
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:13,370
Right. Well, yeah. So I have no idea where about 11.

627
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:18,290
Maybe a mindset explosion somewhere like asking Palgrave or.

628
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:22,940
You know what? Oh, my gosh. Yeah, I think so.

629
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:30,190
All I have is an 8000 enough number and a bit that's going out to.

630
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:41,510
Oh, yeah, well that's a little bit more than one I think.

631
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:46,130
Oh, not another. No. I'm so happy to come up with a thousand.

632
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:57,379
So I will share this. I was like, I have all of those notes on like this further down, I have all the notes on the various different avenues.

633
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:12,590
So I will share that with all-purpose heavy food items, temperatures awesome cold and have all of them and I still can't get an ice cream I found.

634
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:19,280
I wanted to bring this up because I wanted us to all watch the gluten development slide ourselves.

635
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,700
So I'm a bit into a healing word for a drink ago and that relaxes me.

636
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:31,580
So I like options. So I was wondering like like how do I sign in with my stories?

637
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:38,509
All these different things. Like one of the more effective is not the need for the new perfect kids to be so perfect.

638
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:48,860
You know, I feel like is a problem. And the weirdest thing I think it goes back to go back to like, why do we need it to be so white and perfect?

639
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:57,830
I don't like where it is the same. Or the other thing I think is like it kind of goes too far in perfect truth, you know, like fruits don't have to,

640
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:06,800
like, smell like your whole life or the fact that we are just happens to be a shape, right?

641
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:19,380
Yeah. You know, I think that I think that the important thing to note is that, I mean, I grew up in a family where we only eight day old stuff.

642
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:28,280
Yeah, right. Right. Like, sounds like a lot more like.

643
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:32,580
Oh, like. Scotland is going to have to take time off.

644
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:35,010
Right. Was a little brown. Right.

645
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:43,560
I want you to think about all the places you ever gone to, like the grocery store with their clothes and the produce and the soul.

646
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:48,090
And some of that does go to places like that.

647
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:52,250
And then there's organizing right now, helping out.

648
01:01:52,770 --> 01:02:02,240
I mean, when it's mature, what they often do is like, I'll take the same channels from various radio stations and I'll open them all at once.

649
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,200
They like that for their spouses,

650
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:10,980
and that's just kind of the positive ones out because the first one will continue to gather and then those package them like,

651
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,660
you know, and not the way that. Right.

652
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:30,920
And so I don't try to do or I don't I probably don't want to pay $5 to some six people right now.

653
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:35,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

654
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:42,930
You know, even it's almost like I'm like, I don't know if I need.

655
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:47,640
Okay, so I didn't get everybody must safely be over at Zingerman's because I didn't get any.

656
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:53,070
Are you guys all set for your carpooling groups for next week?

657
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:56,160
Everybody a chance to look at the document for document.

658
01:02:56,220 --> 01:03:00,430
You have an item I know I will chat with.

659
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:03,270
I love document. So but I think he forgot.

660
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:11,850
So so you guys should definitely you don't have an exhibit usually he does his exams take all right or you don't have an exam.

661
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:18,890
Oh, I would. I think it's like, oh, okay.

662
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,399
I thought maybe it's not taken, but I think you can log in remotely kind of like you could do.

663
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:31,820
I think there's so much content that says, I'm like, I wouldn't even remotely study for that.

664
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:35,790
I think I'm not this I don't like I don't like to memorize things.

665
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:42,090
So you weren't supposed to do a thing or the other?

666
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:46,700
Oh, it was. Okay. I'm not judging, you know, like, I guess, you know, it doesn't.

667
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:50,670
Oh, okay. Oh, all right.

668
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:54,980
So let's call it if everybody that already.

669
01:03:55,410 --> 01:04:01,080
Okay. So even though the next slide is breakouts, we're we're going to do this bar activity.

670
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:12,000
I want to quickly get through the rest of the baking ingredients for you and see if we can touch upon any of the starch concepts.

671
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,570
If not, we'll revisit those like in the beginning of the third unit.

672
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:20,969
But you know, for years, for some reason, it's still not taught them history.

673
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:25,110
And so I'm kind of controlling it differently, but whatever. So, you know,

674
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:33,329
so for years I've had like different ways that I've tried to explain that gluten and gluten development because like in gluten isn't present in flour.

675
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:36,569
If you were to do like an analysis of like is there gluten in this flour?

676
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:42,990
Like, no, there's actually the components out there, but gluten isn't formed until you do two things.

677
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:49,170
You have to wet it. So you have to actually release it from the end of sperm where it's fragment, and then you have to need it to develop it.

678
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:54,930
So it's really that combination of making it moist and kneading it that develops the gluten where the two

679
01:04:54,930 --> 01:05:00,150
components which are required in and gluten then come together to form this network that we call gluten.

680
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:08,969
So I have over the years brought in pipe cleaners and I brought in kids toys and ball bearings, you know,

681
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:14,040
because some of the protein components look more like kind of a pipe cleaner that's been wound up.

682
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:18,750
And others are more like little like silver balls that you might see like in a pinball machine or something like that.

683
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:25,950
And it's how they interact and work together that gives it this unique property of what we call being like Visco Elastic,

684
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:30,300
so stretchable that can also hold its shape without breaking,

685
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:38,190
therefore allowing it to hold things like these delicate, like carbon dioxide bubbles that are formed when we have something present like yeast.

686
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:46,560
So I really like this. One of my favorite like kind of very user friendly sites is Cooks Illustrated.

687
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:54,300
And if you remember when we was that was it. Lauren was definitely remember when we looped in like the recipe developer,

688
01:05:54,600 --> 01:06:02,759
she actually had a stent that was like at Cook's Illustrated where she did a lot of recipe development and they do a lot of science testing there.

689
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:09,240
And I think they've come up with this best this video, if we could get it to play about gluten development here,

690
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:15,990
which is kind of fun and really demonstrates it nicely when you out even after you watch the Target ad.

691
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:21,230
This is Loomis, the first device. Oh my God.

692
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:27,510
I have to look at Google, which as we all have a hard and fast like that.

693
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:36,340
All right. Here we go. Romans I love this video.

694
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:42,799
Hopefully you will, too. Can you see over me on my parents what we're doing?

695
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:48,070
How many recipes? Two loaves of bread. You should have 600 cakes and some muffins.

696
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:51,890
All of these baked goods rely on something called school. How does this work?

697
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,149
First of all, start with a simple question. What is always flours?

698
01:06:56,150 --> 01:07:00,380
Contain two important proteins glide and the presence of water.

699
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:03,440
These two small proteins shape and bond together.

700
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:11,209
This creates an elastic network of proteins which has the ability to trap air in this network because

701
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:16,490
it splits starch granules and gas bubbles allow it to rise in the case of the chain structure.

702
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:22,880
Now, here's a test case. We've long known that gluten is important in baking, but mainly we've done a lot of talking, not a lot showing.

703
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:27,200
So what is it? On a tangible level, they see it, deal with it.

704
01:07:27,530 --> 01:07:34,190
I ran a simple experiment to find out just that. I made two basic goes by mixing flour and water in a food processor until smooth.

705
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:40,190
All I for one dough I use cake flour which contains the least amount of protein or all the different types of flour.

706
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:43,550
You can find a grocery store between six and 8% usually.

707
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:47,540
In addition, keep my ears open, which further weakens the proteins.

708
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:55,370
For the other one, I use bread flour which contains the most amount of protein, usually running about 12 or 14% and is generally not used.

709
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:58,370
So you can see here I have two balls of dough,

710
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:04,670
each containing a different amount of you can actually see that you surround yourself with a whole lot of starch.

711
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:08,270
The next step or not, I washed the stars away.

712
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,840
I placed in a mesh strainer and the sides of it are running water.

713
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:18,290
Wash away all starch. Once the water ran clear aside at the start, this time I was left with two piles.

714
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:26,890
Essentially, you can see the difference is it appears the texture of the caught, the low protein flour, very small amount.

715
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:34,990
I really need to pull it apart. On the other hand, high protein bread, flour for the large bulk of highly resilient rubber.

716
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:41,480
It can be stretched very thin. That's very well show just how elastic this bread flour is.

717
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:45,260
I'm going to try to do something a little bit crazy. I'm going to treat it like a balloon.

718
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:49,230
It looks like a crazy high. Yeah.

719
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:58,940
This is why we call it this dough elastic. Wow.

720
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:03,920
So what do we learn from this experiment? Well, we use the fiber to read.

721
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:09,450
Flour mixture develops a lot of very flexible image, as we've seen, actually,

722
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:15,079
with a little trapping air to create higher highs and lows, we want just enough food to provide.

723
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:21,260
It is structured. We are turning them tough. We try to keep flour is lower protein content and reduced food potential.

724
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:29,450
All purpose flour, as his name suggests, is good for a lot of foods that follow between these extremes, such as pie dough, hardier muffins and coats.

725
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:36,950
So next time you're needing pizza dough gently folding a cake batter or considering swapping one type of flour for another.

726
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:46,690
We hope you remember this experiment. This is one case we're seeing really is believing we can't beat that four our video.

727
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:53,089
That was the idea. So I think of like all of the different ways that I've actually tried to show that over time.

728
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:56,990
I think he really shows it the best. So. So thoughts?

729
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:04,729
Anything new that you learned on that? So there are lots of different proteins that are available in flowers,

730
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:13,010
which is key to know about 85% of the protein and flour is composed of the gluten and the gliding and the gluten in.

731
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:17,240
And those are the ones that are primarily responsible for making up for making the gluten.

732
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:23,900
The other 15% of the protein that's available has nothing to do with the gluten development.

733
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:29,690
So I think that I mean, there are other things to kind of note.

734
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:33,350
I will release my notes on here because I have a lot of information here.

735
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:40,670
And this what is gluten side that's kind of more of a pictorial with some links about some of the science in gluten development there.

736
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:46,670
It shows how this mesh structure actually occurs kind of chemically speaking,

737
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:50,479
there are hydrogen bonds that are formed that tend to be a little bit weaker.

738
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:54,140
And then there are disulfide bonds that are formed that tend to be stronger,

739
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:58,760
which hold together to create the networks of the pockets that can actually hold the carbon

740
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:03,620
dioxide when we actually leaven them by using the various different leavening products.

741
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:06,710
So those are kind of the key takeaway points that we that I want to make.

742
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:15,800
I'll share my notes with you about. I mean, we're not in my class, but we talk about gluten in terms of not only culinary purposes,

743
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:23,340
but we also want to think about it in terms of autoimmune diseases such as celiac and also the

744
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:28,520
nonspecific gluten sensitivity which occurs in a much larger percentage of the population,

745
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:29,889
celiac. Disease.

746
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:38,840
The autoimmune disease is really only affects about 1%, but we think there's about 6% of people that have this nonspecific gluten sensitivity and IBS.

747
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:42,580
There's no biomarker for those, but you have similar GI symptoms.

748
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:48,610
So the other thing to think about, because we do talk about the various different properties of wheat,

749
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:51,760
there's something else that's in wheat that are called Fructans,

750
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:59,260
which are the carbohydrate portion of wheat, and they are non digestible, non absorbable and fermented in the colon.

751
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:04,650
We've talked about this previously and they're fermented by the bacteria that live within our colon.

752
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:07,870
So they do produce also short chain fatty acids and gas.

753
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:16,690
And a lot of people with IBS are not sensitive actually to the gluten portion of of of wheat, but they're actually really sensitive to these fructans.

754
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:21,009
So and that's also important in people that are following the Fodmap diet that

755
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:25,030
you'll learn more about is the limiting products that have fructans in them.

756
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:31,809
So, um, so, and again, since we're not empty, I'm not going to go into the specifics of the FODMAP,

757
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:37,060
But as you learn more about that now, my, please, please, we can bring that into this class here,

758
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:44,530
the kind of like the specifics on a deeper level and again I'll release the notes for these two

759
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:50,950
is the the there's been a lot of debate back and forth and that's why I link those articles.

760
01:12:50,950 --> 01:13:01,749
There is is it actually the guide in portion or is it the gluten in portion that is more sensitive in terms of people that have celiac?

761
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:09,010
And it's thought that it's these amylase trypsin inhibitors that are actually the cause of the gluten sensitivity for celiac disease.

762
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:19,360
So in wheat, the protein guidance seems to have historically been responsible for the symptoms that are associated with celiac disease.

763
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:25,299
But now we think that the peptides that are derived from both groups are the immuno stimulatory peptides.

764
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:32,890
So both are of a concern in celiac disease and it's highly probable that it's not just the guide and it's also the gluten and that is toxic.

765
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:38,830
We talked we've talked about like the three prime grains that contain gluten.

766
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:42,370
Again, to reiterate, that was wheat and rye and barley.

767
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:46,270
So in rye it's actually different. It's something called Sakhalin.

768
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:53,530
And that it seems to be like the the the protein that actually causes problems in people with celiac.

769
01:13:53,530 --> 01:14:01,660
So just know that in different grain products there are different proteins in barley, actually a protein is called for dyne.

770
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:04,990
So and again, I'll release those for you here.

771
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:09,760
So we talked about it being visco elastic and not being normally found.

772
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:16,389
And the remaining 15 remember I said about all of flour,

773
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:23,860
it's about 85% gluten in and diet and and then the 15 remaining percent are the albumin and the globulin that are present.

774
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:26,950
Just different types of protein is what you need to know there.

775
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:37,900
There is labeling for gluten free products. So the it is regulated that let's say you have you can actually say a fruit is gluten free.

776
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:47,770
So you can say that you can also say something is gluten free if it has less than 20 parts per million of gluten in there.

777
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:54,099
So it may not be gluten free. It's kind of like the old trans fatty acids.

778
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:58,780
If you put the creamers in a small enough container, you can label it as trans fat free.

779
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:03,970
But if you are somebody like me who puts a lot of cream in their coffee and you have 3 to 4 creamers,

780
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:08,020
then your product is no longer trans fat free because it's based on quantity.

781
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:11,079
So keep that in mind. Buy gluten free products.

782
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:14,170
Also, in order to be labeled, they have to be free.

783
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:16,930
Of those three primary grains that I just talked about,

784
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:25,450
they can't be processed or or manufactured in plants that they have any cross-contamination with wheat, barley or rye.

785
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:29,890
So those are regulations. I always like to kind of throw in the regulations with that.

786
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:38,409
Let's spend like about the next 10 minutes talking a little bit about ingredient functions and you're going to explore this more in person next week.

787
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:44,050
And this section will just give you background information on the different functions of ingredients that you'll see.

788
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:47,500
And the first thing that I really want to talk about is different types of leavening.

789
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:55,600
So we lab in a batter or we run a dole in three distinct ways, like the different types of leavening slide shows you.

790
01:15:55,870 --> 01:16:02,949
And it's a process of incorporating air into a batter, either through physical, biological or.

791
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:07,160
Yeah. Is there a specific site that. Oh, I'm on different types of leavening.

792
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:10,850
Is there a different slide deck from the flour?

793
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:15,950
Are you guys in the week two PowerPoint that I put up this morning?

794
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:19,730
No. Are you in week one? I see what you're talking about.

795
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,809
Yeah, it's. It's on slide 27. Yeah. Slide 26.

796
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:28,160
I have it on in week two. I'm sorry for the confusion.

797
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:34,130
So I reordered the slide deck from last week to get to the things that I wanted to.

798
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:38,150
So if you go into week to look at the one that was put in there.

799
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:42,720
You see it. Everybody on the right one. Yes.

800
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:47,930
53. Are you in week two, though, aren't you?

801
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:52,690
You have to go on today. Yeah. Today's date. And I got it from.

802
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:58,170
Don't know, but some of you are in it and have ideas.

803
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,880
Slide 2627. Yes, it is. Okay.

804
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:09,240
Sorry about that. Yeah, I wanted it was more important that we talked about the ingredients and if we get to the star tree, get to the stars.

805
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:19,030
So that's why I labeled it that way. So. So the different types of love than leavening, like I said, are some things that we don't even think about,

806
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:21,970
which are the physical leavening of how we incorporate air and steam.

807
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:26,889
Well, talk a little bit about the biologic biological lavenders, which are going to be the yeast products,

808
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:31,030
and then chemical lavenders, which are the baking soda and the baking starch.

809
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:35,440
So next slide which says leavening, which is physical leavening air.

810
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:42,400
So we leaven products in ways when we're making baked goods in ways that you probably don't,

811
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,879
even when you think of it just as only the average baker thinks of it as mixing.

812
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:53,120
But there are there are things that we do that actually incorporate different types of air, and we do that by beating in eggs.

813
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:58,060
So it depends upon the portion of the egg that you're using, how much air, if you're using a whole egg,

814
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:04,629
moderate amounts of air you're putting in, if you're only using it egg white, tremendous amounts of air, because that's what their function is.

815
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:10,010
If you're using an egg yolk, which is more fat, minimal amounts of air if not.

816
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:13,750
So, so really depends upon the egg portion that you're using.

817
01:18:14,350 --> 01:18:18,040
Just the act of creaming fat and sugar together. What does that do?

818
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:25,300
So when you think about a sugar crystal and you think about fat, if you're creaming, almost every cookie recipe starts with your creaming process.

819
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:28,810
Those crystals are actually functioning. Functioning.

820
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:37,060
That's an interesting word. Puncturing the the fat and creating holes in that so that air can go in there.

821
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:43,210
And that's an act of leavening. So just that different textures being mixed together will create leavening.

822
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:48,850
Beating batter in any way. And also folding and rolling out dough.

823
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:56,650
So when we think about folding and rolling out Dole, dole, I'm thinking of like those that sometimes we call plastic that have a lot of fat in them.

824
01:18:57,010 --> 01:19:02,290
Those would be like like different types of phyllo dough or puff pastry.

825
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:07,719
We don't generally tend to make puff pastry from scratch because it's very time consuming and

826
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:12,760
involves something called lamination where you're folding and folding and sitting and then folding,

827
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:19,239
and then you get these layers of fat that are actually interspersed with the protein and the starch so that you get

828
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:26,050
kind of that puff in that crunch where you might see it more if anybody has made a homemade pie pastry before.

829
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:33,340
You generally don't do that with a liquid fat. You want to do that with a solid fat and you want to minimally walk it because you want

830
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:38,830
to have it actually be as tender process as possible so that when you're baking it,

831
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:46,179
we'll get to the next part, which is steam. You're actually evaporating the water and you're creating the pockets of tender, flaky dough.

832
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:51,220
So so the other physical way that we have of leavening is through steam.

833
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:57,010
And we usually do that like in pie crust, like I mentioned, that have some water components often.

834
01:19:57,010 --> 01:20:06,729
That's why a butter crust because it has water. Water in the butter will allow for more steam because the evaporation of that water but also we have

835
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:12,670
steam happens in baked goods that have a really high liquid content and a high of in temperature.

836
01:20:13,090 --> 01:20:23,480
And the best example that I have on that is what we call shoe dough, which is sort of the it's actually C, H or u, x, so not h, o e,

837
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:31,629
but a shoe dough is a French term and a shoe dough is the type of dough that's used to make things like cream puffs and popovers.

838
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:37,570
And they're actually so thinking about the end of the semester when you do your food demonstration,

839
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:40,600
they're kind of a fun thing if you've never made them before.

840
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:48,399
It's a fun experiment because a lot can go wrong, but it's an interesting dough where it's actually cooked twice, which is really rare.

841
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:52,930
So you actually cook it on the cooktop and it and you drill out nice to starch by doing that.

842
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:56,770
Similar to kind of like how we're talking about how browning butter will change the flavor.

843
01:20:57,310 --> 01:21:04,600
And you have a usually a high egg content which provides structure and you have a high water content which will have steam and then you

844
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:13,030
put it in a very high oven in a type of container that will you can stick to it stick like a souffle where you're sticking to the sides.

845
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:21,070
So it allows it to rise really quickly, quickly by producing steam and then creates a hollow but moist center if done correctly.

846
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:24,560
And then it's usually filled with deliciousness, you know, you know,

847
01:21:24,830 --> 01:21:29,830
some type of a custard or some type of whipped cream or some chocolate filling or something like that.

848
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:36,760
So I'm just throwing that out as an idea. If somebody is looking for their food demo project to do something that they've never done before.

849
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:46,719
So those are the two main ways that we leaven and steam has this tremendous ability to leaven to some extent, and it leavens in all baked goods.

850
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:52,390
So so the next slide is just leavening using carbon dioxide.

851
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:56,079
So, so using carbon dioxide.

852
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:03,399
We do that through biological agents, which is the action of different types of yeast and through chemical agents,

853
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:10,600
which are baking soda and baking powder. So because they do both produce carbon dioxide but in different ways.

854
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,970
So the next. Try this baker's yeast or biological leavening.

855
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:23,190
So there's different types of yeast. You never want to confuse those with brewer's yeast or the example of nutritional yeast.

856
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:27,059
Nobody has ever used this before, because if you try and bake your bread with this,

857
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:36,330
you will be very unsuccessful because nutritional yeast is a seasoning that's often used in vegan diet and it produces

858
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:42,299
like a it's almost like a cheese substitute and a flavoring often used for popcorn if you've ever tried it before.

859
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:49,460
But it's often used to replace cheese in recipes. But it is also the same type of yeast.

860
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:53,850
It's Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but it's been inactivated,

861
01:22:53,850 --> 01:23:01,650
so it will never be able to be activated in the baking process or through warm water like the yeast that we use in baking is.

862
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:10,049
And brewer's yeast is something completely different. It's a byproduct of making beer, and it has a variety of different purposes.

863
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:14,970
But it also is not something that you want to use for leavening your baked goods.

864
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:22,560
So if you want to leaven your baked goods, you want to use one of the main yeast products.

865
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:27,600
And I don't have an example of the pictures here. On the far right is cake yeast.

866
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:30,180
So most professional bakers are going to use cake.

867
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:39,300
Yeast is very perishable and has to be refrigerated, but those who bake professionally will say that it's the best to use if you can find it.

868
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:43,850
And then there's two other like two other yeast products that are used.

869
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:49,649
We have my example here is I have active dry use yeast and this is the primary yeast that most

870
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:57,240
of us home bakers will use and it can be easily activated by the correct temperature of water.

871
01:23:57,510 --> 01:24:02,940
And I say the correct temperature of water because it's inactive, it's too cold and it's killed off, it's too high.

872
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:06,090
So that perfect range, I've seen lots of different scales,

873
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:12,210
but usually around 100 degrees somewhere as you can be up to 150 and sometimes in the low nineties.

874
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:17,250
But it's one actually your thermometers arrived in the mail yesterday, so I should give those to you.

875
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:22,310
But you do have to be really careful about the temperature when you're activating this.

876
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:28,290
So so this was developed after this because of the stability.

877
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:36,180
And then I want to say like 20 years ago, maybe when you guys were growing up, maybe you lived in a household that had a bread machine.

878
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:43,350
Bread machines became wildly popular because everybody wanted to bake bread, but they didn't want to have to go through the proofing process.

879
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:50,370
They want to throw all of the ingredients in at once and put the yeast in and just have it be activated and ready to go.

880
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:54,120
And that's where these if I have oh, this one here.

881
01:24:54,480 --> 01:25:03,420
So this is the fast rise or instant east and the particles are kind of smaller and they don't necessarily need to be pre hydrated to be activated.

882
01:25:03,810 --> 01:25:08,520
They're meant to go it was meant to go into a bread machine and be activated all at once.

883
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:13,770
So just know that when you're shopping for different types of yeast, they do have different shelf lives,

884
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:16,919
they have different processes, they have different activation levels.

885
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:22,720
So important to know that.

886
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:27,060
See, I think that's about all I wanted to cover on that particular slide.

887
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:36,890
Simply like in terms of the chemical reaction, it produces both ethanol and carbon dioxide.

888
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:41,470
Most of the ethanol is just actually blown off in the baking process and doesn't remain.

889
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:49,630
And it's the carbon dioxide that produces and traps those bubbles in that very elastic bread that we're talking about when the gluten is developed.

890
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:54,340
Okay, next slide. Are these other types of yeast and I already mentioned these.

891
01:25:55,690 --> 01:26:00,399
So this nutritional yeast is actually sold as flakes, granules or powder.

892
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:10,390
And I talk about it being deactivated. But the other primary nutrition purpose used in vegan diet is the nutrient B12.

893
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:21,790
Many nutritional yeast are fortified with B12, and B12 is a problematic nutrient for vegans who don't have any animal products whatsoever.

894
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:28,360
Not all. Like you can often buy this nutritional yeast in bulk, and often the bulk is not fortified.

895
01:26:28,630 --> 01:26:33,490
So it's really important if you're counseling anybody who might be concerned about their B12 intake,

896
01:26:33,490 --> 01:26:37,240
that they actually buy nutritional yeast that's been fortified.

897
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:42,790
So it actually two tablespoons of nutritional yeast has about 60 calories.

898
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:49,029
It has fiber. It actually is a complete source of protein and it has about five grams of fiber.

899
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:50,710
It's also high in tyramine.

900
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:57,550
So if you're ever counseling somebody who uses a tremendous amount of nutritional yeast and they say that they have a lot of headaches,

901
01:26:57,820 --> 01:27:02,889
there has been an association of high ingestion, of nutritional yeast and headaches,

902
01:27:02,890 --> 01:27:07,480
and it could possibly not scientifically proven be linked to the high red meat levels.

903
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,910
So just to keep that in mind.

904
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:21,790
The other thing to note is that the difference with brewer's yeast is it is also Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but it's a different strain.

905
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:28,240
And remember, these yeast produce ethanol and they produce carbon dioxide in the brewer's yeast.

906
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:33,160
It produces more ethanol, which makes sense because you want the alcohol content.

907
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:43,030
Okay. The next slide is the baking soda on. Baking soda falls under that category of chemically leavening and the two different types of baking soda.

908
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:50,560
And if you want to kind of look at these here, I have just two examples that I keep, which are which is baking soda with sodium bicarbonate.

909
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:58,540
And this is used in recipes. When there's an acid ingredient, you have to have an acid ingredient to activate the baking soda.

910
01:27:59,050 --> 01:28:05,980
So you brainstorm what kind of acid ingredients could you possibly have that would activate this in different types of baked goods?

911
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:11,320
Lemon juice. Anything with lemon juice? Yep. What else?

912
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:16,600
Something. I'm sorry. Sigma. Yeah, vinegar could be.

913
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,419
If you have a recipe that has been occurring in a lot of baked goods. Don't.

914
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:25,540
But what I mean, classic kind of food science experiment is take some vinegar with your baking soda bubbles, then it's good.

915
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:31,329
If it's not, put it in your refrigerator, throw it out, because it does have a limited shelf life of things.

916
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:36,610
Fruits, you know, so fruits have naturally containing acids in them, chocolate,

917
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:41,890
molasses, honey, those are all things that will activate this and provide leavening.

918
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:48,159
And it's usually single action. So the leavening process just happens once baking powder.

919
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:52,090
Most baking powder is sold as double acting baking powder.

920
01:28:52,090 --> 01:28:59,440
So basically what it has, it has four ingredients and it has a sodium bicarbonate, which is baking soda, it has two acids.

921
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:02,680
And the acids vary based upon the different types of brand.

922
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:07,239
But the acid, one of the acids is activated when it's mixing and when it's wet,

923
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:11,830
and then the other has a second tooth where it is actually activated when it's heated.

924
01:29:12,130 --> 01:29:20,560
So you have that double action. You do not have to have an acid present in your baked good in order for this to be activated.

925
01:29:21,070 --> 01:29:28,389
And the third ingredient is a starch because the starch stabilizes it so that there aren't any reactions that might occur.

926
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:34,390
The starch would also absorb any liquid. So there's no actually reactions that occur wireless in the container.

927
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:40,750
Okay. So I think that tends to be like really confusing for people when they're baking of which one to use.

928
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,790
But that's the simplest explanation.

929
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:52,120
And just knowing that it's really the two types of acids that actually give it a higher product, often like chocolate chip cookies.

930
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:55,989
I think the best chocolate chip cookies often are used just with baking soda.

931
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:59,080
The chocolate provides the acid ingredient that you need in it.

932
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:03,460
And if you want a cookie that's crunchier as opposed to really fluffy,

933
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:09,430
you get more fluffy with the baking powder and kind of more crunchy with the baking soda.

934
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:16,510
So be interesting next week to see how they alter the ingredients in these funky chunky cookies to give you different results in the product.

935
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:24,830
Any questions there? You know, the other thing that we did point out was buttermilk.

936
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:28,490
So you'll find buttermilk is a key ingredient in a lot of quick breads.

937
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:32,870
So because it has lactic acid in it.

938
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:37,549
So anything with lactic acid in it and that.

939
01:30:37,550 --> 01:30:42,710
Oh, yeah. The other thing that I wanted to mention is anybody a fan of snickerdoodle cookies?

940
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:48,410
Yes. What is the ingredient that gives snickerdoodles cookies their interesting flavor?

941
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:53,780
You have cream of tartar, right? And cream of tartar is the acid, you know.

942
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:56,470
So that also will activate baking soda.

943
01:30:56,480 --> 01:31:02,120
So any recipe that has cream of tartar in it is usually used with baking soda and you don't need the powder to.

944
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:07,850
I've actually found snickerdoodle recipes that are do you want a fluffier snickerdoodle recipe?

945
01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:11,090
And if you want a fluffier recipe, it often will add a little bit of the powder.

946
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:17,770
Oh. Okay. I on the baking powder.

947
01:31:17,770 --> 01:31:22,450
I already actually talked about that. I did. I talked about the baking soda.

948
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:26,290
I talked about the baking powder or the chemically leavening the dough to different types.

949
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:33,700
So the last couple of slides, we talked a little bit about this last week about what are the various different fats that you might

950
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:40,029
use and what are the purposes for them in baking and fat is generally known in baking as a tenderizer.

951
01:31:40,030 --> 01:31:45,489
So how does it do that? Think about the gluten and the gluten development will fat will actually coat the

952
01:31:45,490 --> 01:31:51,610
gluten molecule and it will separate that you might even use the term shortening.

953
01:31:51,610 --> 01:31:57,400
So it basically shortens it so that it can't stretch as much and it provides a more tender particle.

954
01:31:57,850 --> 01:32:04,870
It also can increase the volume by coding the air bubbles in there so that it provides stability to the batter.

955
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:08,679
So that's another thing that fat is used for in baking.

956
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:12,190
And then primarily like we talked about last week, it's also in flavor.

957
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:18,490
So it really depends upon the fat and whether or not you want a neutral flavor or a more intense flavor like a brown butter.

958
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:26,530
Or if you want something like that with a lot of substitutions of people using coconut oil, it definitely will impart a certain flavor too.

959
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:35,890
We use also the term plastic when we're talking about flat and meaning fat, meaning that it can be moldable at room temperature.

960
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:43,690
So often that's used synonymously with saturated fat, saturated fats being solid at room temperature.

961
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:54,610
And we would always choose a moldable fat for a pie crust because it will make actually a pie better, lighter, fluffier as opposed to a liquid fat.

962
01:32:55,630 --> 01:32:58,750
Other things to think about are the degree of on saturation,

963
01:32:59,110 --> 01:33:06,399
and that affects the temperature in which it melts and more on a more on saturated will

964
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:11,590
be more liquid at room temperature when you're considering things like substitutions.

965
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:14,739
We've already talked about this about butter and being part water.

966
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:18,969
Commercial butter has different butter, fat components.

967
01:33:18,970 --> 01:33:23,830
Margarine has different components. You know, for a long time there are a lot of recipes that substitute it.

968
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:28,930
When we thought margarine before we knew about trans fatty acids and hydrogenated oils,

969
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:34,660
we thought margin was the end all be all in terms of substituting for butter.

970
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:39,190
And now we know better, but it also functions completely differently and make good recipes.

971
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:45,940
So the next slide is just a review slide that I pulled out about degree of saturation.

972
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:54,690
Just to refresh you about like why we we talk about ingredients of hydrogenation and why do we hydrogenation, you know,

973
01:33:54,760 --> 01:34:01,150
and now obviously we we know that we've been taking hydrogenated food out of the food chain,

974
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:05,290
but it was done to preserve food to provide longer shelf life.

975
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:17,110
So so just refresher from 630, that slide to throw in and then slide 35, which is oil comparison.

976
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:24,040
I like to show this slide because when you thinking about different, that's like a common question.

977
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:29,830
You might guess what oil should I use? And again, we talked about this a little bit, so that's why I want to make sure you saw this slide.

978
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:38,170
It's not like a simple science that that fats are either all saturated or all unsaturated or all nano unsaturated.

979
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:43,810
And even the talk about coconut oil and being mono unsaturated, most modern,

980
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:50,530
unsaturated like medium chain triglyceride oils are like 10 to 12, ten, 8 to 10 carbons.

981
01:34:50,530 --> 01:34:53,679
And coconut oil is more like 12 carbons.

982
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:59,020
And we don't really have the scientific evidence to prove that functions like medium chain triggers or IEDs.

983
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:03,580
So there's a lot of interesting science about that, about whether or not that's supported or not.

984
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:09,370
And most of the evidence right now does not support that. It functions like a true medium chain triglyceride oil.

985
01:35:09,730 --> 01:35:16,150
But I just wanted you to say that all of see that all of these oils have different levels of saturation.

986
01:35:16,150 --> 01:35:22,300
And it's important to know that because you have to think about what it's what it's used for and small points.

987
01:35:22,630 --> 01:35:27,490
Actually, the oil the plant based oil that has the highest smoke point is avocado oil.

988
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:33,490
I wouldn't necessarily recommend, though, people using a lot of avocado oil because it's incredibly expensive.

989
01:35:33,490 --> 01:35:40,840
So that's something to to what would be a more affordable substitute, something like a canola oil or an all purpose vegetable oil.

990
01:35:41,890 --> 01:35:46,750
What is the health of the oil and what is the cost? All things to consider when you're comparing oil.

991
01:35:47,890 --> 01:35:52,120
The next slide, which is like the types of fat. I think we've gotten into most of this.

992
01:35:52,870 --> 01:36:00,220
The one thing we've talked about liquid purposes and shortening being solid and butters and margarines and the different water content there.

993
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:06,610
But the other thing that many, many pies that are commercially available are actually made from lard.

994
01:36:07,090 --> 01:36:13,719
And lard is an animal fat. And a lot of people who think that they're eating a fruit pie don't recognize that it's actually is an animal product.

995
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:18,230
So that's something to consider when. Thinking about labels and how those pie crusts are made.

996
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:22,969
And it's important from just a food science standpoint that you know what it is.

997
01:36:22,970 --> 01:36:25,370
And lard, is it rendered pig fat?

998
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:33,050
So it is specifically considered rendered pig fat, which means that it's just separated and boiled in the waters and it's refined.

999
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:38,060
There's a different type of specialty lard that's called leaf lard.

1000
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:46,910
And leaf lard is actually the delicate fat that surrounds the internal organs of animals, specifically the kidneys.

1001
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:50,900
And that is used for really delicate pie crust.

1002
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:55,040
So you may see a leaf already has an ingredient back.

1003
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,119
Fat can be used.

1004
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:03,310
So when you're thinking you have a whole unit that animals but the fat that actually just comes right underneath the skin and the back is also used.

1005
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:11,120
So when we want to render fat, it's usually cut and then it's slow and steady, heated, and then it's strained.

1006
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:17,209
And a lot of people will do this at home. If it's made at home, then there's no hydrogenation that's going on.

1007
01:37:17,210 --> 01:37:20,300
It's usually a lower saturated fat also so.

1008
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:26,570
We talked earlier a little bit about fat replacers.

1009
01:37:26,830 --> 01:37:29,060
Shayna, you mentioned the one we were talking about, ice cream.

1010
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:35,990
And just so that, you know, in the food industry, the two prime fat replacers are carbohydrate based.

1011
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:41,690
And those are things like cellulose gums and maltodextrin and then those that are whey based.

1012
01:37:41,690 --> 01:37:45,860
And you'll see that ingredient in ice creams and yogurt and cheese spread.

1013
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:48,110
And it's the ingredient that's called simplex.

1014
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:57,120
And those are often ones that we can see with some GI distress to other baking ingredients that you'll talk about next week.

1015
01:37:57,140 --> 01:38:00,600
Just keep in mind, they all have different properties.

1016
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:05,360
I won't reiterate this because they're they're they're written pretty clearly on the slide.

1017
01:38:06,110 --> 01:38:09,010
And some of them we've already talked about you.

1018
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:16,540
A lot of people will say, well, if my yeast needs sugar and all I'm using is flour, how can my yeast get sugar?

1019
01:38:16,550 --> 01:38:20,630
So that actually comes obviously from the starch that's present in the flour.

1020
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:31,250
And I think I'm going to end there because the next slides here are really more about starch,

1021
01:38:31,790 --> 01:38:37,680
which is kind of like this fine line between the flour and the grain unit and the next unit that we're going into.

1022
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:44,090
So I will make sure that when I go back, I'll release all of the notes so that you can see the various different notes.

1023
01:38:44,450 --> 01:38:49,459
The starch slides are really intended to be a review of what you learn.

1024
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:54,950
And I put a macronutrient review actually PowerPoint for you to review about, for you to review,

1025
01:38:54,950 --> 01:39:04,879
but to think about it from food purposes and to think about it also mostly from commercial use of starches and specifically modified starches.

1026
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:10,160
I think, if you like, the one example of how it's used in chewing gum, but you pretty much go home.

1027
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:14,870
Maybe you have some processed foods that you have in your refrigerator or in your cabinet.

1028
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:21,740
I would imagine that 90% of the processed foods that you have have some form of a modified starch in them,

1029
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:25,129
and they're used for a variety of different reasons.

1030
01:39:25,130 --> 01:39:32,480
So I think the first step in learning about how starches are used are to read the ingredient list and the different foods that you have at home.

1031
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:37,190
And then we can kind of bring in some of those ideas and talk about how the different starches are used.

1032
01:39:37,550 --> 01:39:44,629
It goes beyond just simple corn starch that we use for gravies, but it's a primary ingredient in the food industry.

1033
01:39:44,630 --> 01:39:52,310
So and then what I want you guys to do, actually, is we haven't had a chance to do this because we have so much content.

1034
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:53,870
But as you're leaving,

1035
01:39:55,250 --> 01:40:05,210
what I want everybody to do here is to do this little kind of take home fine experiment is you saw that we have our food cart, right?

1036
01:40:05,330 --> 01:40:11,180
You it we have a food cart now that Casey and Carol stack the first time and then wait

1037
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:15,470
and that's the second time we're flying some maybe some slightly better choices.

1038
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:22,370
That's to be determined. But as a working dietitian, in the future, you're going to get this question all the time.

1039
01:40:22,370 --> 01:40:26,270
I want to have a bar replacement. I want a stock.

1040
01:40:27,170 --> 01:40:29,959
What should I have for breakfast? I don't have time to eat.

1041
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:36,920
I want something that's grab and go or you're the wellness champion at your workplace and they want you to help stop that.

1042
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:40,940
And some of these are whole grains. Some of these have more protein.

1043
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:43,640
There are look at all these.

1044
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:55,100
This is just a here's my offer for this, but these are just a small sample of all of the different grain free grain containing protein bars,

1045
01:40:55,100 --> 01:41:01,230
meal replacement bars that are on the market. So there is one, two, four, six, eight, five.

1046
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:07,430
There is more than enough for everybody to take one, take something that you're unfamiliar with, take it home.

1047
01:41:07,670 --> 01:41:13,909
You don't have to eat it if you want your speed. And just tell me next week.

1048
01:41:13,910 --> 01:41:16,670
Well, not next week. When we come back in two weeks, when I see you,

1049
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:25,070
whether or not you think that this would be a good meal replacement and what you based it on, think about macronutrients.

1050
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:29,270
Think about calories that are in there. Look at the ingredients.

1051
01:41:29,270 --> 01:41:35,780
What additives do they have in them? Are there additives in there that are confusing to you that you have no idea what they are?

1052
01:41:36,170 --> 01:41:46,819
Are you somebody who prefers like to recommend a bar that actually has food products in it that are visible like not or something like a Luna bar,

1053
01:41:46,820 --> 01:41:49,070
which is just all kind of mashed together.

1054
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:57,320
So try and do this without like looking at any of the reports that review the various different bars because they come out every year.

1055
01:41:57,680 --> 01:42:03,530
But think about it from macronutrients, from calories, from a sugar standpoint, from a fiber standpoint,

1056
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:09,560
and take something that you're unfamiliar with and then let's have a conversation about that in a couple of weeks.

1057
01:42:10,370 --> 01:42:15,770
I've tried quite a few of them over this past this past week, and I have some new favorites.

1058
01:42:16,650 --> 01:42:20,940
You know, I have tried everything and I'm like, what?

1059
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:24,340
I is not familiar. Oh, there's. Be something you have to try.

1060
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:28,150
No, I'm serious. Really? Yeah. I just.

1061
01:42:28,170 --> 01:42:31,540
You know. Yeah, that's an interesting one.

1062
01:42:33,790 --> 01:42:39,440
Yeah. Come take a look at. So really pretty interesting.

1063
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:43,090
I just. Oh, I don't know about you.

1064
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:47,320
This one probably looks like you. Yeah, I've had this. Oh, yeah.

1065
01:42:47,470 --> 01:42:51,190
I never saw you like that.

1066
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:55,810
I haven't had that of. Okay. Which one?

1067
01:42:57,190 --> 01:43:00,460
I found I'd never seen one before.

1068
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:06,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. These are pretty good, actually. I know.

1069
01:43:08,050 --> 01:43:12,400
It's like, you know, the other thing I want you guys to think about was.

1070
01:43:12,790 --> 01:43:17,770
Okay. And accessibility. These guys are.

1071
01:43:17,870 --> 01:43:21,020
Oh, yeah. I have a girlfriend.

1072
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:24,260
Yeah. Oh, my God. For 3 hours.

1073
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:29,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what I mean.

1074
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:33,030
What are you doing? You're just.

1075
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:36,140
You know what? I'm sorry. I can't remember. Which ones are you?

1076
01:43:36,610 --> 01:43:49,610
Yeah, like, yeah. Yeah. They're really on the output from some of the Trader Joe's ones for me to and I tried just one after that.

1077
01:43:49,690 --> 01:43:54,440
No problem. I got to do some for Maverick.

1078
01:43:54,790 --> 01:44:04,280
So you're going to have to make this the first round of cards for the first round or I don't know if I like it,

1079
01:44:04,330 --> 01:44:11,860
you know, but everything's gonna be okay. I think I'm definitely open minded.

1080
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:15,130
Yeah. And would you say it was good for grab and go? Well,

1081
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:21,700
food went in 24 hours I've every time I've got into an empty she stopped it yesterday

1082
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:29,090
and she still has fresh fruit now and bananas Clementine I think maybe it was the,

1083
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:38,260
the, the thing that elicited some of the most negative response was on the other hand, sometimes I know, but I think that's college students.

1084
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:41,620
We're just on the go. Exactly right. And it's Trader Joe's.

1085
01:44:42,730 --> 01:44:46,480
I mean, I read it. Yeah, exactly. And people didn't eat it.

1086
01:44:46,510 --> 01:44:49,810
So I think it just brings up like a really interesting discussion.

1087
01:44:50,110 --> 01:44:53,889
It's all about balance. I just like where I come from.

1088
01:44:53,890 --> 01:44:56,140
That's like higher country those nights.

1089
01:44:56,350 --> 01:45:02,410
So I think what I want to throw out to you guys then is like when we have the scientists at the School of Public Health.

1090
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:08,229
Yeah. And the only options are sodas and there's nothing that's not soda oriented.

1091
01:45:08,230 --> 01:45:11,920
And options are we are we sending the message that we want to send?

1092
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:15,309
Do we have to have the should we only have healthy options?

1093
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:19,060
Should we have a variety of options from an equity issue? That's my point.

1094
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:27,400
I'm an average person, so like I would I'm going to go and pick up some celery that we to go and pick up something.

1095
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:30,580
That's good. Yeah, you're welcome. Yeah, but I will eat celery.

1096
01:45:30,790 --> 01:45:36,070
That is something that I go to get all the stuff for that thing.

1097
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:41,020
You know, what's, what's come out. It's like today or today.

1098
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:44,200
Yeah, well, today, Wednesday was Saturday.

1099
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:48,360
Like, I didn't realize what day it was. It's like a chat either way.

1100
01:45:48,490 --> 01:45:54,760
Oh. So eventually you're like, we have to get, like, healthy enough.

1101
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:58,299
Yeah. So, I mean, you're right.

1102
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:01,390
I know it is. I am not taking a stand on it.

1103
01:46:01,390 --> 01:46:07,150
I'm just trying to think like, do we try and set an example as nutritional sciences?

1104
01:46:07,210 --> 01:46:13,480
But we're also School of Public Health, so it has to be accessible and cost appropriate.

1105
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:24,820
Yeah, but within the realm of being accessible and cost appropriate and we're looking at like a Quaker chewy bar versus an affordable granola bar.

1106
01:46:26,110 --> 01:46:33,720
Where, where, where are we, the leaders in the best and those or you know, I mean, it's just I think it's just a really good conversation to have.

1107
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:40,810
So, yeah, I just didn't think like, I don't want it to get like a negative connotation that, like, it was totally unhealthy.

1108
01:46:40,830 --> 01:46:44,410
Yeah, well, that's actually, that's actually why they sent out the.

1109
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:47,950
So hopefully you did the survey. Casey sent out a survey. Yeah, I think they're fine.

1110
01:46:47,950 --> 01:46:53,170
I mean, yeah, maybe some stuff, just little, but I thought they were free to go.

1111
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:57,560
I mean, if you want a program like got or Walmart got like some of the cheapest sometimes.

1112
01:46:57,580 --> 01:47:04,479
Okay, maybe. But it's not like, yeah, I think what ended up happening is Sarah went to a bunch of stores and took screenshots of like,

1113
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:07,270
consider this, consider this all within minutes.

1114
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:13,479
If you were stacking that every week and it goes within 24 hours, it's big cost also to pass for the department.

1115
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:21,370
So but something to consider. Yeah, I think we got like, what did you guys what did you get that?

1116
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:27,530
Yes, I did. That.

1117
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:33,880
Oh, I will tell you right now, I am going to, like, grab and go.

1118
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:39,550
Oh, we almost feel like guns. Or like you mean the police have a line?

1119
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:44,240
I know. They call me like I don't like all. Yeah, I go.

1120
01:47:44,650 --> 01:47:49,150
Those are 2000 kids. Uh huh.

1121
01:47:50,050 --> 01:47:54,760
We almost got those there. We got real apples in the mountains. And these cookies.

1122
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:58,210
Yeah. The cards give to you. What was the last one?

1123
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:04,270
Okay. Oh, yeah, I like that, too, I got to say. Well, yesterday they got smart pop, and I was like.

1124
01:48:05,410 --> 01:48:13,630
Yeah, I was going to ask you to. We have marjoram and we have people like that all the time on our diet and how bad it is for you.

1125
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:16,960
Well, it's. It's soya based. Okay, it depends.

1126
01:48:17,810 --> 01:48:26,530
Yeah. Yeah. In Florence. Well, I at my house, I almost always have a container of smart balance, which,

1127
01:48:26,890 --> 01:48:30,370
again, is a better there's good options and they're just like everything.

1128
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:34,149
See? Yeah, there's good. There's good options and there's bad options.

1129
01:48:34,150 --> 01:48:34,990
And I think, you know,

1130
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:41,850
with there was good about I just I just felt kind of like that because like it sounded like I'll do it like medicine, like, no, no, no.

1131
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:45,280
I just I know a lot of people didn't think it was unhealthy.

1132
01:48:45,550 --> 01:48:47,950
I think it was like this not going wrong. But no, no.

1133
01:48:47,950 --> 01:48:53,230
I think it's more of what is our role in the department in terms of providing things, you know, within reason.

1134
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:57,700
And is it our role? Are we the food police, you know?

1135
01:48:59,020 --> 01:49:03,010
Yeah. No, I. I don't want to, you know, know exactly.

1136
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:08,160
And always like it's also as you enter the world as a future dietitian, you're always going.
