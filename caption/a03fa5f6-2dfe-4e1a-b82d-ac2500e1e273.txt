1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,887
In this lecture for HMP600 the health services system,

2
00:00:05,887 --> 00:00:13,067
we are going to talk about a basic lecture to describe what insurance is,

3
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:19,327
how it works, and some of the basic terminology of insurance.

4
00:00:19,327 --> 00:00:25,574
So to get started, let's think about what insurance really is.

5
00:00:25,574 --> 00:00:29,262
And we're gonna start with an example that has nothing to do with health insurance

6
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,924
but just insurance more generally.

7
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:35,615
So let's imagine a country that has 1,000 ships.

8
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:40,668
Each of those ships is worth $100,000 when it's filled with cargo.

9
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:45,516
So these ships are used for moving goods and cargo back and

10
00:00:45,516 --> 00:00:48,558
forth into our imaginary country.

11
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,939
And so each ship is worth $100,000.

12
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:57,677
In an average year, 6 of the ships from this imaginary

13
00:00:57,677 --> 00:01:02,835
country are lost, they sink and they lose all their cargo.

14
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:08,402
So the loss to each owner is $100,000,

15
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,028
a huge and catastrophic loss.

16
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:15,852
And if we think about our imaginary country and

17
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:21,050
thinking about it across the country, the total cost of losses

18
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:26,167
from these 6 ships that sink each year is $600,000.

19
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:29,790
Also a large loss to the country.

20
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,082
However, if we think about the fact that there are 1,000

21
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:39,865
ship owners, we could think about the total annual loss

22
00:01:39,865 --> 00:01:44,872
averaged across each ship owner is really only $600.

23
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:51,427
So that's taking the total loss 600,000 to the industry averaged

24
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:57,993
over the total number of owners of 1,000 owners and we get $600.

25
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:02,294
The ship owners could think about pulling their resources together.

26
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:06,961
If each owner paid $600 a year into a fund,

27
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:13,782
that would then be enough to cover the loss of any one ship that sunk or

28
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:18,569
even the 6 ships that sink in an average year for

29
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:22,659
any individual owner in any given year.

30
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:27,529
And this basic idea of pooling resources to cover

31
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:31,923
the loss from any sinking ship for example,

32
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:40,002
changes that huge catastrophic loss from the sinking ship from an individual and

33
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:45,113
unaffordable and even unpredictable cost because

34
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:50,026
you don't know which year that loss might come.

35
00:02:50,026 --> 00:02:54,953
And it changes that into a more predictable budgeted annual

36
00:02:54,953 --> 00:02:58,214
expense that is also more affordable.

37
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:03,677
So it changes that $100,000 loss to any individual

38
00:03:03,677 --> 00:03:08,812
ship owner into a predictable $600 per year per ship

39
00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:13,961
owner that can be budgeted and is much more affordable.

40
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:19,740
And that's the basic idea of insurance.

41
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:27,201
Pooling across a group to cover the risk of some loss.

42
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:31,150
So I'm gonna now talk about a few more terms that

43
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,723
you sometimes hear related to insurance.

44
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:41,117
So a hazard is the formal term that's often used for the type of loss.

45
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:45,573
So in our example, the hazard was the ship sinking.

46
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:52,359
Another hazard we might think about is for example, a health problem.

47
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:57,406
Like an injury, a broken leg, or some other disease or

48
00:03:57,406 --> 00:04:05,115
health condition that needs some kind of medical treatment that might be a hazard.

49
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:09,851
For insurance we need to then think about what is the risk,

50
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:14,491
what is the calculated likelihood of those hazards being

51
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:19,147
experienced across some individual or group over time?

52
00:04:19,147 --> 00:04:23,096
And so in our imaginary country, the example is,

53
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:29,126
what was the risk to the country's ship owners from losing a ship each year?

54
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:33,621
And that calculated risk was that on average,

55
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:41,240
6 of the 1,000 ship owners would experience the hazard of losing a ship.

56
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:48,390
In health insurance, when we're talking about hazards that are health hazards and

57
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:53,426
the risk of experiencing those hazards, we often will talk

58
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:58,864
about a population group in a geographic area such as a country or

59
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:04,224
a state, or some community population over some time period.

60
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:11,849
And so finally, just the sort of definition of insurance

61
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:16,630
is pooling resources across some group to pay for

62
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:21,409
the costs of covering some loss from a hazard over

63
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:26,206
some period of time for each member of the group.

64
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:31,516
So this is a very basic high level definition of insurance.

65
00:05:31,516 --> 00:05:36,474
It doesn't get into many additional important issues that people who might

66
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:40,813
be more familiar with health insurance, or health economics, or

67
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:45,163
actuarial science might be thinking about that we can talk about.

68
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:50,976
But this is just to give you an overall high level definition and

69
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:55,044
understanding of how insurance operates.

70
00:05:55,044 --> 00:06:00,327
Converting that high unpredictable loss from some hazard or

71
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:05,816
set of hazards for any one member of a group into a more regular,

72
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:12,569
predictable, and smaller affordable expenditure per member of the group.

73
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:16,776
And I'm just gonna introduce a few more terms that you

74
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:21,372
may hear particularly as we talk about health insurance.

75
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:24,116
Some of these terms will be really useful for

76
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:27,020
you to get to know and understand really well.

77
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:34,605
So a premium is the name for the annual fee to own the insurance.

78
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:38,949
So you might pay your premium on an annual yearly basis.

79
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:42,833
Or when we talk about health insurance,

80
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:49,013
most health insurance is actually paid out on a a monthly basis.

81
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:54,865
But that's the the fee to own the insurance.

82
00:06:54,865 --> 00:07:00,826
Beneficiary is the term for the person or people covered by that insurance.

83
00:07:00,826 --> 00:07:06,789
So if I'm the, for example, I might purchase the health insurance,

84
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:13,069
I pay the premium but I might be buying that insurance for my whole family.

85
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:18,086
And so my spouse and my children might also be

86
00:07:18,086 --> 00:07:23,925
beneficiaries covered by that insurance policy.

87
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:29,176
Another insurance term is the term deductible,

88
00:07:29,176 --> 00:07:34,170
which is defined as the amount the beneficiary

89
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:38,523
must pay out of pocket for some service or

90
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:43,261
cost prior to the insurance policy covering

91
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:48,401
some part of the remaining cost of the service.

92
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:53,962
And so you might be familiar with a deductible from say your car insurance.

93
00:07:53,962 --> 00:07:57,302
And let's imagine that you have a fender bender and

94
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:59,788
you take your car to the mechanic, and

95
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:04,615
the mechanic says to replace your fender, that's gonna cost $500.

96
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:08,662
So you who own car insurance, think great.

97
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:14,068
My car insurance will pay for the $500 for that fender.

98
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:19,486
But your insurance policy states that you have a deductible of $200.

99
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:22,815
That means you are responsible for

100
00:08:22,815 --> 00:08:28,211
paying out of pocket paying yourself the first $200

101
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:33,509
toward that $500 fender bill from your mechanic.

102
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:37,349
Another term is co-insurance.

103
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:43,029
And co-insurance means some percent of the service

104
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:47,941
costs that the beneficiary must always pay.

105
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:51,233
So co-insurance is different from a deductible.

106
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:55,914
A deductible is an annual amount that the beneficiary

107
00:08:55,914 --> 00:09:00,289
must pay out of pocket, and it's a fixed amount.

108
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:06,720
For your car insurance in our fender bender example, that amount might be $200.

109
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,718
And so if your mechanic bill was 500 and you had to pay out of pocket $200,

110
00:09:13,718 --> 00:09:19,881
you never have to pay that deductible for the rest of that calendar, or

111
00:09:19,881 --> 00:09:25,331
calendar year, or whatever the period of your insurance is.

112
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:29,863
That's a one time amount.

113
00:09:29,863 --> 00:09:34,711
And co-insurance is some percentage of the bill,

114
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:39,908
the service costs the beneficiary must pay each time.

115
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:45,290
And so if we think about our fender bender example and the bill being $500.

116
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:51,464
If I have not paid any part of my deductible yet, when I get that $500 bill,

117
00:09:51,464 --> 00:09:55,969
I'm responsible to pay the $200 of the deductible.

118
00:09:55,969 --> 00:10:02,234
That leaves a remaining $300 towards the $500 mechanic bill.

119
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:08,718
Let's say I have co-insurance of 10%, that means I still pay or

120
00:10:08,718 --> 00:10:15,546
I still am responsible to pay an additional $30 toward the remaining

121
00:10:15,546 --> 00:10:20,922
$300 of the bill because my coinsurance is 10%.

122
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,455
And finally, another term that you might also be familiar with is the term co-pay.

123
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:33,319
A co-pay is a flat fee paid by the beneficiary

124
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:37,673
at the time of service for that service.

125
00:10:37,673 --> 00:10:43,037
Co-pays are less often seen in the car insurance example but

126
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:46,414
are very common in health insurance.

127
00:10:46,414 --> 00:10:51,176
And so the co-pay is for example when you have

128
00:10:51,176 --> 00:10:55,814
to visit your doctor you are responsible for

129
00:10:55,814 --> 00:11:03,480
a $20 co-pay no matter what other responsibilities you might have.

130
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,339
So you might also have co-insurance on the service bill and you might also have

131
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:15,047
a deductible responsibility on that service bill in addition to a co-pay.

132
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:19,970
But a co-pay is different from co-insurance because it's not a percentage

133
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,812
of the bill.

134
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:25,548
It is a flat fee amount that you pay each time and

135
00:11:25,548 --> 00:11:30,538
it does not contribute toward your deductible.

136
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:37,289
As we talk about health insurance in HMP600,

137
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:41,743
these terms you will hear a lot and so it will be really

138
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:47,009
important to be familiar with this insurance terminology and

139
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:51,380
this basic understanding of how insurance works.
