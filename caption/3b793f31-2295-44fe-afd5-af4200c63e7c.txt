1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:15,380
Okay. So while in this lecture today, we are merely going to focus on interaction.

2
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,850
Hopefully we are able to be able to cover this full module.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,500
We will have covered basics about interaction. And then one big example.

4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,460
And so we went over this first couple of slides kind of in a rush.

5
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:39,470
So now let's just get on and try to commemorate the overview encounter that we move on to new materials.

6
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:48,740
So previously when we think linear regression models and this is the typical regression model would fit right in this example to covariance.

7
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:58,780
And if you look at a such a model now if we try to interpret a beta zero and a bit of luck in a zero, that is how these are.

8
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,700
One is mean of the response.

9
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:08,030
Whatever the response is, that is mean the response or average response where you set all the other queries equal to zero.

10
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:15,860
In this case at one, that's what you would do because only one adds to X, one has to are zero zero.

11
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:22,040
Right. And this, of course, most significantly may not make sense, but what it is,

12
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:31,370
is how our interpretation of that isn't or it is a better one is that they are one is that you need to model the the

13
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:41,030
strength of the association between Y and that's one where in fact that's one adjusting for extra holding as two constant.

14
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,420
So by holding as true constant what we mean is that.

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:55,490
Well, we just thinks as to whether, well, it doesn't matter which value you fix if and who is, let's say if actually sex variable,

16
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:05,899
then it could be you said x2 to be either male or female right to a category or if you consider has to be continues let's say age then

17
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:15,380
by holding X to cost and that means by you could look at of people at age 30 and 40 or 50 doesn't matter as long as you fixed age.

18
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,100
Well that's by holding a constant and then x one is actually mean change in y per y unit.

19
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,830
So the minute you like her y unit increases in x with x without a constant.

20
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:37,820
So if you look at it, then the effect of x one on a y in this model now in fact does not depend on has to it doesn't matter where you are looking at.

21
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,710
So it is as long as you hold absolute constant, then they find on the x one is a constant.

22
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,080
But in practice are often that we are.

23
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:55,099
I mean that the effect of x one may depend on which for example,

24
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,470
if adds to is age may depend on which age you are looking at people at different age there

25
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:10,250
are no longer one or for females ever for females and for males they sat on x one on a Y,

26
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:23,540
maybe different, right? So in this case, now we need a, you know, you can call this extension again your regression model to to account for that.

27
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,340
And that is also called interaction in a to collaborative case.

28
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,790
I mean, graduate is just a product of X one in X two.

29
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:42,740
Of course, later we're going to see more general examples. But for two of our four two covariates, the key in order of x1x2.

30
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,019
And again, for theta one, beta two,

31
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:56,740
these two usually are women are referred to as the me that we announced in the beta three urinate referred to as the interaction front,

32
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,490
gradually tapping into the interaction.

33
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:11,219
Here are two common types of interactions and in this answer I don't think of these two terminologies.

34
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,710
There are not all that commonly used. But anyway, I mean they appear here, so let's just mention that briefly.

35
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:22,590
So one is a syncing synergism.

36
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:30,190
So that means x1 the kind of x1 extreme rather than that of the actual effect.

37
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,150
Yeah. The other one is called an antagonism.

38
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,410
So X1 weakens the actual effect.

39
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:46,560
So basically it just shows which direction the interaction is, whether it's arousal that throttling of another weakens by another.

40
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,550
So you need to look at whether interaction is significant or not.

41
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,450
We look at whether beta three, the radical event.

42
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,880
So that's beta three here. The radical regression we look at this whether this is.

43
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,040
We look at whether this is significant or not.

44
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:22,919
If better three is not equal to zero is not zero, then there is a significant interaction in fact, but it's been a three is equal to zero.

45
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:31,050
Then there's no interaction anymore. There's no significant interaction between between zero two.

46
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,400
So this is how we tested the significant regression term.

47
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:42,480
So it's not insignificant that I mean, there is no evidence of effective modifications.

48
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,850
So now the words that you find out that's one does not vary with extra.

49
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:54,530
As long as the adds to a constant, then the x one in fact is a fixed is a fixed number.

50
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:01,949
The letter of the actual that's that's what happens if the reaction is not a significant but if the interaction

51
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:09,569
is significant later obviously in many many examples that means the effect of X one will vary with x two.

52
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:14,700
It depends on which actual value you are looking at. The x one effect on y may change.

53
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:24,120
Okay. So that's that. And while the main facts were a little interpreted.

54
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:34,690
Detailed interpretation of the many facts. So now let's take a look at how to interpret the parameters in the interaction model.

55
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:45,010
If we focus on the mean, that's the model that has no interaction, meaning facts of this model, no interaction.

56
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:59,770
And then if we look at the effect of X one, a Y, well, here the fact we can think of the effect as the first group on Y with this X1.

57
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:07,390
I know if you're familiar with countless, you can look at it this way, but really it's not necessary because the model is so simple.

58
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,950
So beta one here quantifies the effect of X1.

59
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,820
Oh, that's the you've had X1 all white.

60
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:27,280
When you have a manufactured model, however, you know, interaction mode in an interaction model, you go see that X1 appears both here and here.

61
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:34,479
So then the effect of X1 on y is more complicated than in the May effects model.

62
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,080
Very little has one x1, one term of X1.

63
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:45,160
So then here. Now when we look at the effect of X1 on why would they draw action?

64
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:53,620
Now, again, if you can look at this by taking the derivative with respect to x one that shows the effect on x14,

65
00:07:53,630 --> 00:08:06,800
we can see what interest you have to derive those s as the theta zero plus one must not really a true performance of one class B at all times.

66
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,030
X I truly must be right.

67
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:21,350
So then if you look at the effect of x one, the one that is this beta one plus beta three times x two, that is just ahead.

68
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:28,250
Okay. So in this case that if you look at the factor, that's one on one.

69
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:35,420
The fact not depends on X to value. This is apparent, right, because here there's X two involved.

70
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,790
So the fact that he has an actual value.

71
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:46,940
So the interpretation in this case is more complex than than in the first case where you only have one term that involved X one.

72
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:58,550
So while this is sort of just repeating what we just said, okay.

73
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:07,150
So in the main facts model where there's no interaction, the speed of one piece that in fact, I'd explain why.

74
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:15,920
But in the interaction model, if you look at a beta one alone now beta one alone, that means here,

75
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:25,610
if you look at the speed at one alone, it is not the effect of x one on Y anymore because there is an x one here as well.

76
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:33,320
And so this beta three times x two, that also is part of the effect of x one on Y.

77
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,470
So in this case, now that he has an X treatment, he has a.

78
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,810
Now in this case here, this is very important to highlight.

79
00:09:52,960 --> 00:10:02,600
So in the interaction model, interaction model, the beta one, if we will, to interpret here.

80
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:13,130
Now, as we mentioned in the interaction model, now beta one is not the effect of X1 a lot because there is another term involved here.

81
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:22,630
But in this case, what is the interpretation on beta one? Now this is similar to before so to interpret.

82
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,310
But you know what? Well, we need to get rid of these two terms.

83
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,740
That's that shows that in fact have been on one. Now, in order to get rid of the last two terms.

84
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,350
Now we can latch beta two to be equal to zero.

85
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,280
So if we look at an actual equal to zero, not a value.

86
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,870
If x two is equal to zero, then there is no this two terms anymore.

87
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,580
And then it shows the fact of x1 one all.

88
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:57,070
So in other words, the interpretation of this be one this term alone.

89
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,860
Now, this is actually given here.

90
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:13,630
This is the change in the explanation of why per y unit increase in X1 where you essentially in fact on the X1, a Y when we look at X2 equal to zero.

91
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:23,620
Okay. When we look at X2, equal to zero. So for example, if X is a later, we're going to see many example if X2 is H.

92
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:40,910
That to me is, well, let's say X to his age. X one is less a weight then then the beta one is actually the effect of weight all.

93
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,870
And that's why his blood pressure is the weight of blood pressure.

94
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:53,120
Looking at the people who have h01, this may not make sense, but that's actually the interpretation of beta one.

95
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,410
Because without interaction they found the weight on the response will vary with age.

96
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,440
We're better with age, but if we look at beta one alone, that is that weight.

97
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:14,420
In fact, when we look at people or at age zero. So this is the the interpretation on beta one.

98
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:22,460
This is quite different from the original better one in the main facts model in the of house model, the individual beta one is.

99
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:34,899
The fact of weight of a mean blood pressure holding house to consider means that it doesn't matter which age you are looking at age 38,

100
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,400
48, 50 doesn't matter.

101
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:46,500
So as long as you look at people at the same age, then on average their wage, they will effect on the blood pressure he's been a on.

102
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:58,930
But in the interaction terms now in order to interpret this better one along that you would have to look at the people at with would equal to zero.

103
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,350
So that's that's the interpretation of the means and a similar you can interpret

104
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:13,630
Peter to bear to is that if I had an ax to a Y when X one is equal to zero.

105
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:22,470
You look at an excellent. Okay.

106
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,249
Yeah. Yeah. So basically you're an [INAUDIBLE].

107
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:34,260
And just say that while we need to be extremely careful when interpreting visions for the meaning of act,

108
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:39,720
when there is interaction in the moment, so we just delay interpretation.

109
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,750
Okay, so we are going to see this over and over again using different examples in different perspective.

110
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,950
Okay. So the next then while still this is to show how to interpret this, this different dataset.

111
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:21,840
So if we. Now this is the model with the interaction, and then we can write for the model in the following two ways.

112
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,780
One way is that we combine the speed of 1x1 with a speed of 3x1x2.

113
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:35,250
Then we have the speed at one plus beta three times x two time x one class beta two times x.

114
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,500
And that's one way to, to, to look at the model.

115
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:57,980
Another way is. Okay, so we. We combine this term with this term so that we have a better to fast better three times X one times at three x.

116
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,960
So this is x two and 3.3 x two.

117
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:12,579
I saw them plus beta one times x one. There are two ways of looking at this and this actually gives the interpretation of the X1.

118
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,050
In fact, give the X1. In fact, it has 3x2 effect.

119
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,730
So for example, here, if we look at this model,

120
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:33,100
this model look looks like similar to the main model where there's been a zero intercept plus something times X1 plus something times x2.

121
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,980
But the regression coefficient of x1 now depends on that.

122
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,130
In a various with x without these the effect of x1 on y, the various one x.

123
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:51,760
Similarly, if you look at x two effect, write it in the following way.

124
00:15:52,570 --> 00:16:00,130
Then the effect of that that's true of y depends on x1, given which value of x1 you are looking at.

125
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:11,630
And there's been a three here. I think what is tricky is the interpretation of Beta three.

126
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:24,340
That is the coefficient. Corrosion in front of well a coalition of for the for the interaction term.

127
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:35,970
So the a three here and if you can interpret the three in this in this way.

128
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,989
So Beta three here.

129
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:47,420
If we look at the first eight fashion, if we look out of the first line right here, then that beta three is actually while beta three appears here.

130
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:56,810
This is where Peter three is. The beta three is part of X1, in fact, because it is part of the radical vision of X1.

131
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:03,110
So as part of the X1, in fact now it is mentioned in X1, in fact.

132
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:13,310
So if, for example, if you increase X1 by one unit, then I'll average a y will increase by this much better.

133
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:21,530
Three is is part of the mean change in mean change in the X1 in fact per one unit increase in extra.

134
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:27,470
So if you increase X2 by one unit, you are going to see this effect change by beta three.

135
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:33,560
She's than three. So that's this is the interpretation.

136
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,430
Later, we're going to see a concrete more concrete example.

137
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:43,850
But this is this is the bare three dimensional and X1, in fact.

138
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:49,969
So it's part of the X like that I mentioned explaining sat for for one unit standing next to that.

139
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:57,890
That is what they have released. It shows how the effect on the X1 varies with different levels of x.

140
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:11,280
And a similar thing. If you look at this flight over here, the second the second Los Angeles fracture,

141
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:18,870
then this shows the mean change in x two effect that is here because it appears in front of X.

142
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,290
So it shows part of the actual effect.

143
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:30,060
So it's the mean change, an x two effect for one unit for one unit increase in x one.

144
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:38,940
So in other words, now the actual effect is given by this, but it is in fact varies with x one banner.

145
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:47,969
Now the beta three quantifies the how the x two in fact online now this looks so for y unit

146
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:56,850
increasing x one for y you increase x one they had amounts to a y varies or increases by beta three.

147
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,140
So that is the. The invitation.

148
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:16,360
Okay. So this yeah, this this part is shows just that in an abstract way how we interpret this interaction is made us three.

149
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,330
She? Okay.

150
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,850
Looking at the interaction,

151
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:38,610
the best way to look at interaction is to start to look at interaction is to look at one categorical variable and one continuous variable.

152
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:48,150
This is probably the easiest or the most straightforward case of having good understanding of interactions.

153
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,390
Now, let's take a look at a concrete example. Let's take a look at how to make a concrete interpretation.

154
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,740
Well, here, this is example of pediatric hypertension.

155
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,469
So let's say that if we are interested in examining the relationship between SBP,

156
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:13,799
so the systolic blood pressure and the two covariates, one is age, one is gender or gender.

157
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,090
We're in this example considered two categories.

158
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:27,090
So gender or sex variable. But anyways, so let's, let's consider here we have two covariates, age and gender and age and event.

159
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:33,150
Well, there are a while. There are several questions that we can ask,

160
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:39,420
and in these questions they can be answered by looking at different models, either with or without interaction.

161
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,790
So for example, I mean, one question is for males and females of the same age,

162
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,840
we'll see that of the same age that me is holding the age constant around the same age.

163
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:03,330
And then there's only age constant. So holding data constant the question as well.

164
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:09,240
Then the question asked of is SBP different?

165
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,110
Of our average, you know, for males and females.

166
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:20,230
So this that means that we are holding data constant and we adjust for age.

167
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:27,160
We want to see whether as BP differs between males and females, whether there is a gender effect.

168
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:39,210
So this is essentially what this question asks for. So to answer those questions, we build as far as we can use this model.

169
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,010
To look at the look at the effect of.

170
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,050
From an imploding age constant.

171
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:09,520
That's to be constant. Want to see whether the V.P. why?

172
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,900
Depends on whether there's a difference between gender.

173
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,720
This. We can use this model to answer this question.

174
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,440
I think my question would be addressed. Now, the second question.

175
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:28,590
Is the gender effect on SBP. Independent of age.

176
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:37,770
Now, to answer this question, fitting this model is not a sufficient anymore.

177
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,520
The reason is that if you look at this model.

178
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:56,080
Once you finish this, this moment, you're implicitly assuming that the age, the gender benefits of your inclusion,

179
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:04,240
assuming the gender effect, does not depend on age, because holding a constant and a gender, in fact doesn't vary with age.

180
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:09,910
That's what you're assuming by fitting this model as this is not so by this one.

181
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:15,630
This model you are assuming will add to the gender if that is in, by the way.

182
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:22,570
So this model cannot be used to answer this question. So in order to answer this question, we need to find a model that has interaction.

183
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:51,600
But few tomorrow will interaction. And then we can look at of whether the interaction term is significant or not.

184
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,879
If the interaction is not as significant, that means there is no such term.

185
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,640
Then we go back to the main facts model. That means gender, in fact does not depend on age, is independent of age.

186
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:10,110
However, if if this beta interaction term is significant, it's never that different from zero.

187
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:16,800
That means the gender, in fact, all as indeed it depends on age.

188
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,750
It depends on which age you are looking at. So.

189
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,060
So anyway, in order to understand second question,

190
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:30,510
we have to look at the interaction model with the interaction and then to look at whether this behavior is significant or not.

191
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:43,450
And. So the third question, does that mean SBP change with age, changes with age?

192
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:51,610
Well, here this question is a little bit vague because it doesn't say whether whether adjusting gender or not, whether holding gender consent or not.

193
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,660
So here, I mean, mathematically it ought to be cracked.

194
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:03,360
A similar fate a model with. With a gender in those women eight image.

195
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:12,329
You could have you could fit this model. And this model would would it be okay to answer this question alone?

196
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:18,030
But, I mean, typically when you have more covariates in the model and if you have reason to

197
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:22,600
believe that the covariates are also maybe strongly associated with why you are,

198
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:28,080
we adjust for those variables. So in this case at least, that would like to address for forum for gender.

199
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:44,000
So then you get you can of this model. Then this model allows you to make a conclusion whether the mean of speed depends on age.

200
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:48,050
But now we address for gender and this is the main facts model.

201
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:58,130
And then the last question is age, in fact, is the age is, I repeat, the same for males and for females.

202
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:07,220
So again, the question is whether the covariate, the copy after the effect of one covariate varies, depends on the level of another.

203
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:14,630
And here we again, we need to fit the same the same interaction model.

204
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:24,940
The international as well because they derive from although allows us to derive from auto and if this beta interaction is significant,

205
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:29,830
it's not a zero. That means the effect of age really depends on gender.

206
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:40,590
Depends on whether which which gender category you're looking at. So these are you of the models that we can fit to answer these questions.

207
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,770
And you can see that,

208
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:52,719
especially if we're for the second round before the first question in ask they ask whether in fact a one covariant of a response,

209
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,240
whether that varies across vary depending on the side of the matter.

210
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:03,660
So to answer some questions, we have to find a model that has interaction in model.

211
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:20,510
Any questions? Yes. Regarding the second question, if we suspected that there was an interaction between two variables,

212
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:23,840
should we always also include the individual terms in the model?

213
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:28,120
Yeah, that's a very good question. Later, we're going to talk a lot more.

214
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:33,410
We're going to see one example about. Yes, the other.

215
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:40,630
When we we include interaction only after we include both the main facts and of course,

216
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,710
better than RNA, but rather than that involve either interaction.

217
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,550
This is based on the consideration of interpretation.

218
00:27:51,070 --> 00:28:00,220
So a model that does not have many facts. Let's say in the model you only have say in such amount of beta zero plus data.

219
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:10,940
That's a times age times gender, right so only interaction in the model and this you that we do not recommend fit inside a model.

220
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:19,810
I mean it's not a saying that mathematically it's not a possible math why this may be possible, but you know that we do not fit this other model.

221
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:27,370
The reason is that it is a little bit hard to interpret this model because because there is no data may in fact no generally.

222
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:33,220
In fact, this is especially true if you have a bunch of covariate in this case, you only have two covariance.

223
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:41,800
It may be okay for you to still interpret this model, but let's say they were data, so you have plenty of covariance, which is not uncommon at all.

224
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,180
You have 20 covariance, then you can consider different combinations of interactions.

225
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:54,790
In that case, if you have a interaction, but you do not have the MI facts of the covariance that involve the interaction,

226
00:28:54,790 --> 00:29:03,220
then interfere on the lot of become very tricky. So that's that's the reason why we strongly recommend not creating such a model.

227
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:10,340
Again, he's not saying that this model is not possible, but for interpretation, purpose, we do not recommend it.

228
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:17,360
It's like a model. Any other questions?

229
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:25,460
So third question just implicitly means adjusting for gender.

230
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,470
No, no. This is this question. This is a little bit vague.

231
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,480
So I'm in for the third question.

232
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,420
If you fit a model without a customer vendor in your ear, well, that's a crack.

233
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:45,750
Borrow the film. Answer this question. But if you are I mean, we because we have gender so we just include gender in the model.

234
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,899
So maybe we should make the question as explicit as the first one.

235
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,760
So doesn't mean as we be changed with age, adjusting for gender or holding gender consent.

236
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,250
So in this question, we have adjusted for ten.

237
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:08,860
In this question you don't have to adjust for to ender but but I mean because we have we do have genders also.

238
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:15,400
Okay. So then we make this adjusting.

239
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:22,730
You. Melanie added this part.

240
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,210
Okay.

241
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:40,250
So my point is that my point is that if there is no addressing for gender stated in this part alone, you could have fit a model with age along in it.

242
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:49,250
You could. I mean, I'm not going to say you're wrong by fitting that model, because the fact that people say you need to adjust for gender.

243
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:55,820
Right. However, I mean. Like in practice.

244
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,150
If I give you a data set as you like, what are you found on Asia?

245
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:08,690
And if you have a strong prior knowledge that of gender, also the fact made the fact that as VPN you might want to adjust for gender.

246
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:13,040
Probably not. You are not interested in.

247
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,610
But the simple Martin. Simple model of that of age.

248
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:22,750
Oh, okay. I mean, this.

249
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,810
That. Okay. So. Yeah.

250
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:30,170
To make. To make things super clear, let's just say the question now.

251
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:41,000
Assume doesn't mean as SVP change with age adjusted for gender not explicit as you have to adjust for gender and then we fridge will figure this not.

252
00:31:52,050 --> 00:32:00,450
Okay. And then let's take a look at now the interpretation but in potato.

253
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:05,460
Yeah. First, let's look at the main effects motive. Now the main facts model.

254
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,710
In this case, we have age, we have we have gender now.

255
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,280
And age, of course, is continuous.

256
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:20,790
Now gender, we are treating female as the we're pretty male as the reference,

257
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:26,579
I guess if we define in this way because when somebody is female now the calf is equal to one.

258
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:31,020
So. So in this case, then we are treating. So this is the answer to treating.

259
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,830
Mills as a reference as the reference group.

260
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,300
Oh. And then if we when we interpret the parameters in the model, we see that.

261
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,290
We had zero here. This is not, of course,

262
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:57,620
the but the Intersect that is interpreted we interpret has been a bit a zero in the

263
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:04,160
intercept when both cobras are equal to zero so that there is no no other terms.

264
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:13,190
But then beta zero is the mean sbp the mean response for people with age zero.

265
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,909
Yeah. For men, right. Males, whatever you do zero.

266
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:24,120
That means for males. So this is the mean SBP for males who are at age zero, right?

267
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:29,480
So this is the interpretation of the intercept and the beta one.

268
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,790
Peter one here. This is the age effect.

269
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:44,850
Adjusting for gender, adjusting for gender. So then by adjusting for gender.

270
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:54,520
By holding gender constant. What it means is that it doesn't matter whether we are looking male, we are looking at a male or female is gonna matter.

271
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:00,190
As long as we hold a gender constant, then beta one is the aging fact.

272
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:07,320
And indeed if you look at being a one year beta one is equal to the mean change, right?

273
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:12,219
This is the change in the mean I mean the change in the mean SBP.

274
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:17,440
You know, for one unit increase in age from a to a plus one,

275
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:24,460
we increase of eight from A to a plus one for one unit increasing age by holding gender hostage.

276
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:31,210
Now holding then, Rick also means that either we are looking at females or they're looking at a balance.

277
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:41,800
So that's why here we have either having one available half equal to one for have equal to zero against people who are zero.

278
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,950
So, so this is the interpretation on beta.

279
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:56,200
What better way to use the mean change or change in the mean response in mean SBP for y unit increase in

280
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:04,390
age holding gender constant means either we are looking at the females or we're looking at the males.

281
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:13,090
So the effect of age does not vary between between males and females.

282
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:18,790
So it's independent of gender. No beta two here.

283
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:37,950
Theta two is the effect of. Theta two is the effect of gender on SBP by holding a two constant by holding it closer.

284
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,490
What we mean is that we are looking at people at the same age.

285
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,980
It doesn't matter which age you are looking at. As long as a fixed age.

286
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,950
So one of the better two is the change in the mean SBP.

287
00:35:55,130 --> 00:36:00,930
I mean speaking for one unit in Chris in in in gender.

288
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,680
That means well for one unit of gender aren't going to going to take problems right.

289
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,480
In this case females equal to one and females equal for males is equal to zero.

290
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:15,510
So for one unit increasing in in gender holding age constant.

291
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:22,410
So a is equal to small and now this small A can be any event as long as you fix this small.

292
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:34,920
Read this. This is the interpretation below. So it does not vary with age as long as the age caused and then the gender effect.

293
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,630
Sorry, but the gender is actually no better for you.

294
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:51,250
The gender effect and does not very well with age. So the me fax model now.

295
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:07,640
It's easier now with the categorical variable involved. It's easier to make a plot device if that like.

296
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:18,320
So if you look out of this model here, then for this model, I'm on the it over here.

297
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:24,470
So for female or maybe for male, we look at a male first because now is the reference group for males.

298
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,800
SBP is equal to beta zero plus beta one times H,

299
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:45,530
times H plus absolute minus for male and for female that's SBP equal to beta zero plus the female gamma is equal to one and so plus every one.

300
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:52,350
So here we have been at two. So beta zero plus beta to be a one times h plus absolute.

301
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,950
If you look at it this way, we are the worst. The this is a regression line.

302
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,910
The model is slightly different for males and for females.

303
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:11,920
The difference is in the intercept. So for male intercept Brazil, but for female, the intercept is better, zero plus better.

304
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:21,470
The slope is the same. The edge effect is the same. So if you make a plot of this, then you'll have two parallel lines.

305
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,240
And Y is for a male and always for a female. So let's say this is for male, this is for Veena.

306
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,570
And again, both wise, they have the same slope. They know the same effect on H, so the same slope.

307
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:38,240
So the intercept intercepts are different. So for for male intercept is beta zero.

308
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:44,150
So this is beta zero here. But for female the intercept is beta zero plus beta two.

309
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:48,800
This is intercept for female.

310
00:38:50,610 --> 00:39:00,360
This is the difference or the graphical representation of the model that does not have interaction.

311
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:08,970
She? Okay. And so we have two parallel lines because they have the same slope.

312
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:14,190
Now, with the interaction, we have interaction model.

313
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,230
Now here we have interaction between age and gender.

314
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,190
In this case, we can look at this in two, two ways.

315
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:34,200
So if we write it as if we write it as well in this way.

316
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:43,590
So three one age plus beta, two plus beta, three age times F, then beta three appears here.

317
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:49,830
So it becomes part of the gender effect of SBP on the immune response.

318
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:56,290
So by writing it this way, we are asking this question.

319
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,860
So each page us address the difference. So we are we are still adjusting for age.

320
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,520
So age is age as as the difference in me as BP.

321
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:13,570
Between the males and females as a constant across all ages.

322
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:19,689
So while this question is a little bit intense, stated in a slightly vulgar way.

323
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:31,330
But but anyway, so this thing is also the question of whether the gender effect on SBP me SBP whether that in fact depends on age.

324
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:37,400
Right. So here if beta three is not a zero.

325
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:45,040
Before is not even visible Lebanese. The effect of gender on women SBP.

326
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,970
Actually it depends on age. It varies with age.

327
00:40:51,100 --> 00:41:00,280
So that's why is asked whether is the mean SBP between males and females constant across all ages.

328
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:04,150
So whether an event depends on age. Now.

329
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:15,400
Beta three I should qualify as Mama Bear three is a corgi that quantifies whether the the gender effect depends on h.

330
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:20,290
This is one way to look at immigration in other ways. Here we write it in this way.

331
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,579
But in this way we have the age.

332
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,570
In fact, now the bigger three becomes the part of the age, in fact.

333
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:44,140
So this is the effect of age of SBP and this effect of beta three shows whether this effect of age depends on gender.

334
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,849
So if beta three is not equal to zero, one is the age.

335
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:57,700
In fact, the age effect here mean SBP varies from males to females.

336
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:01,149
So when you compare this two categories when there's a beta.

337
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:09,100
So this is why it is as is said. So does that mean Chanda SBP per year of age, per year change of age.

338
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:13,720
Now that's age, in fact, whether that's equal for males and females.

339
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:19,839
So this is the again.

340
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:31,210
So I mean, we are sort of repeating what we what we saw at the beginning of this lecture, but this is by writing it in different ways.

341
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:43,000
You can see that the beta three it represents rather the effect of one covariate varies with the level of the other corporate.

342
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:56,940
And then if we try to interpret this model, this tomorrow, again,

343
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:03,330
it's easier if we because now we have a22 category in categorical, dichotomous, categorical variable.

344
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:07,630
So we can write this model in two separate lives.

345
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:12,310
So for males that is F equal to zero, whatever is equal to zero.

346
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:17,010
There's no this term. No, this term. So it's below zero plus beta one.

347
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:21,040
H was beta zero plus beta one H plus absolute function.

348
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:24,450
And that's for female. Now for for.

349
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:28,320
Oh, sorry. That's that's for male and for female. Alpha is equal to one.

350
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:35,100
What is equal to one? So if you replace F by Y, you replace F by one.

351
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,560
In this case that you have beta zero plus beta two, that's the intercept.

352
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:44,470
And then beta one plus beta three.

353
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:50,680
That's not a fact. So that we can run it as a follow.

354
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:55,330
So better to zero plus, better to the intercept and better 100 or three.

355
00:43:55,330 --> 00:44:01,630
That's that's a fact. That's one that's that's for female that's one one half is equal to one.

356
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,620
So again, we have two lines well over a female and a well-known four for a male.

357
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:12,090
Right. So, again, if we make a plot of this to.

358
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:20,310
Right now, if you look at how SBP on average how it depends on age.

359
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:28,020
Now there's tools. They have both. Divert intercepts and divert slopes.

360
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:33,030
So here I say we have this line and we have this line.

361
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:38,130
They are not parallel anymore. They're not parallel.

362
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:48,630
So let's say this is for again, this is for female, for male, this is for females and for the intercept for male.

363
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:52,080
We can see the intercept is how much the intercept is.

364
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,010
But as you say, let's not speed as it.

365
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:05,850
This is bands who intercept before you and then intercepted it for a female that's been a zero plus beta to.

366
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,150
So then this pull in here. This is better. Zero plus better to.

367
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:23,770
This is The Intercept for CNN. And then the two slopes the slope for four mile, the speed of one.

368
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:36,300
So that means that the slope for male this has been a 100.

369
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:43,060
So this line is. Yeah.

370
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:49,130
Okay, so maybe. Maybe we can easily show this. Not so. So let's say this is age eight.

371
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:56,580
This is age in class one. Be rather slow. Actually, that's that's that's why you change age from A to eight plus one.

372
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:02,400
That's actually how much change you have. Inquirer.

373
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:12,430
This has been a lot. This is a slump. This has been a month. And the slope for female that's been a one plus minus three.

374
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,750
So this means that if you change A from A to a plus one.

375
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:23,000
Now, this here is a spade, a spade a spade of three.

376
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:32,799
That's the slope for female. So now this two lines.

377
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,830
They have different intercepts and differ on the slopes.

378
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:44,160
So the idea was if you look at an effect, if you look at how SBP changed with age.

379
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:51,700
We can see that indeed, the age, in fact, as we've seen, depends on which gender you are looking at.

380
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:58,110
And so so for age, if you vary from 30 to 35,

381
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:06,570
then the children as V.P. for males is different from the children as being for females because they have different slopes.

382
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,960
And this is one way to interpret like graphical illustration of the of the interaction that

383
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:20,480
factory direction where you have a categorical variable that holds category variables.

384
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:32,210
It's easier to illustrate this using a graph. Okay.

385
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:41,440
Any questions? So much. Okay.

386
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:48,850
And then let's finish next slide and then we will take a break.

387
00:47:49,660 --> 00:48:00,010
So let's look at this interaction model. Now, the question one is, is the adjustment gender adjusted a gender effect on SBP?

388
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:11,240
Independent of H. So in other words, we are looking at whether they are addressing the gender effect, whether the gender effect on SBP,

389
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:17,690
whether that's independent of age or this is a clearer question about an interaction term,

390
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:23,890
whether there is a interaction between age and gender and a similar we can ask a question in the other way.

391
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,860
So is the aggressive age, in fact depends on gender.

392
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,670
So whether that's same for males and for females,

393
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:39,830
whether that in fact depends on gender and in both the questions they actually ask, essentially that may mean the same thing.

394
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:47,060
They ask whether respect of three should be in the model or not, whether being a three is equal to zero or not,

395
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:54,440
whether they in fact a wonderful response vary with the other marriage.

396
00:48:55,070 --> 00:49:03,800
So in this case we are casting the novelist is is it a three equal to zero versus alternative that being three is not equal to zero.

397
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10,930
We're casting. Sandra, novelist.

398
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:24,180
And of course, once we formulate the question, once we translate this question into this, well, this is testing this hypothesis and this is our model,

399
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:34,030
then not everything should become very familiar because we have talking about how to test the mother of an eagle or beta in a lower level,

400
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:43,520
and that's equal to zero or not. And here we are because we are testing for a single beta now we can rely either on our past or t test.

401
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:50,420
So the advertising in this case is the ads for some of square, you know,

402
00:49:50,420 --> 00:50:01,729
by adding by fate of three that is the interaction by animator three into a model that already has been in zero one and been a

403
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:16,129
tool in the model divided by its the freedom that's equal to one because we has one data and dividing it by the SC or beta zero,

404
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:18,800
beta one Peter two and we have three. Right.

405
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:29,690
So and as I see of that, the full model is the one here and divided by degree freedom and minus P so in this case is minus four because we have one,

406
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:30,970
two, three, four, four valence.

407
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:42,010
And thus we will follow under a novelist as news will follow after his vision would once and still minister people's freedom.

408
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:58,989
This is the F test and t test is what is beta three hatch minus the zero log the out of

409
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:05,260
spaceflight under not have others is which is zero then divided by the center error of data.

410
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:19,570
So we have and this is latest statistics and then under on and on but this is this will follow t disclosure with the minus PD what freedom minus four.

411
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,990
Okay. So this is how we answer this question.

412
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:40,020
Right. So again, you see that once we translated this question, I think for now, I think the the hard part,

413
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:46,160
it seems to be, especially because we are seeing interaction, we are seeing the price for the first time.

414
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:53,089
The hard part is the translation of the question, the how to connect this question to our model, what it was.

415
00:51:53,090 --> 00:52:02,210
We translate this question into this this hypothesis, and then things become things that we know.

416
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,900
Okay, so we will take a seven minute break and we will be doing a lot.

417
00:52:20,355 --> 00:52:32,265
So we looked at the question, one that is, while we just translated into this housing task where there have been a three is equal to zero one.

418
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:41,115
Now, let's take a look at another question. No, see now the same model that has been gradually.

419
00:52:44,365 --> 00:52:50,765
Please try one of these.

420
00:52:51,415 --> 00:52:55,495
So the question is, does mean SBP change with age?

421
00:52:56,305 --> 00:52:59,905
Change with age. What about sex variable?

422
00:53:00,175 --> 00:53:03,685
Right now we are looking at this model.

423
00:53:04,675 --> 00:53:11,545
Now let's first let's focus on age. For example, ISO, how, where it has and whether as we change with age.

424
00:53:13,405 --> 00:53:17,125
Now, if we look at the age, age up here is both here and here.

425
00:53:18,825 --> 00:53:24,114
So in this case, food has for the fact we have to combine this to terms.

426
00:53:24,115 --> 00:53:27,385
So let's write it in the following way. It becomes easier.

427
00:53:27,835 --> 00:53:34,494
And if your later if you're super familiar with the interaction model, you don't have to do this or hot button.

428
00:53:34,495 --> 00:53:38,005
But again, beginning is probably easier if we exclude, right?

429
00:53:38,005 --> 00:53:46,075
It has as this conversion effect of age and plus the effect of gender to answer this question.

430
00:53:47,365 --> 00:53:56,095
So in this case, we see that this is the age. In fact, this is the age, and they depend on gender.

431
00:53:56,395 --> 00:54:00,535
Well, depending on whether beta three zero or not, it may depend on gender.

432
00:54:02,635 --> 00:54:11,995
So in this case, to test the effect now we need to look at this whole thing, not only beta one, not only beta one anymore.

433
00:54:12,175 --> 00:54:17,035
So we need to look at it both both beta one and a bit of three, because both terms involve age.

434
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:23,965
So in this case, liabilities is is whether beta one is equal to beta three is equal to zero.

435
00:54:23,965 --> 00:54:28,345
Whether whether both are able to do when both are equal to zero, then there is no age.

436
00:54:28,345 --> 00:54:35,245
In fact, one either one is not zero, then there is an age effect.

437
00:54:36,805 --> 00:54:44,035
So whereas in this versus while beta one is not equal to zero or beta three is not zero.

438
00:54:44,305 --> 00:54:56,305
So at least one of these two is not equal to zero. And again, after we translate this question into this hypothesis now,

439
00:54:56,305 --> 00:55:02,515
we should be very familiar with how to carry out this hypothesis and pessimist hypothesis,

440
00:55:02,935 --> 00:55:06,535
because if we are testing to beta so we can, we can use the F test.

441
00:55:07,135 --> 00:55:17,935
So the extra sample square by adding beta one in a fit of three in the model in the model that Ana has beta zero and beta two.

442
00:55:21,305 --> 00:55:26,725
Divided by a corresponding bigger freighter. Now we're casting Kubota so that your freedom is too.

443
00:55:28,105 --> 00:55:31,165
That's the numerator and denominator is the same.

444
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:34,255
Is still the SC for the whole lot for the football.

445
00:55:37,475 --> 00:55:45,595
Divided by its founding of freedom, as in Linos for Amnesty and other fourth, and in this case under law.

446
00:55:45,615 --> 00:55:52,975
But this is the real problem that families usually with two mothers for Cuba.

447
00:55:55,955 --> 00:56:00,935
And that's how we passed the age. In fact, in this case, we.

448
00:56:07,755 --> 00:56:21,395
Yes. Under the circumstances where it makes more sense to conduct a T test with like maybe three over the six with both of the packs.

449
00:56:23,325 --> 00:56:31,395
Yes. So like in the first one, this has really depends on what questions you are more interested.

450
00:56:31,995 --> 00:56:40,875
Like in the first case. This question here, this question as to whether the ag effect, whether a defect depends on gender.

451
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:49,335
Then we should pass the beta three in itself because that house, whether a fact depends on gender.

452
00:56:50,265 --> 00:56:54,615
But the second question was whether there is an age effect.

453
00:56:54,935 --> 00:56:59,595
What does the mean as we speak? Depends on age in this case.

454
00:57:00,075 --> 00:57:11,505
Now we should look at. Whatever turn that involve age because that as a as part of the agency that it really depends on deciding

455
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:20,565
the question of the interest and the hypothesis should be formulated because I wasn't interested.

456
00:57:20,585 --> 00:57:25,115
Once you have a question that you translate ahead into a hypothesis and then you pass it.

457
00:57:32,175 --> 00:57:40,065
Yeah. I hope you guys can see the difference between those two questions and the first question asked whether the fact of age depends on gender,

458
00:57:41,325 --> 00:57:47,845
while the second one asks whether there is any fact there is a difference between these two questions.

459
00:57:52,905 --> 00:58:00,615
Okay. And then for the interaction.

460
00:58:06,535 --> 00:58:10,595
For the. Now, again, this is the interaction appraisal.

461
00:58:10,685 --> 00:58:17,105
This is similar to before we we write this in Raja Modo has two separate lines for male and female.

462
00:58:17,675 --> 00:58:19,325
So we have done this.

463
00:58:19,475 --> 00:58:28,295
So for male we have a line and for female we have another line that the two lies and they have different intercepts and different slopes.

464
00:58:32,415 --> 00:58:36,435
So then how do we. One question is how do we calculate?

465
00:58:37,845 --> 00:58:44,055
95% accommodation level for every fact among females now looking for females.

466
00:58:45,645 --> 00:58:51,075
For females. The fact is this guy beta one plus betas.

467
00:58:52,925 --> 00:58:57,694
So the question is how do we calculate in her world co-designer or being a world class painter?

468
00:58:57,695 --> 00:59:08,925
Three. No, we can totally do this, but it's just that we have to, you know, do our own algebra in order to recover the confidence interval together.

469
00:59:08,925 --> 00:59:12,355
The confidence interval recall that confidence interval is given by.

470
00:59:15,805 --> 00:59:18,385
Okay. So we should be clear that, first of all,

471
00:59:18,595 --> 00:59:26,484
the confidence interval is because we are interested in this guy and beta one plus beta three plus beta three.

472
00:59:26,485 --> 00:59:37,014
We want to have a confident zero four, beta oneplus beta three. So the confidence interval then is the estimated value for beta one plus beta three.

473
00:59:37,015 --> 00:59:41,275
That is the estimate of value for beta one. Plus the estimate is out of the data.

474
00:59:41,275 --> 00:59:53,155
Three, this guy was minus four, but the key is yeah, -40.

475
00:59:53,155 --> 00:59:58,665
We're afraid on the 97, 97.5%.

476
00:59:58,705 --> 01:00:02,815
How high is the standard error of beta?

477
01:00:02,815 --> 01:00:08,195
One have pluses? We haven't. So first.

478
01:00:09,935 --> 01:00:17,135
Let's just make it clear that this is the 95% confidence interval for beta one.

479
01:00:17,135 --> 01:00:21,755
Plus Beta three are this two distributions.

480
01:00:23,005 --> 01:00:27,085
Yes. Yes. Yes.

481
01:00:27,865 --> 01:00:32,755
So how should I? It is duty to his future.

482
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:35,904
Because just imagine this to be a single quality.

483
01:00:35,905 --> 01:00:38,965
I can give it. Give it another name, let's say.

484
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:44,845
Okay. That is probably not good unless I call you either. I just can't call it.

485
01:00:44,845 --> 01:00:49,375
It is a single line I am trying to construct a confidence intervals.

486
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:55,885
This is funny. So yeah, it's easier if we just use integer first.

487
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:59,124
So. So I just call this a2 beta one plus beta three.

488
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:05,934
This is ETA and I want to construct this in a row for eight and that's actually, you know,

489
01:01:05,935 --> 01:01:18,745
hash if I can estimate eight and a half plus minus, you know, t times the amount of 40, but freedom is not a 7.5.

490
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:23,185
So compound the times, the error of here.

491
01:01:23,785 --> 01:01:27,055
This is the 95% confidence interval for it.

492
01:01:29,015 --> 01:01:33,175
Okay. That's where this last line come from.

493
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:38,505
It's just the height because my ETA is beta one plus beta three.

494
01:01:38,515 --> 01:01:41,815
Then I just replace my either by beta one plus basically.

495
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:50,475
Okay. So, first of all, are we are we okay with the last line here?

496
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:56,055
We're okay with the last line, right? Okay.

497
01:01:56,445 --> 01:02:05,565
And there was we realize, oh, this is the 95% of corners communists in our scenario, that we just need to figure out what each quality is in this.

498
01:02:05,775 --> 01:02:12,555
So this quality we know after we finish the model, we will get the estimated value for a better one and a better three.

499
01:02:12,675 --> 01:02:12,905
Right.

500
01:02:13,485 --> 01:02:23,445
And then this you can you can run it either from what you can see on a table, or you can use art to calculate this somehow with a degree of freedom.

501
01:02:24,345 --> 01:02:36,315
So what is left is just the center area. A better one had a positive that we had and this guy will not be derived given by our output so far.

502
01:02:36,605 --> 01:02:43,635
You are. It will simply give you the variance covariance matrix of all the various.

503
01:02:46,335 --> 01:02:53,744
So if you run are are you fit model and are will estimated all the four vetoes for you and

504
01:02:53,745 --> 01:02:59,145
also are and will calculate the various calories metrics of of his four vetoes for you.

505
01:02:59,715 --> 01:03:04,965
So you will have a four by four a matrix, various covariance matrix and a based on that.

506
01:03:04,965 --> 01:03:10,635
If there is a matrix you can calculate of the center error of the general functions of the valence.

507
01:03:12,145 --> 01:03:16,225
In this case, we have created what kind of hospitals we have. This is easy to complete.

508
01:03:16,615 --> 01:03:21,475
This has shown here. So we are calculated as an error, a better one, how to speed up the rehab.

509
01:03:22,105 --> 01:03:27,715
And this is actually the square root of the various center areas, the square root of veterans.

510
01:03:28,165 --> 01:03:32,574
Now, there is if we use the the formula of the virus,

511
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:39,175
that is the virus of beta one plus there is a beta three plus two times the covariance, which is beta one.

512
01:03:39,175 --> 01:03:47,754
And eventually we have. But if we can find each of the three component like variance of beta one,

513
01:03:47,755 --> 01:03:54,985
that virus of beta three had an a covariance between beta one had a benefit from the variance clearance matrix.

514
01:03:57,135 --> 01:03:58,935
Art gives you the various clearance matrix.

515
01:03:59,265 --> 01:04:07,365
So once you find all the three viruses and viruses and covariance that you were able to calculate this standard error,

516
01:04:09,015 --> 01:04:13,755
that you were able to calculate 95% confidence interval.

517
01:04:18,415 --> 01:04:28,165
This is an example. The point of this example is that sometimes the fluidity is that we are interested in like in this case we

518
01:04:28,165 --> 01:04:33,835
are interesting despite a three plus one plus made have eight of the qualities that we are interested in.

519
01:04:34,895 --> 01:04:43,025
May not be the quality that are derived in a calculate by R, although I mean R gives you the outputs,

520
01:04:43,385 --> 01:04:48,175
but you may not to be able to find directly from our output of the quality that you are introducing.

521
01:04:48,845 --> 01:04:52,595
However, you can always go through some algebra based on the output.

522
01:04:52,685 --> 01:04:58,835
And is always a way of finding a calculated quality you are interested in and in

523
01:04:58,855 --> 01:05:03,755
constructing confidence intervals and then do inference to subsequent inference.

524
01:05:06,635 --> 01:05:09,985
But we need to be clear how to calculate this.

525
01:05:09,995 --> 01:05:20,105
This things based on the article. Any questions about this?

526
01:05:28,045 --> 01:05:32,235
Okay. And then if there are new questions, then let's take a look at one example.

527
01:05:32,235 --> 01:05:41,505
Again, this is a kind of heavy example of a hopefully I mean, now after seeing this example, it answers well,

528
01:05:41,985 --> 01:05:48,505
if you guys do have questions about interaction, hopefully by looking at example way to answer some of your questions.

529
01:05:49,615 --> 01:05:57,145
So here we have well, we have used this dataset before, so we have the SBP.

530
01:05:57,145 --> 01:06:09,205
That's our response Y and we have two covariates ways stage and one is birthweight and both are continuous and in the dataset.

531
01:06:09,235 --> 01:06:17,715
So we have. I mean, this acts I actually don't know what this kind of stands for is probably stands for.

532
01:06:19,085 --> 01:06:23,974
I mean, it's probably just duplicate of this column in the second column.

533
01:06:23,975 --> 01:06:33,214
This is ID number, definitely. But the first column, I am not so sure of what it represents, but it seems to try to be a rubber gauge of ID number.

534
01:06:33,215 --> 01:06:38,885
But anyway, that's not our interest. So we are more interested in this last three columns.

535
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:44,315
So SBP is the Y and birth weight and age are the two X.

536
01:06:44,945 --> 01:06:58,475
We want to build a more linear regression model, but first let's take a look at the model that has the two main facts, plus the interaction side.

537
01:06:59,345 --> 01:07:04,984
So here we have a model. SBP is the response and this is the interaction.

538
01:07:04,985 --> 01:07:16,535
This is the ME if out of age this is made fact of birth weight of here we use this eye function in r this is.

539
01:07:22,755 --> 01:07:27,375
How much detail actually explain about her coat? So.

540
01:07:30,835 --> 01:07:39,114
So the I the foundation means you know as essentially means as is so it it means that if well this is the environment,

541
01:07:39,115 --> 01:07:43,225
this is the product of age and the birth weight. So if you use eye function,

542
01:07:43,495 --> 01:07:48,444
it means that if you are simply looking at the product because if you are not using the

543
01:07:48,445 --> 01:07:53,095
high function later we're going to see one example where you do not use the invention.

544
01:07:53,605 --> 01:08:01,525
Then if you simply include this, a lot of them are will automatically equal the interaction in both formats.

545
01:08:03,565 --> 01:08:07,224
But if you use I then R will know that.

546
01:08:07,225 --> 01:08:11,695
Okay, you are simply looking at the product being rationed, but not to need that.

547
01:08:11,965 --> 01:08:16,105
So here, in other words, we are. Let's forget about let's not worry too much about that.

548
01:08:16,115 --> 01:08:22,735
So you can go for the article and part and you can figure it out.

549
01:08:23,485 --> 01:08:31,375
After larger test, that's the main focus. But we shouldn't focus too much on our code part, you our nature because of the time constraint.

550
01:08:31,825 --> 01:08:38,605
So here, let's just say that we have a modal now that has the interaction and has that to me that's.

551
01:08:41,185 --> 01:08:45,505
Has the international has the two main facts and then we feed in this model.

552
01:08:45,895 --> 01:08:49,825
Now we have these outlaws, right?

553
01:08:50,005 --> 01:08:55,885
We have the interaction between age and birth weight. And we have age and we have birth weight.

554
01:08:58,525 --> 01:09:01,675
And this table, we have seen similar people before.

555
01:09:01,795 --> 01:09:06,835
So we have estimated that if we have standard error or we have to move out if we have the p value.

556
01:09:08,325 --> 01:09:12,514
And and then this, for example, this is an estimate.

557
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:16,745
It means that for birthweight, there's an estimated to be about for age.

558
01:09:17,015 --> 01:09:20,645
Yeah, this is the estimate age, in fact, for interaction.

559
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:30,815
So this looks familiar to us. I mean, then with this, oh, essentially we have been a world through a bit of three.

560
01:09:31,175 --> 01:09:36,215
And the beta zero versus the intersections. So that's that model.

561
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:40,325
And then let's look at well, and then of course, you can calculate.

562
01:09:40,505 --> 01:09:46,864
You can get to the sum of squares by the square, ensemble square or cartoons on the square.

563
01:09:46,865 --> 01:09:52,885
So, for example, if you use ANOVA, you will get the survival of square.

564
01:09:54,115 --> 01:09:59,435
Well, yeah, we have seen similar table before. So here we have interaction, we have age, we have a birth weight.

565
01:09:59,975 --> 01:10:05,405
And this is a sequential sum of square, adding this sequentially into the model.

566
01:10:06,305 --> 01:10:16,535
And also we can look at it a partial sample square. This this is the part of the sample squared so that the sum of squares here each sample square

567
01:10:17,435 --> 01:10:25,805
in size after adjusting for the other terms above well by adding well for each role here

568
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:30,575
for example for for this role here this this sample square corresponding to corresponds to

569
01:10:30,575 --> 01:10:36,035
adding this particular term into a model that already has the other two terms in amount.

570
01:10:36,245 --> 01:10:38,375
And that's what a part of some square means.

571
01:10:39,845 --> 01:10:51,154
So this is this table gives you partial, somewhat square and depending on the question of the interest, well, if you are formally doing this,

572
01:10:51,155 --> 01:10:58,325
I never question into a habit of assessing the hypothesis will evolve sort of balance like how often sort of data is equal to zero.

573
01:10:58,925 --> 01:11:01,505
And then so we follow in our test.

574
01:11:02,105 --> 01:11:08,185
Well, sometimes it's easier to find some square from this table, and sometimes it's easier to find some square from listening.

575
01:11:10,715 --> 01:11:19,505
So both tables, they may be useful, but it's just, it's just not a, you know, which, which table is,

576
01:11:19,505 --> 01:11:27,184
is and which they will give you about the sum of squares that a unit to use to test.

577
01:11:27,185 --> 01:11:33,395
I have others this and this. Well we would just one more word so this is sequential table.

578
01:11:33,395 --> 01:11:42,305
This means that a well the first the first rule then is that by adding the interaction into a model that has all the

579
01:11:42,315 --> 01:11:51,785
Intersect in this equation and then adding by adding pay for model that has a intercept and value the interaction term.

580
01:11:52,385 --> 01:11:55,745
And of course, this is a very strange sequence.

581
01:11:55,745 --> 01:11:57,755
I mean, in practice, people really do this,

582
01:11:57,755 --> 01:12:07,864
people who first at the main facts and then consider that interaction but a here this model in first by this following this way in first

583
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:16,175
out of the interaction and then the remember that this is this is not of the the typical way that we would build a model in practice.

584
01:12:16,395 --> 01:12:26,615
And I think this is put here intentionally to illustrate that the fact of adding the interaction is a model that has a mean thanks.

585
01:12:27,065 --> 01:12:30,725
But anyway, so this is the sequential sum of square table.

586
01:12:34,795 --> 01:12:42,835
Okay. Oh, yeah. So. So then let's take a look at the past for the interaction.

587
01:12:44,395 --> 01:12:49,014
So here, if we look at this table, we have not for interaction.

588
01:12:49,015 --> 01:12:54,145
We have sequential this sequential past.

589
01:12:54,175 --> 01:12:59,035
Well, sorry, this square was almost where it gives us a our past for interaction.

590
01:12:59,965 --> 01:13:08,155
And thus the partial sum of square listings on my table gives us a cast for that interaction.

591
01:13:09,115 --> 01:13:12,485
And if we look at the P values, the P values are definitely different.

592
01:13:12,505 --> 01:13:16,764
So here is the P value and here is the P that you can see.

593
01:13:16,765 --> 01:13:19,795
The P values are definitely different, are quite different.

594
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:28,345
So then which one should we use if we want to test for the significance of the interaction term?

595
01:13:28,915 --> 01:13:32,665
So here I so we are, we have to test for the interaction.

596
01:13:32,965 --> 01:13:40,405
So which one is valid? And he very quickly asked, which one you think is valid?

597
01:13:40,465 --> 01:13:45,444
Yes. Well, if we only want to test the significance of the interaction,

598
01:13:45,445 --> 01:13:51,405
then we should use this one on the second table, because that's as if it was being added on to the model last.

599
01:13:55,045 --> 01:13:59,605
Okay. Yeah, yeah. You're another. So what then? What was the problem with this one?

600
01:14:02,365 --> 01:14:11,685
When we do the sequential test or the first interaction is not the age and part.

601
01:14:11,695 --> 01:14:14,965
We haven't been added in yet. The main effects haven't been evident.

602
01:14:15,685 --> 01:14:25,765
Yes, exactly. So recall that we mentioned this, but this is just an example, trying to make that point to see what we are.

603
01:14:27,055 --> 01:14:31,365
So when we add interaction into the model, what we including graduating the model,

604
01:14:31,375 --> 01:14:40,825
typically what we do is we first include both main events in the model, all of the if all the covariance that are involved in the interaction.

605
01:14:41,965 --> 01:14:48,445
But if you look at this sequential sample square, this interaction appears as the first rule.

606
01:14:49,225 --> 01:14:58,465
What it means is that this is the effect of the interaction by enduring reaction to a model that has only intercept.

607
01:14:59,275 --> 01:15:02,755
That is. No, no, no, no, no. Neither of these two.

608
01:15:03,785 --> 01:15:06,995
But this is not the model that we would like to build.

609
01:15:07,535 --> 01:15:13,205
We will add included ration only when we already include both covariates.

610
01:15:14,285 --> 01:15:21,755
So that's why when we pass the significance of the interaction, we will not look at this sample square.

611
01:15:21,785 --> 01:15:34,025
We will not look at this p value here. But for the sequential not sorry for the partial samples where this interaction did,

612
01:15:34,035 --> 01:15:44,565
it means that while we are adding the region to a model that already has the other fruits first, which are the H and birthweight, many facts.

613
01:15:45,465 --> 01:15:49,335
And so this is actually the right model that we should be looking at.

614
01:15:50,175 --> 01:15:53,205
So in other words, now this line, maybe I should make a list.

615
01:15:53,355 --> 01:16:00,675
So this line, this is this corresponds to the models beta zero plus beta three times h.

616
01:16:01,685 --> 01:16:10,055
I'm surprised made. And the cars fall through this model that has only interaction.

617
01:16:10,185 --> 01:16:13,655
There's no me. That's what this.

618
01:16:15,405 --> 01:16:38,565
Corresponds to the model that has. Okay.

619
01:16:40,925 --> 01:16:45,155
So this is testing whether beta three equal to zero or not.

620
01:16:45,335 --> 01:16:49,295
And this one is also it has to be a three is equal to zero or not.

621
01:16:50,225 --> 01:16:58,355
But what we really want to test for the interaction we should actually be looking at of the second model that R2 has the two main effects.

622
01:17:00,835 --> 01:17:08,635
So in this case, then, are either of them both? So the then the we should so we should.

623
01:17:10,825 --> 01:17:19,945
We should to use your heartfelt but the results of an important p value from.

624
01:17:22,845 --> 01:17:25,935
Partial. Something square. This. This table.

625
01:17:29,135 --> 01:17:35,525
To test the null hypothesis function in a three is equal to zero.

626
01:17:38,975 --> 01:17:49,635
Versus Italy is not a. Okay.

627
01:17:51,775 --> 01:17:55,855
Because everybody see the reason I'm using the partial.

628
01:18:00,985 --> 01:18:06,555
Now let's take a look at another iReporter.

629
01:18:06,565 --> 01:18:09,955
So here we actually, you know, change the order.

630
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:14,545
We include that many times first and then we call an interaction.

631
01:18:16,855 --> 01:18:20,095
Right. So this is again, this is a sequential sample square table.

632
01:18:20,335 --> 01:18:26,845
So we have we call a first, then we add birthweight and then we add of the direction that we find.

633
01:18:28,555 --> 01:18:32,485
And then while this is the corresponding partial sample square.

634
01:18:36,115 --> 01:18:44,425
Well, we can see that now. But this piano here for the interaction becomes the same as the.

635
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:52,775
The problem here for the interaction that was emerged was almost where the results came in by the signature of someone somewhere.

636
01:18:52,805 --> 01:18:57,065
That's why people become the missing as the parties on the square.

637
01:18:58,115 --> 01:19:08,175
People. The reason is that now the situation is almost where at this table we add to the ration at last.

638
01:19:08,895 --> 01:19:12,735
So that means both covariates are already including the model.

639
01:19:13,335 --> 01:19:17,505
So. So then of course, then it becomes the same as the partial sum of square.

640
01:19:22,635 --> 01:19:32,775
So this shows that indeed that the order I mean, the order that you asked when you I mean, if you want to use the sequential sample square.

641
01:19:33,495 --> 01:19:39,195
So this shows that a square was almost square. This some square this table really depends on the order.

642
01:19:39,345 --> 01:19:43,544
How how you count that which covariates are added.

643
01:19:43,545 --> 01:19:50,055
The first musical numbers are added later or the partial sample square does not depend on the.

644
01:19:54,845 --> 01:20:01,945
And then based on the the fitted model, you fit in the model with a driveshaft with the two main factors and with the interaction.

645
01:20:01,955 --> 01:20:05,315
Of course, after a fit model, you can gather the feed into that.

646
01:20:06,245 --> 01:20:11,735
So the last column here, this is the fitting about this is not the one I had.

647
01:20:13,465 --> 01:20:21,455
You can. You can. What happens is you can cover what I had based on your model and species are what I.

648
01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:38,035
This is our what? And then.

649
01:20:42,765 --> 01:20:47,865
And then that's turned out somehow what this has about the interaction term.

650
01:20:48,195 --> 01:20:53,325
So none of us fit this model. Okay. So now I think maybe we can compare this article to previous article.

651
01:20:54,105 --> 01:20:57,645
So previously we used the eye function as well.

652
01:20:57,645 --> 01:21:03,105
When I specify the model, we look at here first. So if you see this by this model you are,

653
01:21:03,315 --> 01:21:16,935
you simply specify age times b b birth weight of the R will automatically include all the main facts and the interaction.

654
01:21:19,415 --> 01:21:23,615
We haven't seen very similar stories about the party in terms of our welfare tomorrow never has.

655
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:28,175
That includes all the events in immigration versus in the previous case.

656
01:21:29,135 --> 01:21:32,465
Like if you are a previous case.

657
01:21:34,005 --> 01:21:37,785
So have you excluded from this?

658
01:21:38,025 --> 01:21:40,545
Let's say you write our code.

659
01:21:41,445 --> 01:21:53,885
As BP and I tried to apply the high function that are would not automatically include this who are able to simply just include

660
01:21:53,905 --> 01:22:03,645
the interaction in the model because the I function means as is because you only specify the product terms are will just make.

661
01:22:04,245 --> 01:22:09,105
That's the the function of of this. All right here that's the wrong time here.

662
01:22:10,815 --> 01:22:14,295
But anyway, that's that's that's the something about our code.

663
01:22:15,735 --> 01:22:19,345
How your analysis fit to the model.

664
01:22:19,365 --> 01:22:26,975
Again, this model has the force of the big events, end of the interaction, and then we have the corresponding a number table.

665
01:22:26,985 --> 01:22:34,795
This is the sequential subtle square. I know my table. So based on this table.

666
01:22:40,575 --> 01:22:44,134
Yeah. This is actually. It's the point. I started this. This table.

667
01:22:44,135 --> 01:22:47,255
These tables are the same as the ones we saw before.

668
01:22:48,485 --> 01:22:55,895
So for example, this has made it not on this table is the same as what we think.

669
01:22:57,115 --> 01:23:07,745
The first of all over here when we include the two main facts out of the aggression and this the same as this has made it valuable,

670
01:23:07,745 --> 01:23:11,375
this table is the same as the one we just saw.

671
01:23:11,525 --> 01:23:18,905
And also the second row is almost where this table is actually this or this table.

672
01:23:18,905 --> 01:23:27,275
And well, here the order matters a little bit. So so this table, this second example, square table is the same as the one we are seeing here.

673
01:23:28,565 --> 01:23:29,165
We are sitting here.

674
01:23:31,225 --> 01:23:40,165
So this line to the point is that while you can fit the model by using a different way of coding our coding instead of using the hi function,

675
01:23:40,385 --> 01:23:43,705
use the product with chance.

676
01:23:43,975 --> 01:23:49,915
You'll get the same result. Okay, now let's take a look at the hypothesis test of age.

677
01:23:52,225 --> 01:23:59,665
We look at this model. We want to test whether age, in fact is significant or not, whether there is an effect on SBP.

678
01:24:03,415 --> 01:24:17,604
So here we see the two models. This model is SBP equal to zero plus beta as a B, BWT, birth weight plus.

679
01:24:17,605 --> 01:24:21,355
Absolutely. This is a model that has no age in it.

680
01:24:22,795 --> 01:24:30,295
This model this is a model that has been a zero plus beta age plus.

681
01:24:34,475 --> 01:24:38,705
Peter. Hey, the one interaction.

682
01:24:42,915 --> 01:24:58,285
Also. Right to past the Ages Act was passed and in fact, there are different ways of doing this.

683
01:24:58,305 --> 01:25:02,025
I mean, we have before seen this example we are talking about.

684
01:25:02,535 --> 01:25:09,195
So one way, of course, now if you look at this, this model, the second model here,

685
01:25:09,885 --> 01:25:16,965
the AP found that involved better pay and better interaction and better interaction.

686
01:25:18,285 --> 01:25:24,075
So if you pass 85 and that means we are looking at whether in a in a better way can speed,

687
01:25:24,075 --> 01:25:28,725
whether those two are both equal to zero or living in a match.

688
01:25:30,615 --> 01:25:39,525
And as we mentioned before, so we use here we we can look at this by using the app test.

689
01:25:40,665 --> 01:25:48,975
This is the age effect. So we should look at whether whether beta one and be a three, whether they are simultaneous and equal to zero.

690
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:53,505
And of that, we can construct this F statistic. That's lovely.

691
01:25:55,095 --> 01:25:59,005
The fun is there for Africa. But now how do we know?

692
01:25:59,025 --> 01:26:04,095
Indeed, if five are the numbers from our output, how do we really carry out this test?

693
01:26:05,145 --> 01:26:12,705
So to cover the test, we need to for the numerator involve the sample square, the actress on the square,

694
01:26:13,395 --> 01:26:18,675
extra sample square by adding the beta limit of three equal the model that has only been a zero.

695
01:26:20,235 --> 01:26:23,505
That's exactly what we are doing here.

696
01:26:27,055 --> 01:26:34,665
So if you took this model, no model, an alternative model, the model no model has only a zero beta beta.

697
01:26:36,055 --> 01:26:48,384
But this model now has while we add into that model that may have a beta eight times the interaction and we see let's see how much some square,

698
01:26:48,385 --> 01:26:53,215
how much extra, some square we have from the first model to the second one,

699
01:26:53,635 --> 01:27:01,075
how much more square change we can get of that by using the ANOVA function?

700
01:27:02,085 --> 01:27:05,354
Here the show. I know if I can, can do that.

701
01:27:05,355 --> 01:27:13,815
So if you simply put no model and alternative models, both as the input of the ANOVA function,

702
01:27:14,565 --> 01:27:23,265
that ANOVA will do the contrast of these two models I we will find one of the increase of some applied.

703
01:27:23,555 --> 01:27:29,505
What are the extra sample square heads and what the corresponding growth rate on this and then carried out on the task for you.

704
01:27:30,075 --> 01:27:37,635
So now if we run this ANOVA with two models as input that we will get this single.

705
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:49,175
So existing in shows that if you are comparing this tomatoes tomato with low down and then the first column here.

706
01:27:51,715 --> 01:27:56,035
I'm sorry. The first rule here. This gives you that regression sample square.

707
01:27:56,635 --> 01:27:59,815
This is a regressions almost waiting for model one.

708
01:28:02,055 --> 01:28:06,975
For Motor1 that is the model that has no age added at all.

709
01:28:07,425 --> 01:28:15,645
So the second row here, this is the regression sample squared for the side of the motor.

710
01:28:18,925 --> 01:28:23,035
Sometimes there's another warehouse almost where this is a residual Somersworth.

711
01:28:24,515 --> 01:28:30,205
This are. This is. This is. Residual sum was there.

712
01:28:33,435 --> 01:28:38,365
So it gives you the residual sample square of the first model in the ratio, some square on the second one.

713
01:28:39,705 --> 01:28:44,385
Of course, you see that a residual, some square old first model is is larger.

714
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:49,645
And the first time the model is smaller because the site of the model has more variables at it.

715
01:28:52,185 --> 01:28:55,665
And then that you were a freedom for for this residuals.

716
01:28:55,695 --> 01:28:59,975
I'm sorry. Okay.

717
01:29:00,675 --> 01:29:04,005
I guess I was running a little bit slow down a little bit.

718
01:29:05,265 --> 01:29:15,165
So this residual sum of the square now for the first model that's 540, and it has this many more freedom.

719
01:29:16,275 --> 01:29:20,985
The reason is that now the total sample size is 16.

720
01:29:21,765 --> 01:29:26,025
Now the first model has beta zero and beta B has two benefits.

721
01:29:26,715 --> 01:29:34,335
So the bigger freedom here, this is this number here is yeah, minus P, which is 16, minus two which is 40.

722
01:29:37,395 --> 01:29:42,965
But in the second case for the second tomorrow, this 12 here, this again is minus P.

723
01:29:42,975 --> 01:29:46,425
This is a degree of freedom corresponding to residual sample square.

724
01:29:47,485 --> 01:29:54,745
And sample size is 16. But AP in the second moto we have 4 minutes, we have four minus.

725
01:29:55,225 --> 01:29:58,665
So that's why we have 16 minus four. We have trouble.

726
01:30:03,145 --> 01:30:07,445
And that's the first column, the residual the war freedom. Then the second to call a religion is not a square.

727
01:30:07,465 --> 01:30:10,645
That's just a neutral central square corresponding to the Somalis.

728
01:30:11,335 --> 01:30:19,525
And then the third column, this people are afraid of to this is the word freedom for the actress almost square.

729
01:30:20,995 --> 01:30:27,835
That's for t minus two as equal to or another way to think about this is where are

730
01:30:27,955 --> 01:30:33,635
are not well this is is testing to be is equal to zero has included as equals.

731
01:30:34,375 --> 01:30:38,855
So that's why here we have to do freedom. Okay.

732
01:30:39,105 --> 01:30:42,405
So this is 14 -12. This is equal to.

733
01:30:44,625 --> 01:30:55,785
And this son of the square here. This is not as as model one minus RSS model to.

734
01:30:59,455 --> 01:31:03,745
This is the actress I was with. How much some of us were.

735
01:31:07,265 --> 01:31:14,865
Hallmark resumed some square got reduced by adding the two bonus into the mortgage.

736
01:31:15,245 --> 01:31:21,545
So this is equal to 540 -52.75.

737
01:31:29,105 --> 01:31:38,285
Okay. And of then this apps that hosting this is.

738
01:31:41,355 --> 01:31:44,264
Okay. So maybe just this is the answer.

739
01:31:44,265 --> 01:31:53,505
The extra was clear by adding by adding beta a and a beta eight comes B into a model that has been a zero and beta.

740
01:31:56,815 --> 01:32:04,275
This is the extra on the square. Listen for some squirm.

741
01:32:04,575 --> 01:32:08,685
And then this f value. This F value.

742
01:32:09,495 --> 01:32:23,155
This is the extracellular squared. Divided by his own view of freedom, which is too divided by the SC.

743
01:32:41,205 --> 01:32:45,315
Divided by A-minus for divorce freedom.

744
01:32:57,735 --> 01:33:10,514
So yeah, this is yeah, this is absolute tastic gender actually in our case this numerator and for some A squared numerator X for example,

745
01:33:10,515 --> 01:33:17,665
squared that's given by this fiber and it is not right.

746
01:33:17,955 --> 01:33:26,625
And the denominator as I see some of the squared that's actually given by this number over here,

747
01:33:26,625 --> 01:33:34,215
this 52.75 because this is the residual sum of square,

748
01:33:34,965 --> 01:33:42,815
this is zero some squared or the error error some square by looking at the form on the forecast for.

749
01:33:49,385 --> 01:33:58,625
And then divided by the challenge of freedom. So, of course, this is different through this whole thing here.

750
01:33:59,555 --> 01:34:08,105
This is equally true. And I saw 80 7165 divided by two is the word freedom.

751
01:34:08,465 --> 01:34:11,885
Divided by 52.275 divided by 12.

752
01:34:16,465 --> 01:34:30,375
I like how that's how this f value is calculated and then you can calculate the p value of the p value is based on this f Ms. on our liabilities.

753
01:34:30,385 --> 01:34:35,365
This follows Aveda's vision with the growth rate of two and a half.

754
01:34:39,055 --> 01:34:47,325
Since. Okay.

755
01:34:47,425 --> 01:34:51,535
That's the interpretation of all these numbers in in this table.

756
01:34:52,375 --> 01:35:01,315
So the main thing, as we mentioned about this table, is that by using this ANOVA function, you can directly compare this to tables, to tomatoes.

757
01:35:01,825 --> 01:35:10,855
And this this function in the end of the table will tells you what an F value is and what are the P values for testing.

758
01:35:11,485 --> 01:35:15,444
While for companies, tomatoes, and for housing, that is for testing.

759
01:35:15,445 --> 01:35:20,575
Whether it's equal to beta eight times B is equal to zero.

760
01:35:31,055 --> 01:35:35,425
Are there any questions about this? And you know that I'm making a mess.

761
01:35:35,425 --> 01:35:46,875
I mean, writing my writings already. I realized this long time ago I'm not super well organized when it comes to spot ups.

762
01:35:47,725 --> 01:35:52,495
But any questions? Because I just want to make sure that we are okay.

763
01:35:52,495 --> 01:36:02,745
We understand what a number represents. Okay.

764
01:36:03,185 --> 01:36:07,955
Yeah. I mean, if you if you have an idea, I think if you spend, you know, ten, 15,

765
01:36:07,955 --> 01:36:19,145
20 minutes on this and try to make sure that you understand what each number means and and connect those numbers through to the previous efforts that,

766
01:36:19,145 --> 01:36:31,745
as Jake and I have on this testing, is invaluable and make sure that you have a better understanding of the whole issue.

767
01:36:32,705 --> 01:36:37,775
Okay. So that's that's one way to carry out, I guess.

768
01:36:38,465 --> 01:36:43,945
How about the testing? Let's be clear on.

769
01:37:03,115 --> 01:37:08,095
Yeah. Okay. So here, I mean. Here.

770
01:37:08,095 --> 01:37:15,445
It's okay. So maybe we do not need to go through the detailed interpretation of each number because we have done that.

771
01:37:15,455 --> 01:37:22,585
So here we are looking at we are compared to the model, this model and a model that has no interaction.

772
01:37:23,065 --> 01:37:29,665
If you look at this model here, the second model here, the model has only the two main effects, but it has no interaction.

773
01:37:31,075 --> 01:37:36,384
And we are looking I will compare this to models. We are using the same model of function.

774
01:37:36,385 --> 01:37:42,955
So if you input this simpler model that has only birthweight as the main effect

775
01:37:43,225 --> 01:37:48,625
and the model has h added as another mean in very fact or no interaction.

776
01:37:49,315 --> 01:37:54,385
If you compare this for models and this table provided you the output comparing

777
01:37:54,505 --> 01:38:03,145
those two models and then this model actually tests and this model corresponds to.

778
01:38:06,455 --> 01:38:10,635
The question, what here? Question one here.

779
01:38:10,905 --> 01:38:14,645
The question one. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

780
01:38:14,995 --> 01:38:18,745
A lot of questions to ask. I think I take that back.

781
01:38:18,765 --> 01:38:25,905
Not just. Okay.

782
01:38:27,255 --> 01:38:29,045
So here this this one.

783
01:38:29,055 --> 01:38:39,945
Well, again, it's just comparing the model that has birth weight and the two main effects and it calculates the corresponding F value.

784
01:38:57,575 --> 01:39:03,875
Right. Compare this to models and in the past, whether the speed of a is equal to zero or not.

785
01:39:05,045 --> 01:39:13,015
And this statistic is an F statistic corresponding to testing better eight equals zero.

786
01:39:13,145 --> 01:39:16,295
So here it has to be a is equal to zero or not.

787
01:39:18,095 --> 01:39:21,865
And then we have the p value. So here you can you can definitely.

788
01:39:21,875 --> 01:39:25,325
I mean, you just use the test which has the you fit of this model.

789
01:39:27,195 --> 01:39:36,675
And from Gizmodo you will get the estimated beta and its center error and t value and that u-value can be used to test this zero or not.

790
01:39:37,515 --> 01:39:43,005
And this app is just a square that it is a square on that you got it.

791
01:39:43,545 --> 01:39:50,985
So, so in beta you have different ways of testing the same hello, the same hypothesis.

792
01:39:52,455 --> 01:39:59,085
Once you are clear how these articles are connected, once you are clear how this numbers are connected,

793
01:39:59,805 --> 01:40:04,815
then you can definitely come up with your own way of testing the same policies.

794
01:40:06,975 --> 01:40:11,715
But here this this article is just using that statistic.

795
01:40:11,865 --> 01:40:23,835
Our test has that. And another way of testing that is to test.

796
01:40:23,835 --> 01:40:27,615
The fact is to use that partial some square.

797
01:40:27,765 --> 01:40:33,165
So if you look at it here. We have a record here.

798
01:40:33,555 --> 01:40:42,525
This means by any age into a mortal that already has birth weight in it or it has birth weight in it.

799
01:40:42,945 --> 01:40:51,645
So then this shows us whether, you know, this age after adjusting for growth weight, whether age is significant.

800
01:40:53,865 --> 01:41:01,415
And if we compare the numbers in this room, we see that they are exactly the same as the number in this.

801
01:41:05,995 --> 01:41:12,555
You can see that they are exactly the same. This is not a coincidence.

802
01:41:12,575 --> 01:41:21,215
I mean, they must be the same because the first model year, while in the first case, the model two, it is a model adjusting for birth weight.

803
01:41:21,755 --> 01:41:26,494
Every fact is in fact adjusted for birth weight and in a partial sample squared.

804
01:41:26,495 --> 01:41:31,954
And this age is also a sum of square dancing in effect.

805
01:41:31,955 --> 01:41:34,265
So that's why the schools must be the same.

806
01:41:35,735 --> 01:41:44,975
So again, you can see that we can reach the same conclusion by looking at a different R of the origin of a lot of things.

807
01:41:46,775 --> 01:41:50,705
So we've got a good understanding of the the rationale behind it.

808
01:41:50,805 --> 01:41:59,345
It seems that in order to let our viewers of what it was, we realized the connection was realized that left behind all this output.

809
01:41:59,585 --> 01:42:05,585
Now we can see that all of these are connected and now you can choose your own output.

810
01:42:05,615 --> 01:42:08,855
You get you can you can use this.

811
01:42:09,965 --> 01:42:12,184
You don't have to ask the same question.

812
01:42:12,185 --> 01:42:20,165
But by looking at all the harmonic, we can just look at a particular part of our output to observe the question.

813
01:42:20,165 --> 01:42:23,715
And you have different ways of, of test. Let's say this.

814
01:42:25,175 --> 01:42:37,145
Okay, so we are over times or we will start and here home and again we will we will have a lot of details about our final verdict,

815
01:42:38,015 --> 01:42:45,435
how the difference that we're talking about here.
