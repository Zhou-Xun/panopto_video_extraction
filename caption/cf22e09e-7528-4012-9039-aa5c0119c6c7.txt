1
00:00:05,147 --> 00:00:08,047
So let's assume you've already
worked on your audience,

2
00:00:08,047 --> 00:00:11,527
you've picked your goals,
you've picked your central message, and

3
00:00:11,527 --> 00:00:14,327
you're ready to start thinking
about implementation.

4
00:00:14,327 --> 00:00:16,887
Great, how?

5
00:00:16,887 --> 00:00:18,408
How do you want to deliver it?

6
00:00:18,408 --> 00:00:22,567
What communication channel is
going to make the most sense, and

7
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:26,350
align with your audience and
goals and central messages?

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,135
And so it depends a lot on what those
audience, what the audience is,

9
00:00:30,135 --> 00:00:33,923
what their characteristics are,
your goals in that situation, and

10
00:00:33,923 --> 00:00:35,638
what your central message is.

11
00:00:35,638 --> 00:00:40,248
Now, I'm going to walk through a whole
slew of different communication channels

12
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:44,330
right now and talk a little bit about
their strengths and weaknesses.

13
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,738
Because you can communicate in lots
of different ways in health context,

14
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:52,590
in science communication context,
or just in life in general.

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,104
So sometimes we communicate
through reports or articles,

16
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:58,365
written things with lots of science.

17
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:03,539
Sometimes we create websites that
might have process information or

18
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,828
resources or educational material,
things like that.

19
00:01:07,828 --> 00:01:11,099
Sometimes we go the brochure pathway,
right,

20
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:17,088
something you can take away with you as an
education, as a marketing tool, whatever.

21
00:01:17,088 --> 00:01:21,558
Sometimes we meet with people, we gather
at conferences, we do big presentations,

22
00:01:21,558 --> 00:01:22,559
things like that.

23
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:26,120
When is that going to be most appropriate?

24
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,157
Related but different is what I
want to call public consultations.

25
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:32,450
This might be in groups or
it might be one on one, but

26
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,510
it's a situation where you're
interacting with the public or

27
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,894
with a constituency and
trying to understand them.

28
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:42,827
Sometimes we do mass media campaigns.

29
00:01:42,827 --> 00:01:46,931
TV spots, public service announcements,
stuff like that.

30
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:50,204
That can be really a powerful
way to reach a large audience.

31
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:52,868
Sometimes we work with journalists, and

32
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:57,827
we let them be the vehicle by which our
message gets out to the broader public.

33
00:01:57,827 --> 00:02:01,549
And then in this media environment, we
need to talk about things like blogging.

34
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:04,253
When are you going to write and
post something for

35
00:02:04,253 --> 00:02:06,896
people to be able to go to
if they want to see it?

36
00:02:06,896 --> 00:02:08,496
When are you going to tweet?

37
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:13,002
When are you going to use Twitter or
other kinds of social networks, Facebook,

38
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:17,579
Instagram, whatever, as a method of
communicating the science knowledge,

39
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:20,936
the health knowledge that
you're trying to get across.

40
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:24,022
So I'm going to go through
each of these quickly,

41
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:27,348
giving you a little bit
about what each is best for.

42
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:32,553
And when each of these channels
might be less appropriate.

43
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:36,908
It's a really brief overview, but
hopefully you'll get some insights into

44
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:39,530
which might be best for
different situation.

45
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,578
Let's start with reports.

46
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,326
Now, reports are best for

47
00:02:42,326 --> 00:02:46,944
situations where the content is not
likely to change at all, right.

48
00:02:46,944 --> 00:02:50,792
It's done, it's published, no changes.

49
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:56,101
It's also important to note that reports
or articles or things like that are best

50
00:02:56,101 --> 00:03:00,881
in situations where being complete
is more important than simplicity.

51
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,094
Right, reports are reference materials,

52
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:06,993
they are something that somebody goes
to when they want to look something up.

53
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:10,627
And they want to learn and
make sure they have the full and

54
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:15,130
complete listing of the data,
the instructions they need to know,

55
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,532
the information that
the committee decided upon.

56
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,432
And as a reference material,
they're excellent.

57
00:03:21,432 --> 00:03:25,153
But that also means that they're not
appropriate for urgent messages,

58
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:27,418
things that have to be
done really quickly.

59
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:28,895
And they are not appropriate for

60
00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:31,965
getting people's attention if
they are not already interested.

61
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:34,855
Right, a report is something
that somebody has to go to.

62
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:39,077
Nobody is going to go, look, there's
a report, I now want to read this report.

63
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:40,989
No, it doesn't happen that way.

64
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:45,100
Reports are reference materials.

65
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,974
Websites are kind of like
reports in many ways.

66
00:03:47,974 --> 00:03:52,159
They're best for situations where
the content changes rarely,

67
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,593
although websites are a little
bit easier to update.

68
00:03:55,593 --> 00:04:00,360
Again, broad audiences, you're making
the information available, but you

69
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,123
also have a little bit more tools to help
people put the information in context or

70
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:08,131
to change the way in which
it's being presented.

71
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:13,155
But again, like with reports,
websites tend to work best for situations

72
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:18,515
where the people who are using them are
people who know what they want already.

73
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:21,940
A website, however, is not a good
way of engaging with an audience.

74
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,420
A website is a one
directional communication.

75
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,420
I have content.

76
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,130
I am making it available to you.

77
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,580
There's not a whole lot of back and
forth in most website contexts.

78
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,020
Brochures, kind of like
each of the first two.

79
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,390
But here the difference is, brochures
are best for meeting very specific

80
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:46,478
information needs, specific instructions,
specific topics, things like that.

81
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,075
Things that people need to look at
later so they can remember them.

82
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:56,351
Content's not likely to change over time
because once the brochure is printed and

83
00:04:56,351 --> 00:05:01,243
it's going to hang around for a while,
so, if the content's changing a lot,

84
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:02,710
it might not be ideal.

85
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,385
Again, they're inappropriate for
urgent messages, right,

86
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:08,493
in part because they hang around, so

87
00:05:08,493 --> 00:05:13,135
you don't necessarily know when somebody
is going to be looking at your brochure.

88
00:05:13,135 --> 00:05:14,789
Shifting a little bit now.

89
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:20,118
When are meetings or conferences most
appropriate as a communications channel?

90
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:23,734
Well, they're great for
engaging with an audience, right?

91
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:27,806
Networking, sharing
information within a community.

92
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:32,353
And to some degree for becoming
identified as an expert or a resource.

93
00:05:32,353 --> 00:05:35,578
Whether that's within
the scientific community,

94
00:05:35,578 --> 00:05:40,411
that's why I go to scientific conferences,
to share content with my peers and

95
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:42,769
to become known for the work that I do.

96
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:46,830
But the same thing is true,
say, if I go to a community and

97
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,414
I want to share that I'm an expert
about this particular topic.

98
00:05:51,414 --> 00:05:56,222
Now, where meetings and conferences have
problems is, the only people you reach

99
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:59,788
at a meeting or conference is
the people who are right there.

100
00:05:59,788 --> 00:06:02,744
You're not going to reach anybody else,
and in particular,

101
00:06:02,744 --> 00:06:06,305
that means you're not necessarily
going to reach diverse audiences.

102
00:06:06,305 --> 00:06:12,925
Audiences who might not otherwise be able
to attend that meeting or conference.

103
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:16,257
They're also not particularly appropriate
for short-term announcements,

104
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:20,850
things that are happening
almost immediately.

105
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,208
And the subset of this that I talked
about earlier, public consultations,

106
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,264
are important to think about as well,
right?

107
00:06:26,264 --> 00:06:31,170
These could be one-on-one, or they could
be like town hall meetings or groups or

108
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,097
focus groups, these kinds of
public consultation situations.

109
00:06:35,097 --> 00:06:40,141
Now those are best for
receiving different kinds of perspectives,

110
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:42,705
where you get to hear and listen and

111
00:06:42,705 --> 00:06:47,322
elicit different perspectives
on the content that you have.

112
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:51,876
They're also really useful for testing
your messages with different audiences.

113
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:54,175
What they're not appropriate for, and

114
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:57,352
you have to be really honest
to yourself about this one,

115
00:06:57,352 --> 00:07:02,026
don't do public consultations if you
won't actually use the feedback, right.

116
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:06,161
The public expects that when you engage
them in a consultation that they're

117
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:09,585
going to be listened to and
there's a potential for change in what

118
00:07:09,585 --> 00:07:14,131
you're doing or what you're saying based
upon the feedback they're giving you.

119
00:07:14,131 --> 00:07:16,999
bIf that's not actually going to happen,

120
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:23,964
then you set up a false expectation
when you do a public consultation.

121
00:07:23,964 --> 00:07:27,582
If you're not going to engage, maybe
the better situation here is to go for

122
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:29,792
something more like a mass media campaign.

123
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:32,128
We do this all the time in public health.

124
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:35,011
And mass media campaigns
are really effective for

125
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:39,069
getting people's attention or
encouraging specific action steps.

126
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:44,038
Now, you have to compete with the media
marketplace and the ads for Coke,

127
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:48,865
and products, and all the other
things in the mass media environment.

128
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:53,561
But when done well,
mass media campaigns can be very

129
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:58,157
effective at getting a key
health message across.

130
00:07:58,157 --> 00:08:01,653
Now, what's mass media
not appropriate for?

131
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:03,203
Detail, right?

132
00:08:03,203 --> 00:08:07,129
Mass media campaigns,
you might get one thing across, so

133
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:10,264
detailed content is not
going to work very well.

134
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:14,568
Or situations where different
audiences need different things.

135
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:18,285
Again, by definition,
mass media is everybody, so

136
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:23,160
sometimes you can tailor it and
you can use mass media channels just for

137
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,456
particular audiences, but
you at least need to think about,

138
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:32,190
is this message going to reach people
than the ones you want to reach.

139
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,081
And is there going to be a problem there?

140
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:40,118
So when you go to journalists,
well, journalists are most useful

141
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:43,809
when what you have to communicate
is urgent and newsworthy.

142
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:49,161
Newsworthy here meaning broad interest,
high concern type situations.

143
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,136
Pandemic influenza is newsworthy.

144
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:57,316
New science that disrupts people's
expectations about colon cancer screening,

145
00:08:57,316 --> 00:08:58,207
newsworthy.

146
00:08:58,207 --> 00:09:01,976
They're not going to be appropriate for
just sort of updates.

147
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:04,649
Well, this is what we're
doing now type of stuff or

148
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:06,586
anything where no action is needed.

149
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:11,371
That might be appropriate to, say, put on
your website, but it's not appropriate for

150
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:13,389
trying to reach out to a journalist.

151
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:15,437
Now, blogs.

152
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:17,399
Blogs are a little bit more interesting,
right?

153
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,659
There are situations in which it's
appropriate to write something that you

154
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:24,532
just want to make available for
the broader public.

155
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:28,386
Reflections on your expertise or
your thoughts on a current issue, and

156
00:09:28,386 --> 00:09:31,213
these kinds of messages can
be useful references for

157
00:09:31,213 --> 00:09:33,606
people who are interested in those topics.

158
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:37,217
But you want to be clear that you're
not using the blog to represent

159
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:40,906
an organization,
because you're just representing yourself.

160
00:09:40,906 --> 00:09:44,950
And you also want to make sure that you
don't duplicate content that's elsewhere,

161
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,908
right, a blog is not just another
way to say the same things.

162
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:51,101
You have to use a blog to
represent something new.

163
00:09:51,101 --> 00:09:55,816
Otherwise, it's just not something
that people will be interested in.

164
00:09:55,816 --> 00:10:00,554
Now, Twitter or other similar
platforms are really interesting and

165
00:10:00,554 --> 00:10:03,749
appropriate when the issue is speed,
right?

166
00:10:03,749 --> 00:10:08,444
Twitter drives followers, you can give
fast topical alerts, you can give them new

167
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:13,290
up-to-date content and guide them to other
things that they ought to take a look at.

168
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,578
And that can be really powerful in
certain types of situations where speed

169
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:18,484
is important.

170
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:23,258
However, Twitter really is not appropriate
for reaching new audiences, right?

171
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:28,012
The only people you reach when you use
Twitter are the people who are following

172
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:31,889
you or those who then retweet what
you say to other audiences and

173
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:35,944
that can take time and
it's difficult to build a large audience.

174
00:10:35,944 --> 00:10:40,107
And it's really not appropriate for
eliciting user feedback,

175
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:43,499
not just because of
the character constraints, but

176
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:47,830
because of the asynchronous structure
of the way Twitter is used.

177
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,423
It can be a useful way of
broadcasting information, but

178
00:10:51,423 --> 00:10:53,800
it's not really a two-way street.

179
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,748
Similarly, there's issues about Facebook
or other kinds of social networks, right.

180
00:10:58,748 --> 00:11:03,808
This can be an effective way of rapidly
informing already engaged people.

181
00:11:03,808 --> 00:11:08,430
And sometimes there's easily shared
content that you can put out there and

182
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,080
see whether or
not people want to share it.

183
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,213
But Facebook is not going to be
appropriate for sensitive subjects,

184
00:11:15,213 --> 00:11:19,642
situations in which people might be
uncomfortable about what's being

185
00:11:19,642 --> 00:11:20,467
presented.

186
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:25,425
And again, it's not a good idea to use
Facebook or other social networks as

187
00:11:25,425 --> 00:11:30,069
just a way to duplicating other content
that you have on your website or

188
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:32,606
in your report, or things like that.

189
00:11:32,606 --> 00:11:35,830
So lots of choices.

190
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,066
How do you choose?

191
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:40,796
Well, honestly, I keep saying
this over and over again, but

192
00:11:40,796 --> 00:11:42,458
it's the same basic idea.

193
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,954
Go back to the basic principles.

194
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,129
Who's your audience?

195
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:47,370
What are your goals?

196
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,754
So who do you want to reach?

197
00:11:49,754 --> 00:11:51,730
When do you need to reach them?

198
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,869
What is the moment in time when
you need to reach this audience?

199
00:11:55,869 --> 00:11:59,560
And what do you want them to think, feel,

200
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,676
or do in that moment as
they're interacting?

201
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:06,636
Be clear about the answers
to these questions.

202
00:12:06,636 --> 00:12:11,583
Because that helps making the process
of selecting the right channel easier.

203
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:16,084
Now, sometimes you pick channels based
upon its strength, and honestly,

204
00:12:16,084 --> 00:12:20,517
sometimes you're just picking channels
to avoid using ones that are going to

205
00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:23,913
be useless or inappropriate for
your goals or audience.

206
00:12:23,913 --> 00:12:27,029
But either way,
being aware of the strengths and

207
00:12:27,029 --> 00:16:17,176
the weaknesses is critical to
choosing the best channels.
