00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,625
In the 20th century,

2
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:04,260
we've discovered how smoking is

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,675
a leading cause of lung
cancer and heart disease,

4
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:09,750
how the mortality rate due
to AIDS can be reduced

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,370
through the widespread
administration

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,300
of antiretroviral drugs,

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,000
and how vaccines can have

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,680
a profound effect on

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,125
the eradication of
polio and measles.

10
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,420
One of the pivotal
factors in each of

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,480
these discoveries
was biostatistics.

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,520
Biostatistics allows us to make

13
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,860
conclusions about the
world from a set of

14
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,080
data as well as quantify how

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,250
confident we are that

16
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,485
the conclusions we
make are correct.

17
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:36,170
Hi, I'm Tom Braun.

18
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,820
I'm a professor of
Biostatistics at

19
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,265
the University of Michigan,
School of Public Health.

20
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:43,100
I've been teaching Biostatistics
for over 20 years,

21
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,270
during which I've also been

22
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,130
a member of the
University of Michigan,

23
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,605
Rogel Cancer Center,

24
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:50,060
assisting colleges in
their discovery of

25
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,490
new approaches for
treating and preventing

26
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,355
cancer of the blood,
breast, and lung.

27
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:57,320
I love being a biostatistician

28
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,360
because my quantitative skills

29
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,115
allow me to contribute to

30
00:01:01,115 --> 00:01:03,680
a vast array of
public health issues.

31
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,320
More importantly, I'm
now able to critically

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,485
evaluate the claims that
are made by others.

33
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:13,040
Now, the best way for me
to kill a conversation

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,510
at dinner party is to

35
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,535
tell someone what
I do for a living.

36
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,625
For one I do, the
response is often,

37
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,920
"I had to take a
statistics class,

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,115
and I really hated it."

39
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:26,120
Now, if you have that sentiment,

40
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,725
I'm here to change
your perception

41
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:29,645
of what biostatistics is.

42
00:01:29,645 --> 00:01:32,360
My goal is to show
all of you that you

43
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,910
can use introductory
concepts of statistics and

44
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,580
probability to visually
and numerically

45
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,715
describe characteristics and
behaviors of a population,

46
00:01:40,715 --> 00:01:43,985
as well as quantify how
strongly those characteristics

47
00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:47,840
and behaviors are linked to
human health and disease.

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,179
I look forward to
passing my enthusiasm

49
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:52,175
for biostatistics to each of you.

50
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:56,275
For without biostatistics,
data are simply data.

51
00:01:56,275 --> 00:02:00,440
But with biostatistics, data
become the vehicle through

52
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,460
which we can all provide

53
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,325
profound insight about
the world around us.
