00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,920
Hello, welcome to this lecture

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,720
on Numerical Summaries of Data.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,980
In this lecture, we're going
to cover how to summarize

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,810
the spread or skepticism
in your data.

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,060
Now biostatistics is
designed to help us

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,715
make good decisions
from a set of data.

7
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:26,940
For example, does it by
giving a particular type of

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,970
antibiotic influence the
average hospital stay

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,160
after major surgery for patients?

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,770
The statistics we'll be
learning in this module,

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,360
allow us to examine the
range of evidence in

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,320
our data and then incorporate

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,765
that variability
into our decisions.

14
00:00:41,765 --> 00:00:44,990
Decisions like which treatment
for patients is better?

15
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,880
Said in statistical terms,

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,170
we need a way to assess

17
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,970
whether the mean or
the median that we

18
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,325
compute are good representations

19
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:54,575
of everyone else in the data.

20
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:56,720
In other words, how
much of the data are

21
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,335
close to the middle
that we compute?

22
00:00:59,335 --> 00:01:01,400
As you will see, the noisier or

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,290
more variable our data are,

24
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,080
the more skeptical we
are that the mean value

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,375
is really representing
everyone in the data.

26
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,355
So our learning
objectives include;

27
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:12,530
first to understand what

28
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,940
the sample standard deviation is.

29
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,250
Then to discuss how to compute

30
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,755
the sample standard deviation
from a set of data.

31
00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:21,770
To understand what the
interquartile range is.

32
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:22,910
Then to be able to compute

33
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,105
the interquartile range
from a set of data.

34
00:01:25,105 --> 00:01:27,470
Then finally, to be
able to interpret

35
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,120
a boxplot and understand its
relationship to a histogram.

36
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,930
So consider an example in
which I have 30 patients who

37
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,715
received antibiotics
while being hospitalized,

38
00:01:39,715 --> 00:01:41,590
and for each patient,

39
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,970
I record how long
they had to stay

40
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,655
in the hospital after
receiving antibiotics.

41
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:48,320
So again using some notation,

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,570
I let X_i represent the length of

43
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,060
stay in days for patient i.

44
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,390
So X_1 is the length of
stay for the first person,

45
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,220
up to X_30 which is

46
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,640
the length of stay
for the 30th person.

47
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,880
Now, I show you the values
from smallest to largest.

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,405
We see the one person stayed
only a day in the hospital,

49
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:10,100
and there was an individual who

50
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,380
stayed 49 days in the hospital,

51
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,980
and everyone else was
between those two values.

52
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,970
Now, I can compute
the sample mean of

53
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,205
these 30 observations X-bar

54
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:22,595
by adding up those 30
numbers and dividing by 30.

55
00:02:22,595 --> 00:02:24,950
That represented by the
Greek letter Sigma for

56
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,675
a sum and then dividing by
30 producing a value of 12.

57
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:32,180
So on average people in this data

58
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,270
stayed about 12 days
in the hospital.

59
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,295
Now, is 12 a good representation
of everyone in the data?

60
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:41,030
One way to answer this question,

61
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,000
is to see how different each
person's observation in

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,240
the dataset is from this
value of 12, the sample mean.

63
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,130
So I'll compute the deviation,

64
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,070
the difference between
each person's observation

65
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,220
and the sample mean.

66
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,060
However, if we take

67
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,490
the average of all
of these deviations,

68
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,560
which might seem a
common sense way to

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,420
summarize how on average
people vary around X-bar,

70
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,470
the average of these deviations

71
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,480
will be zero for any set of

72
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,745
data and any variable that

73
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:13,565
you might be computing
the sample mean from.

74
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:16,340
So the average of these
deviations is not

75
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,570
a good representation of how
spread out the data are.

76
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,035
Therefore, as an alternative,

77
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,760
we take these deviations
and we first square them.

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,460
We do not care if
someone has three values

79
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,655
perhaps below the mean or
three values above the mean.

80
00:03:31,655 --> 00:03:34,070
We just want to know that
the difference is three.

81
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,050
So to get rid of the
positive and negative sign

82
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,400
one way to do that is to square

83
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,990
everything because three and

84
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,450
negative three squared
are both nine.

85
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,240
So after squaring up all
of these deviations,

86
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,470
we add them up, again,

87
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,900
represented by the
Greek letter Sigma.

88
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,090
Again, we take an average.

89
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,905
Now we don't divide by 30.

90
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:55,130
We instead average
by 30 minus 1 for

91
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,080
mathematical and
statistical reasons

92
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,540
that I will not cover
in this course.

93
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,150
Now, this is an average
square deviation but

94
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,530
it is difficult to
talk about an average

95
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,095
squared length of
stay in the hospital.

96
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:10,610
So therefore, we take

97
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,320
a square root of this
number so that we're

98
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,180
back in the original units of

99
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,565
the data which is length of stay.

100
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:18,860
This entire value is known as

101
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,975
the sample standard deviation

102
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:22,610
of the length of
stay in our data.

103
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,535
Again, it is a number
that attempts to tell us

104
00:04:25,535 --> 00:04:28,855
how spread out our data
are from the sample mean,

105
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:31,670
a sample standard
deviation of zero would be

106
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,930
a data set in which everybody

107
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,745
had the same value as the mean.

108
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:37,340
As the sample standard
deviation grows,

109
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,320
we have observation
in the data that are

110
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,180
getting very far from the middle.

111
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,100
Now, there is another term in

112
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,520
statistics known as
the sample variance.

113
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,675
The sample variance is

114
00:04:47,675 --> 00:04:50,165
the square of the sample
standard deviation.

115
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,670
So if I take the average
square deviation and

116
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,130
do not take the square
root in the formula,

117
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,280
I end up with a number
called the sample variance,

118
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,495
which we denote as S_x
squared instead of

119
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:02,630
S_x which we use to represent

120
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,840
a notation for the sample
standard deviation.

121
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,380
In the data that I just showed
you about length of stay,

122
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,030
the standard deviation
is 9.1 days.

123
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,140
So now recall the 30 values again

124
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,075
ordered from smallest to largest.

125
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:19,460
I could also compute
the sample median

126
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,520
and there are 30 observations.

127
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,110
So the sample median must be

128
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,660
the 15th and 16th
observation in order

129
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,480
in the dataset and the
average of those two values.

130
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,180
This example, those
two values both are 10

131
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,340
and therefore the sample
median is also 10.

132
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,870
Now, if we compare
the sample median

133
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,680
of 10 to the sample mean of 12,

134
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,885
we see that the mean is
larger than the median.

135
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,515
This suggests a slightly
right-skewed distribution.

136
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:50,979
The sample mean of 12 is being
pulled to the right of 10

137
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:52,840
because of the
individual who stayed

138
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,970
49 days in the hospital,

139
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,250
that person is unusual and not

140
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,630
like most of the
observations in the data.

141
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,430
So the mean is
being pulled toward

142
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,430
that unusual or
outlying observation.

143
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,680
To summarize the noisiness or

144
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,230
the spread of the data
around the median,

145
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,355
we could simply report the
smallest and largest values.

146
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:16,415
These two values together are
known as the sample range.

147
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:21,580
So in this data, the
sample range is 1-49 days.

148
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,335
As an alternative to
the sample range,

149
00:06:24,335 --> 00:06:26,960
we can report another
range of numbers known as

150
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,505
the sample interquartile
range or IQR.

151
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:32,420
Recall, that the median is

152
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,765
the 50th percentile of the
data so that there are

153
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:38,120
observations 50 percent
of the observations below

154
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,635
that value and 50 percent
are above the value of 10.

155
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:42,980
If we return to

156
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,215
the 15 smallest observations

157
00:06:45,215 --> 00:06:47,705
and we go to the middle
of those values.

158
00:06:47,705 --> 00:06:52,000
We get a number we call
the 25th percentile or Q1.

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,565
Likewise, we go to the
15 largest observations.

160
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:58,670
We take the middle of those
15 observations leading

161
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,210
us to the 75th percentile or Q3.

162
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,000
So again the 25th
percentile tells me

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,570
the value where 25 percent

164
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,625
of people are below that value.

165
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,390
The 75th percentile
is the value of which

166
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,615
75 percent of individuals
are below that number.

167
00:07:14,615 --> 00:07:17,090
Those two percentiles reported

168
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,355
together are known as
the interquartile range.

169
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:22,260
The further the 25th and

170
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,650
75th percentiles get
from each other,

171
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,930
the more spread out the
observations are in my dataset.

172
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,060
Now, the interquartile range
is useful for creating

173
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,160
an alternative to a histogram
which we call a boxplot.

174
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,460
A boxplot is simply viewing a
histogram from up above and

175
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,690
looking down at the top of

176
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,765
the histogram and the
spread in the histogram.

177
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:47,480
Now, in the boxplot is a box,

178
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,590
and that box represents
the interquartile range.

179
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:55,065
In these data the
interquartile range is 7-14.

180
00:07:55,065 --> 00:07:58,925
The box then contains a
solid black vertical line.

181
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:00,800
That line represents
the median or

182
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,315
the 50th percentile of data
which if you recall was 10.

183
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:07,310
You can see that the
median is not necessarily

184
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,505
exactly in the middle of
the interquartile range.

185
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:12,140
It can be in the left or

186
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,960
the right hand side of
the interquartile range.

187
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,755
This represents
skewness in the data.

188
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:20,840
Again, the median is
toward the left end of

189
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,460
the interquartile range more than

190
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,310
the right-hand side of the
interquartile range, again,

191
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,560
representing right
skewness caused

192
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,660
by this observation of 49,

193
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,425
this unusually long length
of stay in our dataset.

194
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:37,070
The boxplot also contains
what we call whiskers.

195
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,450
These are connected to

196
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,330
the box with a dashed
horizontal line.

197
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,430
These two whiskers represent

198
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,240
the 5th percentile and the
95th percentile on the data.

199
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,430
Again, the fifth
percentile is the value

200
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,530
at which only five percent
of individuals are

201
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,980
below that number and
the 95th percentile is

202
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,960
the value at which
five percent of

203
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,735
the values are above
that percentile.

204
00:08:59,735 --> 00:09:02,515
This represents a
preponderance of the data.

205
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:05,645
Any observations outside
these two percentiles

206
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,250
are known as outliers.

207
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,670
In this set of data,

208
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,970
there are two individuals
who had lengths of

209
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,000
stay that will be on
the 95th percentile.

210
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,640
There can also be
outliers to the left of

211
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,770
the fifth percentile
but they do not

212
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,380
exist in these set of data.

213
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,420
Again, all of this information

214
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,690
provides whether or not there
is skewness in the data,

215
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,510
whether the skewness is to
the right or to the left and

216
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,550
exactly what the
outlying observations

217
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,645
in the data set might be.

218
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:35,700
So now to this point,

219
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,820
our sample of data allows us to

220
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,040
compute numbers that
quantify first,

221
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,740
the level of evidence our
dataset suggests we have,

222
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,005
represented by the
mean or the median.

223
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:47,030
The level of skepticism our data

224
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,680
suggests we might
have represented by

225
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,225
the sample standard deviation

226
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:52,555
or the sample
interquartile range.

227
00:09:52,555 --> 00:09:54,890
However, the elegance
and power of

228
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,750
statistics is that we can go

229
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,805
much further with these values.

230
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:00,950
We can actually use
them to guess or

231
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,050
infer what other studies

232
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,420
might have concluded
without having

233
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,941
the data from those
actual studies.
