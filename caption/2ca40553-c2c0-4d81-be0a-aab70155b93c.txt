1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,550
Hello, welcome to this lecture
in which we'll discuss

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,480
interpretation of an inference
with confidence intervals.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,225
Now that we've covered
how confidence intervals

4
00:00:10,225 --> 00:00:12,860
can be computed from the
data that we collect,

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,700
we need to know how to interpret
confidence intervals and

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,700
practice in our own research.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,130
So our learning objectives
include: first,

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,810
how to correctly interpret
confidence intervals,

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,710
to then know what
incorrect interpretations

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,420
of confidence intervals are,

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,940
to understand how the
confidence level impacts

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,935
the width of the
confidence interval,

13
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:35,260
and then to finally use a
confidence interval to make

14
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,185
conclusions about
the population mean.

15
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:40,590
So 95 percent
confidence intervals

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,690
are a function of
our sample of data.

17
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,310
So therefore, another person's

18
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,040
95 percent confidence interval

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,440
is a function of
their sample of data.

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,130
So if we have different
samples of data,

21
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,950
we'll have different 95
percent confidence intervals.

22
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,170
So here are two
investigators, Bob and Sue,

23
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,930
and the resulting 95 percent
confidence intervals

24
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,270
that they created
from their data.

25
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,920
The vertical bar represents

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,080
the sample mean and
the parentheses

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,790
represent the lower
and upper bounds of

28
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,130
their 95 percent
confidence intervals.

29
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,800
The question is, do
we know if Bob or

30
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,950
Sue has a correct or incorrect
confidence interval?

31
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,170
Again, we want confidence
intervals that

32
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,775
contain the population mean Mu.

33
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:22,990
Well, we don't know.

34
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,060
For example, if the
population mean

35
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,560
took this value here represented

36
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,860
by the green vertical bar,

37
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,265
we can see that both
confidence intervals

38
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:33,830
contain the population mean Mu.

39
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,115
Therefore, both confidence
intervals are correct.

40
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:38,390
However, if the population mean

41
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,820
Mu were further to the right,

42
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,920
we can see now that Sue has
a good confidence interval.

43
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,915
But unfortunately,
Bob produced one

44
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:47,275
that does not have Mu in it.

45
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:49,900
Conversely, if Mu were
much further to the left,

46
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,560
we could consider a
confidence interval

47
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,090
now where Bob has been able to

48
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,855
contain the correct value
Mu and Sue has not.

49
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:58,745
Finally, they both
could be incorrect,

50
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:01,040
they both could produce
confidence intervals that

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,250
are to the left of the
population mean Mu.

52
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,200
So through this example,

53
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,820
I've tried to
emphasize that we know

54
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,270
nothing about a specific
confidence interval.

55
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,280
All we know is that collectively,

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,360
95 percent of

57
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,045
all the confidence
intervals will contain Mu.

58
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:18,920
So therefore, your single

59
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,630
confidence interval
is either one of

60
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,595
the 95 percent good intervals

61
00:02:22,595 --> 00:02:26,095
or it's one of the five
percent of bad intervals.

62
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:28,880
Therefore, the following
interpretation of

63
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,295
a confidence interval I
consider it to be weak.

64
00:02:31,295 --> 00:02:33,980
If you stated that your
95 percent confident that

65
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,030
the population mean Mu is in
your confidence interval,

66
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,405
I would then ask you,

67
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:41,475
what does it mean to be
95 percent confident?

68
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:44,070
Often the answer to
that question leads

69
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,815
to the following
interpretation that is wrong.

70
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:50,180
If you stated that there is a
95 percent probability that

71
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,680
my population mean Mu is in

72
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,485
my confidence interval,
you would be wrong.

73
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:56,000
The confidence interval either

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,385
contains Mu or it does not,

75
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:01,630
there is no probability
attached to it.

76
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,960
Therefore, to correctly interpret

77
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,865
your 95 percent
confidence interval,

78
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:08,015
in this case we had a
confidence interval of

79
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:11,615
2,236, 2,464,

80
00:03:11,615 --> 00:03:14,115
I could see, in repeated sampling

81
00:03:14,115 --> 00:03:15,680
our confidence interval is

82
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,120
either one of the 95 percent of

83
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,850
confidence intervals that
contain Mu or one of

84
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,410
the five percent of
confidence intervals

85
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,030
that do not contain Mu.

86
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,240
Again, this can also level
our confidence because

87
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,070
95 percent of the
confidence intervals

88
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,600
are good and five are bad,

89
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,340
you have a better
chance of being one of

90
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,540
the good confidence intervals

91
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,265
than one of the bad intervals.

92
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:37,280
However, that
interpretation is not

93
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,355
really pleasing in terms
of our specific data.

94
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:42,380
So second interpretation
would be that

95
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,510
our confidence interval
describes a range of

96
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,490
values for the population mean

97
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,785
Mu that are supported
by our data.

98
00:03:48,785 --> 00:03:50,750
So that although
our best estimate

99
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,800
for the population mean

100
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,420
Mu is the sample
mean of 2,350 grams,

101
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,430
accounting for the
sampling variability

102
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,810
the population mean
could be as low as

103
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:05,470
2,236 grams or as
high as 2,464 grams.

104
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,580
Now, recalling the computation

105
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,930
of the confidence interval,

106
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,940
I multiplied the standard
error of the mean by

107
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,970
two and this is two
standard deviations which

108
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,160
comes from the fact
that 95 percent of

109
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,720
the normal distribution is

110
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,135
within two standard
deviations of the mean.

111
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,720
So therefore, I could compute

112
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,200
a 68 percent confidence
interval by looking

113
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,460
at one standard deviation

114
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,230
to the left or right of the mean.

115
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,320
Now, all other confidence
levels need to be

116
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,410
looked up in a textbook
or used with a computer.

117
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,970
So for example, if you wanted

118
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,980
a 90 percent confidence interval,

119
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,890
you would need to know the
value of the factor f,

120
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,850
such that values
that are within f

121
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,380
times the standard
deviation around

122
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,560
Mu covering 90 percent of
that normal distribution.

123
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,320
I didn't give that value
in my previous lecture,

124
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,245
and the actual computation
is quite complex.

125
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:55,610
But I tell you here,

126
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,300
that if you want a 90
percent confidence interval,

127
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,560
you would multiply the
standard error of the mean

128
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,915
by a value of 1.65.

129
00:05:02,915 --> 00:05:04,180
So I ask you now,

130
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,955
as compared to the 95
percent confidence interval,

131
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:08,990
will the 90 percent
confidence interval

132
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,780
be wider or narrower?

133
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,910
Because we are multiplying

134
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,830
the standard error of the mean by

135
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:20,515
a smaller number f of
1.65 instead of two,

136
00:05:20,515 --> 00:05:22,160
you can see that the
confidence interval

137
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,050
will actually be narrower.

138
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,915
So that when we reduce
our confidence,

139
00:05:26,915 --> 00:05:29,800
the confidence interval
becomes narrower.

140
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,700
Conversely, suppose I want

141
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,145
a 99 percent confidence interval.

142
00:05:34,145 --> 00:05:36,350
So the value f that
it would multiply by

143
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,285
the standard error of the
mean is actually 2.58.

144
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:42,080
So you can see now
that because I'm

145
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,195
multiplying by a bigger number,

146
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:46,355
the confidence interval
will get wider.

147
00:05:46,355 --> 00:05:49,280
So that a 99 percent
confidence interval is

148
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,850
wider than a 95 percent
confidence interval.

149
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,940
Now, let's return to our
example in which we had

150
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,260
a sample of 100 children

151
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,060
who were born to
uninsured mothers.

152
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,890
From the data in that sample,

153
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,620
we found that a 95 percent
confidence interval for

154
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,620
the population mean birthweight
of newborns born to

155
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:13,050
uninsured mothers was 2,236
grams up to 2,464 grams.

156
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,210
Now, we know that a healthy
birthweight is currently

157
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,250
defined as 2,500 grams.

158
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,290
So based upon the evidence
provided in our study,

159
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,050
do we believe that the
population of babies

160
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,035
born to uninsured mothers
have healthy birthweights?

161
00:06:27,035 --> 00:06:28,625
Then the question is, why?

162
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,020
What evidence do we have

163
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,680
to negate or agree
with this statement?

164
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,360
Well, if we draw a picture
of our confidence interval,

165
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,070
again the middle of this
confidence interval

166
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,620
is the sample mean of 2,350,

167
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,480
and we see the upper
and lower bounds

168
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,995
of this confidence interval.

169
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:46,190
Again, this confidence
interval is a range of

170
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,285
values for the population
mean that my data support.

171
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,430
Twenty five hundred is not in

172
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,380
this confidence
interval and therefore,

173
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,739
my data do not support
that these babies

174
00:06:57,739 --> 00:07:01,550
in the population have a mean
birthweight of 2,500 grams,

175
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,180
it is actually a value
somewhere below 2,500 grams.

176
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,420
So we can use the confidence
interval here to reject

177
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,640
the hypothesis that these babies

178
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,070
have an average birthweight
of 2,500 grams.

179
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,605
The data do not
support that value.

180
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:18,500
Now, imagine that the sample mean

181
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,080
and the sample standard
deviation are unchanged,

182
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,090
but the sample size was

183
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,925
only 50 children rather
than 100 children.

184
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:27,800
Again, you can use
the formula for

185
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,300
a 95 percent confidence interval.

186
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,440
The only thing that
has changed is

187
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,020
the sample size and the
confidence interval is now

188
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,310
2,189 grams to 2,511 grams.

189
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,330
So based upon this
smaller sample,

190
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,650
do our conclusions change?

191
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,370
So again, if we draw a picture

192
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,765
of our confidence interval,

193
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:47,005
again centered at
the sample mean,

194
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:48,770
we can now see that

195
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,200
the conjectured value
of 2,500 representing

196
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,820
a healthy birthweight is

197
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,595
now in sign to the
confidence interval.

198
00:07:55,595 --> 00:07:59,150
Our data do support the
possibility that these women give

199
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,070
birth to babies with healthy
birthweights on average.

200
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,750
So confidence intervals
are a way to use

201
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,860
the data to make

202
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,560
conclusions about a
population parameter.

203
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,360
With one set of data,

204
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,760
I can find a whole
range of values that

205
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,760
are plausible for the
mean of the population.

206
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,610
Confidence intervals
belong to a whole body of

207
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,820
statistical inference known
as hypothesis testing,

208
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,380
which will encompass
some majority of

209
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,373
the rest of the lectures
in this course.
