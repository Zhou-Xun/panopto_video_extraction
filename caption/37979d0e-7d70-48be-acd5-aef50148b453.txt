1
00:00:18,472 --> 00:00:29,472
script, so that is now available in case you would like to enable that on your end the session is being recorded.

2
00:00:29,472 --> 00:00:32,472
If you have any questions, please feel free to use the chat.

3
00:00:32,472 --> 00:00:39,472
I have my chat menu up here. feel free to unmute your microphone and ask questions.

4
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:42,472
Those in the room may speak up any time as well.

5
00:00:42,472 --> 00:00:55,472
Just note that you will get picked up in the recording I'm gonna discourage the use of the zoom race hand function just because that's a little difficult for me to see while i'm screen sharing see if I can

6
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,908
make this a little bit bigger a lot

7
00:00:59,054 --> 00:01:06,054
So what is Panopto? Panopto is a program that is licensed by the school of public health.

8
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:23,054
So it's not a university wide tool so it's a couple of things like, if you if you ends up teaching with a non sph canvas site, or teaching in a classroom outside the school of public health you may

9
00:01:23,054 --> 00:01:28,054
not see this as easily as you would in Sph:

10
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:33,054
Others. Units in schools are on campus. Use different tools for classroom recording.

11
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:42,054
We use panopo it's extremely flexible for video audio screen recording my first bullet.

12
00:01:42,054 --> 00:01:49,054
They've got different types of recorders a desktop recorder which we're gonna demo today.

13
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:56,054
A mobile recorder. So they have an app so if you're out in the field and want to capture something and send it to your canvas site.

14
00:01:56,054 --> 00:02:07,054
Yes, if students are recording videos. they can use the mobile app there's now a web app which was in Beta last fall.

15
00:02:07,054 --> 00:02:15,054
And now it's ready to go that means there is a browser tab that you can do all the record settings you need.

16
00:02:15,054 --> 00:02:18,054
And so this is a great option for student recordings.

17
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:27,054
If you wanna record from your own personal computer and not have to install the Panopto software, and it's also a great option.

18
00:02:27,054 --> 00:02:45,054
If you're teaching or doing a talk or presentation outside of the School of Public Health, where sph it do not manage the computers that you can't install things New this Year we are piloting a remote

19
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:56,054
recorder. This is a pre installed Pano program that we can set to automatically start recording and stop recording at the times.

20
00:02:56,054 --> 00:03:04,054
You tell us So it's currently in the third floor 37, 55.

21
00:03:04,054 --> 00:03:09,054
If you teach in there. But if you are interested in trying this out send me a message.

22
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:15,054
I'm gonna have our email at the end we'd love to talk to you about it.

23
00:03:15,054 --> 00:03:28,054
It's a very hands off option it loses a little bit of the flexibility of settings that you might change in the desktop recorder, but it's more of a set and forget it it's gonna

24
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:36,054
start recording automatically. and we'll schedule those all, even before the semester begins.

25
00:03:36,054 --> 00:03:39,054
You could upload existing video to Panopo.

26
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:50,054
So if you have some files on your computer, or maybe somebody shared a recording with dropbox, you can upload those 2 panopto so that they exist in your canvas site.

27
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:58,054
This is also a plenty of existing video as an option. If you're trying to save and share zoom recordings.

28
00:03:58,054 --> 00:04:13,054
The University has a 150 day storage limit on zoom recordings, and so uploading those to Panopo is a great way to preserve those long term within the course they happened in as another way for students to access

29
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:25,054
those We have a lot of courses that contact us a year later, saying I wanted to see them recordings from our remote class last year.

30
00:04:25,054 --> 00:04:37,054
And those are often long gone student upload that I mentioned we'll talk a little bit about that it offers in video discussion and quiz questions.

31
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:45,054
If you're interested in that option, it has a live stream, so you may not necessarily always want this for your class.

32
00:04:45,054 --> 00:04:55,054
But maybe a one off scenario, whereas student is, has been exposed to Covid, or whatever it has to stay out of the classroom.

33
00:04:55,054 --> 00:04:58,054
They can view it live. Just know, potato is not like zoom.

34
00:04:58,054 --> 00:05:12,054
There's no interaction it's just a one way broadcast Pinato offers auto-generated captions that you can add to your videos at after the fact.

35
00:05:12,054 --> 00:05:22,054
It will also you can also upload captions to zoom and it will put them on there, and there's also a canvas integration like I said so.

36
00:05:22,054 --> 00:05:31,054
It's sort of our go to way to record in the classroom, and have those set directly to your canvas site.

37
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:35,054
So we'd like it because it has a ton of functionality.

38
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:41,054
And a lot of flexibility for whatever you're trying to do so.

39
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:50,054
Why do we record? We record covid it's a huge reason right now, this semester and last year we don't know what's going on.

40
00:05:50,054 --> 00:06:04,054
Things change. Students need to miss a few classes there's just still some uncertainty, and so, by recording each of your class sessions you can be ready to support those students.

41
00:06:04,054 --> 00:06:14,054
But even before Covid school public health, which was using panopto to record in the classroom simply to support student learning, they get to review these things.

42
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:25,054
As we think of students who need a little bit more processing time and review people who are not need of English speakers who may need to watch things over again.

43
00:06:25,054 --> 00:06:32,054
Question, Yeah. So is put up to load it on all the all of the computers and all the lecture rooms.

44
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:38,054
It is in the school public health, with the exception, and Matt vendor from classroom services, is online.

45
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:45,054
Correct me if i'm wrong with the exception of the sites, labs in the basement.

46
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:52,054
Yes, and it's not on the student machines and 2615, which is the second floor lab.

47
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:56,054
It is on the instructor station in that room, though.

48
00:06:56,054 --> 00:07:02,054
Take that

49
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,054
And the site flaps just because university it manages both computers.

50
00:07:05,054 --> 00:07:12,054
So they control what software goes on there. in the fall 2021.

51
00:07:12,054 --> 00:07:17,054
So last year, this time last year we had 82 courses, using puncto to record.

52
00:07:17,054 --> 00:07:29,054
Maybe it was just one or 2 or every week for the whole semester, so it got a lot of use in the winter semester instructional services sent out a survey to students.

53
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:38,054
We got 210 respondents, and of those 200 1,113 indicated that puncto was used in their course.

54
00:07:38,054 --> 00:07:47,054
It was the second highest tool we were quiz. We were asking them, What tools are your instructors using just out of our curiosity of like, you know.

55
00:07:47,054 --> 00:07:55,054
What tools are they using? How did you like it? How well was it used 113?

56
00:07:55,054 --> 00:08:01,054
Put up to was the second after Zoom Zoom pinnacle.

57
00:08:01,054 --> 00:08:07,054
We then followed up by asking them, how frequently would you look at those pinnacle recordings?

58
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:12,054
And so the biggest answers we got were all the time for occasionally.

59
00:08:12,054 --> 00:08:19,054
We got a little bit of never and we got a little bit of I would watch these, but they're not available.

60
00:08:19,054 --> 00:08:25,054
My Professor doesn't record our class so we'd love to you know.

61
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:32,054
Pick up a few more classes where these are made available to students.

62
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:37,054
We also ask them Why? what motivated them to watch the recordings?

63
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:42,054
The number. one reason being they missed class and so we didn't expect this to be the number one.

64
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:47,054
Reason. the second reason was to gain a better understanding.

65
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:55,054
Their third reason was before an exam, reviewing and prepping, and then number 4.

66
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:57,054
Phonoo was somehow involved in assigned viewing.

67
00:08:57,054 --> 00:09:04,054
They need to come meet

68
00:09:04,054 --> 00:09:08,054
I do want to briefly talk about privacy with classroom recording.

69
00:09:08,054 --> 00:09:17,054
You of Mit has a guide for recording classroom activities, and i'm going to share this link with you when I share the slides out.

70
00:09:17,054 --> 00:09:23,054
A lot of the language centers around the use of zoom for recording, because they talk a lot about.

71
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:28,054
Try to show the instructor and not record student video feeds.

72
00:09:28,054 --> 00:09:37,054
This it's in the classroom we have a 3 60 camera, but it focuses on whoever is speaking.

73
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:45,054
So there's not the same amount of flexibility but that website provides some syllabus language that you might review and see if you want to incorporate.

74
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:49,054
On we're recording and here's sort of dos and don't.

75
00:09:49,054 --> 00:10:00,054
You can do with this recording. and they emphasize on this like sharing only with members of the class which Panopto is set up to do automatically by loading into your canvas site and only going to your

76
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:12,054
canvas site. your controlling that. Only the members of that court site have access to those recordings

77
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:19,054
Alright, so let's look at how it works

78
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:27,054
Your first step is to check in your canvas site and see if connecto recordings is in that left hand.

79
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:37,054
Navigation menu. So this is the first step is to enable an opt out in your canvas site You're gonna tell us how to do that.

80
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:41,054
Yes, the steps right here i'll give you a moment to go ahead and log in.

81
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:46,054
If you want to do that. So in your site you're gonna go to the settings, menu.

82
00:10:46,054 --> 00:10:53,054
It's always the last item in the list

83
00:10:53,054 --> 00:11:10,054
Across the top it's a tab for navigation Here's where we control what students see in that navigation menu for your course.

84
00:11:10,054 --> 00:11:16,054
So the first block of tools at the top are all of the inabled tools for your course.

85
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:26,054
But if you scroll below that, there is an extremely long list of available tools, and these are some university wide tools. if there's some Fp.

86
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:39,054
Tools, library you're gonna scroll through that list and look for puncto recordings

87
00:11:39,054 --> 00:11:51,054
When you find it there's 3 dots. on the far right of that adopto recordings tool. and if you click it, you'll be able to enable it.

88
00:11:51,054 --> 00:11:59,054
Okay, Sorry You found it awesome by default.

89
00:11:59,054 --> 00:12:06,054
Once you enable it. it's gonna drop it down to the bottom of the menu of that block in the top.

90
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:14,054
But you can click and drag that to appear anywhere. so if you if you're recording every class.

91
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:32,054
This semester you might bump it up a little higher, so it's more visible to the students before you leave this page scroll all the way to the bottom of the page, and click the save button.

92
00:12:32,054 --> 00:12:38,054
Once you hit save you should now see Panopto recordings in your left hand.

93
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:58,054
Course, menu, and go ahead and click on it by clicking on it. that's going to It's gonna load for a few seconds, and that is gonna basically generate your course folder in the Panopo server and it's

94
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:09,054
also going to tell the Panopo Tell Panopo that those who are in the teacher role in this canvas site can add add videos.

95
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:19,054
And those who are students in this canvas site can view only

96
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:24,054
Alright. So when you get to class you're in the Sp.

97
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:35,054
Classroom. you want to use the windows computer that's at the teacher workstation that's because it's already connected up with the audio and video devices you need and it already has panopo installed and

98
00:13:35,054 --> 00:13:42,054
it's ready to go

99
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:48,054
Yes, and additionally, you're gonna be able to record your screen.

100
00:13:48,054 --> 00:13:53,054
So anything you need to pull up, whether it's canvas pull up Powerpoint slides.

101
00:13:53,054 --> 00:14:01,054
Whatever the classroom also has, and recording with Panopo quick reference sheet.

102
00:14:01,054 --> 00:14:06,054
Just would be a great reference particularly your first time looking at it.

103
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:15,054
Or if you're able to get into the classroom before your class first meet, just to look at it. it's gonna go through the steps that i'm about to go through now.

104
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:30,054
But the most important thing is on the back. Matt has highlighted the recommended video and audio tools to make sure you get the best video and audio for your recordings.

105
00:14:30,054 --> 00:14:35,054
So panel is pretty good at remembering your settings from last time.

106
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:52,054
So that's a huge help so checking on that the first time you set up is gonna help you have a successful recording, and those are in each classroom.

107
00:14:52,054 --> 00:15:05,054
When you come in to the classroom you're gonna log into the windows computer, and i'm gonna suggest that your first step is to log into your campus site and launch Panopo from there.

108
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:22,054
What that's gonna do is prompt panocto to log you in, so that the instructor who just taught before you is not logged in, and you recordings go to their campus site.

109
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:30,054
So when we're re when we're, coming in and out and all working through on the same computer, that's a possibility.

110
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:37,054
So launching it from your campus site is going to eliminate that.

111
00:15:37,054 --> 00:15:45,054
So one of the things I do when i'm coming into the classroom computers is to navigate to canvas.

112
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:50,054
I'll start at the you mishu web page just because that's easy to remember.

113
00:15:50,054 --> 00:15:55,054
A lot of people will Google canvas campus youish, which is totally fine.

114
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:58,054
But if I go to you, Mitch Edu, and use the quick links.

115
00:15:58,054 --> 00:16:04,054
Toolbar canvas is the second item

116
00:16:04,054 --> 00:16:12,054
And I logged in a minute as I was setting up so it took me directly to my dashboard without the login step.

117
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:21,054
I'm gonna go to one of my practice sites where I have Panopto recordings

118
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:25,054
And this is what my site currently looks like. I have some recordings.

119
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:39,054
I have some folders. Let me see if I can go to a different course that doesn't happen much that's in it

120
00:16:39,054 --> 00:16:39,219
Right me. Well, I enable it

121
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:51,160
So you're gonna have a blank canvas with a big green create button at the top.

122
00:16:51,160 --> 00:17:06,160
So create this. How you add content when i'm in the classroom I'm going to use this very first option panopto for windows

123
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,160
It's gonna show you a lot of launch options but what we want is the top one launch panel.

124
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:26,160
This is gonna open the program that's already installed in the computer, and because the browser wants to make sure that you wanna you wanted to launch a program, it's gonna give you a queue.

125
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:40,656
Are you sure you want to open this? And you can check this box and just say, yeah, always let Chrome open pinopto for me

126
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:51,550
Once you have that set you now have the recorder open

127
00:17:51,550 --> 00:18:01,550
Anything else.

128
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:10,550
Up here at the top. I can get my laser pointer up here at the top.

129
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,550
It's going to let you set the folder this should default.

130
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:22,550
This will default to your canvas site so you can leave that it's gonna allow you to name your recording.

131
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:36,550
If you want to name it something specific it's gonna default to the date and the time, and it's totally fine to especially when you're in a hurry. It builds something in so that you can just keep moving

132
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:41,550
it's gonna jump to the default settings that as you're getting used to it.

133
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:48,550
You can double check with the quick reference Cheap it's on your desk on the table, hey?

134
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:55,550
Joanna. Yes, I think we're just still seeing the open pan opto screen.

135
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:01,550
We're not actually seeing the application. Oh, i'm sorry yep I know what doing them.

136
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:09,550
It's because i'm not sharing my whole screen application scattered all over the screen.

137
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,796
We do a screen share

138
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:23,257
The name if you want to title it video and audio it's gonna default

139
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:29,257
It's gonna look for defaults which are often time to be the meeting out camera and audio.

140
00:19:29,257 --> 00:19:34,257
Some rooms have better audio systems. So Matt has set those up.

141
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:37,257
It should default to the shore again, checking that reference.

142
00:19:37,257 --> 00:19:43,257
Guy, and all of these items are checked. My Powerpoint record, my main screen.

143
00:19:43,257 --> 00:20:00,257
To make sure I get everything I show depending on whether it's far, whether it's powerpoint, if I'm working in canvas or Google slides and i'm gonna hit the red record button

144
00:20:00,257 --> 00:20:11,257
So I have a counter right here and now i'm ready to teach

145
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:16,257
And so now that is rolling in the background and capturing all this.

146
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:25,257
So again I mentioned the remote recorder pilot Yes, question Looks like It's just capturing you, though it's not capturing this.

147
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:33,257
The what's showing on the screen is that right except it is. it's capturing everything. It just didn't give me a preview of it in the application.

148
00:20:33,257 --> 00:20:45,257
The reason I know is because this checkbox here capture main screen let me switch to the main screen.

149
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:53,257
It hides it. let's see it hides it by default, because it creates this infinity mirror.

150
00:20:53,257 --> 00:21:03,257
Concerned enough people that they were like maybe we'll just not make that the default

151
00:21:03,257 --> 00:21:06,257
So again, just putting the remote recorder out there.

152
00:21:06,257 --> 00:21:18,257
This has our email address, and then you also i'll also share that out in my email after the session Rico pano capture.

153
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:28,257
This is the tool that does the in browser. So if I were maybe my class is meeting in a different location.

154
00:21:28,257 --> 00:21:39,257
But I did want to capture what we're talking about I can hit the create button and hit an octo capture.

155
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:43,257
So is that second option that's kind of pop open hey, browser window?

156
00:21:43,257 --> 00:21:49,257
Let's see if this really messes everything up

157
00:21:49,257 --> 00:22:04,257
That's gonna open this browser window or I get to pick my audio and video sources, and if I want to share any screen, the most important thing when using Panapto capture is to hit allow on these

158
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:19,257
prompts, and let chrome access your devices i'm gonna cancel out of that, because i'm using a lot of devices as it is.

159
00:22:19,257 --> 00:22:24,257
But a great way to create quick videos from your computer.

160
00:22:24,257 --> 00:22:34,257
Alright. So now i'm gonna go back classes over i'm, closing all my applications and i'm gonna hit the stop.

161
00:22:34,257 --> 00:22:50,257
But it's gonna Say, all right we stopped it it's gonna give me another opportunity to change the name if I want and I can hit done at the top. there.

162
00:22:50,257 --> 00:22:57,257
It happened really quickly, because that was a short recording it's gonna do an upload step once it does an upload step.

163
00:22:57,257 --> 00:23:03,257
I'm good once it's uploaded I can get out of here.

164
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:12,257
Now it's going to appear at the top of this list and start processing, and it does all of that in the cloud, so I don't have to stick. around and Wait for it, cause I've got to get my stuff get to a

165
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:18,257
meeting get to my next class. The next class is coming in and notice all these past recordings.

166
00:23:18,257 --> 00:23:29,257
These are other classes that have recorded in here and that's because we save a backup of the recordings to the local hard drive.

167
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:35,257
But I just wanna let you know that these are also restricted for view access.

168
00:23:35,257 --> 00:23:47,257
So if I were to hit view on any of these I wouldn't be able to see it, because i'm not in those class, and if at any time you want you can come and delete your recordings, once they finished

169
00:23:47,257 --> 00:23:54,257
uploading. If you don't want those on the hard drive at all.

170
00:23:54,257 --> 00:24:12,257
So after class that's, uploading it's processing and now, when I go back to canvas and I refresh my screen, that's coming in, it's ready, because that was so that was a very short recording it's ready

171
00:24:12,257 --> 00:24:22,257
to watch now an hour and a half class it's gonna take 5, 10 min, but it's very quick.

172
00:24:22,257 --> 00:24:28,257
So let's see what that looks like I wanna point out that when I hover because i'm an instructor.

173
00:24:28,257 --> 00:24:32,257
I'm, the instructor of this canvas site when I hover my mouse over the title of the recording.

174
00:24:32,257 --> 00:24:38,257
I have all these menu options. I can look at settings, and that was gonna allow me to give it a different name.

175
00:24:38,257 --> 00:24:48,257
If I want I can share this again, it's already shared with your students in this canvas site, I can edit.

176
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:54,257
So if I need to trim a little off the end, because the student started a conversation with me before I was able to stop it.

177
00:24:54,257 --> 00:25:12,257
I can do that if you want to look and see if any students watch this video, you can look at the stats, and then you can always delete a video that you upload So if I click on the title of that this is

178
00:25:12,257 --> 00:25:17,257
what students see?

179
00:25:17,257 --> 00:25:26,257
In the upper left hand corner is the video window and so that is picking up from the meeting owl.

180
00:25:26,257 --> 00:25:38,257
So that's further divided into a 360 view at the top and close up view of whoever is speaking, and again, the center is

181
00:25:38,257 --> 00:25:44,257
The screen

182
00:25:44,257 --> 00:25:50,257
On the left hand side. It kind of tries to guess and create chapter markers for you.

183
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,257
So I've noticed it's starting to do .

184
00:25:53,257 --> 00:25:56,257
Optical character recognition on screen recordings to kind of help.

185
00:25:56,257 --> 00:26:05,257
Divvy up your content. that's. basically it if you want to do more with your recordings.

186
00:26:05,257 --> 00:26:14,257
There's a lot you can do if you don't that it's walking launch panopa from canvas.

187
00:26:14,257 --> 00:26:28,257
It. record each stop recording. Thank you.

188
00:26:28,257 --> 00:26:36,257
So there's some additional options. as I said like you can do as little or as much as you want, and there's some additional options you can set.

189
00:26:36,257 --> 00:26:47,257
These are automatically set to be available to your students, but you can change the setting to where you want to approve them before posting.

190
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:52,257
Perhaps if you maybe don't want to automatically post all of them.

191
00:26:52,257 --> 00:26:57,257
But you want to like. If no one was absent, maybe you choose not to renew.

192
00:26:57,257 --> 00:27:02,257
So it depends on some of what your purposes are and if there's any reason why you might want to hold those back.

193
00:27:02,257 --> 00:27:17,257
You might approve before posting, because I want to make sure there's nothing I need to cut out for instance, if your class is a 3 h class, and you have a break in the middle and you wanna maybe cut those breaks out before

194
00:27:17,257 --> 00:27:24,257
you publish that for your students. That would be a reason to kind of hold them back and not post automatically.

195
00:27:24,257 --> 00:27:29,257
I will show you that real quick in canvas I have.

196
00:27:29,257 --> 00:27:40,257
I showed you those setting menus for each individual recording but I also have the settings here, and some options for my entire folder.

197
00:27:40,257 --> 00:27:49,257
So it's gonna show me analytics on all the recordings in this course, and I can set settings for all the recordings in this course.

198
00:27:49,257 --> 00:28:01,257
So if I click on that settings gear i'm now setting parameters for everything in this course

199
00:28:01,257 --> 00:28:12,257
I believe it is the settings menu so in the left hand is overview share and settings.

200
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:19,257
There's some other options you several other options you can look at, but i'm going to scroll down and show you the update.

201
00:28:19,257 --> 00:28:24,257
So by default. we have these calls set to become available immediately.

202
00:28:24,257 --> 00:28:41,257
But you can change this to when approved by a publisher, and you can be the publisher, or you can set a ta gsi someone like that to be a publisher on your behalf or with you and

203
00:28:41,257 --> 00:28:48,257
then setting time, restrictions, sessions remain available. We have them set to forever.

204
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:53,257
But you can modify that if you want to. send these up to become unavailable.

205
00:28:53,257 --> 00:29:02,257
At the end of the semester

206
00:29:02,257 --> 00:29:11,257
You can trim and edit so let's look at that on set out

207
00:29:11,257 --> 00:29:16,257
Again. When I cover over my mouse I wanna click on the edit menu.

208
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:26,257
This brings up something similar to the viewer without the the video window in the upper left corner.

209
00:29:26,257 --> 00:29:39,257
But I have a timeline of my video here, at the bottom and it includes audio waveforms, which is really nice, because I can see really clearly where i'm speaking and where i'm not speaking if you're cutting.

210
00:29:39,257 --> 00:29:54,257
out breaks. For instance, this will be really helpful because still be really little quiet. and then it's gonna be really really loud in the waveforms whenever one starts kind of getting up and moving, and talking all at once when i'm on this

211
00:29:54,257 --> 00:30:01,257
timeline in edit mode, and I want to trim something off the beginning.

212
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:14,257
I can move my mouse to the beginning, or all the way at the end, and get a gray bar and a 2 headed pointer

213
00:30:14,257 --> 00:30:22,257
When I have that 2 pointed 2 headed pointer, I can click my mouse button and drag that.

214
00:30:22,257 --> 00:30:45,257
Yeah. So i've now created sort of a grade out zone of my timeline and a center a white did. You will turn your cameras off because you saw it in this recording Everybody flipped out on me and I

215
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:55,257
couldn't figure out why I think I know Why, that anyway. and I could do the same thing at the end.

216
00:30:55,257 --> 00:31:00,257
So that's just a basic trim from the beginning trip me in.

217
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:06,257
So say I want to remove something from the middle, and at any time I can play and see.

218
00:31:06,257 --> 00:31:16,257
So again, an option that's gonna population and find the the area that I want to work in.

219
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:27,257
I can just go my mouse anywhere and hold the mouse button down and drag

220
00:31:27,257 --> 00:31:42,257
And so now what's gonna happen is when I save this an octo is gonna play only the the highlighted sections.

221
00:31:42,257 --> 00:32:00,257
The active sections. it's going to skip over the grade out sections, and I can demo that if you'd like i'll get it close So again, just putting the number of recorder out there so I don't know if you can see

222
00:32:00,257 --> 00:32:07,257
that red playhead, but it just jumped over everything to give you an idea

223
00:32:07,257 --> 00:32:12,257
And then I would hit apply here at the top, which is gonna reprocess.

224
00:32:12,257 --> 00:32:18,257
That video with the edits

225
00:32:18,257 --> 00:32:24,257
And I want to talk about how to apply captions because that's also in edit mode.

226
00:32:24,257 --> 00:32:37,257
If I want to utilize those auto-generated captions in the left hand, menu of the editor, I can use the captions.

227
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:47,257
There's an import caption dropdown menu and it gives me the ability to upload a caption file.

228
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:56,257
So if i'm posting a zoom, recording I always download that transcript from zoom and upload it, because it'll accept it.

229
00:32:56,257 --> 00:33:04,257
If I if i'm recording live i'll use import automatic captions

230
00:33:04,257 --> 00:33:08,257
And so I can scan through and see if there's anything obvious that looks wrong.

231
00:33:08,257 --> 00:33:21,257
It usually gets my name really wrong. They have also incorporated newly incorporated a find and replace option right here.

232
00:33:21,257 --> 00:33:40,257
So you can. If you see a word mispronounced over and over, you can type it in and enter a replace with, and you could do a replace all, or go item by item to make sure that

233
00:33:40,257 --> 00:33:41,380
You want to replace those? I did a training session a week ago for a tool called Critic, with a K.

234
00:33:43,131 --> 00:33:50,131
So I would apply these here. it's gonna it's accepted that.

235
00:33:50,131 --> 00:34:01,131
And it's gonna go work on it and so here it's now made this video temporarily unavailable until it finishes processing.

236
00:34:01,131 --> 00:34:20,131
So if I did this prior to publicishing it wouldn't interrupt anyone's view there'd be a publish opportunity to come back when this is finished, and make this available to students

237
00:34:20,131 --> 00:34:25,131
So that is the recording in the classroom process.

238
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:32,131
But the session was called Do more with Panopto, so I wanted to just highlight a couple of other things you could do with a panopto.

239
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:39,131
One of them is we're encouraging instructors to record a course tour with Panopto.

240
00:34:39,131 --> 00:34:47,131
One of the things I mentioned that survey we did the campus survey for students, and one of the things students say every year.

241
00:34:47,131 --> 00:34:56,131
Is. Is there any way you could make the venues in the same place for every class?

242
00:34:56,131 --> 00:34:58,131
So every instructor organizes the canvas site differently.

243
00:34:58,131 --> 00:35:14,131
They put their materials in different places, whether it's modules, pages, files, and students feel like they have to relearn canvas and remember where each instructor puts their content so we can't

244
00:35:14,131 --> 00:35:18,131
block those things. and that really is up to the instructor.

245
00:35:18,131 --> 00:35:23,131
But one thing you could do is record a course tour and let students know

246
00:35:23,131 --> 00:35:30,131
You know, as soon as you publish your course you could share a video where you tell them where they're gonna find their assignments.

247
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:32,131
Where are they gonna find the instructions, the assignments?

248
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:38,131
Where are they gonna be able to find the meetings? Where are they gonna find the schedule?

249
00:35:38,131 --> 00:35:45,131
So here's a sample i'm gonna jump ahead because you don't even need to be in it.

250
00:35:45,131 --> 00:36:03,131
I'm gonna skip ahead a little bit to where it's just the screen share construction the grading policy course policies

251
00:36:03,131 --> 00:36:09,131
In the course schedule

252
00:36:09,131 --> 00:36:17,131
You can also download a pdf version from here Let's go back to the home page.

253
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:23,131
If you click, on the instructor's link so that's just a quick sample.

254
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:36,131
I'll share this out afterward we actually have a template script as well, and this would be a great opportunity to either practice using panopto or utilize the Panopto it'll record

255
00:36:36,131 --> 00:36:52,131
audio video, and only if you wanna share your video. but audio and canvas, I will point out that for this demo and one of our recommendations is Monica, who recorded this is displaying the course in student

256
00:36:52,131 --> 00:37:00,131
view, which is very important, because when, when we're not in student view, this menu goes all the way down the page.

257
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:08,131
But we wanna look at things the way students see it particularly when they show when we're showing them what it's gonna look like for them.

258
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:15,131
And so it will show things that are tools that are being used it won't show them items that have not yet been published.

259
00:37:15,131 --> 00:37:26,131
So that's one of our recommendations for using a course tour, and I was like, even if you're showing canvas, and maybe demoing it in your first class meeting, putting it in zoom view.

260
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:32,131
So it looks closer to what their view looks like and i'll show that really quickly.

261
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:38,131
Because yes, I don't I I know I have some assignments.

262
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:44,131
Yeah, so, and notice in my assignments i've got some drag handles over here.

263
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:51,131
I've got menu items to make edits I have options up here.

264
00:37:51,131 --> 00:38:14,131
But when I go into student view, those things go away, and the view is a little cleaner, and my menu short here because it's not showing things that are not available to students

265
00:38:14,131 --> 00:38:24,131
Head in the lower right corner, I can leave so view to go back to a destructive deal

266
00:38:24,131 --> 00:38:29,131
Media assignments is another thing. that is possible with Panopo.

267
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:36,131
Let's see if I have another yeah you can set that up for student media submissions.

268
00:38:36,131 --> 00:38:45,131
Potato offers. what's called an assignment. folder meaning students record, and they get to if they want to install the desktop recorder like is here.

269
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:49,131
They can. They can use Panopto, or they can upload.

270
00:38:49,131 --> 00:38:59,131
So. So some people have gotten very comfortable with recording with zoom, and they would be able to download that and upload it here if they'd like

271
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:13,131
The assignment, folder, has options where maybe they can't see one of another submissions where they can only see if they've submitted something, and not their peers, but you can also enable it.

272
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:17,131
To where they they can see what their peers have submitted as well.

273
00:39:17,131 --> 00:39:29,131
So if you want to make it easy for them to see one another's presentations introduction videos it's an elevator pitch type of assignment and i'll show you where that is let me jump back over

274
00:39:29,131 --> 00:39:41,131
to my canvas site in Panopo. That, again is gonna be the settings gear at the course level.

275
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:52,131
And right here on this overview tab is and create assignment, folder option

276
00:39:52,131 --> 00:40:06,131
So by default. it captures the name of my campus course, and add assignments and brackets at the end

277
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:19,131
So if I x that out that now appears here at the top, and I could tell students because they won't see the ability they won't have the ability to add content to this page only the instructor does they would have to

278
00:40:19,131 --> 00:40:31,131
come into this folder and then they'll have the opportunity to create and record and upload something to this section.

279
00:40:31,131 --> 00:40:38,131
If you'd like they can also embed after they've recorded this or actually they could record it in line.

280
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:44,131
They could embed it. so let's say I making a discussion post.

281
00:40:44,131 --> 00:40:52,131
The rich text editor is available in discussions, and what an assignment is set to text entry.

282
00:40:52,131 --> 00:40:58,131
They have this rich text. Editor: underneath the plug.

283
00:40:58,131 --> 00:41:06,131
You all is Panocto

284
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:12,131
And because i'm the instructor I could select something already existing.

285
00:41:12,131 --> 00:41:20,131
But they would have the ability to upload or record and launch Panopto from right here.

286
00:41:20,131 --> 00:41:31,131
And then, once that happens, i'll just show a demo of one we already made it will embed it into the the player into the text entry.

287
00:41:31,131 --> 00:41:51,131
So maybe if they're doing intro videos or feedback on a presentation of some sort, discussion board or just using the pinato assignment folder as an option

288
00:41:51,131 --> 00:41:59,131
How's this? is outdated this is our last session in at instructors on Monday.

289
00:41:59,131 --> 00:42:11,131
We're doing a series for graduate student instructors So if you have a gsi or ta or a greater and actually anyone is welcome, we'll sort of be aiming it.

290
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:17,131
To gsi but anyone is welcome we're gonna talk about teaching with canvas teaching with zoom.

291
00:42:17,131 --> 00:42:23,131
I think we're covering panopo and some of our participation.

292
00:42:23,131 --> 00:42:32,131
Tools like pull everywhere, and perusal

293
00:42:32,131 --> 00:42:47,131
Are there any questions I can answer

294
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:51,131
Thank you i'll be sure to share this recording out we're.

295
00:42:51,131 --> 00:42:59,131
Our team is available at Sphinx instruction at you Miss Edu.

296
00:42:59,131 --> 00:43:08,131
I'll add a couple of quick notes here and that is, in addition to the computer and everything in your classroom.

297
00:43:08,131 --> 00:43:23,131
Some of the larger classrooms. have microphones So I encourage you to use those because when we think about what gets captured and how accurately it's going to pick up and that generating that

298
00:43:23,131 --> 00:43:27,131
transcript is gonna be able to understand what you're saying better the better.

299
00:43:27,131 --> 00:43:33,131
It can hear you. So using this microphone if you intend to wear a mask.

300
00:43:33,131 --> 00:43:41,131
That's gonna help your students a lot Matt has these in the classrooms, and he supplies extra batteries.

301
00:43:41,131 --> 00:43:47,131
And then many of the classrooms have a little Ted card with the phone number.

302
00:43:47,131 --> 00:43:52,517
If you run into any issues. With this I had a quick question absolutely.
