1
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:26,530
Hey. Good morning, folks. We have another typical early November 73 day in Michigan, right?

2
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,070
I actually don't believe the hype. Enjoy it while you can.

3
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,030
From what I see in the forecast, it's really going to get cold in just a couple of days.

4
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:43,850
Okay. So we're going to finish up last lectures material and then jump into today's topic around air pollution and health.

5
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:51,850
More specifically, where we left off. We had just finished having a breakout thinking up examples of opportunities for

6
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:58,540
control and community environmental settings around warnings and education.

7
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,560
You all had covered three examples of those.

8
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:09,790
I kind of introduced the concept of the urban island where we have higher temperatures due

9
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:17,230
to the higher rate of impervious surfaces in urban areas versus more suburban and rural.

10
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:26,900
And then we were just getting into some of the impacts specifically, and there are actually multiple from this urban heat island effect.

11
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:35,110
One is increase energy consumption, right? If it's hotter, people are using more air conditioning for cooling.

12
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:42,790
Uh, it results in higher amounts of air pollution, uh, from a couple of different reasons.

13
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:49,540
One is that a lot of the primary pollutants come from electricity generating electricity

14
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:56,410
generating power plants that emit pollutants just from the process of generating electricity.

15
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,750
And we're going to talk about that in a few minutes. But also,

16
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,959
the higher temperatures across an urban area can actually promote increased

17
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,620
pollutants that are sensitive to temperatures and other aspects of weather.

18
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:25,090
Extreme heat events. Right. We have these heat events happening regionally with more frequency, with broader scale changes in climate.

19
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:33,130
But then you add on to that, right, a hurt and urban heat island effect and it just exacerbates the extreme ness of that heat.

20
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,000
And then we talked about last time about impaired water quality.

21
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,410
Right. That that high pavement and rooftop surface temperature.

22
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:48,400
Think so? So thermal impairment of nearby streams and water bodies.

23
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,640
You might be aware of air quality alerts that get put out, right?

24
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:02,600
So these are broadcasts. We had an example of this last time in class where that and oftentimes is forecast in advance.

25
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:09,919
Right. It's not just, hey, air quality is bad right now where it's almost in advance of a day.

26
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,370
So tomorrow we're expecting air quality to be poor in Michigan.

27
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:22,820
They call them ozone action days in the case of the pollutant of concern being ozone and have some kind of individual

28
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:30,860
behavior actions that are suggested to help make a dent in that and to reduce the potential concentrations of it.

29
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,179
We'll talk about ozone specifically and our air pollution and health lecture.

30
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,860
That will start in just a few moments. These air quality alerts also go out for health.

31
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:47,780
So not just an alert of what you can do to change your behavior or help reduce ozone, for example,

32
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,430
more broadly in your community, but then as an individual to protect your own health.

33
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:59,570
I know the air quality indices that are put out that have associated with them, you know, some basic interpretation.

34
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,959
And then what type of advisory goes out to health.

35
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:10,010
So for example, once the air quality index gets over 100 and the index is actually taking into account multiple pollutants.

36
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,660
So in the case of ozone, particulate matter, whatever it might be,

37
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:22,970
factor in all of those concentrations together to come up with an indices of the general level of air quality.

38
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:29,120
Once that indices gets above 100, it's considered unhealthy for sensitive groups.

39
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,579
So people with heart or lung disease, perhaps older adults or children,

40
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:42,650
should try to reduce prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors on those particular days when that level is in place.

41
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,300
I just checked before class started in Ann Arbor, the air quality index.

42
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,950
Right now it's 69, which is in this moderate level.

43
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:59,000
I think we'll talk a little bit. Again, I keep alluding to this, that building up a lot of stats about this air pollution health lecture.

44
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:05,540
We'll talk about that as well. Meteorology plays a huge role in air quality.

45
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,559
And right now, one of the reasons why we're going to have this beautiful,

46
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:17,330
sunny and 73 day is because of high pressure that's been over this part of the Great Lakes for the last couple of days.

47
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:25,220
We have this flow from the south, which happens to be from a pretty large region of air pollutant emission sources.

48
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,229
And it's impacting our air quality.

49
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:34,580
We're getting the sun, we're getting the warmth, but we're also getting regional pollution being transported into the area.

50
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,170
And then there's similar to the air quality exposures and indices.

51
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,490
When we have these forecasted excessive heat events,

52
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:56,450
there is often educational material that goes out about how people actions they can take to reduce their exposure to excessive heat.

53
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,410
A couple of examples here of what typically goes out.

54
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,149
Okay. Let's go ahead and shift gears.

55
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:13,910
This is our last topic as we're kind of going down that hierarchy of control as applied to community environmental settings,

56
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,969
personal protective equipment, go ahead and do one more kind of breakout.

57
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:26,570
Turn to the person next to you and come up with some examples of personal protective equipment that might be employed.

58
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:39,170
You know, I was talking about community settings.

59
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:49,420
Sometimes you walk around some isolated factories right now and you know, there's a problem right here in a place like a computer.

60
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,420
It can be sensitive. Yeah, there is a garage.

61
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,770
Yes, I. I literally just have time for the workplace.

62
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:07,309
And I guess what the community is responding to, you're not actually, you know,

63
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:17,350
it was like I was like your a psychiatric hospital for like that stream.

64
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:28,580
Leo My God. One time I was like on the straight roof reflectors, just very black.

65
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,799
And it was midnight.

66
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:47,840
And then I will say reflective strips, you know, people are like, what am I like, oh, my gosh, not one word like downtown would look like no.

67
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,750
I was thinking like, oh, like between even like we're like one of those people.

68
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:06,910
Just like most people just like, want to go there and just have so much nonsense comments, especially at home.

69
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:19,570
It's like, Yeah, yeah, go get something, you know?

70
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,770
Yeah, it just occurred to me. Okay.

71
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:39,280
She said. I feel it is almost like that all like TV.

72
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:47,050
You thought of using it. That's one reason that I feel like, you know, like that to be.

73
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,120
Interesting. It's your idea. It's not like we're just.

74
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:00,719
Here is the thing to. Yeah. It's like you're surrounded by, like this.

75
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:11,670
Like this level of thinking.

76
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,180
I'm charging references, but I believe that it's like.

77
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:20,010
Did you really think you were charging? Oh, no, I told you.

78
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,860
I don't know.

79
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,880
A in. I think I know what I saw.

80
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:41,270
You know, these games that I just heard that you were in New Jersey when I read England's statement,

81
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:48,060
you know, I told, all right, what are some examples that came up with for personal protective equipment?

82
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,480
I like hearing. Yeah.

83
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,320
That's like sunscreen and like Rashad hat sunglasses.

84
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,480
And I'm like the opposite end of the spectrum, like scars, shrouds, clouds.

85
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,000
Excellent examples. Right. So one aimed, I think mostly UV protection.

86
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,450
Another just aimed at staying warm, right.

87
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,700
For thermal regulation? Absolutely. Great examples.

88
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,500
What else? Yeah. You sound like earplugs for a concert.

89
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,060
Sure. So, protection from noise? Absolutely.

90
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:36,030
Carrying inhalers or like EpiPens, in case you are exposed to.

91
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,600
Hmm? Nothing. I don't think that's controlling exposures.

92
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,650
That's true. That's definitely an individual behavior to help your health.

93
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,340
But I don't think it's a medication.

94
00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:01,980
I just think about, like my partner who had severe asthma and now I get air quality warnings and be like, make sure you have your home with you today.

95
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:09,510
Right. So it's part of the response right to knowledge or alert or awareness is to be to have that as a preparation.

96
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:16,630
Yeah, I see the connection. I was supposed to come up with.

97
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:27,280
Yes. We also talked about reflective gear shirts for joggers and different insect interactive repellent.

98
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:34,660
So that's repellent, mosquito netting. And we also talked about permethrin or PI reference for prevention.

99
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:44,020
Perfect. Yeah. So a lot of the insect repellents, right? Definitely as a way to mitigate some of those biological hazards.

100
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,440
And then I think the obvious one, right face masks.

101
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:57,840
But, you know, this has been something that's been part of work, work for health and safety for decades and not until more recently.

102
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:04,780
You know, I think in other regions of the world that experience some respiratory health breaks over the last decade or so.

103
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:13,750
Personal mask use has come into play in the U.S., not so much until this COVID 19 pandemic and of course, on a very large scale.

104
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,500
All right. Great job. What's coming up with those examples?

105
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,190
What did I want to talk about next? Okay.

106
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:27,819
So I want to kind of finish up the topic going back to like we talk about how

107
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,200
policies right there at the top of the list of a hierarchy of control and

108
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:42,640
especially within a community environmental settings that really our best chance at reducing exposures to have a large impact over a broad population.

109
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,660
And getting back to this concept that we talked about earlier in the semester where,

110
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,970
you know, we can have the science inform us and come up with a great solution.

111
00:12:54,340 --> 00:13:02,740
But oftentimes, you know, what gets us to that result is kind of muddied by things that that have little to do with science.

112
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:08,590
Let's see a couple of the logistical complications.

113
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:16,570
Here is an example around air pollution. It travels long distances and it doesn't observe borders.

114
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:24,160
It doesn't observe state borders within the U.S. it doesn't observe international borders between countries.

115
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:34,840
And there are many really good examples of how many pollutants actually end up in the in the polar regions as sinks and our across our globe.

116
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,330
A great example is going for a long time now around just regional impacts.

117
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:48,400
And then yeah, so we actually talked about acid rain earlier in the semester and how it made some improvement.

118
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,340
But again, it's hundreds of miles away.

119
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:59,020
But it becomes a challenge because the structure of the Clean Air Act with regards to air pollution in the US puts the onus on individual states.

120
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:07,150
Right. So there's monitoring that takes place. And if standards aren't being met, for example, if the air quality standard is exceeded in Ann Arbor,

121
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:17,830
it's EPA expects the state of Michigan to come up with a plan for how to improve the air quality if the pollution is coming from outside of Michigan.

122
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,370
Right. What is what is the state of Michigan to do?

123
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:28,150
Fortunately, this was recognized, but really not that long ago.

124
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,230
It was just just over ten years ago that the EPA actually finalized the rule of the cross, the air pollution rule,

125
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:44,320
which allowed a state impacted by poor air quality from pollution coming from outside of their state to act

126
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:52,330
to legally engage other states as part of the to the state implementation plan to improve air quality.

127
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,700
Another one is the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule.

128
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:03,850
There was that a similar timeframe. That was the first national standard to reduce.

129
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,830
It was focus on power plant emissions.

130
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:14,500
But many of these toxic metals that are emitted in travel for hundreds of miles across regions and literally across the globe.

131
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:24,610
And I want to finish this one last example, where there are policies put in place that are actually in conflict with each other.

132
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:36,730
And this can happen sometimes even with the best intentions. This was analysis done as we go around the hidden cost of U.S. agricultural exports.

133
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:45,190
So you might know that farming in the US is subsidized by the federal government,

134
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:53,980
by the Department of Agriculture, and it's due to encourage farming right to to produce food.

135
00:15:55,030 --> 00:16:05,320
And we need food here in the U.S. And there's also an opportunity to to export that food or revenue.

136
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,210
And it ends up being a more profitable enterprise.

137
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,170
Farming does to be able to scale it up. Right.

138
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:20,560
So if you're just trying to farm for a smaller population to feed it, the numbers don't work out as well.

139
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:24,520
If you can scale it up larger and then export that,

140
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:34,600
it makes it more enticing to be a farmer and to invest and produce that there are particulate matter.

141
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,310
Emitted from ammonia emissions having to do with farming.

142
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:53,030
Right. And this initial plot here, these maps are it's a little bit busy looking at cumulative export or cumulative emissions of ammonia.

143
00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:01,280
I'm focusing in on probably Iowa for the most part is where it's centered, but kind of in America's heartland,

144
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:08,549
where much of the farming takes place and kind of breaks out those ammonia emissions based on different sectors.

145
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:18,650
So related to growing corn, poultry or the wheat, cotton, etc., let's look at where this conflict comes into play.

146
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:25,760
So we have this ammonia that's being emitted from all of those different sectors related to agriculture.

147
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:32,270
We're going to talk in a minute here. Again, this air pollution and health lecture about secondary particulate formation.

148
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:42,440
But in general, what happens is when that ammonia gas mixes with what's the air gets transported and it got it can be transported hundreds of miles to

149
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:51,080
an urban area where we have things like sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides emitted as part of burning coal for electricity production,

150
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,010
driving automobiles. Right. With fossil fuels to make them go.

151
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:03,290
Those nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides react with that ammonia gas to form PM 2.5.

152
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:11,210
So we end up having higher levels of PM 2.5 in the urban areas where most of the population resides.

153
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,850
So this is not the best thing. Right.

154
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:25,520
So this is getting now looking at first at this map where we're showing where most of the ammonia emissions are kind of centered around Iowa.

155
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,630
But, you know, Nebraska, Kansas, by geography, is not the best.

156
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:36,560
And then it's basically downwind in the US. You know, most the weather patterns kind of flow from west to east.

157
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:43,100
So here's where most of the emissions are taking place, but it's a few hundred miles downwind with a maximum impact circle.

158
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:51,590
So there's increase in PM 2.5 on this map that's attributed specifically to those ammonia emissions from agriculture.

159
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,140
Right. And how much it's being increased.

160
00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:05,000
You know, the the maximum here is probably crossing or straddling the Indiana Ohio border, but impacting on oil and a bit of Michigan here.

161
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:12,410
So you have one government, federal government agency, the Department of Agriculture, with a policy.

162
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,870
Right. A very big one and a longstanding one to subsidize farming for very good reasons.

163
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:25,129
And then you have another agency, the federal agency, the U.S. EPA, imposing these air quality standards.

164
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:31,580
Right. And going through a lot of effort and implementation plans to reduce air pollution to meet these standards.

165
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:36,320
So this is here's a really good example of with best intentions on both sides,

166
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:42,350
federal government policies from different agencies that actually conflict with one another.

167
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:50,090
And then this quantifies it in terms of cost and kind of a comparison.

168
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,830
So looking at states that benefit from a revenue perspective,

169
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:02,030
from the agricultural production, right, and it looks like Iowa is kind of leading the way,

170
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:07,190
the biggest benefit in revenue, but then surrounding states and that again, it's a couple hundred miles downwind.

171
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:15,979
Now, turning it into a cost from that increase in pollution levels in terms of cost and health has been quantified.

172
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,780
And who is bearing the brunt of that? All right.

173
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:27,710
That is the end of issues around controlling exposure and maybe environmental settings.

174
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:36,640
Any questions or comments? All right.

175
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:47,650
With that will keep moving and we're not actually going to move too far off topic slightly by coincidence but it works out.

176
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,030
So for the rest of the course, which is going quickly, right.

177
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:57,390
I think we're down to like four weeks or something. It amazes me how fast the semester goes by.

178
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:05,450
We're going to start to come full circle a little bit. Right. So we've talked about at the beginning of the course kind of classifying everything.

179
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,040
Right. Biological hazards, chemical hazards, physical hazards.

180
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:14,500
What are those pathways that these contaminants can be transported through?

181
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:20,740
What are those routes of exposure that we can be exposed? How do we assess someone's exposures?

182
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:26,169
What are some of the methodologies and approaches and opportunities we just kind of concluded with?

183
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,460
What are some of the opportunities to control them? And in going through that hierarchy of controls,

184
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:39,610
we're going to come full circle and for the next few weeks talk about some kind of some I want to call them case studies,

185
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:46,210
but some of the really important topics that focus on an exposure pathway.

186
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:53,380
Right. So in this case, we're really looking at the atmosphere and to a very large extent,

187
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:01,840
a great deal of impact on adverse impact on health, on a global scale with regards to to air pollution.

188
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:14,020
So in today's lecture, we're going to want to understand what the important role that actually the meteorology I alluded to a few minutes ago,

189
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:23,440
as well as topography play in air pollution exposures and the magnitude we want to describe what those primary emission sources

190
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:32,800
are and how chemistry that takes place in the atmosphere contributes to air pollutants and especially urban air pollutants.

191
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:39,190
And then we'll finish by talking about what some of the most kind of problematic or persistent air pollutants are,

192
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:45,100
focusing again on those in urban areas, with the justification being that's where most of the people live.

193
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,459
Right, from an exposure perspective. All right.

194
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:55,600
So yeah, so I already basically said this. We we previously identified all of these critical exposure pathways.

195
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:05,200
In today's lecture, we'll be focusing very much on the atmosphere and with the primary concern being inhalation, relative exposure.

196
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,620
So if you were to ask me, you know, what are the biggest global air pollution problems?

197
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:20,959
This is the list I would I would put together. Urban smog, which is weirdly where we're going to focus today, issues around particulate matter, ozone.

198
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,510
And I'll kind of tell you why as the focus, atmospheric deposition continues to be a problem.

199
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:30,500
Toxic metals like mercury persist in organic pollutants.

200
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,310
Uh, ozone depletion in the stratosphere.

201
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:40,670
So this is very high up. It provides a protective layer to ultraviolet light exposure.

202
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:47,890
Climate change, obviously, from greenhouse gas emissions is very much an air pollution problem.

203
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:54,910
And then indoor or household, more specifically, air pollution.

204
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,440
And we do actually have a short lecture on in a couple of weeks that we'll talk about.

205
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,980
We'll also talk about aspects of climate change and health.

206
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:12,130
Today we're focusing on ppm and ozone. And the reason is when we look at global burden of disease.

207
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:20,110
Right. So this is just looking at mortality and deaths per year from specific cause.

208
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:25,270
At the very top are things like high blood pressure, smoking.

209
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,070
You don't have to go far down the list to get to ambient particulate matter.

210
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,600
Right. So this is looking at and this is just outdoor air pollution.

211
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:40,870
About 4 million premature deaths per year occurred due to pollution,

212
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:48,550
due to exposure to not just air pollution in general, but specifically the particles that exist in the air.

213
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,640
Huge number. And just to compare it, relatively speaking, you know, here's the impact from ozone.

214
00:24:55,050 --> 00:25:02,410
Still very important, but on a relative comparison or relative scale, PPM is really the biggest driver for impact on health.

215
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,990
And then as I alluded a couple of weeks, talk specifically about indoor air pollution on households.

216
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,130
And also a very large impact is very high up on the list.

217
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,350
Yes. There's no legend on that other side.

218
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:28,500
But do you know what the color baseline is? Yeah. And I think it's attributed to different disease types.

219
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:34,510
So mortality from different diseases then. And that's actually a good point because I need to figure out where that legend

220
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:37,660
is and put it on the slide because that's my transition to the next slide.

221
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:45,850
For air pollution, specifically, for particulate matter, most of the impacts,

222
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:53,800
most of the the characterized impacts are due to respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease.

223
00:25:54,310 --> 00:26:04,140
That's what's leading to these premature deaths. These are the aspects that are very well studied through after exposure and outcome analysis.

224
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:10,450
We continue to learn right beyond those very well understood impacts.

225
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:16,120
Due to respiratory and cardiovascular disease, we continue to learn every day, every month,

226
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,400
every year about new adverse impacts on health that we didn't understand before.

227
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:26,680
I just have a couple of slides here illustrating some that are in the last year or so,

228
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:31,390
a study that linked air pollution exposure to permanent vision loss.

229
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:38,260
Here's another one that this is actually from a year ago.

230
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:44,770
So it was a bit more timely last year. But it's very important to quantify and this is true.

231
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:49,930
I mean, this particular article is looking at Vietnam, but this is the case globally.

232
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:57,340
Certainly the COVID 19 pandemic has been terrible. It's had awful impacts on people and many deaths.

233
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:02,920
If you quantify that rate of deaths on an annual basis globally,

234
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:09,610
it's less than the rate of deaths from air pollution exposure here, just to put it into perspective.

235
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:16,239
So, yes, the COVID 19 pandemic is terrible, but from a comparative purpose,

236
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,690
you can say that we've been experiencing an air pollution pandemic every year for the last 50 years,

237
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:26,020
just from a numbers perspective, to put it into some context.

238
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:36,930
Uh, yeah, this one was actually looking at, uh, we talk about in this class about multiple exposures, right?

239
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:42,140
And how we set standards based on exposure to a single chemical or hazard.

240
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,870
The reality is we're exposed to all kinds of things.

241
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:53,750
And one of the things that the pandemic has taught us is that, uh, in both perspectives, people that are exposed to air pollution,

242
00:27:54,650 --> 00:28:02,300
higher levels of air pollution are more susceptible to more adverse effects after they're infected with COVID and vice versa.

243
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:09,560
People that contract COVID are then more susceptible to the adverse effects of being exposed to air pollution.

244
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:18,350
Another one. Again, just the headlines here. Air pollution linked to increased mental health, outpatient visits.

245
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:24,440
So the drivers that are well-studied and that we have well characterized are the impacts due

246
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:32,209
to respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes that we're learning more and more with each year.

247
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,410
That goes by about how vast the health impacts are.

248
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:43,080
And again, it kind of gets back to. This policy perspective.

249
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:49,059
And you know what, where we generally place most of the blame and even in this class,

250
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,410
we're talking about where the emissions are coming from, from cars.

251
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:57,309
Right. So you kind of walk away with the connotation of cars are bad or say it's coming from power plants.

252
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:04,930
Right. And we walk away with the connotation of our plants are bad or even waste incinerators or is another major source of pollutants to the air.

253
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:15,690
Waste incineration is bad. And if you take a step back and think about it, it's not really those individual entities.

254
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,979
It's us as a society, you know, we're the ones that have the demands for transportation.

255
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,250
And that's why there are, you know, all the cars on the roads.

256
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:28,300
I mean, we're the ones that have demand for electricity.

257
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,180
Right. And that's why, you know, all of this pollution is being emitted as part of generating the electricity.

258
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:44,350
Similarly, for the waste incineration. Right. We are consuming and and producing a lot of waste that needs to be managed somehow.

259
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:53,800
And so where we see that, you know, in the unfortunate part is where we see the highest levels of pollution is where we all live.

260
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,330
Right. You can point to rural areas where pollution isn't so bad.

261
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:05,200
That's great for those as as lands or for the, you know, relatively less people that live there.

262
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:12,160
But unfortunately, you know, if you just track it to population, the highest pollution levels are where we all live.

263
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,580
All right. So let's drill down a little bit on these urban air pollution issues.

264
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:23,620
We're concerned primarily with tropospheric ozone. And I want to distinguish between the two.

265
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:29,020
Right. Because I talked about stratospheric ozone depletion higher up in the stratosphere.

266
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:37,180
We want ozone to exist because it provides this protection from ultraviolet light in the troposphere,

267
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,980
which is the lowest level of the atmosphere that comes down to the surface of the earth.

268
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:44,590
Right. So this is where we live, where clay and so forth.

269
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:53,890
We don't want ozone to exist. We want it to be in very low levels because it is along irritating causes, adverse impacts on our health.

270
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:59,710
Ozone is one of these pollutants that doesn't get directly emitted from a source.

271
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,590
It doesn't come out of smokestacks, it doesn't come out of car tailpipes.

272
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:15,970
It is considered a secondary air pollution, which means that it's formed through atmospheric chemical reactions of other precursor gases.

273
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:22,030
So the nitrogen oxides that get a major automobile, the power plants,

274
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:32,980
as well as volatile organic compounds that get emitted from smaller scale operations but that exist in large quantities on an area basis.

275
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:41,950
Things like dry cleaners, printers, auto shop, anything that deals with large quantities of volatile organic compounds.

276
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:47,230
And these viruses and nitrogen oxides exist in the same air mass.

277
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:55,270
When there is sunlight, there's photochemical reaction that takes place that allows ozone to be formed.

278
00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:00,770
Particulates are primarily coming from, again, automobile emissions.

279
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,580
We talked about waste incinerators, electricity production,

280
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,220
primarily sources of combustion is what we're concerned about, but we'll talk about in a minute.

281
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:17,630
Particulates are a mix. They are a primary pollutant and that they can be directly emitted from a smokestack or a tailpipe.

282
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:24,500
There are other aspects of particles that can be formed, secondarily through chemical reactions in the atmosphere.

283
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:30,440
We'll talk about those more specifically here in a minute. Before we get into those pollutants,

284
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:37,640
let's talk about some of these important factors that can really impact the magnitude of air pollution concentrations.

285
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:45,440
One of them is meteorology. Who's ever heard of a reference or the term temperature inversion?

286
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:53,270
It's a couple of hands. And then the really hard question is who can explain it?

287
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:57,500
So this is this is a problem. Most people are many people.

288
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,640
I don't think most many people have heard of something called a temperature inversion or there's inversion in place.

289
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:12,320
What does that actually mean and why do we care about it? So without spending too much time on it, there is something that happens in the atmosphere.

290
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:21,200
When you look at temperature with height, so on this scale here, we're looking at temperatures, the red line and going up in altitude in the plot.

291
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:29,350
Uh, let's see who is flown on an airplane has been really bored and has played with the screen in front of you

292
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,179
that gives you like those local conditions and tells you like how fast the planes go and how much longer.

293
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:41,180
And so we get there, right? I like that. But it will often talk about like the wind speed and the temperature.

294
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,860
And the temperature is like some ridiculously low level, right?

295
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:51,380
You're at like 30,000 feet. It says that it's like -45 degrees Celsius or something like, oh, that's really cool.

296
00:33:52,520 --> 00:34:05,990
Maybe the more tangible evidence is any anyone who's anybody who's like a hiker or even driving right up of high elevations in mountains,

297
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,580
it gets colder, right, the further you go up the mountain.

298
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:19,100
So this is the normal atmosphere or kind of the typical atmospheric condition is the temperature is decreasing with height.

299
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,990
There is something that can happen where that gets reversed.

300
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,840
So in this this is a very simple example. In this plot, temperature is decreasing with height.

301
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:39,800
And all of a sudden we get to a certain layer where that rate stops decreasing and temperature actually starts to increase.

302
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:47,380
And this is what's described as a temperature inversion. That's what people mean when they refer to that term.

303
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,690
And in a nutshell, what is happening?

304
00:34:52,930 --> 00:35:03,620
I mean, do a lot of hand-waving here, because it literally is that when like this morning it's cold outside for full time relative.

305
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,540
It's going to get warmer. The reason it's going to get warmer is it's not here. Right.

306
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,640
The air is not getting warmer during the course of the day because the sun is warming the air.

307
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:22,740
That's not actually what happens. The the light passes through the air and reaches the earth's surface.

308
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:33,450
And it's the earth's surface that absorbs that solar energy and it gives it back off in the form of radiation in the form.

309
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,920
So the air warms from the ground up.

310
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:44,010
Right. And this is why, you know, when you go up in the airplane and the temperature goes down quickly, right,

311
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:49,410
the further away you get from the ground, which is really the source of heat to the atmosphere.

312
00:35:50,940 --> 00:36:01,620
So what happens is that during the daytime we have this heating of the earth's surface.

313
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,360
The ground is giving off that heat. Right. And it's rising.

314
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,540
You've heard the reference to warm air rises.

315
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:18,180
This is absolutely true that warm air rises and on a warm summer day, a lot of sunshine.

316
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:23,640
You have a lot of warmth being given up by the ground even after the sun goes down.

317
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:27,389
You probably had some evenings in the summer where you're outdoors and you're like,

318
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:30,190
Wow, this has been down for a couple of hours, but it's still really warm.

319
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:35,519
And that air continues to rise because the ground has absorbed so much solar

320
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:42,570
energy during the day that it continues to give up warm air and heat as it rises.

321
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:50,520
We can have occurrences where by the time we get to the end of the night, usually just prior to sunrise,

322
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:59,970
we have all of these warm air parcels that have risen, but now they're aloft and there's no more heat being given off down at the surface.

323
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:09,270
And this is where we end up with a situation like this, with the temperature inversion, we have warmer air aloft and cooler air down below.

324
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:17,790
But the impact that has on pollution is that the pollution we've heard of, we've talked about smokestacks, right?

325
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:27,060
We want to increase the height of how pollutants are emitted so that they don't expose those of us that are locally at the ground level.

326
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:32,850
That only works if we have the help of meteorology, if we have wind,

327
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:40,440
horizontal wind to affect it and take it away, but also if we have been mixing vertically in the atmosphere.

328
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:49,860
So oftentimes what happens as the day goes on is that the sun actually causes air to mix vertically.

329
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,739
If you have these warm air particles rising,

330
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:59,010
you have cool air parcels are replacing that and you have some kind of equilibrium that the atmosphere is trying to maintain.

331
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:06,180
But you're able to mix this pollution into a a large volume of air in the atmosphere.

332
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,220
And we have this inversion layer in place and those pollutants get emitted.

333
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:18,150
They will rise there. They're generally warm because of the high temperature combustion process.

334
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:26,510
Without this and temperature inversion in place, those pollution emissions can rise and rise and dilute vertically in the atmosphere.

335
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:37,220
When we have warm air parcels aloft, the whole concept of warm air rising, it will only rise as long as the air above it is cooler.

336
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,899
So once we have a case like this where this temperature inversion implies this

337
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:46,610
pollution will get emitted and hit a point where it can't rise any further.

338
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:52,670
So that in effect, there is a thermal cap that's in place.

339
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:58,130
It's really shrinking the amount of atmosphere that those pollutants can go into.

340
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:02,270
So as you can imagine, you can build up concentrations.

341
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:07,370
The pollution just keeps going, right? The power plants go all day, every day.

342
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:12,560
People drive cars so that that source of pollution is pretty much continuous.

343
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:19,850
And if you go from a large vertical mixing layer to a very shallow mixing layer,

344
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:26,450
the amount of volume that that pollution can and delude into is smaller and the result is a

345
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:31,370
higher magnitude or a higher level of pollution without any change in the emission profile.

346
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:38,040
Further. So that's one example of meteorology. Further complicating that is topography.

347
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:49,650
Uh, we have some very basic sketches of, of kind of cities or factories actually, with the.

348
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:56,870
I guess it's both. There's a people living and we have some factories emitting pollutants within a valley, right?

349
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:01,710
So there are hillsides on both sides of the city.

350
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:10,590
And where this industry resides, this is also a very common, uh, kind of residential industrial setup.

351
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,990
Y y ah. I'll actually turn this around. Why do many cities.

352
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:26,070
Why are they located in valleys? That's where a lot of the water is.

353
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:32,219
Yeah, right. So the rivers. Right, the waterways are they're just having a source of water nearby.

354
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:39,570
It really makes sense to choose to live, build infrastructure and so forth near that source of water.

355
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:43,500
From an industry perspective, there's also benefits, right?

356
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,469
If you're manufacturing something, it's a it's a means of transportation.

357
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:52,770
So the maybe the raw materials we're receiving can come down the waterway after you've manufactured them.

358
00:40:52,770 --> 00:41:01,740
They can then be sent further down on the waterway for high temperature processes that have a net source of water for cooling is also really valuable.

359
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:11,460
So yeah, so we have this setup in many places around the globe where we have a lot of people in industrial places located within a valley.

360
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:18,420
So that same concept, this is the actually combining of the examples of the temperature inversion with now adding

361
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:23,760
a layer of topography over here on the left because we have that set up during the daytime,

362
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,080
we have the sun shining, we have a lot of vertical mixing.

363
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:37,470
So those pollutants that are emitted can actually dilute into a greater volume of air, uh,

364
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:42,719
during the nighttime or perhaps early morning time where this is looking at that

365
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,740
same kind of temperature profile here we have temperature decreasing with height.

366
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:52,529
On this one, we have a decreasing, but then it bends at a certain height and starts to increase.

367
00:41:52,530 --> 00:42:00,120
So we have this temperature inversion in place. So it's providing that thermal cap rate, the pollutants can't dilute higher up into the atmosphere.

368
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:10,650
Now we also have horizontal constraints put into place by the mountains or hills on either side of that valley.

369
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:19,200
Right. So not only can the pollution not be diluted vertically, it also can't impact horizontally.

370
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:22,140
So it's basically trapping it within the valley.

371
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:30,630
And again, where a lot of the people are living again on purpose because of the proximity to perhaps the river or the waterway.

372
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,959
But again, it allows for pollutant concentrations to accumulate to much higher levels than

373
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,630
they otherwise would without this meteorological and topographical constraint.

374
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,830
Uh, here's, here's a, just a photographic image.

375
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:50,640
This is Salt Lake City, Utah.

376
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,540
You can't actually see the city, but believe me, it's there.

377
00:42:55,110 --> 00:43:01,559
This the vantage point is on one side of the valley, up at the mountain, taking a photo across the valley.

378
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:07,530
And then you see the mountains on the other side. And this is where there's an instance of a temperature inversion in place.

379
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:13,530
There's warmer air aloft. It's a large city with a lot of emission sources.

380
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:21,149
Because of that inversion that's in place, there's a vertical cap because of the mountains on either side of the city.

381
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:27,840
Within this valley, there's a horizontal constraint so that pollution has nowhere to go and it continues to build up.

382
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:35,550
And in this case, it's so thick that you can't see through the pollution layer to the city, which would be telephoto here.

383
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,910
All right, uh, this is usually a bit more convenient.

384
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,180
Usually by November 10th, it's, like, not very nice outdoors.

385
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,600
And so this is a nice image to look at. It's still an image to look at.

386
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:56,010
I want to go through a really quick exercise here, uh, who's had the privilege of being able to go to a beach.

387
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:00,689
Okay, awesome. This will help with the exercise.

388
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:07,709
I'm glad you've had that experience. So what I want you to do and feel free to close your eyes if it helps to kind of like stare at

389
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:12,960
the picture or maybe close your eyes to one of these times that you get on the beach on a nice,

390
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,190
warm day. Right.

391
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:32,220
And maybe in the summertime and just using your senses, what you see, feel or maybe smell, uh, or even observe what's there at the beach.

392
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,950
It's such a great image. I love that we are all there right now.

393
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,760
We need to figure out like a classic field trip opportunity for this class.

394
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,830
But you sense that the beach is usually a breeze. It's usually a breeze.

395
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:03,140
Okay. Can you recall which direction that breeze is usually coming from?

396
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:13,030
Off the water. Off of the water. Okay, so from the water to the land, uh, swaying these beautiful palm trees.

397
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:24,630
What else? There's a lot of people offline.

398
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:32,910
A lot of people, yeah. Because that beach is wonderful and I wouldn't question anyone's desire to be there.

399
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,690
So there might be a lot of people. What else?

400
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,410
Yeah. Like the sand during the day. The sand is usually very hot in the water.

401
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:44,190
Yes, yes. Uh, I've.

402
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:51,450
I've had occasions where it's so sunny and so warm, and I imagine it has to do with, like, that type of sand, right?

403
00:45:51,450 --> 00:46:00,390
And probably like the color of the sand. Again, going back to that, you know, how much of the sun's energy can be absorbed.

404
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:06,430
If you go a long ways to go with bare feet, it can be intolerable if the sand is that hot.

405
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,640
Yeah. So great observation. So the sand can be very hot during the daytime.

406
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:15,480
Right? Yeah. Good one. What else?

407
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,380
What about the water again?

408
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:43,410
Just basic senses, sincere observations. In comparison to this and perhaps.

409
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,540
It's usually colder or refreshing. Yeah, it's usually cooler.

410
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:57,469
And that's when my feet are burning. And I need some, really?

411
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:02,810
If I can get him into the water. That's my my saving grace.

412
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:07,010
Yes. The water is often considerably cooler.

413
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:10,520
Right. And not just the sand, but even the even the air temperature.

414
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:15,260
Right. If it's a warm day, you have this cooling effect by going into the water.

415
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:25,280
Okay. Great job. I think that sets the stage for us to talk about this component of meteorological impact.

416
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:38,390
I call the sea breeze. So, yes, we often have the water being cooler than the land, especially during the daytime when the sun is shining.

417
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:47,450
The land warms and cools much more responsibly to the sun than the water does at water temperature.

418
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:51,350
And it's it's a very large volume of water, typically.

419
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:56,420
It doesn't change hour by hour or even day by day so much.

420
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,840
It's pretty much the same temperature during the daytime. During the nighttime.

421
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,030
I've actually experience I mean,

422
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:13,250
maybe you have as well when it gets later into the evening and it's cooled considerably over the land and know that sand is cool or cold,

423
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,890
if you then go down to the water and put your feet in, now the water feels warm, right?

424
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:21,570
Because it's warmer and the air one of the same.

425
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:30,320
So what happens is that similar to when the ground gets heated and gives off,

426
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:39,650
that they get the radiated infrared radiation and in the form of heat, we have these rising parcels of air.

427
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:51,050
Right. And when we're in a coastal location like this, along a water body, a large water body, that same thing happens.

428
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:57,950
So we have these parcels of air rising and the atmosphere is always trying to liberate itself.

429
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:03,110
So it needs to replace that air. The air that just rose needs to be replaced by something.

430
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:09,560
And what is conveniently nearby is cooler air just offshore.

431
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,230
So it's actually pulling the cool air from over the water onto the shore.

432
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:23,530
And this is this is why a sea seabreeze, why when you're at the beach, there's often a breeze coming from the water to the land.

433
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:31,180
And as that cycle gets stronger, it actually turns into a circulation where you have cool air coming on the land.

434
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:35,620
It hits the now the warmer land and rises.

435
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:43,479
And then the same type of atmosphere delivering that goes on as as this cool air is coming on, the atmosphere is looking to replace it with something.

436
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,470
And here comes this warm air aloft and you basically get this circulation going.

437
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:54,070
During the daytime, there's warm air that's going out to sea and cooler air at the surface coming onto the land.

438
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:01,930
All right. So what's the what's the air pollution relevant to this scenario?

439
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:06,969
Similar to a lot of cities, urban areas, residential areas,

440
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:14,080
industries being located in river valleys, there are also many located along coastal environments.

441
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:22,150
Should have looked at this. I think it's over half of the world's population lives within like x miles of of an ocean coast.

442
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:26,950
And again, it's for a very good reason, much of it related to transportation,

443
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:32,980
being able to transport goods, maybe people from port to port and so forth.

444
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:38,530
And also those industrial processes having that large source of water for cooling

445
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:45,130
purposes is why a lot of industries are located along coastal areas as well.

446
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,990
It's 37%, 37% does close with it.

447
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:59,530
What's the statistic? It's within how much of an ocean coast just like you just go, okay, that number changes.

448
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:05,490
Like if you say within 60 miles or 60 miles, okay, maybe I'm thinking of like within a hundred miles of.

449
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:08,860
Awesome. Thank you to a lot of people for sure.

450
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,350
That would that would be billions of people.

451
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:22,989
Is that in those urban areas, if you were at the beach and you're looking out and you can't see anything, right?

452
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:26,020
Like the ocean just goes and goes and goes forever. And you feel this breeze.

453
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:31,329
You think, wow, this is like pure, clean air, right?

454
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:40,330
There's nothing for maybe a thousand miles where there could be any pollution coming into the air that I'm breathing, being exposed to.

455
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,390
Well, because of the sea breeze circulation,

456
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:50,710
all of the cars right now emitting pollutants that people are driving throughout that urban area, the power plants.

457
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:54,160
Right. The different industrial processes that are emitting the pollution,

458
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:02,620
that pollution is also being pulled out to sea by the circulation and coming back down with the sea breeze.

459
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:07,000
So even though you think this might be, you know, very clean, pure air,

460
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:16,330
if you are in an urban area or even nearby an urban area, it's often not it's often laden with relatively local pollutants.

461
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:32,200
The other component of this is that. This also provides kind of a trapping mechanism instead of just having advection of wind from east to west.

462
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:38,230
Yeah, those pollutants are being emitted in the urban area, but they can just kind of be blown away right there,

463
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:45,220
blowing downwind at somebody else's problem, that maybe they're kind of blown out of the urban area because of this circulation effect.

464
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:48,710
It basically allows it to accumulate. Right.

465
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:52,100
It doesn't actually leave that localized area.

466
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:58,959
The pollution continues to be emitted. If the kids continue to be caught in this loop and the pollution level can increase

467
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,920
and increase and increase over the course of the day within an urban area,

468
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:08,650
really impacting the magnitude of pollutant and potential pollutant exposure.

469
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:13,030
All right. Here's another image. Not of a beach.

470
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:19,810
Really? Without giving you any information, just from observations relevant to our discussion here.

471
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:26,230
What do you think is going on? And again, based on what you see in this image?

472
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:41,720
A lot of titles are out of titles, but it looks like it to me.

473
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:51,719
Yeah, that looks like a water body that in certain times of day is filled with water right at this particular time is perhaps not.

474
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:59,930
And that's the. A bottom of a bay or something without water in it at the moment.

475
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:05,720
That might tell us something about our location. Proximity to water.

476
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:20,430
What else? Yes.

477
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:26,100
So it's like there's an inversion happening that's trapping everything in the mountains or sort of the barrier.

478
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:35,330
And since we can assume if this is a tidal flat, that there's the ocean somewhere off to the left, it's just going to continue to get stuck there.

479
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:40,290
Yeah. Yeah. So you mentioned the mountains, right? That we can see in the background here.

480
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:49,020
What what is informing your conclusion that there might be an inversion, flat top of the emissions themselves?

481
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:57,559
Yeah, so there's that. I'm not sure what, you know, some sort of factory of some sort that's emitting and you see the emission going up.

482
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,280
It's going up. It's going up and it gets to a certain height and it's not going up anymore.

483
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:07,399
Right. And it just starts to spread horizontally at a pretty defined height.

484
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:16,010
Right. Not going any further up. So, yeah, that would definitely make us suspect more that there's a temperature inversion in place.

485
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:26,530
One additional component that I wanted to add, you know, by illustrating with this image is this sky blue sky, right?

486
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:37,400
Sunny day. So these are actually the kind of the worst case conditions or best case, if the goal is to form a temperature inversion,

487
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:43,310
is that when we have sunny days, that usually means that we have high pressure,

488
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:48,620
like you probably heard weather people, weather forecasters talking about areas of low pressure,

489
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:59,930
areas of high pressure, areas of high pressure means that we have subsiding air that inhibits the formation of clouds.

490
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:05,389
Clouds form by having rising air moisture that rises.

491
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:13,940
It cools as it rises and it hits a certain point that it can no longer keep that moisture in the form of a vapor, and it begins to condense.

492
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:23,150
It forms clouds. If there's enough moisture present, it actually forms precipitation of high pressure subsiding air.

493
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:27,740
So air isn't allowed to rise. We have clear skies.

494
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:32,030
We also typically have stagnant conditions. Right.

495
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:35,990
So not a whole lot of of horizontal wind destruction going on.

496
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:41,720
And so these are the typical conditions that when temperature inversions take place,

497
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:50,560
we've had sunny days the day before, perhaps the day with high pressure in place, very light or little winds.

498
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:58,130
We've had a lot of heating at the surface level during the day and then it's been continued to give off

499
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:06,750
during the night time or we end up with warmer air aloft and that it provides basically a vertical gap.

500
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:09,230
And then yes, in this image we have some mountains there,

501
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:17,600
so maybe we have some some topographical features happening as well that limit the attraction and allow it to accumulate in this little area.

502
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:23,599
QUESTION So just because you talked about it hitting the ground, which then heats there,

503
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:31,180
does the urban heat island effect also contribute to potentially creating inversions because you have all the great points?

504
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:36,440
So right when you talk about the impervious surfaces that are really good at absorbing

505
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,700
this heat or absorbing the energy and then giving it off in the form of heat.

506
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:44,740
Right. So in urban areas and again, that's our worst case scenario.

507
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:49,580
That's where all the people live. Right. And a part of our concern is magnitude of air pollution exposure.

508
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:57,190
This is not helping. I know that's not in this photo, but yeah, there's nothing on this photo right of the trick.

509
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:07,070
Any other any other questions or comments around kind of meteorological impacts on employment levels as well as topographical?

510
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:10,970
Yes. Is there a lot of seasonal variation with this as well?

511
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:18,170
There is a really good question. So in a temperate climate like Michigan, this is primarily a summertime feature.

512
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:20,690
We don't have a whole lot of topography in Michigan,

513
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:32,599
but we do have high pressure aloft that can help to form these temperature inversions after like a warm summer day as we get into the winter.

514
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,929
And, you know, lots of complicated reasons that tilt of the earth's axis.

515
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:45,710
Right, and how it's orbiting the sun. We have very short days of sunlight, so there's less opportunity for that strong gradient heating to occur.

516
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:54,860
So it's mostly a summertime occurrence regardless of where if you're if you're on the North Pole or the South Pole,

517
00:58:54,860 --> 00:59:06,800
the Northern Hemisphere summer or the Southern Hemisphere summer is fog also like a natural example of like the inversion layer.

518
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:11,450
I'm not sure yet. So it might be an indicator, right?

519
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:14,660
That, yeah. Sentinel I guess so.

520
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:22,340
Maybe there's a place where there's generally speaking that much pollution in that and that moisture.

521
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,940
At the surface, but it is an indication of usually little to no end.

522
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:32,570
It's very calm and then it's not rising very high.

523
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:38,570
Usually fog layers are at a very defined height, not too far above the surface.

524
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:46,280
I see it. And over here. Yeah, yeah. This is more of like an additional comment, but my dad's side of my family comes from Lima,

525
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:50,960
Peru, which is sort of like the perfect storm in so far as geography and pollution.

526
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:56,809
Um, it's sort of like there's mountains on one side, then there's the ocean on the other side.

527
00:59:56,810 --> 01:00:02,900
So if you look at like Peruvian air quality maps, it's usually pretty good because not a lot of it is industrialized,

528
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:10,160
although there are pockets of mining throughout the mountains. But Lima is just like abysmal because there's nowhere for any of the pollution to go.

529
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:16,190
And so like the last time I was there with my family, my little brother, like his asthma was just horrible.

530
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:25,309
And it just like the smell of the air from all of that, the engines they also very recently started phasing, let out of their gas.

531
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:33,920
So they're behind them a lot of things. But yeah, I thought that was just a good example of all of these sort of external factors.

532
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:38,239
Absolutely. Thank you so much for sharing that.

533
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:43,010
Yeah. And you know, I had the single image of Salt Lake City, Utah.

534
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:46,490
We could have picked any of like hundreds of cities across the globe.

535
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:49,820
Mima would be where you want to actually have a really nice image inside of this.

536
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,820
Larger of Santiago.

537
01:00:52,880 --> 01:01:02,810
Chile is also a South American large city with similar set up mountains on both sides of the valley, lots of pollution being emitted.

538
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:05,419
And then yeah, I like how you brought up the combination, right?

539
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:11,210
That there's there's often cities with mountains on one side, with an ocean coast on the other.

540
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:13,969
In the US, Southern California,

541
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:22,459
kind of the greater Los Angeles area is a really good example of this and it's why Southern California has some of the worst pollution over decades.

542
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:25,880
Right. In this country specifically is it's located on the ocean coast.

543
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,560
There are these sea breeze effects.

544
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:36,320
There's also large mountains, right, not too far inland to provide this kind of trapping of circulation and allowing pollutants to build up.

545
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:44,370
Pretty common. Any other questions or comments? All right.

546
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:48,700
Thank you so much for that, that engagement and working through some of those issues.

547
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:56,100
Okay. So let's get into the pollutants themselves. We understand now what some of these important components of meteorology and topography are.

548
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:03,420
We talked about tropospheric ozone and its sources and particulate matter and its sources.

549
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:09,150
So not getting too muddled down into the chemistry, but just putting it out there.

550
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,890
We have these volatile organic compounds that are emitted.

551
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:19,409
There are many of them are natural sources or sorry, many of them are anthropogenic sources.

552
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:26,729
But we do have some natural sources that play an important role. Trees, for example, give off volatile organic compounds.

553
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:31,860
And there are regions of the country, regions of the world where trees,

554
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:36,780
tree emissions mixing with these nitrogen oxides in the presence of sunlight

555
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:41,520
are forming ozone in addition to the more traditionally anthropogenic cause,

556
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:49,919
when we get this mix of doses and ozone and high amounts of ultraviolet light,

557
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:59,160
so this is considered a photo chemical reaction so that the reaction that take place in the atmosphere is actually triggered by the ultraviolet light.

558
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:04,200
It specifically at wavelengths less than 420 nanometers.

559
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:18,390
What we end up doing is the nitrogen oxide with the sunlight, with those volatile organic species end up converting the oxygen component to ozone.

560
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:26,430
And and this is what allows it to build up. It generally gets worse as the day goes on.

561
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:32,850
Right. There's no sunlight. The sun rises. Now we have the potential for that photochemical reaction to take place.

562
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:36,899
And it allows the ozone to build up and build up and build up over the course of the day.

563
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:42,959
So it's usually later into the afternoon and evening and the highest ozone concentrations exist.

564
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:49,980
Interestingly, once the sun goes down, it kind of shuts off the mechanism for that reaction to take place.

565
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:59,580
Ozone is no longer produced. It's actually pretty reactive so that it is removed from the atmosphere at a pretty high rate.

566
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:10,149
As you go through the night, the ozone levels go down. In terms of how are we doing?

567
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:18,260
And again, focusing on the U.S. in terms of ozone, air quality over the last few decades, there have been reductions.

568
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:24,850
So this is looking at the national standard as plotted here with the dashed line.

569
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:28,570
Here is the average ozone concentration.

570
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:37,030
The white line that we're following over time from 1980, going forward, about 30 or 40 years, and it's slowly coming down.

571
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:41,260
On average over the last 40 years, it's decreased by about 35%.

572
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:49,750
So that's good. It's decreasing. Right. But it's not very impressive if we know that ozone is a problematic polluter.

573
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:53,500
For 40 years, we haven't been able to reduce it by more than 35%.

574
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:59,980
Part of the reason is because of its characterization as a secondary problem.

575
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:08,500
It's not as simple as saying, okay, let's let's prevent it from being emitted from a tailpipe or a smokestack.

576
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:11,440
It's not emitted from those sources in the first place. Right.

577
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:18,400
It's formed as part of the chemical reactions from the emissions of many other precursor gases.

578
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:28,780
And because there are so many sources of them, it has continued to be a challenge from a policy perspective to dramatically reduce ozone levels.

579
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:37,300
This is looking at attainment or more specifically, non attainment areas that are depicted.

580
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:41,920
So these are areas that are not meeting the standard for ozone, right?

581
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:48,910
Meaning the levels of ozone are higher than what is allowable by the air quality standards.

582
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,180
And you can kind of go through a get my drag free is not great.

583
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:58,690
We talked about Southern California and this has been a problem again for many decades that that video that

584
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:04,750
we watched a lot thoroughly back kind of highlighted the history of pollution in southern California.

585
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:11,500
That's also a valley, the orange. Yeah, absolutely. So we have the topographical considerations, which are a huge,

586
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:19,800
huge player in the rest of the country, for the most part are our maps of of urban areas, right?

587
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,190
Where you see the volume,

588
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:31,510
you can kind of follow this megalopolis that goes from basically D.C. up to Boston along in the northeast kind of urban corridor.

589
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:37,150
And then otherwise, it's kind of urban areas. You know, here's the Detroit area, the Cleveland area.

590
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:47,200
Cincinnati. See, my geography is not that bad. Chicago, Saint Louis, Houston has poor air quality.

591
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:51,730
Sorry, that's wrong. Houston and Dallas.

592
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,840
And we can go on and on. But it's primarily, again, these urban areas, right?

593
01:06:56,140 --> 01:07:07,360
It's the combination of where those precursor gases are being emitted that are resulting in pollution in a relatively localized area.

594
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:18,140
So any questions about ozone before we shift up here? Is the the precursors of ozone.

595
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:26,010
Are they the are also regulated as like you were saying you can't regulate it because it's a secondary.

596
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:33,590
But are they the ones that are in that the any engines that work like that.

597
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:37,030
One of nitrogen oxides. Ah yeah. Yes.

598
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:40,470
Um and, and it's for good reason.

599
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:50,270
It's for a couple of reasons actually. One is that nitrogen oxides, uh, just from your perspective on a local scale and the impact of.

600
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:56,190
The other is that they also contribute to the formation.

601
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:08,630
So the challenge then is, you know, from a regulatory perspective, EPA says this is what's allowable into the air quality standards.

602
01:08:09,770 --> 01:08:14,360
If the states exceeded exceeding the ozone standard or location within the state,

603
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:19,070
it's up on the burden falls on the state to come up with an implementation plan.

604
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:23,330
What are we going to do to reduce ozone levels?

605
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:28,680
And for ozone, because there are so many different sources of these precursor gases.

606
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:38,520
There's a lot of considerations and they're often not just pointed at a single large emitters.

607
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:43,630
When we talk about cars being one of the major sources right now, that's a huge challenge.

608
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:54,570
There's, you know, millions of cars in Michigan, for example, and then some of those smaller scale things like dry cleaners and auto shops.

609
01:08:54,570 --> 01:09:01,080
Right. These are these are challenging things to try to to try to regulate or have a lot of contact on.

610
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:08,070
The question, any others? Rebecca So what's COVID?

611
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:12,540
You have been advertising ozone generating air purifiers.

612
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:19,350
Is that like a concern for outdoor air pollution or is that more like indoor air pollution?

613
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,370
Yeah, great. Great question. And then remind me promise me on it.

614
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:27,300
If you if you remember in a couple of weeks, we talk about indoor air quality specifically.

615
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:35,520
But yeah, because ozone is so reactive and so relatively short lived, it's not so much of a concern for outdoor environments,

616
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:41,309
but since its primary uses is in an indoor environment and we have and we talk

617
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:47,100
about the volume of air that a pollutant can be diluted into once we come indoors.

618
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:53,130
Right. We're in this classroom. We've got a serious vertical cap going on here and serious horizontal constraints.

619
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:57,030
There's not much air for that for that pollutant.

620
01:09:57,150 --> 01:10:03,480
It's being manageable really to be deluded into. So, yes, it would be a concern from an indoor air quality instructor.

621
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:08,660
Your question? Any others.

622
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:17,950
All right. Let's go ahead and shift gears to particulate matter. So I kind of alluded to this.

623
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:26,360
We have it. It's characterized as being a primary pollutant, meaning that it is directly emitted from things like tailpipes,

624
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:35,240
but it's also a secondary pollutant that can be formed in the atmosphere from other precursor emissions.

625
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:41,780
A really big one here, as an example, is sulfur dioxide gas.

626
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:50,750
It's emitted from coal fired power plants that can form downwind sulfate particulates or sulfate aerosols.

627
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:58,249
This is a kind of an image of a power plant that burns coal to generate electricity that

628
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:04,400
cool as it's mined out of the earth and geologically is naturally enriched in sulfur.

629
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:16,010
So when that coal is burned, that solid sulfur right that's in the coal is liberated at a high temperature into a gas in the form of sulfur dioxide.

630
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:20,780
It's able to, you know, go with these emissions. It's a gas.

631
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:24,860
It can be it's buoyant in the air.

632
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:33,620
It can be transported hundreds of miles and it can undergo these chemical reactions that allow sulfates to be formed.

633
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:41,200
This is a couple of examples here about how we can have secondary particulate matter formed in the atmosphere.

634
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:51,650
We're concerned both about sulfates emitted from sulfur dioxide, as well as particulate nitrates that are emitted from nitrogen oxide gaseous species.

635
01:11:52,520 --> 01:12:00,830
So we have that example, right, of the ammonia emissions from agriculture reacting with nitrogen oxides that are ammonium nitrate particles.

636
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:10,940
Another one is that CO2 gas that's emitted in the presence of water vapor, or we can form sulfuric acid sulfate particles.

637
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:20,749
There are also many secondary organic particles, so anything in the atmosphere that exists as a semi volatile compound at a warm temperature,

638
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:27,510
it might exist any kind of gas, but in a cold ambient temperature it can condense and form a solid.

639
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:32,700
So this is another source of secondary particulate.

640
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:45,590
And then this is, I think, the Segway to the next slide is that many particles are actually internal mixtures that might contain a primary

641
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:54,620
particulate on the inside and then have had secondary particles form on top of them as they transport downwind.

642
01:12:54,860 --> 01:13:02,650
So here's the next slide. So we might have a core particle that was that was directly emitted, right?

643
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:05,570
And they can be natural, like sea salt or mineral dust.

644
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:16,669
But then around that core have a coating that's been formed as part of an atmosphere reaction or secondary particulate matter like that,

645
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:23,240
ammonium nitrate or some of that, some volatile organics that has condensed onto it.

646
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:28,910
We can also form a particle aggregates where you actually have two individual particles.

647
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:36,440
And just because they're allowed to collide, kind of stick and form their own single particle.

648
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:43,450
How do we know this stuff? You can actually look at them using a scanning electron microscope.

649
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:46,880
You can collect particles in the air onto a filter.

650
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:53,600
You know, use this technology and and tunnel down literally and see, you know,

651
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:59,420
a large core particle with smaller particles that have kind of a tent or aggregated.

652
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,209
You can combine that with chemical analysis, right.

653
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:09,500
And identify what the chemical component of these individual particles are on those samples as well.

654
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:16,450
And then with PM 2.5, it looks very similar to ozone.

655
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:26,360
If we look at kind of the trends over time, we have made headway in terms of decreasing about a 43% decrease.

656
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:30,620
Oh, there's a typo in the national average over the last 20 years.

657
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:34,730
The ozone time period, if you recall that, look back 40 years.

658
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:43,280
The reason that PM 2.5 only goes about 20 years is because the standard, the air quality standard wasn't enacted until 1997.

659
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:48,290
And then the first assessment took place after three years of data was collected in 2000.

660
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:52,130
So we do have a nice trend. It's going down.

661
01:14:53,330 --> 01:15:06,170
The unfortunate news is that with all of the studies that have been done, many of them don't show a threshold effect for exposure to 2.5.

662
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:13,200
There are a lot of studies that show adverse impacts on health when people are exposed to pollutants.

663
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:20,870
PM 2.5 Specifically even at levels that are already within the standard threat level at the lowest level.

664
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:27,249
So this is unfortunate and it's the reason why that the EPA continues to reevaluate.

665
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:30,660
And what should that standard be? Should it be lower?

666
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:42,389
Looking at the current standard that's in place and it hasn't been updated since 2012 for anyone

667
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:47,760
who went to that that Emily event just a couple of weeks ago where Cory Ziegler was in town,

668
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:58,350
talked about how EPA is currently in the midst of coming up with the final ruling on whether that PM 2.5 standard will be reduced or not.

669
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:09,630
Currently, you know, most of the country is in attainment aside again from large portions of California because of those

670
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:19,890
inherent topographical conditions and whether that kind of up to result in high polluting concentrations.

671
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:31,060
So as we kind of finish up here in talking about PM getting back to the regulatory perspective,

672
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,680
right, kind of going forward and what are some of the challenges?

673
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:42,200
Going back to the 1970s where we said, hey, it's any particles that are in the air is what we should be worried about.

674
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:49,610
So the first standards were focused on mass of particles, so just the amount by weight.

675
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:54,799
So we collect, we take a filter, we wait in the laboratory, we take it out into the field.

676
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,220
You pull air through it, particles accumulate on the filter,

677
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:04,160
come back to the lab and wave the filter again and we subtract the pre weight from the post weight.

678
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:07,460
And that tells us how much of the mass of particles have been collected.

679
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:15,470
We divide it by the known volume of air that came through the sample and we get a concentration right in mass per volume of air.

680
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:24,589
So this was the original standard was total suspended particulate, whatever it was in the air through those exposure and health studies,

681
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:31,730
we learned that it was really only particles of ten microns or less in size that are respirable,

682
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,970
that can actually get into our airways and impact our health.

683
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:40,640
For that reason, the standard was changed from TSP to ten.

684
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:45,680
And then, like I just mentioned a moment ago, in 1997,

685
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:52,909
there was an additional standard added again because the exposure and health literature base told us that

686
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:57,770
there are independent effects from particles that are less than two and a half microns in diameter.

687
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:08,050
So now we have a PM10 standard as well as a PM 2.5 standard, but they all continue to be based on particle max, right?

688
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:14,780
Just again, that pre-filter filter you weigh them is the mass of particles present.

689
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:21,290
So some some relevant questions. How important is the chemical composition of those particles?

690
01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:23,780
Right. They're made up of chemicals.

691
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:33,590
And they're not all the same as you over space and over time, the chemical composition of the particles can be greatly varied.

692
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:39,860
What's more important is the bulk composition.

693
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:47,870
So let's say we take those particles, we do a chemical analysis of them, and we say it's 27% as 15%, 10%.

694
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,930
Okay, we know the chemical composition,

695
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:58,040
but should we be concerned about just that bulk composition or we should be more concerned about the surface composition?

696
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:08,659
Right. If you imagine particles coming into our lungs and coming into contact with our our airways to whatever is on the surface.

697
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:12,860
Right. Is what's coming into contact, perhaps not what's in the middle of that particle?

698
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:21,970
What about particle number? So if we have particle mass, I'm going to try to draw an instance and I never do that.

699
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:32,000
But we have particle mass in one large particle in a ways, one milligram.

700
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:39,260
We now have this quickly. Many articles.

701
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:45,950
That are actually equivalent in math to this one single particle.

702
01:19:47,170 --> 01:19:52,360
Which one would we be more concerned about? The same as the standards are based on that.

703
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:59,710
Are we more concerned about this single particle over here or these many particles over here that have equivalent mass?

704
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:15,210
Any guesses? I feel like it would have to depend on what the individual components are like chemically.

705
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:22,950
So assuming the chemical composition is the same, how do they break apart once they're in there?

706
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:27,060
Then they could potentially circumvent certain standards to go through.

707
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:31,490
I don't know. I shouldn't be answering. No, but that's fine.

708
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:36,120
Guesses are totally allowed. Yeah. So I think the multiple would be more of a concern.

709
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:43,560
Why? Just because they're more likely to get into your bloodstream and into your respiratory system.

710
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:49,230
Sure. So they're they're smaller, right. So perhaps they can penetrate further down into our respiratory system.

711
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:52,260
They also have if we're worried about surface area,

712
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:59,160
the surface area of all of these small particles is much greater than just that single, large particle.

713
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:03,270
Yeah. Let's go ahead and finish there. I know we're at time.

714
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:10,440
There's a few more slides left. On Tuesday, there's no lecture, but we'll start the class period by just finishing up a lot of slides here.

715
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:13,650
I think we have an exercise that we're going to do together.

716
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:20,970
Just to clarify, there's no preparation required. I will approach that exercise before class, but you don't have to react to it.

717
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:25,139
Um, and we'll also going to have whatever time we have left at the end, the class period.

718
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:34,400
Will you have some debate group meetings so you guys can continue working on it so much?

719
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:49,350
I'm very happy you can join our day. She's giving it to you.

720
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:51,720
That's my life. Oh.
