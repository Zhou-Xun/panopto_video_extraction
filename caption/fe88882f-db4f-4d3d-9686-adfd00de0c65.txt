1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,212
today. We're gonna continue our discussion about

2
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:13,040
reflective listening.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,042
And in particular, we're gonna start to describe how you can

4
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:20,340
use reflective listening to handle client emotion.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,840
Let's start by looking at this clip, I'll see you on the other side.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,709
>> I think you're getting bangs.

7
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:30,411
>> You totally should.

8
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:32,021
You would be so cute with bangs.

9
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:32,951
You have the face for it.

10
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:36,460
I don't There's my better half.

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,340
Can, would you mind?

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,240
Thank you.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,967
Hey honey, where are you?

14
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:43,071
>> I'm on my way to Downey.

15
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:46,160
Did you know Karen and Richard Carpenter grew up in Downey.

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,130
>> A random and not helpful fact Phil I'm sorry, I'm having kind of a rough day.

17
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,014
>> Yeah, I'm kind of having a rough day myself.

18
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:58,890
>> [LAUGH] Look Phil I need you to take care of dinner for me.

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,439
>> What's wrong Alex, ripped Haley's favorite sweater and now I'm driving

20
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,340
around from store to store trying to find the exact same one before Haley finds out.

21
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,330
>> Don't do that.

22
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,080
Just explain to her what happened.

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,550
>> He always not gonna understand.

24
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,600
>> Sure she will know >> Phil you don't understand.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,157
I'm trying to avoid this turning into a whole big thing

26
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:17,691
>> and just get her something close.

27
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:20,140
You'll never know the difference, >> Phil Could you just take care of

28
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,901
dinner, sweetie.

29
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:21,730
That's all I'm asking.

30
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,126
That's it. >> I'm just saying there's a simpler way

31
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:24,711
to do this.

32
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:25,890
>> There is no simpler way.

33
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,700
>> Just make dinner.

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,840
Thank you.

35
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,340
>> Hello.

36
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,140
Yeah.

37
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,840
What?

38
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,731
Okay, I'm confused.

39
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:39,130
You're saying that if she tells me she has a problem, I'm not supposed to help her.

40
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,430
>> Not unless she asked for your help >> But if she lets me help her,

41
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,130
I can make the problem go away.

42
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,280
>> That is such a male thing to say.

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,940
>> Well forgive me for being a man mango or kiwi kiwi.

44
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,101
>> When you say do this or do that,

45
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:59,021
all she's hearing is I'm smarter than you believe me.

46
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:03,130
>> She doesn't think that she doesn't want you to solve her problems.

47
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,870
She just wants you to give her support so that she can solve her problems herself.

48
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,431
>> Yes.

49
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:11,270
And sometimes sometimes she just wants a sympathetic ear.

50
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,640
>> Whoa, whoa.

51
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,470
Maybe it's all the creams, but that just made sense girlfriends.

52
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,233
So if Claire says I hate getting stuck in traffic,

53
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:27,080
I shouldn't say maybe you should leave earlier or don't get on the freeway.

54
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,470
I should just say, I know it's so frustrating.

55
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,250
Really?

56
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,671
And if she says the waiter I had today was so rude.

57
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:41,470
I shouldn't say maybe you should just order something on the menu for once.

58
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:49,140
I should just say what a jerk [NOISE] she says fill the tv is driving me crazy.

59
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,990
I should just say, I know there is not enough quality programming for women.

60
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,140
>> No turn off the damn tv.

61
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,145
>> Okay, now I'm confused to go, >> well it's ink,

62
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:03,410
>> she's in the house.

63
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,427
What are you doing with my sweater?

64
00:03:05,427 --> 00:03:06,700
>> My God, it's ruined.

65
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,980
It was an accident.

66
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,080
>> You know what happened?

67
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,181
Hey?

68
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:11,800
>> Hey, let's try to get along.

69
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,540
I wish he was never even born.

70
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,180
>> They were trying to make one with a brain.

71
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:22,315
>> No honey, you guys are both pretty smart.

72
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:27,140
>> So sweater.

73
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,658
>> Yeah it is that sweater and

74
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:31,940
I did everything I can to stop them from fighting.

75
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,470
>> I don't understand why they can't see how much you love them.

76
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,320
>> I don't know.

77
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,151
Meanwhile Cheryl has been calling me all day because she's angry.

78
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:40,950
I didn't show up.

79
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,460
>> Doesn't Cheryl have a housekeeper and a nanny.

80
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,740
Why does she need so much help?

81
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,240
>> I know right, you worked so hard.

82
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,940
You do so much.

83
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,840
>> I do.

84
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,100
>> Course you do.

85
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,040
>> I do.

86
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,852
I do.

87
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:00,711
Sweetie.

88
00:04:00,711 --> 00:04:01,280
Thank you.

89
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,340
Really appreciate that.

90
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,990
>> Well what you see is that Phil I think gradually grasped the concept that

91
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:15,717
giving advice before the person has had a chance to express their fears or

92
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:20,339
their emotions just doesn't work jumping to fixing too soon.

93
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,640
Instead he came to realize that he has to reflect his wife's feelings.

94
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,540
Then they can maybe have a discussion about what to do next.

95
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,740
Now handling emotion can be tricky.

96
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,940
Let's look at these two examples.

97
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,140
In the first case the client starts with, I'm a bit upset with my husband.

98
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,930
If you reflect, it sounds like you hate your husband.

99
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,740
We consider this an overshoot.

100
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,540
Yes, it's fine to use powerful emotional words to reflect back to the client.

101
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,388
But this word is this too strong and

102
00:04:54,388 --> 00:04:58,560
because the person may not be willing to accept that they hate their husband.

103
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,821
It might knock them out of their chair and make them defensive and they might run for

104
00:05:02,821 --> 00:05:04,040
the hills.

105
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,884
So it's fine to increase the intensity of the person's emotion, but

106
00:05:07,884 --> 00:05:09,490
not by such a large degree.

107
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,140
Going from a bit upset to hate.

108
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,920
A nice strategy here might have been Sounds like you're more than a bit upset

109
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,940
that some more safeway 2" them towards their ultimate intensity.

110
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,540
On the bottom we see the opposite problem.

111
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,581
I am furious with my boss here.

112
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:31,540
You respond well you're a little upset with your boss.

113
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,440
That's a different problem.

114
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,940
We call that minimization.

115
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,840
This one actually can shut a person down.

116
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,740
Buy you communicating with this week word like a little upset.

117
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,570
The meta messages, either I don't wanna hear it.

118
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,950
You shouldn't be so upset or I'm not a very good listener.

119
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,857
So it's important on the bottom case if someone comes at you with intense emotion,

120
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:57,640
reflect with equal intensity.

121
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,260
Just to remind you as we talked about in our last session on the left

122
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,882
are the introductory clauses you can use to start a reflection and

123
00:06:06,882 --> 00:06:09,090
on the right is the short form.

124
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:15,740
So we're going to see a little bit of both in our discussion today.

125
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,718
Although there are thousands of emotional words you can use in your in my

126
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:23,962
conversations here's nine that we have found our golden, particularly in

127
00:06:23,962 --> 00:06:28,370
the early phase when a patient still may be ambivalent or resistant to change.

128
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:34,640
We'll take a look at these nine words.

129
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,040
Now we do have a pronoun hierarchy.

130
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,498
Generally we recommend that you start your reflections with you,

131
00:06:42,498 --> 00:06:48,340
you're feeling this, you did this, you want this, you're scared of this.

132
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,516
However, there's a time and place for it's I and we but by and

133
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:56,640
large we recommend that you reflect with you.

134
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,320
Sometimes it can be, it's interesting to hear that that can be a powerful

135
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,469
reflection at times and I and we are the third in line because it can

136
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:10,104
sometimes change the focus from the client to you, the counselor.

137
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:12,840
I completely understand that.

138
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,458
Although that's not generally a harmful reflection, it's not really adding much

139
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,331
useful information and it opens you up to argument.

140
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:23,698
So when you say to a patient, I completely understand that they may say no,

141
00:07:23,698 --> 00:07:26,980
you don't, you're rich, you're beautiful, you're privileged.

142
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,740
You don't understand what it's like.

143
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,480
So injecting I just often creates more problems than it solves.

144
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,540
Same with we.

145
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:40,390
So today we've talked a little bit about how to reflect emotion matching intensity.

146
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,713
Neither overshoot or undershoot or minimize and

147
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:50,937
try to use colorful metaphoric language to capture someone's emotional state
