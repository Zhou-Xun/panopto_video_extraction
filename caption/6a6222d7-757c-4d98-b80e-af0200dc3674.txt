1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:13,160
I've already gone there. But what about?

2
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:37,710
Okay. We're going to go ahead and get started. We're doing another in-class activity today focused on case control studies.

3
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,830
So I'll give you guys about 15 or 20 minutes to go through it and then we'll go through the answers together.

4
00:00:51,360 --> 00:01:04,250
Otherwise. Oh.

5
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:53,170
Like. They looked for somebody else didn't do that.

6
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:01,780
Yeah, I think that was great.

7
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:09,790
That people should be.

8
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,250
Is Mother.

9
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:09,080
Oh, he is. I mean, this is.

10
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,810
Good practice for this scenario. Probably scary for you to turn.

11
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:42,930
Do you know? So you're going to get 70 minutes for the exam?

12
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:51,240
Yeah. Do you think I was plenty of time? Yeah. Most people last year finished and left before the 70 minutes were out, so.

13
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:22,510
It's nice. So.

14
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:41,870
It's. Yeah.

15
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:13,510
I was. So I thought.

16
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,910
Yes. You know.

17
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:30,330
Thank you. So. We?

18
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:52,880
Three. I can do.

19
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:14,320
Yes. Right. If you know.

20
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:22,610
How did you like? Oh, it's no surprise.

21
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:39,500
Really? Yeah. And does it work this year?

22
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,160
Yeah. Do you like it? I like.

23
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,520
Yeah. Yeah. So who's got a.

24
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:05,850
We speak. All over the country.

25
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:13,770
This is what I do.

26
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:39,560
So the. I mean.

27
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:54,010
After you. Yes, we should.

28
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:17,610
So. For.

29
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:41,800
Your. Usually.

30
00:11:14,770 --> 00:12:24,710
Speaking of kids. Okay.

31
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,170
Well, yeah, but when you. You're just.

32
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:53,090
Last Thursday, I was at the 500.

33
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:02,280
Oh, yeah.

34
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:17,110
Yeah. You don't want to drive up three kilometers.

35
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:34,080
Do. You know, you just.

36
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,770
It's no worse than you might think.

37
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,880
I know where this.

38
00:13:54,530 --> 00:14:08,670
Everybody. Do you know what it was?

39
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:44,520
How can. Each case is separate.

40
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:13,210
It was such an excellent. This is actually.

41
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:33,990
The number 80. So.

42
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:52,500
You know. I didn't.

43
00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:05,270
You know. At this point.

44
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:30,590
I do. It was a bit. If he knows all.

45
00:16:41,540 --> 00:17:03,650
It's not so. Married.

46
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:54,610
You did. Like the format. Yeah.

47
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:05,830
And I. You said it.

48
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:14,220
No. No. They went.

49
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,250
I know, but. Do?

50
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,360
Does everyone need more time or are you ready to start going over it?

51
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:41,600
A little more time. We're.

52
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:58,470
It. Can you quantify?

53
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:57,960
Give me. Yeah.

54
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:15,120
We do it. Emergency.

55
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:17,160
Really it makes. Right.

56
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:29,430
I'm like every. I'm going to.

57
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,070
He's. I'm really confused.

58
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:48,810
Joining me now.

59
00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:00,680
Oh, no. Yeah.

60
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:13,520
I had to excuse. I.

61
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:28,210
This is. You're not.

62
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:41,350
This is something that one part of the.

63
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,690
You to keep.

64
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:09,130
I think in the interest of time, we're going to start going over the questions.

65
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,530
So for this activity,

66
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:20,290
we wanted to determine whether each scenario used a primary or secondary study based whether the cases or incident are prevalent,

67
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,280
and then act to identify the type of control sampling strategy they used.

68
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,340
So for the first scenario, it says that among participants in the Physician's Health study,

69
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,520
which is a randomized trial of aspirin in cardiovascular health,

70
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:39,790
investigators selected 704 participants who experienced an acute cardiovascular event which

71
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:45,339
were your cases and one controlled for each case among participants who were not experienced.

72
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,180
A cardiovascular event at the time of follow up the case did.

73
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:56,320
So it says the exposure of interest was a mutation in a gene coding for a coagulation factor of five,

74
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,730
which investigators assessed in stored blood samples collected at the time of recruitment.

75
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,890
So does anyone want to say if our study base was primary or secondary?

76
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:18,170
Yeah. Yeah.

77
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,950
So it says it was it is a primary study based.

78
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,730
It says it was conducted in a randomized trial.

79
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:33,830
So if you remember back to lecture earlier today, the definition of a randomized trial is you have a close cohort where you assign exposures.

80
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:39,560
The investigators do. So, you know, if you're in a randomized trial, you have to have a close cohort.

81
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:46,460
And for when you have a primary study based, you have an existing cohort versus secondary, you're cohort isn't characterized.

82
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,850
So since you do in this case, it's going to be a primary study based.

83
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,540
So then our case is going to be incident or prevalent.

84
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,690
Yep. So most of the time when you have a primary study base,

85
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:08,580
you're looking at incidental cases versus a secondary study base, you're looking at prevalent cases.

86
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:16,740
In this case, the investigators of the cohort followed participants and documented documented the development of each case.

87
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,879
So you looked at did they develop the outcome during that time period?

88
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,660
So they're going to be incident cases. So then what type of control sampling did they utilize?

89
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,160
I heard density. Yeah. So it's going to be density or risk sampling.

90
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:45,900
So it says in the scenario that the controls for each case were taken at the time of follow up of the case.

91
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,890
So you're looking at that time the case became a case.

92
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,430
You're looking at that risk set there. So it's going to be the density sampling.

93
00:25:54,030 --> 00:26:00,419
The controls were selected for each case among the trial participants who had not experienced the outcome at the time.

94
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:05,910
The case experienced that cardiovascular event. So it's going to be density sampling.

95
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:13,339
Any questions on that one? Okay.

96
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:21,440
So first scenario B, it says investigators in Philadelphia enrolled 677 cases who had been shot in an assault and

97
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,690
684 controls to examine the association between carrying a gun and being shot in an assault.

98
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:33,130
Population based control participants were sampled from all of Philadelphia via random digit dialing.

99
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:39,710
Each case was matched to a control line. Being in Philadelphia on the date and time of each shooting age group sex and Race.

100
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,860
So is our study based primary or secondary? Yeah.

101
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:56,139
So it's going to be secondary. The source of controls was the person time being contributed by all inhabitants of the city of Philadelphia.

102
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,890
So that's more of an open call. It's not a closed cohort, so it's going to be secondary.

103
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,230
So then do we have prevalent or incidental cases based on that?

104
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:32,200
Yes. Those are going to be prevalent cases. The cases arose since you're looking at an open cohort and a secondary study based,

105
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:38,709
you're not really following the development of that outcome because it is an open cohort.

106
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:45,610
So there are going to be prevalent cases. So then what type of control sample or sampling do they do?

107
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,410
What was that? I think you had the right answer.

108
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,060
So this one's a little tricky. It's actually going to be density sampling.

109
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:15,410
So usually when you have density sampling, you're looking at primary study bases.

110
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:24,780
There are instances where you can do density sampling in secondary study bases, and this example is actually a good example of that.

111
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:31,860
So for density sampling, because the controls were a match to each case on the date and time of that event,

112
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,660
the matching on time indicates the controls were at risk for the outcome.

113
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:41,850
At that time, the case became a case. So that indicates that it's density sampling.

114
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:49,110
And so this is that example where you kind of have a secondary study base with density sampling and the controls.

115
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:05,059
So now the next scenario says 40 patients with a diagnosis of acute a flu,

116
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:11,600
a toxic dosis into hospitals in eastern Kenya were selected as cases in a case control study to

117
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,510
identify environmental correlates of an outbreak that occurred between January and June 2004.

118
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,650
For each case,

119
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:26,300
two controls from the same village were randomly selected among people who had not been diagnosed with the disease after the end of the outbreak.

120
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:47,760
So do we have a primary or secondary study base? You have a 5050 chance.

121
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:08,349
So in this case, it's actually going to be secondary. So you're looking at cases.

122
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:17,140
They're selected in hospitals. But it's not certain that the people are from the same village as the cases are rose.

123
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,620
But for sure end up at the same hospital the case did.

124
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,380
Had they gotten sick?

125
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:33,610
So since you have to kind of make assumptions about where the people are at the hospital are coming from, it's going to be a secondary study based.

126
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:41,470
So then based on it being a secondary study base, do we have prevalent or incidental cases?

127
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:49,710
Yeah. So it's going to be prevalent on the cases were selected from patients already hospitalized with the case illness.

128
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,870
So they weren't being followed in any cohort for that outcome.

129
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:59,140
So they're going to be prevalent cases. So then what type of control sampling strategy did they utilize?

130
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:09,340
Yep. So it's going to be cumulative. The controls were selected among those who did not receive a diagnosis at the end of the outbreak.

131
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:13,400
So that's what makes it a cumulative sample.

132
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:21,910
You're selecting your controls at the end of that follow up period or the end of the time period.

133
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:41,430
So then first scenario. It says, in a study of early pregnancy, weight gain and risk of pre-eclampsia,

134
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:51,870
investigators retrieved individual pregnancy records of 339 pre-eclampsia cases and 1254 randomly selected pregnancies to serve

135
00:31:51,870 --> 00:32:00,960
as controls from a database with 80,812 singleton deliveries occurring between 1998 and 2011 at a Pennsylvania hospital.

136
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:09,200
So is it a primary or secondary study base? I heard primary.

137
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:15,170
Yeah. So it is going to be primary. The study was conducted using an existing database.

138
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:21,500
So they're looking at the database of deliveries from a hospital during that 13 year period.

139
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,580
So it could be considered a close cohort study. So it'll be primary.

140
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:32,090
So then based on that, do we have primary incident cases?

141
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,570
Yeah. So they're going to be incident.

142
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:45,650
The new pre-eclampsia cases are usually diagnosed during the second half of pregnancy and they arose during that follow up period.

143
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:51,830
So they're going to be incident cases. And then what type of control sampling do they use?

144
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:06,200
I heard case cohort. Yeah. So it's going to be a case cohort sampling.

145
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:11,120
They select for two reasons they selected pregnancies.

146
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,710
And because the occurrence of this outcome typically ends a pregnancy,

147
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:22,280
selecting those pregnancies should be interpreted as a selecting controls at the beginning of the exposure period.

148
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:31,760
So the beginning of that follow up. So that's what defines the case cohort sampling of the controls you select your controls at that beginning on the

149
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:39,680
follow up and then also the pregnancies to serve as controls were selected randomly from the whole database.

150
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:52,930
So that also indicates case cohort sampling. Are there any questions so far?

151
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:53,590
Good.

152
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:05,990
So then for the last one, it says investigators conducted a study to estimate the effect of acute alcohol intoxication on having a physical injury.

153
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:14,149
They recruited 961 patients who consulted the emergency department due to an injury and asked one whether they had consumed

154
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:20,720
any alcohol within the hour prior to the injury and to their usual average alcohol intake during the past 12 months.

155
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:28,549
They then compared patients who had consumed alcohol within the hour prior to their injury above their usual 12 month average intake,

156
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:35,900
with patients who had not consuming alcohol within the hour prior to their injury but had some usual intake during the prior 12 months.

157
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,890
So is our study based primary or secondary?

158
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:46,550
Yeah. So it's going to be secondary. The cases don't arise from well defined cohort.

159
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:51,800
So then are they prevalent or incident cases yet?

160
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,170
So they're going to be prevalent. They were people with injury at the emergency room.

161
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,780
They were not being followed for that outcome specifically.

162
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:05,660
So those are going to be prevalent cases. And then this, what is the control sampling?

163
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,020
So be careful with this one. What type of study is this?

164
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:24,800
It's a specific kind of case control study that we learned at the end of the case control lecture.

165
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,040
Yeah. So it's going to be a case crossover. And do you have controls in case crossover studies?

166
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:37,940
No, you only have cases. So in this case, there are no controls because it is a case crossover study.

167
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,270
So there isn't actually a control sampling method used in this case.

168
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:50,060
You just look at the exposure status of each of the cases in their usual exposure,

169
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:56,220
and then you're comparing that to that acute exposure right before they experience the outcome and seeing if they're different.

170
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:06,350
Yeah. Yes.

171
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:14,520
Yes. Yeah.

172
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:23,370
So if you have a primary study base, you're usually coming from an existing cohort that researchers usually have conducted already.

173
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:31,859
And then you're going back and kind of using the data from that close cohort versus if you're looking at secondary study bases,

174
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:36,209
the cohort usually isn't characterized, it's usually an open cohort.

175
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:41,280
So investigators can't really determine where those cases are coming from.

176
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:50,960
So we think. Are there any other questions on this?

177
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:58,610
Or we can open it up to any questions before the midterm, if anyone has any.

178
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:14,010
Yeah. Like what material is emphasized?

179
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,920
I would say it's fairly are all the materials pretty represented on the exam?

180
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:33,270
Because I mean, first topics were exchange, ability and counterfactuals, so that's important.

181
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:43,349
Then you get into associations and dags. So like, can you look at a dag and determine like do you have a statistical association?

182
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:48,300
Do you have causation? So like the homework where you get a dag and a lot of true false questions.

183
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:53,790
I think that's a good example of questions you could ask based on that.

184
00:37:54,390 --> 00:38:01,050
And then we got into all the different study designs. So I think this is a really good activity for like potential questions.

185
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:06,270
If he gave you a scenario like this, can you determine what type of study it is?

186
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,109
What are the characteristics of that study? Limitations.

187
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:19,230
Advantages of the study. What types of measures of association would you calculate based on that scenario and based on what type of study it is?

188
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:27,990
So I would say all the material and I mean a lot of it is related.

189
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:33,659
You can kind of relate it together. So I think when you're studying, that's actually a good strategy to utilize.

190
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:41,489
How does exchange ability counterfactuals relate to the different studies to the DAGS associations?

191
00:38:41,490 --> 00:39:10,910
So. Are there any other questions?

192
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,150
Yeah. Yes.

193
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:37,100
Yeah. Yeah.

194
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,670
Oh, yeah, exactly.

195
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:49,720
Exactly. Yeah.

196
00:39:49,740 --> 00:40:07,570
So for thinking of what exactly did it take to control, do those people at the hospital like in the same place at the controls,

197
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:16,710
like just because they're at the hospital, they could easily be going anywhere.

198
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:31,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

199
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:43,950
So I mean, yeah, they do basically because they like it and they're following in that database over time.

200
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:52,020
So it can still be considered a. I think so, yeah.

201
00:40:52,230 --> 00:41:02,570
Yeah. Okay. So we all feel like a lot of you can think of like, like cohorts like babies going at this hospital.

202
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:15,690
Yeah, that's true.

203
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,890
Yeah. Yeah. So it doesn't make sense.

204
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:27,760
Yeah, I mean. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

205
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,490
You see, this is a crime. It is?

206
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:41,800
Yeah. Yeah, I have to.

207
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:50,230
Yes. It says that each case matched to a.

208
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:59,629
And the date of shooting. So since that control was smashed at the same time that that shooting happened.

209
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:03,920
So that's your case, your controls at that point.

210
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:10,660
So what's going to happen?

211
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,570
Yeah. So when you say cumulative sampling, it's happening.

212
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:19,140
You're selecting your controls after the case.

213
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:25,810
But in this case, since they said they matched up at that specific time, it's going to be necessary.

214
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:36,200
Yeah, they. Just like if.

215
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:41,940
Just like free drinks.

216
00:42:43,640 --> 00:43:05,080
Like at. There is supposed to be.

217
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,320
I do for three reasons.

218
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:26,950
You don't have time. It's not like.

219
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:45,080
I mean, it's just depending on how you look at I you're going and then you have something worse, right?

220
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:52,930
Right? That's right. So this is.

221
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:02,600
Zero. And to my eyes, I don't.

222
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:20,600
Start. A group of like minded.

223
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:47,480
I mean, I guess you should definitely be there on how you're able to get to a place.

224
00:44:54,570 --> 00:45:02,760
Families started here. I mean, both of you have.

225
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,950
All the other thing.

226
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:16,110
I think we all know that.

227
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:38,030
So. Am not going to go down here and.

228
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:54,000
Like this 13 year old. For example, if you'd like to.

229
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:15,640
Right? That's right. Oh, yeah.

230
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:19,660
That's something I got a lot of.

231
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:29,100
This is very. Yeah.

232
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,780
Yeah. So we're going. Mr.

233
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:09,680
One. Yeah.

234
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:14,710
Something like this. What's. You're doing?

235
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:24,480
Here is my favorite results. Was the least. Maybe I.

236
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:45,050
Twice in the past 24 hours. Sacrifices.

237
00:47:54,420 --> 00:48:07,600
And figure out. We're at this.

238
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:28,969
I feel like this is where you have to go back in time to do something.

239
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:34,800
I never thought about it myself and I was like, Let's see.

240
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:45,990
And I was like, Yeah, but there's nothing but somebody that was just like, Yeah.

241
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:58,750
Yeah. You must be.

242
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:17,150
So much for. Yeah.

243
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:26,540
So that's. Suspect is a.

244
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:43,550
So. You know. But you know.

245
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:48,170
But is.

246
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:10,330
Her prefer to go like I'm from you live on look.

247
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:20,170
This is a big deal for.

248
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:30,080
You're in the locker room so they can share with you.

249
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:44,370
Yes. Yes. So. I was making a lot of work already, so, I mean, it's only one person.

250
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:58,830
But we. No, like cigarets.

251
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:04,389
I'm just. I don't like this kind of school because.

252
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:13,070
And that's what they're going to want to know.

253
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:27,130
Oh. And.

254
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:36,930
You. We got.

255
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:53,100
If you. Well, we've got to do that.

256
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:58,020
We'll be looking for. Do you have a minute?

257
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:07,420
Yeah, we. It still.

258
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:19,600
Yeah. So. It's not just my business versus your counterpart.

259
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:26,230
Yes. So. Yeah, that's. So if you know.

260
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:36,180
So if you're looking. The counterfactual.

261
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:59,660
So we're looking at. We do have.

262
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:10,420
Since there is coordination. Yeah.

263
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:19,370
So we know that's what you do. You have. So just another way to play.

264
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:33,410
So in terms of like interpreting that. You think?

265
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:36,530
Well, yeah. And then how so?

266
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:40,880
Like how they. In. Yeah.

267
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:51,790
So that story. Yeah. You're.

268
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:04,730
61. So that's.

269
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:16,860
Okay. Yeah. Likewise.

270
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:23,190
So you're like, Oh, yeah. Yeah, then.

271
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:35,430
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, she's going to go to school right now.

272
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:41,880
Okay. Yeah. I think.

273
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:57,990
So originally I had only just made process and as a result, I had a substitute information.

274
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:02,340
Yes. So that you were able to indicate.

275
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:09,160
To make. Sorry.

276
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:14,030
All right. It's worse than last time.

277
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:22,280
But it's like for me at. And you.

278
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:34,360
If I. Okay.

279
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:44,490
I'll try ahead of the car. Obviously, you had to be.

280
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:59,820
Some of the. He's.

281
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:44,370
I do. Thank you.

282
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:14,430
There is. The.

283
00:58:29,240 --> 00:59:11,370
Yeah. Yeah. Or at least the.

284
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:31,330
Many of us do. This was unnecessary.

285
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:48,420
You know, she was. Yes.
