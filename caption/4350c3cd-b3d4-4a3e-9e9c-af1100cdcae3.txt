1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,049
Okay. I'm going to get started. So much to cover, as always.

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:14,600
So little time. So where we left off last week was just highlighting some time lines of infectious disease responses.

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,310
So we're going to pick up from the 1980s to present with HIV AIDS.

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,510
So this was first documented in 1981.

5
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,590
There's a really interesting it's like a fiction movie, but it's supposed to be kind of like biographical.

6
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,390
It's called And The Band Plays On. Have you ever seen or heard of it?

7
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:44,100
You have Abby in. You've seen it. Oh, yeah. So it kind of talks about like them doing like the epidemiological investigation

8
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,259
of the origin of what they later discover to be a human immunodeficiency virus.

9
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,399
And, you know, getting people to, you know, discovering treatments and all that.

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:01,590
But as of 2018, it is still the ninth leading cause of death among 24, 25 to 34 year old.

11
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,090
And there's about 1.2 million. There's about 1.8.

12
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,709
I have misophonia to it.

13
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:17,600
So I'm going to try really hard to focus on 1.3 million people in the U.S. living with HIV and about one in seven people do not know their status.

14
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,580
So there's still always a huge push to do testing, testing, testing.

15
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,880
So more than 700,000 people with AIDS has died since the beginning of the epidemic.

16
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:42,560
And at the beginning of it, there was a complete lack of response and denial by the federal government, specifically by the Reagan administration.

17
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:54,240
It was a really poor mishandling of the epidemic because it was, you know, they created a lot of stigma around MSM and yeah,

18
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,770
just mismanage in the way that, you know, we've seen some other things like COVID mismanage.

19
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:09,210
So now there's a ton of federal programs and agencies related to HIV and AIDS care, such as tertiary care, health insurance coverage,

20
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:16,410
research and development, and then public health research for primary, secondary and tertiary prevention measures.

21
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:23,730
We don't have time to do like a full blown basically a full blown breakout discussion.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,650
But I'm just wondering, you know, like what? Just open it up to the group because they're a little bit smaller today.

23
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,589
Are there any parallels that you're seeing now between the public health communication

24
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:41,280
around HIV AIDS in the 1980s versus what we're seeing with the current monkeypox outbreak?

25
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:51,470
Any thoughts or comments? I feel like there's, like, some stigma around some stigma.

26
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,530
Yeah. With who? With both.

27
00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:00,920
Like HIV and AIDS and monkeypox. Right now, with a population.

28
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,840
People say that younger and younger people.

29
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,620
Okay. Mirror also people who have sex.

30
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,600
Because I don't think people living with HIV is kind of interesting.

31
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:26,240
Yeah. So yeah, I think like specifically, yeah, that the lgbtqia+ community men who have sex with men originally with monkey pox like national,

32
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:33,020
some news messaging, they were like, we shouldn't say this because we don't want to like further stigmatize the community.

33
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,749
But I feel like unfortunately that's going to happen regardless.

34
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,010
And I did see one news article, you know,

35
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:52,669
these like and these like click bait things where they were talking about how these two dads had exposed their child to monkey pox.

36
00:03:52,670 --> 00:04:01,639
And it was trying to like further evidence that like LGBTQ plus people shouldn't be able to like adopt or have children or things like that.

37
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,230
So I would say, you know, because COVID is still going on,

38
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:16,669
the media and and polio now like the media attention on monkey pox hasn't been as large as I thought it would be.

39
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:23,540
And especially in larger cities, they were able to, you know, provide a limited number of vaccines in Los Angeles County,

40
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:30,350
New York City, Boston, etc., to try to target those populations.

41
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:40,730
But usually MSM populations are very proactive with primary prevention in terms of like getting tested, getting on prophylaxis, medication like prep.

42
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:49,279
So, you know, once the vaccine was offered to them, they were really like all about getting vaccines.

43
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,080
There were there was no vaccine hesitancy within this population, really.

44
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,210
But I'll be curious to see how this continues to unfold.

45
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,010
So with COVID and beyond, we don't have to spend too much time with COVID.

46
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:10,009
But actually, at the very beginning of the pandemic, you see that people are like, okay,

47
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:18,320
if you only recently did travel screening, if you only travel recently from China or Korea or Italy, for example,

48
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:26,780
but then community spread became pretty rampant and there was a mass deployment of resources for prolonged response,

49
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:33,979
as Dr. BIDDINGER talked about last week, using the national stockpile to bring out PPE.

50
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,709
And this is like expired PPE, right?

51
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:45,530
But we had so much that we needed and manufacturers, because some manufacturers were closed for a period of time due to shutdowns,

52
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:52,070
just a huge back order of supplies, rent, moratoriums, suspension of student loan payments.

53
00:05:53,150 --> 00:06:02,090
So this has been the largest national infectious disease emergency response not only in decades, but is now surpassed 1918.

54
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:12,680
So, you know, what is how has the United States response to infectious disease outbreaks evolved over time?

55
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:22,160
Well, before the United States was even officially a country in Europe in the 1300s,

56
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:30,210
they did actually have organized organizational and institutional responses to the plague, which they also called the Black Death.

57
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,840
So, you know, obviously, in the 1300s,

58
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:43,640
very limited information known about personal hygiene modes of transmission reproduction numbers, as well as reproduction numbers.

59
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,930
Decon array of treatments are used at this time.

60
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,089
In this time, people frequently use like different holistic remedies.

61
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:59,360
They used to do something called bloodletting, where they like believed that the blood was impure.

62
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,710
So they would purposely like bleed you out for a little bit for a certain period of time.

63
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,180
But they did know to try to avoid contact with infected persons, contaminated objects, quarantine.

64
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,250
They did have plague hospitals. They did use ports and ships to isolate people.

65
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,120
And there's very primitive surveillance networks.

66
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:28,640
Right, because at least with the plague, with this in particular, you get buboes, which are very visible signs that you've gotten infection.

67
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:40,610
So cholera johns now that not not the Game of Thrones one, but the original John Snow, I'm sure you've heard about him.

68
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:47,600
Yeah. Okay. So he. Cholera reached the United States in the 1830s and.

69
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:53,650
They adapt, adopted similar response strategies that they used to control the plague back in Europe,

70
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,270
where they did also use quarantines and designated locations.

71
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:06,970
But who this political opposition, due to the suspension of personal liberty is not a new phenomena.

72
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:16,030
So there were some people who are highly against quarantines because they thought that it, you know, infringed on their personal liberties.

73
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:25,840
And because, you know, we had just very recently won independence from, you know, England, and there was all this stuff going on in France.

74
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:31,450
A lot of people had strong feelings about it. Okay, but great news.

75
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:39,429
Increasing number of scientists and health administrations started imposing sanitary cordons and quarantines from those coming abroad.

76
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,360
And they're starting to get like the very basic principles of contagion.

77
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,690
And at least there's some local health boards to provide guidance.

78
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,430
Again, we see the Red Cross and other nonprofits contributing to the response during that time.

79
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:01,980
And if we look at the crude death rates for infectious diseases up until the early 2000s,

80
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,390
like in the United States here, we felt like we're moving on.

81
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,470
We're moving away from being an infectious disease country to a chronic disease country.

82
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:18,350
Typically, you see this when countries get more and more developed, so to speak.

83
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:25,180
So like in China, for example, seeing over time seeing less infectious diseases and more chronic diseases,

84
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,040
as things become more capitalistic, for example, there's more commerce.

85
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:38,649
You know, the food industry is really booming. But now, interestingly, while we still have all these chronic diseases running in the background,

86
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:45,820
we're seeing this surge again in infectious diseases, not just in the United States and worldwide as well.

87
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,910
So between the 1920s and the seven years,

88
00:09:52,360 --> 00:10:02,120
the Cold War between us and then the USSR did increase the number of civil defense programs here in the United States.

89
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,280
So obviously they wanted to focus on nuclear threats first.

90
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:12,360
So they established, you know, the DOD and other federal entities were given a lot more power.

91
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:21,639
And thankfully, this was a quiet period with few large scale natural disasters, resulting in subsequent infectious disease outbreaks,

92
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,880
because the rate at which climate change was affecting the globe at that time wasn't nearly as severe as it is now.

93
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:36,910
But the CDC was established in this period in 1946, shortly after the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

94
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:44,620
But, you know, as of today, many different federal agencies are established or established,

95
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,970
but they're not working in confluence in any particular way.

96
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,700
And even though the U.S. is a relatively young country.

97
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:04,030
Right. Compared to others, like compared to like, you know, Greece or I don't know, Botswana, you know, it's.

98
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:10,480
Yeah, but yet. Well, they just got freed from the United Kingdom not too long ago, actually.

99
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,490
But, you know, we're relatively young compared to other countries.

100
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,059
So definitely the advances we've had in surveillance, medicine, technology,

101
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:24,370
research, better understanding of disease etiology and modes of transmission.

102
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:31,060
Now, hurray for us. But there's still so much more work to do.

103
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:39,639
And it's still a lot of resistance to even like the latest technology in research, like how much pushback we received for the COVID.

104
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,650
MORRONE Vaccine was pretty, pretty notable and substantial.

105
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,280
So with Michigan in particular, how did they respond?

106
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:55,510
Well, all states have state health departments because of the way that the health services are structured here in the United States.

107
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:01,780
So really, state level work on public health in health services began in the 1800s.

108
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:11,290
And most of the time, they focus on more like chronic issues or things like maternal child health, nutrition, food inspections, etc.

109
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:18,520
So, you know, they do surveillance and monitoring, diagnosis, research, dissemination of findings.

110
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:24,400
But depending on the state you're in, the health department's capacities really vary.

111
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:34,400
So I had the opportunity to work in partnership with like the the Douglas County Health Department in Omaha, Nebraska and the state of Nebraska.

112
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:45,310
And there they were really focused on chronic diseases. So diabetes, you know, heart disease, obesity, those kinds of things.

113
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:51,260
California Department of. All of this like super on the ball about certain things.

114
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,069
So they're not only looking at like surveillance,

115
00:12:55,070 --> 00:13:01,850
but they're trying to look at they they roll out a lot of interventions compared to a lot of other states where a somewhere like South Dakota,

116
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:09,440
for example, you might not necessarily see that same level of robustness here in the state of Michigan under DHHS.

117
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,780
They do have a division of communicable diseases, so they provide support and consultation,

118
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:20,900
collect and analyze data, develop programs and strategies, and then liaison with the CDC.

119
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:29,750
So some of the highlights for what they do is they do have an emergency notification network like Dr. BIDDINGER talked about.

120
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:36,530
We do have a michigan disease surveillance system, preparedness and coordination for bioterrorism and pandemics.

121
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:43,850
They do take part in the national pharmaceutical stockpile preparations, continuing education partnerships,

122
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:54,230
and then they are particularly interested in control, surveillance and education on diseases, transport emitted by animals, in particular zoonotic.

123
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,810
And then they do have a viral hub, TV, sharps body art section.

124
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,770
So here for the MDS, as their goal is to detect what we consider unnatural outbreaks.

125
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:13,370
So if there's like a huge burst of like, I don't know, like listeria, for example,

126
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:20,870
from people eating infected lunch meat from one particular county or facility.

127
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:28,460
Right? These are the kinds of things that they would start to take a look at and potentially send people out to investigate in person.

128
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:36,260
So there are 65 facilities across the state that participate in this and it's real time outbreak detection.

129
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:42,950
So they receive about in a day about 8000 emergency care registrations.

130
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:49,880
So people going to the ER all over the state and they receive data from the Poison Control Call center as well.

131
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:58,819
So they're monitoring this and IT data is available to you regional and state EPI here here's just a plot,

132
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,060
a AP plot map where you can see like for example,

133
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:12,050
if you're looking at gastrointestinal issues that happened on October 21st, 2004, looking at major cities and counties.

134
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,150
You can see where it's all reported right there. So it's I think it's a pretty cool tool.

135
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:24,970
Do any of you do this okay this is a really used was hired than skill I'm not myself going to land

136
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:33,380
but so COVID 19 you know they for a while they had an MIT COVID alert app on your smartphone.

137
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,680
I did have it like in the very beginning, but then everybody eventually got it.

138
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,030
And then and then the university itself had its own COVID dashboard.

139
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:53,390
So I like deleted the app. They also have one for tracking ticks because ticks is a huge issue here in the state.

140
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,490
So they do have a surveillance system for tracking ticks.

141
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:03,740
There's no efforts to curb the population at the moment because we can't just deforest a bunch of trees.

142
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:09,740
But if you download an app through the Department of Health and Human Services,

143
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:16,550
you can actually like if you if your dog has a tick attached to them or like you find a chick attached to you,

144
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,169
you can like report it in this app and like take a picture of it and like put

145
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,490
the location and do all that stuff and it kind of helps feed into the data.

146
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:32,059
So just a little snapshot of what's going on in Michigan, thoughts,

147
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:39,530
questions or comments on that before I like try to blow through this next part as as that's now it's okay, I'll finish.

148
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:44,110
I'll finish on Tuesday if I don't get through all of it. Yes, really.

149
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,970
It's a very urban like an effort to spring for.

150
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,180
No, not that I'm aware of.

151
00:16:50,570 --> 00:17:01,010
It's easier to spray for mosquitoes because generally they're in still water, but ticks hide super well and like foliage and trees.

152
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:09,140
So it's like this striking this balance between like killing the ticks versus we don't want to kill off a lot of our natural flora and fauna.

153
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:18,739
Yeah. Or like if you ever go to a nature preserve here and like at the entrance they have those little like shoo scrubby things.

154
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,340
But definitely like when you leave, check your check yourself.

155
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,589
I'm not scared of a lot of things. I'm worried a lot about ticks because I have dark hair.

156
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:32,060
So if one just like went on my scalp, I wouldn't I would never know.

157
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:38,840
And then people get symptoms like unspecified symptoms that are undiagnosed where they have Lyme disease,

158
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:46,520
but they think they have fibromyalgia, for example, or they have chronic pain for years and years and brain fog and like.

159
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:53,929
Neurological dysfunction with something like depending on the tick Rocky Mountain spotted fever that

160
00:17:53,930 --> 00:18:01,190
has that signature like bull's bull's eye rash that comes that makes it easier to distinguish.

161
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,560
It's very fatal in children. Usually a couple of kids die every year from a tick bite,

162
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,559
an interesting tick that a species of tick right now that's come out that some people

163
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:19,880
have asked me when I do trainings is one that changes your immunological response.

164
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:25,040
And if you get bit by this particular tick, I forget what species it's called, but you can Google it.

165
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:32,809
It makes you no longer be able to process and digest the meat properly.

166
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:37,480
So some people are worried because they're like, Oh my gosh, what's going to make me a vegetarian?

167
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:43,640
You know, if I get bit by this tick is their primary concern, but I'd be more worried about the other diseases, you know?

168
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:51,140
Okay. Yes. For me, I think communicable diseases and then infectious disease.

169
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,390
Yeah, they use them as synonymous, somewhat like as can you pass it to someone else?

170
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,610
Like, I can't give diabetes to someone else or I can't give asthma to someone else.

171
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:07,100
So they kind of like classify that under chronic or is like communicable slash infectious

172
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,900
slash contagious even though those now don't necessarily have the exact same definition.

173
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:16,489
They might use those terms in those ways. Yeah. Okay.

174
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,900
So now we're getting into health care capabilities and the tiered hospital system.

175
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:31,670
So in general, the first thing to understand is that adult and pediatric patients are treated differently and generally in different facilities.

176
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,270
So here, like our prime example is moths, women and children.

177
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,120
And then we have University Hospital and Taubman.

178
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:46,040
Not that Motts is just there to like look cuter and stuff like that, which I actually think it does if you ever go inside.

179
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,100
But you know, obviously in terms of like the beds, the beds are different sizes,

180
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:59,329
but children themselves have not reached full capacity in terms of like development in size,

181
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:08,090
but also development of things like their brain, for example, or or they haven't developed as robust as an immune response as some adults.

182
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,169
So you can't obviously give the same treatment to kids like you would adults.

183
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:16,520
And you've learned about this in talks by like milligrams per kilogram body of weight.

184
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:24,140
But, you know, not all physicians and health care professionals are trained to detect uncommon infectious diseases.

185
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,820
I think I've mentioned in this class how like sometimes I'll just be at a doctor's visit and like the person

186
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:35,720
is like clearly Googling the thing I just asked which like doesn't instill a ton of confidence and it's like,

187
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:46,879
oh, okay. Right. But health care capabilities can y y vary wildly depending on the location and resources like rural

188
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:54,410
facilities versus like urban clinics versus federally qualified health centers versus large city hospitals.

189
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,830
So I have friends who are still in Nebraska and they're physician assistants in rural clinics,

190
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:06,979
but they're essentially like the doctor for that entire city or town, for example.

191
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,309
Right?

192
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:16,969
Whereas if you go somewhere like Saint Joe's, which is now Trinity Health or even here totally different, like all the specialties are in-house.

193
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,900
Like you don't have to like exit the building to even like go from seeing your

194
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,680
doctor to getting your blood drawn to getting like any tests that you need.

195
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:32,000
But with infectious diseases, you ideally have isolation rooms for suspected or confirmed patients,

196
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:37,610
especially that's known to be airborne, are spread through respiratory droplets.

197
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:43,700
But not all facilities have separate isolation rooms that are ideally either with

198
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,710
special filtration like HEPA or what we consider like negative pressure rooms.

199
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:55,009
So the difference between negative pressure and positive pressure rooms, generally for negative pressure rooms,

200
00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:03,170
you'll see them used for anything like tuberculosis, measles, anything that's airborne or concerned about droplets.

201
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:10,070
So the air pressure in the negative air pressure room is lower than what it is in the hallway.

202
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:19,459
So the room itself is sucking in air from the outside, but the air in the room is less than what is on the outside.

203
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:27,000
So usually those rooms go to its own separate filtration system that is different than the rest of the wing of the hospital.

204
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:35,240
The facilities, positive pressure rooms are like this one, more like this air is just like blowing back out into the hallway about an outside.

205
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:45,530
So, you know, with this, it's really important to exercise infection control precautions among health care staff and patients.

206
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:54,360
So. Thinking about things ideally like containment and isolation, separate entrances and exits, and then flexibility of care venues.

207
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,230
What makes a health system resilient against infectious disease outbreaks?

208
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,170
There is so much more than what's on this list,

209
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:11,840
but flexible plans and management structures definitely timely and flexible access to emergency response and financing.

210
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:20,520
Even little things like talking about beforehand, like who are your suppliers that supply your PPE and your like treatments?

211
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,500
Are they able to prioritize you or push you to the front of the line?

212
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,579
If you have a special circumstance, what's your health care workforce like?

213
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,550
Are they trained? Are they dedicated? Are they ready to go?

214
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:43,850
So during Ebola, at the very, very, very beginning of the outbreak, there was no tiered hospital system here in the United States.

215
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:49,340
Really, there was only three isolation centers in the whole of the United States.

216
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:56,990
So the first was at National Institutes of Health at Fort Detrick in Bethesda, Maryland.

217
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:05,780
Then there was Emory Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, and the biocontainment unit that I was at in Nebraska.

218
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:14,150
There was supposedly a biocontainment unit in like Billings, Montana, or something like that, something random, but it wasn't actually functional.

219
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,330
So people were super worried about Ebola, right?

220
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,320
Because people had watched, like, I don't know, like Outbreak with Dustin Hoffman, Congo and stuff like that.

221
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:30,110
But it's also like it's very like visible like you if you get late stage what we consider wet.

222
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,100
Like you're just like you can potentially hemorrhage from your offices.

223
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,340
So people panicked and they were like, oh my goodness,

224
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:45,020
we only have three high level isolation units in the U.S. like, no, no, no, this cannot be right.

225
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:49,030
So essentially what they did is develop this tiered hospital system.

226
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:56,540
They didn't build new hospitals per say like we saw in in China, for example,

227
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,800
during COVID, they were building like super quick in a span of like a week.

228
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:09,140
These COVID units, these are existing hospitals throughout the United States where they designated them to different categories

229
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:16,640
to address Ebola screenings and potentially treatment depending on what their capabilities were.

230
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:24,110
So this was specifically targeted at state and local health departments, acute care hospitals, etc.

231
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,840
So with that, in the tiered hospital system, though,

232
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:38,360
the assumption is that the staff have been properly trained and have documented competency in personal protective equipment practices.

233
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:44,720
So all in all, like most of this happened in West Africa, people were super worried about Ebola.

234
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:51,200
Realistically, there were only 11 Ebola patients in this two years here in the United States.

235
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,690
Only two caught it here in the United States.

236
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:02,870
The rest were people who were evacuated, and the two were the nurses at Texas Presbyterian in Dallas.

237
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:08,510
And the reason why they got Ebola was because they weren't properly trained on how to deal with

238
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,940
such a patient and they weren't trained on proper donning and doffing of high level suits.

239
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:21,620
So they were like watching YouTube videos on how to do it before they were like providing patient care.

240
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,430
Okay. Like, that's the level we're at.

241
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,950
And there is, you know, and also you have to have this assumption that the hospital already has systems and

242
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:36,620
procedures in place to safely manage solid and liquid waste infection control procedures.

243
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:45,680
Hospitals may serve more than one role. We'll get to that on Tuesday and that patients can be transferred between facility depending on state plans.

244
00:26:46,670 --> 00:27:01,069
So that alarm is for myself to stop talking and start the zoom with my commander Garza, who she is usually always early.

245
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,100
So no cookies.

246
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:19,600
Oh, that was I was like, this is meeting our mark and I start the video.

247
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,140
Can I start the video file? To start the video, please select another video camera in settings.

248
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:47,540
Why can't you see us? Okay.

249
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,670
Hi, Liz. Did you hear me?

250
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:10,830
Yeah. He can't see me because I am discovering that this classroom doesn't have a webcam.

251
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:25,610
So. Well, sorry that you will have to like, I don't know, give this guest lecture to just a picture of my face, but I'm going to start the recording.

252
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:37,190
And if there's students that have questions during I will def we will definitely shout it out your name before you ask the question.

253
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:44,510
So thank you so much. I'm going to do an introduction to Commander Garza and then I'm going to start talking.

254
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:53,690
So Commander Elizabeth Garza began her commission corps career with the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response,

255
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,209
which now we found out from Dr. BIDDINGER last week,

256
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:02,600
has renamed itself as a research officer in the Biomedical Advanced Research Development and Development Authority.

257
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:06,770
There she was able to conduct research on several public health, medical,

258
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:12,320
emergency preparedness and response topics ranging from pandemic influenza to anthrax.

259
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:19,760
In 2008, Commander Garza joined the HHS office GO Office of Global Health Affairs as an international health analyst.

260
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:24,140
In that role, she served as project officer for the Afghanistan Health Initiative,

261
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:29,930
which focused on strengthening maternal and child health, as well as improving outcomes of mothers and newborns.

262
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:37,549
In Kabul in 2009, Commander Garza joined the CDC, NAIA, where she serves as a public health advisor.

263
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:44,900
And that's how we know each other. And her focus is on health equity and serving underserved through national partnerships.

264
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,249
She works to ensure high level technical science is translated and makes its way

265
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,930
to the hands of workers so they can protect their health and safety on the job.

266
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:59,330
Commander Garza also serves as a response leader on the CDC Global Rapid Response Team.

267
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:04,490
She's deployed over 20 times to places in Central and South America,

268
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:10,250
disasters in the U.S., Mozambique, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and many more.

269
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:14,420
She earned her MPH in global health from George Washington University.

270
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:19,970
Her B.S. is in Bilal Biology and International Relations from the College of William Mary

271
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,320
and is certified in public health by the National Board of Public Health Examiners.

272
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:32,780
She also completed a grad certificate in Global Health Management in February 2020 from the Uniformed Services University of Health Science CES,

273
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,890
and is an active member of the Fairfax County Medical Reserve Corps.

274
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:43,240
Check out her full biography because she's done a lot of super cool stuff and all of her accomplishments.

275
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:47,389
I posted that on Candace and Commander Garza.

276
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:53,170
I will let you take it away from here. Jason.

277
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:01,950
Was. Know, I see it and you just need to put it in shear mode.

278
00:31:06,140 --> 00:47:22,500
Yes. I want Commander Garcia to ask a question.

279
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:31,770
And this is Aurora. I may get I may be getting ahead of your presentation, but, you know, we have a lot of first and second year masters students.

280
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:37,050
So how does one get into the public health service like that?

281
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:40,589
Did you just sign up for it like you would for the military?

282
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:45,210
Or like how did you decide that this is what you were going to do and then how you started?

283
00:47:51,660 --> 00:49:03,760
Um. Both, I guess. Do you think you.

284
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:14,740
Yeah. You don't hear the sound with what we hear now.

285
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,510
Okay. We heard them. Yeah. Yeah. And.

286
00:54:16,330 --> 00:57:13,810
Yes. Yeah.

287
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:22,970
Can I ask you, is this like super competitive, like something you applied for?

288
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:30,500
And then they decide if they want you or like, you know, how how do you how do you go about picking people?

289
01:00:07,240 --> 01:07:28,310
Thank you. Thank you.

290
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:38,590
Commander. Good. So let's give her our initial here. Questions from the audience and just make sure to like members.

291
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:48,700
You're quiet this morning. Okay, well, I'll ask you a list.

292
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:56,880
So I know you're based in the D.C. area. Do you have to need to be part of the public health service or.

293
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:39,680
I'll just keep asking questions until someone hopefully comes up with one.

294
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:52,219
So so since you're in the armed forces, like do you periodic did you have to do like an initial like training or like, you know, periodic training?

295
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:58,370
Because I think what you do is really cool. But I, I can do a pushup, I can go down, I can go back up.

296
01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:02,540
So I don't know. This would be like a suitable Joplin, Missouri.

297
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:07,910
They're like, these is not only like the U.S., but physical training requirements.

298
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:22,030
I'm just. Cool. But can you hear me on the back in the bathroom?

299
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:25,030
So I don't know how loud I'm speaking. Hello. My name's Brian.

300
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:28,930
Leaving you for your talk. I was interested in the ship.

301
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:38,379
In the medical ship. And how? Just common that it is in terms of deployment, as that is the reason that you use that.

302
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:42,820
So you don't have to build a medical facility where you travel to and it can be

303
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:48,420
more transient or like why use why use a ship in one instance and not in country?

304
01:10:48,440 --> 01:12:12,440
Maybe it's geographic base, but. And also is curious in terms of who decides where to go and doesn't even have an emergency.

305
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:21,740
We've learned about like declaring the emergency on the federal level, but as it is, most of the decisions are made at each address.

306
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:30,140
Or is that higher? Where where would you say like the percentage or the distribution of decisions on where do we go?

307
01:12:30,230 --> 01:12:35,210
Like doing the diplomacy mission? Is that an executive order or.

308
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:56,560
The question. I'll ask I'll ask my question.

309
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:03,850
So, you know, like you said, these some of these missions are goodwill and stuff and your bilingual is.

310
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:08,979
But I'm assuming like for some places you've been deployed, obviously you're not fluent in the language,

311
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:13,870
so you probably have, you know, translators on your team and stuff like that.

312
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:23,500
So, you know, it's I do a lot of community based participatory research really trying to like foster these relationships with,

313
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:30,309
you know, the community. And this is obviously a very different situation because they're just on deployment and you're like in and out.

314
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:39,280
So you don't necessarily have that time. So like, I don't know generally how have you been received by communities when you come there?

315
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:44,859
They're like generally like, oh my gosh, I've been he's a lot like, this is so exciting.

316
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:54,009
Or you initially like met with some skepticism and you kind of have to do some some like relationship building in the first week.

317
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:56,379
I know it's probably different for every country,

318
01:14:56,380 --> 01:15:05,290
but just kind of getting a sense of like I like people and communication skills that go into not only like the technical response.

319
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:58,480
Any questions from the crew? All right.

320
01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:06,559
Let's give a final. Thank you so much, Commander Garza, again.

321
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:12,650
I'm so sorry. I thought this meat thing was also video, but apparently not.

322
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:20,660
I know you mentioned you have like a slightly modified version of slides that you can share with the class and.

323
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:27,739
Yeah, yeah. And thank you so much. I've learned so much more about you.

324
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:35,210
And it's so funny that you said you went to Nebraska because I'm sure you actually did the training because I'm contracting with that right now.

325
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:40,700
So the the PowerPoint you probably looked at on the hierarchy of controls and like some table top.

326
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,970
Yeah, I edited those like two weeks ago and they were like, oh my God, they're coming out right now.

327
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:52,280
But I was like, okay, so this is the small world that we live in.

328
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:58,530
Thank you so much, Commander Garza, and I'll follow up with you.

329
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:23,600
Okay. Thank you so much. Why did that make any of you compelled to to think about public office?

330
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:29,600
Well, it looks very interesting, but the first requirement is a U.S. citizen.

331
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:31,370
Oh.
