1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:18,240
In previous videos, we began to look at the scope and temporal trends of contaminant levels for exposure in community environmental settings.

2
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,720
To do so, we've used air quality as an example within the context of standards and regulations.

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,840
In this video, we'll continue with the air quality example and look specifically at examples

4
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,280
of air quality within more recently developed urban areas across the globe,

5
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:42,900
as well as understand the differences between standards and guidelines and the role of various agencies and organizations.

6
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,880
So when the historical case study of air quality in Southern California,

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:55,080
it took decades of research and the coming together of various stakeholders, including concerned citizens,

8
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,750
industry groups, top scientists, as well as local and state governments,

9
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,760
in order to make progress against the once very alarming levels of air pollutants.

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,060
Fast forward several decades from that time period, and there are now many other newly emerging,

11
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:23,140
recently developed large urban areas with fast growing economies, improved access to quality health care, and overall improvement in quality of life.

12
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,350
But also with widespread environmental pollution, including air pollution.

13
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,960
Not different from what Southern California experienced with its own growth several decades ago.

14
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,320
One example includes many of the large urban areas within China.

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,820
The use of coal combustion for energy production has grown rapidly in China, as has the growing number of automobiles.

16
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:53,500
To illustrate that growth included on this slide, our photos of the city of Shanghai in China.

17
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,190
The image on the left is of the city in 1987.

18
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,420
The image on the right is of the city in 2013.

19
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,400
Clearly immense growth over a very short couple of decades.

20
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,160
And the immense rate of growth has resulted in community levels of air pollution that

21
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,350
look eerily similar or even worse than those of Los Angeles from several decades ago.

22
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:27,800
And it's not just in China. This is the case in many fast developing urban areas across several countries, including many of those within India.

23
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,210
This map shows regions of the globe where air quality was once quite high,

24
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,430
like in the US and Europe that have since recovered following intense regulation.

25
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:46,870
The map also shows regions of the globe where air quality in more recently developed and developing regions is now quite high,

26
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:52,660
including urban areas within Central and South America, Africa and Southern Asia.

27
00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:01,010
So while some individual countries do have air quality regulations and enforcement, many of those developing nations do not.

28
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,140
The W.H.O. does not provide guidance in the form of guidelines, however,

29
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,690
and there's not an international enforcement agency analogous to the EPA at

30
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,040
the federal level within the US to issue enforceable air quality standards.

31
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:24,420
So let's look at the difference between standards and guidelines as they apply to exposures within community environmental settings.

32
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:32,070
National standards, which are enforceable, do vary according to the approach adopted for balancing health risks,

33
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:39,510
technological feasibility, economic considerations and various other political and social factors.

34
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:47,490
International guidelines issued by the W.H.O. acknowledge heterogeneity across regions and nations,

35
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,690
and in particular recognize that when formulating policy targets,

36
00:03:52,140 --> 00:04:00,360
governments should consider their own local circumstances carefully before adopting the guidelines directly as legally based standards.

37
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:08,370
For example, this figure shows annual average concentrations of PM10 across several Asian

38
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:14,070
cities that easily exceed the W.H.O. guideline of 20 micrograms per cubic meter.

39
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:24,150
However, so as not to be discouraging, W.H.O. also issued set interim targets that countries can first strive to achieve.

40
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:31,120
W.H.O. issues these interim targets for each pollutant with several important factors in mind.

41
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:39,190
They are proposed as incremental steps in a progressive reduction of air pollution and are intended for use in areas where pollution is high.

42
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,049
And they aim to promote a shift from high air pollution concentrations which have

43
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,670
acute and serious health consequences to lower air pollutant concentrations.

44
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:55,060
W.H.O. quantifies for each interim target achieved what one could expect in terms of

45
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,590
significant reductions in risk for acute and chronic health effects from air pollution.

46
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:08,830
Progress toward the guideline value should, however, be the ultimate objective of air quality management and health risk reduction in all areas.

47
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:17,550
So in this video, we've looked specifically at examples of air quality within more recently developed urban areas across the globe,

48
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,820
as well as looking at the differences between standards and guidelines in community environmental settings.

49
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,050
In future videos, we'll begin to discuss exposure assessment, starting with opportunities for personal monitoring.
