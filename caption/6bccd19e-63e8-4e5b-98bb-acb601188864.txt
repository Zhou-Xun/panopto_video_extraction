1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,620
In this module, I'm
going to give you

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,560
an introduction to hazardous
waste. Let me ask you.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,090
Have you ever been
driving down the road

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,650
behind a large commercial truck

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,905
and perhaps noticed a
diamond-shaped placard with a blue,

6
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:22,065
or white, or red, and
a yellow cell in it,

7
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:24,555
and maybe wondered, what
does that sign mean?

8
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:26,760
Well, it turns out that
placard is required

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,355
by the Department of
Transportation or the DOT,

10
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:30,930
and it's a way to communicate

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,540
the hazards in the
waste being carried by

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,760
that truck to regulators and to

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,800
first responders who may have
to respond to an accident.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,420
But what actually
defines or makes it

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,390
necessary for a truck to
have that placard on there?

16
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,850
We're going to explore
that in this module.

17
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,640
What actually makes
hazardous waste?

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,070
Well, it turns out the
Environmental Protection Agency

19
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,260
has given us definitions
of hazardous waste,

20
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,585
and there's really two
that we have to work from.

21
00:00:56,585 --> 00:00:58,280
The first is, hazardous waste

22
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,930
is a material that
comes from one of

23
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,485
about 500 different types of
industrial waste streams.

24
00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:04,790
So there are certain types of

25
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,760
industrial processes
that use solvents or

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,310
electroplating
processes that actually

27
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,025
create stuff that comes out
that's just very hazardous.

28
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:15,200
If it comes from a
process like that,

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,740
by default, it's considered
hazardous waste.

30
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,490
But there's also other materials.

31
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,075
So the EPA puts forth
criteria about corrosivity,

32
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:25,160
or ignitability, or reactivity,

33
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,160
or toxicity, various
chemical parameters that

34
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,325
can make a particular chemical
more harmful than others.

35
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:34,380
Coming back to that DOT
placard that I mentioned,

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,450
so you can see it imaged here.

37
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,540
We've got this
diamond-shaped placard

38
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,340
again with four cells within it,

39
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,620
and each of these
cells corresponds to

40
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,010
a certain type of outcome that
can be harmful to people.

41
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,480
So the blue cell represents

42
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,180
a health hazard and it
can be numbered zero,

43
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,180
meaning there's basically
no hazard to three,

44
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,430
meaning this is the highest
hazard category to health.

45
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,380
We can also look at the red cell

46
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,285
which corresponds to
the risk of fire.

47
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,010
In this case, a risk of zero,

48
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,120
not worried about fire,

49
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,730
three would be the
worst possible case

50
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,185
in terms of ignitability.

51
00:02:06,185 --> 00:02:08,740
The yellow cell
represents reactivity.

52
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,550
So is this particular waste more

53
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,980
likely to react with
other chemicals?

54
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,840
Then the white cell
at the bottom is

55
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,595
what's considered
a special hazard.

56
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,130
In this case, the W
with a line through it

57
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,630
means that this is a chemical

58
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,040
that's going to react with water.

59
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,420
So if it's on fire, you do

60
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,220
not want to spray this
with water because you're

61
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,780
going to make the
problem much much

62
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,270
worse if that's your
emergency response.

63
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,300
So it turns out we generate
a pretty large amount of

64
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,770
hazardous waste every year

65
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,390
just here in the
United States alone,

66
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,385
about 40 million tons,

67
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:38,749
and if we look globally,

68
00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:40,940
we're pushing half a billion tons

69
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,240
per year for all countries
around the world total.

70
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,690
What sorts of risks are
represented by hazardous waste?

71
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,975
Well, of course, there's
risk to human health.

72
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:52,160
Chemicals, and biological, and

73
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,050
physical wastes can
cause things like

74
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,250
behavioral abnormalities,
cancer, genetic mutations.

75
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,830
We can think about
physiological malfunctions

76
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,680
like reproductive impairment
or kidney failure,

77
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,880
and we can also think about

78
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,340
physical deformations
and birth defects,

79
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,920
a more reproductive outcomes.

80
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,500
We could also think about
the risks not to us,

81
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,180
but to the ecosystem around us.

82
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,070
So some of these
hazardous wastes can

83
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,230
directly kill plants and animals,

84
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,190
or they could cause

85
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,530
reproductive
complications in animals,

86
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,290
or if exposed at a
high enough degree,

87
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,760
they could actually
limit the ability of

88
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,275
that ecosystem to be able
to survive and thrive.

89
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,220
Finally, there are combined

90
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,140
human and ecological risks here.

91
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,440
So certain hazardous waste
can explode or cause a fire

92
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,120
and cause extensive
damage both to

93
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,955
people and the
ecosystem around them.

94
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:43,100
So what's out there to protect

95
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,600
us in terms of hazardous waste?

96
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,250
In another module, I introduced

97
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,380
the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act of

98
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,080
1976 or RCRA as it's called.

99
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,870
This is a very important piece
of legislation that gave

100
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,805
the Environmental
Protection Agency

101
00:03:55,805 --> 00:03:57,860
Regulatory and
Enforcement Authority

102
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,735
over both solid waste management

103
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:02,050
and hazardous waste management.

104
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,510
Critically, for the first time,

105
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,020
it gave us the ability to do

106
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,225
the so-called
cradle-to-grave tracking

107
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:10,445
of hazardous waste.
What do I mean by that?

108
00:04:10,445 --> 00:04:12,200
Well, if you look
at the image here,

109
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,985
we can imagine the place where

110
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:17,455
hazardous waste is generated
or born, that's the cradle.

111
00:04:17,455 --> 00:04:19,080
Typically then, there's
going to be some

112
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,520
transportation involved,
and in the past,

113
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,405
this was often where
hazardous waste would just

114
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:25,700
go missing, and then ultimately,

115
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,825
the waste is going to reach

116
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:30,440
its final destination either
ideally to be recycled,

117
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,700
or to be treated,

118
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,165
or perhaps to be
permanently disposed off.

119
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:35,960
So this cradle-to-grave tracking

120
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,580
means that we follow this waste

121
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,320
from the point it's generated all

122
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,140
the way to the point of
its final treatment,

123
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,980
so we can document
and determine that it

124
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,250
was dealt with and
disposed off effectively.

125
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,515
There's two other key pieces

126
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:50,220
of legislation I want
to talk to you about.

127
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,560
The first is the Emergency

128
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,720
Planning and Community
Right-to-Know Act

129
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,450
or EPCRA of 1986.

130
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,059
This basically established
reporting requirements

131
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:00,820
for governments at
the federal, state,

132
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,650
and local level, also for
Native American tribes,

133
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,600
and for industry as well,

134
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,165
and put stipulations in place for

135
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:10,850
planning around emergencies
and how hazardous waste

136
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,830
was reported particularly to

137
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,420
local communities that could be

138
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,405
exposed to that hazardous waste.

139
00:05:16,405 --> 00:05:18,770
So this legislation
generated the need to

140
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,935
educate and inform communities
about potential exposures,

141
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:24,800
and also to keep them
apprised of hazardous waste

142
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,115
and emergency
operation's responses.

143
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:30,140
Then the last piece
of legislation I'll

144
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,790
mention has a very long name.

145
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,190
The Comprehensive
Environmental Response,

146
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,355
Compensation, and
Liability Act of 1980.

147
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:39,290
That's often shortened to CERCLA,

148
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,865
but you may have also heard of it

149
00:05:40,865 --> 00:05:42,905
referred to as Superfund.

150
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:44,840
So this legislation actually

151
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,490
gave the Environmental
Protection Agency

152
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,290
the authority to go in and

153
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,520
designate a site as a
hazardous waste site,

154
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,805
and then to have the
authority to clean it up.

155
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:56,690
It put prohibitions on
certain types of closure

156
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,760
and absolutely on the abandonment

157
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,515
of hazardous waste sites.

158
00:06:00,515 --> 00:06:02,090
Very importantly, it created

159
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,445
liability for the
people or the companies

160
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:07,085
responsible for creating
that hazardous waste site

161
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:08,465
in the first place,

162
00:06:08,465 --> 00:06:10,460
and finally, it established

163
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,290
a public trust fund for cleanup.

164
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,710
So ideally, the EPA goes
after the polluter who

165
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,600
created the hazardous waste and

166
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,985
the polluter ends up
paying for the cleanup.

167
00:06:19,985 --> 00:06:22,820
But in the case that the
polluter is no longer available,

168
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,515
they're out of
business, they're dead,

169
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:27,200
then this public trust funds
can step in and provide

170
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,590
funds to clean up a community
and a hazardous waste site.

171
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,810
So let's talk about Superfund.

172
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,430
You may have heard
of this just through

173
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,350
the lay media previously.

174
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,480
Is there a Superfund
site near you?

175
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,620
The answer, if you live in

176
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,050
the United States,
it's absolutely yes.

177
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,000
The Superfund site is

178
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,220
a very common feature
in many communities.

179
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,990
So on the map here,
you can see that

180
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,180
there are actually
several designations.

181
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,220
There are active Superfund sites,

182
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,705
and there are also so-called
Superfund NPL sites.

183
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:58,400
NPL stands for National
Priority List.

184
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,620
So this is basically the
government's registry

185
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,970
of sites that really should be

186
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,740
cleaned up when and if

187
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,020
the funding becomes
available to do so.

188
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,570
So if we zoom in just on
the state of Michigan,

189
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,100
you could actually
learn that there are

190
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,770
65 national priority sites

191
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,785
listed with the government
just here in the state,

192
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:18,845
as well as active Superfund
sites going on right now.

193
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:20,270
So I'm going to
encourage you to check

194
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,130
the supplemental
materials so you can do

195
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,140
a little bit more research
and learn about what

196
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,460
Superfund sites may be near
your hometown, for example.

197
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,040
I'd like to talk to you briefly

198
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,690
about an international incident.

199
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,370
So we often think
of hazardous waste

200
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,720
perhaps as a local problem,

201
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,820
but it can very
rapidly grow to be

202
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,120
an international incident
under some circumstances.

203
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,150
So back in my childhood actually,

204
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,290
we heard about the
so-called garbage barge.

205
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,860
I'm going to tell you the story
of the garbage barge now.

206
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,270
So in 1984, the city
of Philadelphia,

207
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,290
which was operating an active
incinerator at the time and

208
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,935
sending the ash from that
incinerator to local landfills,

209
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,020
the city was informed
that the landfills were

210
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,895
no longer going to
accept the ash.

211
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:04,915
This ash had to go
somewhere, absolutely.

212
00:08:04,915 --> 00:08:07,065
So in 1986,

213
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:09,740
a freighter named the Khian
Sea actually pulled into

214
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,050
Philadelphia and picked up 15,000

215
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,335
tons of ash from the
Philadelphia incinerator.

216
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:18,260
What you can see on the
map here is basically

217
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,090
the journey of this freighter

218
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,025
as it tried to dump this ash.

219
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:24,650
So the freighter basically

220
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,020
traveled to 11
different countries on

221
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,810
four different continents
looking for a place

222
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,155
that would accept this
hazardous waste effectively.

223
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:35,780
One of their first stops
was Haiti actually,

224
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,160
and they dumped 2,000

225
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,680
tons in the Haitian port
before the freighter was

226
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,240
actually legally ordered by

227
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,000
the police to leave the country.

228
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,260
So that's 1986.

229
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,110
Fast-forward two
years, this freighter,

230
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,370
which had now been renamed
the Felicia and reef flagged

231
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,050
turned up all the way
around the world in

232
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,625
Singapore with an
empty cargo hold.

233
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,490
After the crew were questioned,

234
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,470
they ultimately revealed that

235
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,990
the ash had been dumped
overboard in the middle of

236
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,490
the ocean and actually
in the middle of

237
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,105
the Atlantic and Indian
Oceans quite illegally.

238
00:09:08,105 --> 00:09:11,870
So now, we have a major
violation of international law.

239
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,030
The saga actually
continues though.

240
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,550
So from 1986-1988, if

241
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,045
we jump all the way up
to the early 2000s,

242
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:22,985
the US government actually
went down to Haiti,

243
00:09:22,985 --> 00:09:25,954
moved the ash that had been
dumped there to Florida,

244
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:27,350
and then moved it again by

245
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,270
rail car to Pennsylvania
where it was

246
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,930
only finally disposed of in 2002.

247
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,580
So again, we often

248
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,290
think in the United
States where we have

249
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,760
a relatively efficient and

250
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,710
invisible waste disposal system

251
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,300
that hazardous
waste must be going

252
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,410
to an appropriate
and intended spot.

253
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,720
But as we can see here,

254
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,285
that is not always the case.

255
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:49,400
I want to wrap up
by talking about

256
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,545
some international
laws that we have

257
00:09:51,545 --> 00:09:53,780
specific to the movement

258
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,865
of hazardous waste
between countries.

259
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:57,620
So the United Nations passed

260
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,510
the Basel Convention
on the control of

261
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,760
trans-boundary movements
of hazardous waste

262
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,010
and their disposal in 1989,

263
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,415
and this convention came
into force in 1992.

264
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:09,410
The goal of the Basel Convention

265
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,240
is basically to stop
the transfer of

266
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,240
hazardous waste from high-income
or developed countries

267
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,590
to low and middle-income,

268
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,645
i.e less developed nations.

269
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:18,860
In other words, if a high-income

270
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,060
country creates the problem,

271
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,935
they should be the
ones to deal with it.

272
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:23,705
I will say the Basel Convention

273
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:25,970
specifically excludes
radioactive waste,

274
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,620
the thought being we
want that to go where

275
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,330
it can be handled
most effectively

276
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,620
regardless of what type of

277
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,400
country that handling occurs in.

278
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,575
Currently, there are 187
parties to the treaty,

279
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:40,460
including 184 United
Nations member states,

280
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,790
and for example,
the European Union.

281
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,620
Unfortunately, there are nine
UN member states that are

282
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,740
not party to the treaty and
even more unfortunately,

283
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,425
one of those countries
is the United States.

284
00:10:51,425 --> 00:10:55,340
So this represents an
international agreement for

285
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,605
countries to better manage

286
00:10:57,605 --> 00:11:00,195
their solid and particularly
hazardous waste.

287
00:11:00,195 --> 00:11:02,270
It can be quite
effective, but of course,

288
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,330
if not all countries are
on an equal playing field,

289
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,460
like the United States
not being signatory,

290
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,710
we still have opportunities for

291
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,282
inadvertent and unsafe
disposal of hazardous waste.
