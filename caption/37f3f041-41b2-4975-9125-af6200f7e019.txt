1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:06,980
And. It's wide open.

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,960
Okay, great. So hepatitis. So hepatitis is.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,950
If you're going to come away from the hepatitis day today with one thing to remember, it's that hepatitis is the category of viruses.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,910
It's going to be different than the different categories the other countries we've talked about,

5
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:37,010
because it's unified by the disease that it causes and not by other characteristics of the virus.

6
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:45,230
So what we're going to do is talk about different types of hepatitis, and then we're going to talk about hepatitis A, B, C and D viruses.

7
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,079
But then we're also going to talk about adenovirus,

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:56,300
which has recently been suspected as the potential cause of this, these clusters of cases of hepatitis in children.

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,969
And the reason I can make that link readily in my mind to jump into other viruses,

10
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:08,030
because hepatitis is a category of similar diseases instead of similar viruses.

11
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,940
Cancers is kind of a different, different way of thinking about this is we've done it before.

12
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,980
So if you look back in history,

13
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:31,040
hepatitis as a kind of infectious hepatitis as a disease state was first talked about as infectious jaundice or epidemic jaundice.

14
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:42,170
And this is something that was observed early on as something that could be transmitted by blood products to transfusion patients,

15
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:54,709
patients that had been treated for mumps, using serum or syphilis, patients in clinics for sterilization, but sometimes gets affected by this.

16
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:03,380
Infectious jaundice is epidemic jaundice and is likely been around first kind of described by how properties in the fifth century B.C.

17
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:16,520
This description here is sort of thought to be probably a description of hepatitis A in this outbreak that's being described here.

18
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:32,060
So in the first specific virus or viral cause of hepatitis that was characterized was called the Australian antigen,

19
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:40,820
which is later determined is actually the antigen for hepatitis B virus or the hepatitis B surface antigen.

20
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:47,689
And it was discovered in Australia was characterized the sort of common antigen profile

21
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:53,630
or this common antibody serum antibody profile that was found in various individuals.

22
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:01,639
And so they started for a while by just searching for what was called the Australian antigen,

23
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:13,010
because it wasn't understood yet what virus was leading to that antibody profile or that serum profile that was being identified in in Australia.

24
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,999
So starting in 1973,

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,470
the US and other countries began to screen blood supplies for Australia and even specifically

26
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:26,870
before realizing they were screening for a specific virus that was a hepatitis B virus.

27
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,540
Now. Okay, now, now we have a slight a slight taser.

28
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,440
I tell you, I can see your spirit. Zibby, recognize this picture and the button.

29
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,510
So this is at the floor of the Denver airport.

30
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,540
By the way, the Denver airport I just found today, this is new since the last time I taught this class has a conspiracy press.

31
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,730
Press seat for me, because there's a lot of there's a lot of conspiracies about the Denver here.

32
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,590
But this is outside the Denver airport. What what is your first what is your mind?

33
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,169
First, go to when you see this car, what is labeled gold and silver.

34
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:12,780
Right. That there is a conspiracy theory that this is actually marking the start of a big wheeled cart full of Australian antigen.

35
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,200
You add in, it's buried, it has been buried deep by the New World Order,

36
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:28,200
I'm sure the Denver airport for use when the aliens come so that they that the biologic toxin is ready.

37
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:35,940
At the end of this lecture, I would like you to tell me whether the New World Order picked the right antigen

38
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,380
to store in the Denver airport underneath the floor marked by the symbol.

39
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,149
If you'd like to know, I've got them up here, if you'd like to know the rest of it from the Denver airport.

40
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,670
Because, like, you know,

41
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,370
I went into the depths of the Internet so that you don't have to actually appreciate the Denver Airport summarizing this for me,

42
00:04:53,370 --> 00:05:02,040
because every year to remind myself about the back story, I'd have to go on some really scary websites, so I put it right front and center for me.

43
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:13,740
That's great. So we've got these ABC, D and E, these viruses we're going to cover in this lecture, hepatitis A,

44
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:20,340
hepatitis B, C, D and E, and if you notice, they are all different types of viruses.

45
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,800
We've got a coronavirus of a bad no virus,

46
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:35,430
saliva virus and HPV is genius delta variant and this is is happens very day we've also got they're not even the same type of genome.

47
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,750
Right. We've got we've got some with an envelope. Some without an envelope.

48
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:46,260
We've got some RNA viruses. We've even got a DNA virus in here and they've got different transmission modes.

49
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:54,630
So we've got fecal oral transmission for hepatitis A is a Bloodborne for A, B, C and D,

50
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,170
and we've got fecal oral for hepatitis E, which is much it's very kind of uncommon.

51
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:09,450
We also, I think, important to remember the hepatitis A has no risk of chronic illness.

52
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,640
There is risk of serious disease from hepatitis A, a low risk of mortality,

53
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:26,970
but you don't carry it forever like you do with if you have chronic development of hepatitis C, D, B, C or D, and we'll talk about that a bit.

54
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:35,010
But you know, what we do a lot of in this class is you thinking of a virus and thinking of similar viruses in that category.

55
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:42,420
Behave. And hepatitis is an example of a disease class where that's not a great idea.

56
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:51,000
You know, you can't really go to other, quote unquote, appetite of viruses to sort of anticipate how a different viral hepatitis is going to act.

57
00:06:52,050 --> 00:07:01,170
So it's also important to note that transmissibility varies greatly by virus.

58
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,810
Different hepatitis is have different levels of transmissibility, notably HPV.

59
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:12,990
Yeah. In terms of needle stick or blood borne transmission, HPV is one of the most transmissible viruses there are,

60
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:21,180
and this is when you do your blood borne pathogens training. The HPV is one of the most transmissible viruses.

61
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:30,290
So for let's let's start by kind of lining up.

62
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,230
Oh, actually, before one thing I just wanted to mention, one of the reasons for this,

63
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:42,710
remember I mentioned that AIDS Hepatitis A and hepatitis B don't establish kind of long term chronicity.

64
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,080
And so they have very brief time periods when they're present in the blood.

65
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,910
And so they they're not very susceptible to bloodborne transmission pathway.

66
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:58,340
You don't have a whole lot of other transmission just because there's not a lot of viremia you see in hepatitis A and E.

67
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,060
All right. So let's look at A versus B start there.

68
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:13,700
So hepatitis A on the left, you've got fecal oral transmission complications being liver disease.

69
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,390
There is an inactivated vaccine for hepatitis C virus.

70
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,349
There is a limited rapid. The vaccine is available. That was started out with a limited recommendation.

71
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:31,430
Now that's expanding and more people are most people are recommended to receive at least one dose of the hepatitis A vaccine.

72
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:40,940
Really focus on vaccination happening for travelers, child care workers,

73
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:50,660
health care workers and sewer workers and players because of their exposure to aerosolized virus that could be in the in the sewer system.

74
00:08:52,250 --> 00:09:00,680
Now, hepatitis B virus is something that we've got blood borne transmission, also vertical transmission.

75
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:09,470
So transmission during pregnancy, sexual transmission, you also could technically have a saliva based transmission like if you had saliva,

76
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,000
blood, like if you had a vampire type situation happening.

77
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,610
And so in transmission for hepatitis B virus is possible from asymptomatic cases.

78
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,459
I mean, it wouldn't always be there first. My sister was a biter.

79
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,660
She would bite us all the time. So like something that's for my sister.

80
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:37,550
So there's a subunit recombinant vaccine for hepatitis B complications and liver disease.

81
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:45,169
Now, interestingly enough, when we just finished having this conversation about the HPV vaccine and difficulties with uptake

82
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:51,200
of the HPV vaccine because it's considered a vaccine against sexually transmitted disease,

83
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,640
now hepatitis B is also can be a sexually transmitted disease.

84
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:08,390
We have for a very long time given children hepatitis B vaccine doses at the birth hospitalization, and then going forward from there,

85
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:14,690
because it was the best time to vaccinate, you know, you get the best immune response you provide after you do that series.

86
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:20,360
You have the best you have the best response and sustained response there.

87
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,530
And it also prevents any sort of perinatal transmission that might be happening.

88
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:33,280
So and then you have additional vaccination to prevent at risk behavior, but has not as much been a target as HPV vaccine has had.

89
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:40,100
It's been around for a lot longer. So hepatitis C virus.

90
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:46,610
To kind of drill down on that one a little bit more. Incredibly long incubation period.

91
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:52,400
You can have up to a 28 day incubation period which makes outbreak investigation really, really challenging.

92
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:59,900
The got a list of symptoms there associated with hepatitis A virus.

93
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,770
Most infections will resolve in two months. It does not become chronic.

94
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,869
Hepatitis A can survive, however, in the environment outside of the human body for months.

95
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,400
So if you think about this as a water potential waterborne pathogen,

96
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:22,760
it's very difficult to get rid of outbreaks used to typically seen most often with producer seafood.

97
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,930
But outbreaks are have been increasing over the last few years.

98
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:34,040
Post-exposure prophylaxis is one of the main methods of outbreak control that are used.

99
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,979
So post-exposure prophylaxis,

100
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:46,760
but it looks like you can also you can have the anti have a IgG administered you can administer immunoglobulin to try to stop the infection,

101
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:56,120
but you can also vaccinate you can vaccinate after exposure and reduce the the likelihood that somebody will become infected.

102
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,159
It's one of the very few cases where you can vaccinate upon exposure.

103
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,080
So we talked about this. We've talked about this a couple of uncommon situations.

104
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:23,510
And Hepatitis A is one of those. So hepatitis outbreaks since 2017 have been increasingly common and around the United States, and their views are.

105
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:29,989
So you see these kind of huge jumps in the reported cases per 100,000 population in

106
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,490
the U.S. And these jumps are not because of kind of even spread of hepatitis B,

107
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:39,950
that's because of larger and larger outbreaks happening in different places largely.

108
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:47,480
You know, these outbreaks, the first ones were largely associated with drug use, with homelessness.

109
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:54,680
The first places that the outbreaks were originally identified were Michigan, Utah, Kentucky, California.

110
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:03,979
In that the initial outbreaks were seen around a lot of populations with HIV drug use or populations that were unhoused.

111
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,320
But then we began to see outbreaks happen in the general public as well.

112
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,030
The biggest the one of the big outbreaks that happened in Michigan was at the

113
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:20,410
Renaissance Fair in Holly ended up being linked to a huge hepatitis A drug.

114
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,500
So come for the turkey leg with jaundice.

115
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:36,860
And so the so you know in one of the it was interesting what the response was because this

116
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,780
is a fecal oral spread virus and this is something that lives outside the body for a very,

117
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:50,840
very long time. So cities are trying all sorts of things to try to just stem Hepatitis A transmission in San Diego.

118
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,960
And actually, this was right before they were about to have the big, in fact, general infectious disease conference in San Diego.

119
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,740
San Diego actually blitzed their streets. They would like go round with a bleach truck and try to, like,

120
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:10,010
bleach their streets because it wasn't really clear, like what that locus of infection was coming from.

121
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,320
All right, I'm going to have to hepatitis B.

122
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:25,490
So Hepatitis B is an interesting virus in that it kind of has has its own extra Baltimore classification over at the end,

123
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:34,010
gets double stranded DNA that has a closed circular DNA close Kobe on circular DNA intermediate.

124
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,160
And so the genome looks like this sort of a double stranded circular genome.

125
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:47,810
And then it's got this gap here that has to be closed off before it can can continue on its replication process.

126
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:55,510
So the virion has it basically enters the cell,

127
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:04,280
the very end establishes then this closed covalently closed circular de formation by completing the gaps,

128
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,579
the gaps DNA, a circle inside the nucleus, you have the immature genome traveled to the nucleus,

129
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,500
at which point it's it's completed and circulates from there.

130
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,480
It's going to produce these RNA transcripts.

131
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:26,090
These early transcripts are going to go out to the cytoplasm, and then it actually codes its own reverse transcriptase.

132
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:34,250
And the reverse transcriptase that it encodes is packaged in the virion with an RNA genome.

133
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:45,050
And it makes the final the final immature genome that it is, that form that it's in during transmission that actually makes that inside the capsid.

134
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:54,680
So it releases as RNA that packages the RNA and it packages reverse transcriptase that it's made that the virus has encoded.

135
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:03,110
And then it does that conversion from RNA to DNA inside the capsid really sort of a

136
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:09,350
different a different model of thinking about how this how this virus is formed in Prakash.

137
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:22,850
It goes through in order to make the final enveloped product, it actually gets its envelope out of the endoplasmic reticulum,

138
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:30,200
it goes through the endoplasmic reticulum to grab the membrane from there, not from the outer part of the cell.

139
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,630
And then it releases out of an undesired, really interesting virus from the way that that lifecycle works.

140
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:44,759
So what's your infective with hepatitis, hepatitis B, the risk for the CDC or per the CDC,

141
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:51,120
the risk for chronic infection varies according to how old you were at the time of infection.

142
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,900
So if young children are infected now, about 90% of infants,

143
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:04,890
25 to 50% of children age 1 to 5 years will remain chronically infected with HPV if they're infected grandchildren.

144
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:12,750
By contrast, about 95% of adults will recover completely from HPV infection, do not become chronically infected.

145
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:20,399
And here are what these different pathways look like and the kind of relative progression through these states.

146
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,240
If you're sort of going to average this out across the population, across all different ages.

147
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:38,580
So for if you've established chronic HPV infection, you can enter into a chronic hepatitis stage or you can enter into a inactive carrier state.

148
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:48,570
And through these states, certain, you have different kind of risks of going through the levels of cirrhosis.

149
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:55,590
And you can either have an active carriers that will very rarely lead to hepatocellular carcinoma.

150
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,959
But the real concern is that you've got this kind of actively established chronic

151
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,740
hepatitis B replication that's leading to progressively higher levels of cirrhosis.

152
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:14,250
And the cirrhosis itself can either lead to death or can lead to the development of the carcinoma that may lead to death.

153
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:23,850
So that's the big risk of hepatitis B. There are a number of treatments that are available with hepatitis B,

154
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:29,009
and here's a link if you want to go see more information about there's a really long list

155
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:34,350
of different hepatitis B antivirals that are available and they have different places.

156
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:41,940
So it just watching very carefully through the through the process of hepatitis B, through its lifecycle.

157
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:47,280
And so you can have antivirals, molecules that are going to block different parts of that cycle.

158
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:59,069
So you've got entry inhibitors, you've got inhibitors that stop that formation of the circular DNA, you've got RNA interference,

159
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:06,780
you've got immune modulation, and that increases targeting of different parts of the virus process.

160
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,490
You've got inhibitors that are going to block NUCLEOCAPSID assembly,

161
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:19,860
you've got polymerase inhibitors that kind of similar to what we've seen with HIV will will block

162
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:26,610
that conversion of the RNA to the DNA in that final that final progenitor variant that happens.

163
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:34,170
And then you've got release inhibitors. So a very active antiviral development space.

164
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:43,090
So I'm going to skip forward and skip hepatitis C and leave that for a second and go to hepatitis D.

165
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:49,300
So this is every virology professor's favorite, favorite common question, person in question,

166
00:19:50,380 --> 00:20:00,010
hepatitis B D is as a defective virus, and it only propagates if you are also CO-INFECTED with hepatitis B.

167
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,690
So I'm going to show you what that looks like in a second.

168
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,399
It requires proteins for hepatitis B for assembly from an.

169
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:17,620
Absolutely. And it has asked to use cell RNA polymerase in order to try to replicate.

170
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,510
It doesn't make its own its own polymerase.

171
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:26,470
So before I show you how this works, so what is the number one strategy for preventing hepatitis D infection?

172
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,910
Get rid of hepatitis B, get rid of hepatitis B, you will get rid of hepatitis C.

173
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:44,100
And this is why it is for like decades as the approval processes are so.

174
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:55,290
Here. We've got a schematic where I've got hepatitis D right here entering into the cell, and then I've got hepatitis B right here entering the cell.

175
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,450
So this is a hepatitis D in a transmission event, attaches to the receptors, comes into the cell,

176
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:13,020
loses the surface antigen proteins, and is transported into the nucleus with its initial genomic DNA.

177
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,710
And the nucleus it forms anti genomic DNA.

178
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:28,380
And more copies of this antigen originates released and transcribed back into the genomic form of the RNA.

179
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:37,559
And this process includes in all ways that it needs to basically form its,

180
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:47,970
its regular genomic RNA and then the eat the hepatitis D proteins that it needs to be able to function and do this process in the next cell.

181
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,410
However,

182
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:59,610
none of these proteins are able to infect another cell or are able to form that receptor binding that's needed to attach and enter another cell.

183
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,230
It uses hepatitis B proteins in order to accomplish that function.

184
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:14,130
So you have also have and hepatitis B virion in the cell that's producing hepatitis B surface antigen at the same time.

185
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:21,629
And then that is what assembles with this hepatitis D virion right here.

186
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:26,340
It coats itself in the hepatitis B protein releases, and that's how it infects the new cell.

187
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:34,350
So it's it's actually using the hepatitis B surface antigen to perform the attachment function, the next cell.

188
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,790
So hepatitis D on its own can't do anything.

189
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,720
It's not going to infect the next cell. It needs hepatitis B through the attachment.

190
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:55,000
So what happens if you have a population that has a hepatitis D and hepatitis B circulating in the population?

191
00:22:55,330 --> 00:23:02,500
You can actually have sort of changes in severity of disease and changes in the level of chronicity that can happen.

192
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:09,910
And that depends on how the the process works with this.

193
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,480
So we're going to look at here RLT as a marker of, of degree of liver disease.

194
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,099
And we're going to use the, the different colors here.

195
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:30,159
The red and green are going to show and I'll trace them out for people who don't differentiate red and green, but there are red and green.

196
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,450
The hepatitis D is going to be in red and hepatitis B is going to be in green.

197
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:44,140
And so you've got this co-infection scenario where you have hepatitis D and hepatitis B were first introduced to the person at exactly the same time.

198
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,520
And you have a primary infection here and then establishment.

199
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,650
So you've got both the red and the green lines are having that initial primary infection,

200
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,610
initial viremia, and then you've got establishment of this kind of second infection that continues.

201
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:12,760
Now you can have super infection with acute hepatitis D.

202
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:20,049
So second. The second scenario here is you've got hepatitis B is already established.

203
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:31,030
You've got a chronic hepatitis B infection. And the introduction of Hepatitis D happening here and hepatitis C can go on or it can clear and go away.

204
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:42,400
Now, at this second or sorry, this third panel, you've got the initial chronic establishment of the hepatitis B infection,

205
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:49,480
and then you've got Hepatitis D being introduced like this.

206
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,140
And then you have an a chronic establishment of a hepatitis C infection.

207
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:56,310
So all of these scenarios can be possible.

208
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:12,200
Now, if you have this co-infection scenario where they're both happening at the same time and your hepatitis B infection is acute,

209
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:22,220
you have a lot of transient affects, your DV infection, you have a T hepatitis B infection.

210
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,610
You're usually going to have recovery with viral eradication.

211
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,620
So very few people end up establishing chronic infection of either of these.

212
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:41,870
However, if you have the super infection, so you have chronic hepatitis B and then you have an acute or a chronic hepatitis D introduction,

213
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:47,690
then you're going to have most often you're going to have persistent infection.

214
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:57,350
Now, the B was already persistent, but the DV will then is more likely to become persistent and chronic at that point.

215
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:05,380
So kind of increasing the risk of liver damage.

216
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,940
All right. Next, along our parade of hepatitis viruses.

217
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,570
Let's talk about the virus and hepatitis.

218
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,940
You talk about hepatitis C, which hepatitis C? I'm going to take a pause on your brains.

219
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:26,650
Move over to a new category of viruses. These are flaviviruses. So do you recognize any of the cyber virus?

220
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,909
We've talked about other cyber viruses a lot in the class.

221
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:33,930
Right. So we've talked about dengue. We've talked about yellow fever.

222
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:44,460
So it is in a different part of your day, but in that kind of general category.

223
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:56,670
So hepatitis C virus also has this kind of duality between it.

224
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:03,860
Some people are going to become initially infected and then are going to clear the clear the virus have

225
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:12,870
very low like resolving lower levels of liver or pathogenicity and maintain that clearance for months.

226
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:20,970
Some people are going to establish a persistent infection that's going to continue and sort of cycle through these different levels of liver disease.

227
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,470
The timescale for hepatitis C infection is one of the longest timescales that we're going to see in this class.

228
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:38,500
So if you have the initial introduction of hepatitis C infection and the development of chronic infection,

229
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,330
you're going to see evidence of cirrhosis developing for about 20 to 25 years.

230
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,690
And you're not going to see end stage liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma for 25 to 30 years.

231
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,360
So it's an incredibly long term progression that happens.

232
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:05,500
And one of the concerns was suspected that many decades ago there were really big upticks in the spread of hepatitis C that were going undetected.

233
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:14,860
And so the concern was that as that population, that older and older, we would start to see a lot of new cases of cirrhosis pop up.

234
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:19,630
And so there was a lot of efforts to try to get more hepatitis C testing into the population.

235
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:29,940
So you could see the if you have this establishment of chronic hepatitis following HCV infection,

236
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,650
you have a fairly high risk, 20, 30% of developing cirrhosis.

237
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:42,180
And then once you develop cirrhosis, a 2 to 7% risk per year of developing severe liver disease.

238
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:52,370
And the risks are greater depending on the age in which you got infected.

239
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:58,080
So if you're infected very young, your risk of developing cirrhosis within 20 years is going to be quite low if you

240
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,320
get infected when you're older and the risk of developing cirrhosis is much higher.

241
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:10,500
So it's the opposite of competency and then your risk is even greater.

242
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:16,850
If you look at people that have had hepatitis C and HIV tend to circulate.

243
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:25,190
And so if you have hepatitis or if you have HIV for longer at the point at which you are exposed to hepatitis C,

244
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:29,840
then your risk of developing cirrhosis following hepatitis C jumps way, way up.

245
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:43,430
So important target population for hepatitis C intervention in people who are have had long term, even if it's highly controlled HIV infection.

246
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:51,129
Now, this is what the estimate is. This from a model, a bird and model.

247
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:55,670
But this is the estimated prevalence of hepatitis C by rooming.

248
00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:08,610
Hepatitis C is around the world. And I mentioned there was this concern throughout the mid 2000s about there

249
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:12,480
being kind of this silent hepatitis C epidemic that was going to grow and grow.

250
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:24,030
And then we were going to have a lot of cirrhosis cases. And actually what we do see when we look at the hepatitis C deaths over the last two decades,

251
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:31,830
you can see that hepatitis C was continuing to grow as we were decreasing other nationally notifiable infectious disease conditions pretty steadily.

252
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,490
Hepatitis C related deaths were continuing to increase.

253
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:44,140
So there's been a big push for both testing and treating hepatitis C and rolling out new antivirals for that.

254
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:50,110
The points of intervention are similar to what we saw with hepatitis B in some ways.

255
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:57,580
You've got intervening on the the virion, the extracellular of urine blocking entry.

256
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,929
You've got blocking translation. You can try to block assembly,

257
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:10,180
block RNA replication or upregulate the innate response of hepatitis C infection to try to get

258
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:17,590
an after the B or some of the interferons to intervene with the viral replication process.

259
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:29,480
Which anti-viral you use is actually what's there's a lot of antivirals that are now available and those are delivered in combination.

260
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:36,230
And the ones that you use have to be tailored to likely to the genotype that people are infected with.

261
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:41,420
So different genotypes respond differently to different antiviral classes.

262
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:52,310
Now, it's there's not great evidence that the genotypes cause fundamentally different disease in terms of severity or how the disease progresses.

263
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,680
But certainly it matters what you what you distribute.

264
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,610
Now, look, to see I showed you the map earlier.

265
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,680
They showed what HCV prevalence was around the world.

266
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,730
Right. Big differences in who's got a lot of HCV, which countries each receive, see studied.

267
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:23,720
But then look here and look at the genotype distribution. So this this graph is like a big red flag in my mind.

268
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:30,260
You've got the countries that have the lowest prevalence of HCV,

269
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:35,719
have a genotype distribution that is different than the countries with the highest prevalence.

270
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:43,670
And obviously that is potentially challenging from a drug availability perspective.

271
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:44,240
Right.

272
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:52,820
You've got your countries with the biggest buying power needing a different combination of drugs potentially than the countries with the lower power.

273
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:59,450
So something to kind of keep in the back of your mind with each HCV drug availability.

274
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:08,120
And even in countries the high buying power like the US, these antivirals are phenomenally expensive.

275
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:16,010
And remember I said one of the biggest concerns for HCV are is in the chronic HCV population.

276
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:24,770
And this is a population that has already a very kind of long and storied history of not being able to afford to get access to antiretrovirals.

277
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:28,490
And then HCV antivirals started becoming available.

278
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,400
So Bobby, for instance, which is the one that gets picked on the most, is $1,000 a pill.

279
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:44,300
So somebody, of course, is estimated to be about $84,000 for 12 week course of treatment, $160,000 for 24 hours of treatment.

280
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:48,290
And that doesn't include the other therapies when it's offered in combination therapy.

281
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:57,200
So very, very expensive. So has received a lot of criticism about the high price of hepatitis C antivirals.

282
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,730
And so, you know, now it's covered by Medicare, Medicaid.

283
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:13,280
And this is there's been a lot of conversations about kind of the cost of liver disease and how much how much can

284
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,800
these companies get away with charging Medicare or Medicaid insurance companies for these treatment courses?

285
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:27,170
But then does that cost impact how quickly these treatment courses are used and whether we're waiting for

286
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:33,170
people to start to demonstrate more severe disease before I'm fully turning them to the cost effectiveness?

287
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:37,280
Conversation with HCV antivirals can be really.

288
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:47,800
Okay. So that is the traditional hepatitis appetite.

289
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:57,250
I don't know if that, but I'm going to switch because today we're actually not going to talk about ABCD or E,

290
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,740
we're going to talk about adenovirus causing potentially causing acute hepatitis like symptoms.

291
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:13,660
So what I wanted to do before we broke off into the workshop is just give a brief, brief, brief, brief introduction to the virus.

292
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:18,340
So adenovirus does not have an envelope.

293
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:27,819
Adenovirus is a DNA virus. We tend to see a virus transmitted by conjunctiva, nose and throat people.

294
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:36,820
Oral fomite transmission. It is broadly included in one of the respiratory virus classes, but and a virus is suspected to have a much,

295
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:48,050
much more prominent contact or fomite mediated transmission pathway than other respiratory viruses you can find.

296
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,520
So finding antiviral setting from the stool, as we all know,

297
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,180
from wastewater now you can pretty much find any virus at any sort, but you swallow small.

298
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:03,730
And so it was debated. Enterovirus is one of the first viruses, though, where it was really detected and it's been debated for a long time.

299
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:08,620
Whether does that mean the adenovirus has a fecal oral transmission pathway or with

300
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:17,710
simply adeno virus is is hardy enough to survive the GI tract in a viable form and,

301
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,629
and it's being swallowed from the upper respiratory tract and no virus.

302
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:30,040
No, you know, caveat, most of these viruses that people are picking up in wastewater are not they're not picking up viable virus.

303
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,459
They're picking up nucleic acid that they're able to detect.

304
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:37,630
That's been solid with adenovirus. You can get viable iris out of school.

305
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:45,850
So there are many, many, many subtypes of antivirus and some serotypes are going to be notably severe.

306
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:55,930
There are there's this long history of adenovirus investigations happening in the military.

307
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,400
Most of what we know about adenovirus and how they operate are from the military.

308
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:09,850
Here is a description of an outbreak that happened in 99 to 2010 in the U.S. military,

309
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:16,780
where they had a number of deaths occur and west of the death were over.

310
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:23,920
Deaths were over this decade long period. They had a number of different outbreaks during the time.

311
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:34,780
And so anniversaries, usually anniversaries four or seven or in over 14 tend to be the the targets for this.

312
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:44,889
It is also most often seen in very new members of the military, partly because of the their joining.

313
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:51,880
They're living in barracks close congregate setting in a like a physically stressing situation.

314
00:37:52,420 --> 00:38:00,129
And there's actually been a lot of studies that have tracked and shown how the four main contamination,

315
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:04,060
like surface contamination in the barracks will map infection rates.

316
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:14,170
So there was a there used to be an of virus vaccination campaign in the nineties for the military that was then

317
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:21,850
discontinued and then it was restarted in 2011 for types four and seven after after these deaths occurred.

318
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:36,549
So. Oh, and here is this sort of rundown of these different classification schemes for the different types of adenovirus.

319
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,490
Because we've known about Adenoviruses for a very long time,

320
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:47,499
there have been multiple different classification schemes that have happened and so you may have species letters A through G,

321
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:56,590
you also have unclassified by the agglutination groups, but then you usually refer to them as these type numbers right here in the middle.

322
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:08,470
Different type of groups of types tend to map to different disease disease categories, particularly, for instance,

323
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:15,760
you know, these conjunctivitis, conjunctivitis and acute respiratory disease are what we are tending to be dealing with.

324
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:22,959
But you do occasionally see outbreaks of gastroenteritis, gastroenteritis or infantile diarrhea.

325
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:31,770
That will be other virus related. All right, so with that, I'm going to stop here.
