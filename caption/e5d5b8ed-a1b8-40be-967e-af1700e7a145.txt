1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:07,740
Great. Okay. So here we go.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,430
I want to get this going here or entering unit two this week.

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,450
They're kind of moving away.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:24,179
Those basic skills like skill sets, analysis and integrating into specific, you know, what I call I mean, sometimes I classify them as food groups,

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:33,180
but really expands upon that because the goal of this unit is to fully cover grains and grain like substances,

6
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:40,319
including pseudo cereals, which we'll talk about, find ways to make it kind of come alive and real for you.

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,530
And that's how we'll do a gluten free grain recipe, as I mentioned,

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,580
and then think about the way grains are processed and that how we use those processed products for other things.

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,880
And that's how we'll morph into baked goods.

10
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:02,190
And talking about the flowers and then you can't really have a full conversation about baked goods and the flowers that we use without

11
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:09,870
thinking about things like what is the role of starches in not only starches that are naturally present in grains that we use,

12
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:15,750
but starches that are actually added to products. So we'll we'll throw in a little bit of processing in there, too.

13
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,979
And then again, you can't have a conversation about baked goods without realizing, oh, what is that baking soda do?

14
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,120
What is the baking powder? Do you know, what is the role of we change the type of sugar.

15
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:36,029
Doesn't matter if the sugar is has more water in it, etc. So so those are all like the goals of what we'll cover and we'll do that.

16
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,840
So that's different explorations that include some of the PowerPoint, some of the demonstration that will do it,

17
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,560
the Zingerman's Bakehouse and some breakouts, etc., etc., and the assignment.

18
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:55,410
So what I did this time also was I put up on the canvas site all of the concepts in the PowerPoint that I hope to cover in Unit two.

19
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,620
Most definitely not today because there were like 60 slides there.

20
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,970
And as you already know, I talk a lot. We don't always get through the slides.

21
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,880
I have really extensive notes for this unit.

22
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:13,020
So if there are things that we gloss over that we don't cover completely, I'll make sure that by the end of the unit I post all those notes for you.

23
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,480
So you have access to those. So, so just kind of presenting them out there a little bit differently this time.

24
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:26,190
So we talked a little bit about the unit to details and every week we can explore that a little bit more.

25
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:35,400
One thing I also like to introduce that you probably already saw in campus is that I give everybody I think I mentioned in the very first class,

26
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,800
this class is designed to be successful.

27
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:44,879
You know, obviously there are things that I need to subtract some points for and various just as a learning experience.

28
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,440
But I want to make sure that you have the opportunity through the content and exploring your

29
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,559
knowledge of the various different products and topics that we have to get some extra credit.

30
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,590
So that's why we have an extra credit that is actually baking bread.

31
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,440
Anybody bake bread on their own. So just a very small amount of you.

32
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,500
So hopefully this will be a new experience. And for those of you that do have experience baking bread,

33
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:14,130
I'd like you to kind of mix it up into a loaf that you've never done, a grain that you've never tried before,

34
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:21,660
something that becomes much more challenging whether or not you bake for free or you don't be gluten free,

35
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:29,669
you know, you combine different classes, etc. So there's definitely improvement to be made in all different areas of that.

36
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:37,709
So so you do have the opportunity to earn two extra points by sometime between now and the last day of class on your own.

37
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:47,530
This is this is definitely an on your own project, not a group project going through the process of making a bread, actually using yeast.

38
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,110
So now talking about a quick bread.

39
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:57,650
So in general, like about leavening agents, there are lots of different ways that we chemically and biologically leaven products.

40
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:05,729
So and a lot of times in baked goods at home, we're examining with baking some of that baking powder and other combination.

41
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,600
So but for this, I want you to use some form of yeast.

42
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,130
So so there are some links in that assignment where you can explore that, some great videos there,

43
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,470
some blogs, etc. and I'd be happy to have more conversations about that.

44
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,620
So basically what you just have to do with this on the canvas site is you need

45
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,569
to upload a picture and then just some commentary about your experience.

46
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,650
Like it was a failure before it was a success, so I did it.

47
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,569
I don't understand. And I proved that it didn't rise, wasn't my temperature.

48
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:43,049
And this is a really weird season also for baking bread, because just like you commented, it's cold in here.

49
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,120
So sometimes our houses are humid or cold or at and all of those things can have a huge impact.

50
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,830
Usually this time of year I have some kind of a sour dough start or go in my Serato started

51
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,840
doing particularly well because it wasn't loved as much over the summer as it needs to.

52
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,910
So I'm trying to bring it back alive. So if at some point a.

53
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:09,980
This semester. It thrives and I feed it a lot and I'm happy to bring that in if people want to use a little bit of a sour start or two to start that.

54
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:16,770
So so just it's kind of a fun usually we I would love at Zingerman's Bakehouse

55
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,149
in your demo excuse me that we have in this unit to be able to bake bread.

56
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:28,620
But as you will see it's a it's not necessarily a labor intensive process, but it's a time intensive process.

57
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,330
We don't have the time to do that in a two hour class. So that's why I let you do that.

58
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,260
Any questions there? Yeah, we'll create something else with.

59
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,310
Yeah. Yes. Meaning what would you think? I'm enrolled?

60
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:49,230
Yeah, absolutely. I highly encourage you to bring them into class, and I honestly share what I need.

61
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:56,610
Like, a loaf of bread is hard to eat all by itself, and it goes to make sure it doesn't have all the dough conditions.

62
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,229
There's an additive, so. But that's kind of a joke, but not really.

63
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,630
So but yeah, but please share.

64
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:09,690
If you don't share what the whole class share with other of your classmates or your roommates or friends or family or whatever.

65
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,970
So anything that's yeasted.

66
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:19,889
Example people have done like this is Thanksgiving time, so sometimes people will do it right around the holidays and do Thanksgiving rolls,

67
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:25,709
you know, and do some really fun twists on that or different variations.

68
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:32,670
You can make pretzels. There are, as you know, if you know anything about donuts, I mean, not necessarily the healthiest option,

69
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:37,559
but there are cake donuts and there are, you know, that's that's a little bit more complex, too.

70
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:44,280
So, sure, anything that's really yeasted and what majority of people will do bread or bread like products.

71
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,430
Any other questions there? Okay, next word.

72
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,950
So I should know a little bit about this because she's been helping me with a project.

73
00:06:54,950 --> 00:07:02,360
But this little acronym that I have up here stands for Peer to peer nutrition counseling sector.

74
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:14,299
So Sara Ball and I that the director of the Dietetic Internship has a novel idea to start a pilot program this fall with the School of Music,

75
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,980
Theater and Dance who have requested our service. Anybody on Sam this year.

76
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:27,080
Say yeah. I don't know if you're familiar with it. So the the School of Music Theater has a really robust wellness program.

77
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,980
I'm envious of what they do in terms of wellness for their students,

78
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,410
but they have this robust wellness program and they've reached out to us to help them with counseling.

79
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,840
And I might have mentioned it earlier in the semester,

80
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:47,930
but last year it was more like very broad creative of some videos and some recipe sharing and some social media updates.

81
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,719
And we weren't quite ready at that point to actually start a true peer to peer counseling program.

82
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,990
But we're getting ready for that, and we want to do it as a pilot this year with a very small number of probably a

83
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:07,600
dozen S.A.T. students who are interested in like broader nutrition counseling.

84
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:14,030
We're not going to delve into the GI issues or disordered eating or other medical issues.

85
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:22,040
We have a nice intake form or a way to go through a process of referring people after answering the intake questionnaire.

86
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,940
And for those of you that have worked in the student run free clinic,

87
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:33,330
in some ways we're modeling what we're doing after that because as a student you will have a one on one.

88
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:40,160
We're going to run it via Zoom for this first semester, even though we do have a dedicated space to this new wellness concept.

89
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,840
But you will run it via zoom with a preceptor presence.

90
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,450
So as opposed to like a Google Voice call, this will be a video call.

91
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:57,050
And I'm telling all of this to you, because if that's something that you're interested in participating in and getting some experience in it,

92
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:02,629
if you've participated in the student run free clinic in the past or you have other nutrition counseling

93
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:09,500
experience that you would like to solidify and improve because it's just a process right now,

94
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,170
a learning and I know you haven't had nutrition counseling, but you're starting to have MMT.

95
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,620
I'd love to have you on board. So I'm making that announcement just seeking a few students to help with this.

96
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,449
You may only have one School of Music Theater and the Arts Student Council.

97
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:32,600
You may have to, depending upon the interest level. So if you're interested in that, just send me an email to find my office.

98
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:38,240
Just let me know. So I'm doing some recruitment for that. I specifically want to have second year students.

99
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:43,490
I don't think overall first year students would be ready for that unless they're coming into the program already.

100
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,020
As an R.D. or somebody, hopefully as a verification statement, we do have some of those students.

101
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,640
Okay, that's my plug for that. There ends big dates.

102
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,890
So because we're 28 people and they can only accommodate 14 at a time,

103
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,709
I guarantee you won't be as rough as with life skills class like last week because I

104
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:09,110
know the second group was a little shortchanged and I think that was a whole new well,

105
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:14,269
just kind of like a new concept for them over at South Quad, but it's a good learning experience.

106
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:19,790
But Zingerman's has been has been breaking up our class for the last several years because they know

107
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:26,209
they can do a really good job in an hour and they can't do a good job with 28 people in 2 hours.

108
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:32,600
So we I'm going to have to divide you into two groups of 14 and similar to what we did last week,

109
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:39,920
14 will stay here with me and we'll continue to kind of plug through all of the material in that large PowerPoint.

110
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:47,690
We'll go into the details of the ingredients in baked goods and move on to starch, etc. and then 14 will go to Zingerman's and then we'll switch.

111
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,790
So I've talked to Dr. Mancuso because I know you have class before this.

112
00:10:53,210 --> 00:11:02,480
The Zingerman's Bakehouse is over by Costco in the mall, if you're familiar with that area, you know, so it's a good ten, 12 minute drive.

113
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,730
Generally, I can help arrange for carpools or whatever needs to be.

114
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,010
I usually will set up a Google doc for that and then you can contribute if you

115
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,760
have a car and you can take people if you don't have a car or you need a ride.

116
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:22,790
And that's what I'm proposing to do, is to just divide you into two groups of 14.

117
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:34,790
Unless I hear from you about any special needs or accommodations or carpooling issues, etc., the thought is you would be going directly from 639.

118
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:44,840
They are the next two weeks. And Dr. Mancuso did say that he would let the 14 that are going each week out a little bit early not to miss any contact.

119
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,920
So that it wouldn't be so stressful. So getting over there.

120
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,930
There's adequate parking there. I know there's not adequate parking here.

121
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,820
So any concerns or questions? Is it possible to, like, rent a school shuttle for that?

122
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,720
Because, yeah, like you said, there's not really enough parking here.

123
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,600
And then we're also, like, investing our own gas money.

124
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:13,630
I don't know, like. Yeah, it's sort of like maybe there's a little bit more efficient.

125
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,390
Right, right. That's a really good. I don't work out. We don't know any shuttles.

126
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,260
We can rent university vehicles.

127
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,710
That is possible. They do have a vehicle lab that we could do and I can look into that.

128
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:40,569
So see if that is possible that we've done in the past that the it's about I think it's about 3 to 5 miles.

129
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:46,960
So hopefully in terms of gas, not too much, but maybe they are right now either.

130
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:53,829
And I really would say from a public standpoint, it's been a problem in the past, but I would highly encourage carpooling there,

131
00:12:53,830 --> 00:13:00,340
too, so that maybe each week we could only have four and five cars with everybody.

132
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,380
Oh, definitely. And and so it's a good.

133
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:15,610
Anybody have an experience with renting cars on campus or is it kinda like the Ginsburg Center, sometimes low rent cars?

134
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,550
This is the only time that we're going to have to be off.

135
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:26,200
Like in the past year we actually got like five prime tickets to go to Eastern Cape and other places.

136
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,099
So this is the only time we're going to be offsite and then our fermentation will

137
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,479
be back and South Cloud running a little bit differently than the Zingerman's

138
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,490
Creamery people are coming to us most likely will sit here in this classroom and

139
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,500
then the final ag class has to be taught remotely because of these regulations.

140
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,060
That's right. Yeah. I'm just gonna say, I know you're up, students.

141
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,170
We're able to take cars to their sites.

142
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,380
That was a pretty easy process to run the shuttles. I don't think it's too difficult.

143
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,400
Okay. Okay. And I guess the only other thing that I don't know about, like cars or how that works, but yeah,

144
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,620
I'm going to look and do it now or else put our executive secretary Filippi and whoever.

145
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:10,960
So just look for an email from now. Otherwise I'll start a Google back to see where we stand.

146
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:17,560
And you guys just just like give you let me know if you're interested in the counseling center to be a student counselor there.

147
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,190
Let me know if you have any issues over the next two weeks, okay?

148
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:27,910
There's nothing that I know of in terms of other conflicts.

149
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,389
But I also know there's somebody who has a class right at noon.

150
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:35,410
So just talk to me about that. Okay.

151
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,280
Any other creative thoughts? Yeah.

152
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:47,919
No, I was just going to, you know, because of the cost of this class kind of adds up with like all the recipes and everything.

153
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,190
And I think you mentioned school with a lot of resources.

154
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:59,550
Uh huh. So like, if we could maybe look into making it a little bit more efficient, like that would be great.

155
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,690
But I mean, I have a car that I can take people Zingerman's to, so I.

156
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:11,260
Okay. Like, overall, like, if we could look into, like, how to make get a little bit different.

157
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,700
Yeah. No, absolutely. And when you do your final.

158
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:21,489
That's a really good point. Amanda, too, is when you do your final food presentation, you also like I would,

159
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,360
I always highly encourage you not to use ingredients that are really costly,

160
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:32,110
but if you find that you need something that is costly, I will collect at the end for that and give a reimbursement.

161
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:37,210
And then that's also reasons why I try to do as much group as we can to decrease the

162
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:43,410
cost and also hope to like with the the budget conscious recipes that we develop.

163
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,260
Also hope that these lead to like meals where you're nourishing yourself.

164
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:54,909
And I always wonder when I watch Food Network like or like even the new greatest great British baking show that just dropped the other day,

165
00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:00,000
what did they do with all that help? You know, they take one bite of 16 red velvet cake.

166
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:06,080
The rest of it, they must have a very well spread crew party.

167
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,900
But I'm very conscious also of the taste of it and it's a great point.

168
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:17,469
Yeah, I appreciate it. And I also have a car and would be willing to drive people.

169
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:25,570
The only thing with that is I know a few other individuals park on north campus, so to get to our car is at least a 20 minute bus ride.

170
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,320
Yeah. That's not going to work for this exact right.

171
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:36,460
Right. So, so how about if we start the Google doc and you put in there like car and parking situation?

172
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:43,180
I can I can reimburse you for short term parking if you're coming in for 639 and you need to use a meter.

173
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:51,290
We can do that. Another option. I can give like $5 credits to every the people who are driving.

174
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,090
So that covers that gas. So what what will work this out?

175
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,130
Is there a way that you could maybe reserve a couple of parking spots for it?

176
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,380
Because, like, I know since we get here after seven and like the hospitals just start at seven, it's like,

177
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:14,420
well, what I can do is I can, I can, I have free parking passes over at the hospital for the P.

178
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:19,220
The problem is it's like the ones that are over close to the Taubman after entrance,

179
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:26,810
my secret parking place what I'm coming in and I know I'm going to be here for less than 8 hours

180
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:31,580
is actually the old Matlock that's right across the street from the School of Public Health.

181
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:38,780
If you get there like today, I got there at 745 and there were lots of parking spaces.

182
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:45,230
And if you're there less than an hour, it's free. But if you're there less than 8 hours, it's $3.

183
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,930
And I would be more than happy for on those days when you guys drive, they have you park there.

184
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:59,660
It's technically for patients and visitors, but if it's a short term stay and you have like you're going to get in and out, it's a great place to go.

185
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,090
The problem is you don't have to generally come back here right after class.

186
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:09,229
So then you don't you're not looking for a parking spot when you return. It's just a parking spot.

187
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:13,210
So you could get to 639. Is that a good option?

188
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,290
Yes. I love these ideas. I'm so glad I brought it up.

189
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,790
Okay, so my value is to start the document.

190
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,939
You start putting your input and then I'll look into alternatives.

191
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:32,050
And the worst case scenario is if you have to park a car close by and you need reimbursement for that, that will definitely help you with that.

192
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,890
Great. Okay. Gluten free recipe development.

193
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,440
Everybody have a chance to look through that because that is our next recipe.

194
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,270
Mm hmm. How do they get back to campus after Zingerman's?

195
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:56,030
Well, if you are in a carpool, let's say you're the carpool driver, because I know you drive metropolitan Detroit, right?

196
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:02,930
I would suggest that you would drop everybody out, back off at some mutually agreed to point and then go on your way.

197
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:08,570
So I think like you have, if you are the driver, you would have the obligation of driving back to campus.

198
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,160
Does that sound like a reasonable thing? Okay.

199
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,250
Yeah. I'm for the gluten free recipe. This one is like a not baked good item.

200
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:27,080
This is like a. Yeah. So in the past, it can be savory, less often.

201
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,319
Sweet. I do have to say, with the grains that I'm going to give you,

202
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,680
common things are often like sometimes I people don't know what to do with like teff or sorghum or millet.

203
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,430
And people have made and students have made like bars in the past.

204
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,759
So they're not necessarily overly sweet bars.

205
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:51,560
But I would prefer this to be a savory. This this recipe also calls for having a healthy ingredient added to it.

206
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,400
So that can be the healthy ingredient of your choice.

207
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:04,070
This recipe, I think that the points that I want to take home with you is I have all of your grains here, so you don't have to purchase that.

208
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,710
And then you will have the choice when we have a great break of selecting the grains that you want.

209
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,690
There's definitely this is my process and demonstration site.

210
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:21,860
So I have what I like to do with this is have a variety of grains that hopefully your somewhat unfamiliar with.

211
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,109
So if there is one of these grains that you tend to up with on a regular basis,

212
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:32,150
I would suggest that you don't choose this and that you choose something that challenges you a little bit more.

213
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:38,840
And sometimes in the past, I've used I've used the bonds of pasta as an option, as an alternative grain.

214
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,589
This time, actually, they have a new product, which is they're calling a rice.

215
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:47,610
But I would say it's more like a or so. So I have that because it was a fairly new product.

216
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,870
It's an interesting time to actually present a new product.

217
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:56,480
But what I have here is other than that, chickpea rice, I have millet and sorghum.

218
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:02,120
I know Keene was ubiquitous, although it's very common in gluten free recipes.

219
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:09,710
So if you're somebody that doesn't normally cook with quinoa or you'd like to try a completely different recipe, pick that up.

220
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:18,890
I also have Buckwheat and I have Amaranth and then I additionally have flowers in here.

221
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,480
If anybody has ever cooked with test before, that can be very challenging.

222
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:32,599
A test is actually the the grain or the pseudo cereal that's used for injera and Ethiopian bread,

223
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,660
but it has to be fermented in order for it to be successful.

224
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,370
So I have teff flour here which can be used as a gluten free grain.

225
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:46,190
I have a couple of corn is naturally gluten free and I think sometimes it gets underrated.

226
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:55,009
So I have somewhat of corn bread polenta here in a couple of different jars that somebody can fill because I brought some others.

227
00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:00,680
And I also have in addition to that, teff flour. I have some brown, brown rice flour.

228
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,690
Students can pan. My goal would be every group takes one.

229
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,250
We'll have some leftovers.

230
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:15,200
So if you are somebody that would like to to make a recipe with some of the gluten free flours, you can perhaps combine two of those.

231
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:23,569
But I also brought dextrose here and I have buckwheat flour, too, which is another gluten free flour that we can disperse this.

232
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,770
And I have extras along with these in my classroom, I mean, in my office.

233
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:35,120
If you find that you don't have enough this year, though, I gave pretty generous portions as repugnant here as about cup and half so.

234
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:42,709
And I have a lot of extra millet. Funny story. I had millet and quinoa stored in bulk jars.

235
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:51,350
I have a pantry math problem, so if I and I get a lot of grains in bulk, if you don't store them in a sealed jar, you often will get pantry moths.

236
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,400
So I had them next to each other. I'm not labeled and I didn't know which one was millet.

237
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:02,150
I didn't know what you are. So I did a controlled experiment and I cooked each one of them.

238
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,120
And if you have cooked them before, you know, they cook quite differently.

239
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,920
And you'll also know that when you put quinoa, it often will cook into a slight a circle,

240
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,920
and then I'll have like a little white tail to it, which is often the germ.

241
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:19,520
So it was key. Mark That's what I look like. So but it was a good way to find out exactly what I had.

242
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:27,050
So when we have a break, I've already is another one of my corn grits polenta that somebody can choose from.

243
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,819
But take a look at what your groups are based upon the input that you gave.

244
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:39,190
And that's just. There are that I made. I think that this will work well for a variety of reasons and groups.

245
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,750
I'm perfectly happy if you're more comfortable collaborating via Zoom.

246
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:49,510
So it's just a little bit more challenging to figure out how you're going to cut down on Zoom.

247
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:57,040
So about 70% of this is development of the recipe and submitting the recipe.

248
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,480
And then about 30% of it is a PowerPoint presentation that you will do with your group.

249
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:07,120
And we'll do that on October 12th, which will be after we're done at Zingerman's.

250
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,770
So basically I expanded the time since we had 11 groups to about 3 minutes,

251
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:16,420
2 to 4 slides, and there's a bunch of criteria of what you can discuss on those.

252
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:23,290
So so it's almost like, I think maybe in Dr. Cole's classes in the past, he might have done some speech presentations.

253
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,940
So it's almost like a speed presentation on your specific grain.

254
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,980
A lot of what I want to hear about is origins, the traditional uses of it.

255
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,820
Any type of problem that you had in cooking in it, because if you're not familiar with cooking with some of these grains.

256
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,890
They can be a challenge the first time.

257
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:49,900
But the goal is in the thousands of species of grains that we have, we know that we only consume a few of them.

258
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:56,440
So really expanding your knowledge and expanding the client's knowledge in the future for a celiac

259
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:04,809
support group and also learning that it performs differently than grains that you might be used to.

260
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:10,040
And how do you make modifications in the actual recipe? Thoughts on that?

261
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:16,790
Questions that I think you'll find, like the assignment is really thoroughly written out there.

262
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:23,830
But, you know, it's kind of like when you write it, you think it's thorough and then somebody else reads it, finds something wrong with it.

263
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,749
So just take a look. So we have the greens will distribute those already talked about that.

264
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,430
We're going to go into cereal grains and we'll probably do starches more next week.

265
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:42,200
We'll go through our grains and our pseudo cereals. And then I have a little breakout activity about so much of what I talk about in

266
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,950
this class is how do you synthesize information that you have and client advice.

267
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:55,340
And we have an activity for that. So I apologize for the glitch that my grader had in figuring out how to hide all of the grades.

268
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:01,170
But hopefully we've worked through that. So I know some of you saw grades that were posted before I made any modifications.

269
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:06,470
I did go in and do some modifications on those and try to provide you lots of comments and read through everything.

270
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:12,500
So just let's just do a little brainstorming. What, you know, what did you guys find challenging about this assignment?

271
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:15,950
Did anybody find it challenging? Anybody have any problems?

272
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:25,090
There were some themes throughout. Christie I was thinking about like I was a little worried that I my recipe required a lot of different appliances.

273
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,719
I wasn't really sure if that would be accessible to everybody.

274
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,990
That's the recipe. Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, in terms of appliances, it depends on the appliance.

275
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,989
Like I know I made some comments if you required like a pressure cooker or an insta pot that might be less

276
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:50,270
accessible than a Crock-Pot or a box grader will make the assumption that pots and pans are accessible,

277
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:54,230
although they're not always but for this recipe, for the most part they are.

278
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:59,510
We made the assumption that blenders are available, but again, not always.

279
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,169
So there are some assumptions. I definitely, though, did comment.

280
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:10,880
If you are using something that I thought was like beyond what would be acceptable, they being modestly stocked.

281
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:18,219
Yeah. A certain size. And it's like, how do you decide what it is like?

282
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:23,740
How do you determine servings? Yeah, that's a really good question and a good challenge.

283
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,580
And I think what you can think about is this sometimes the way that I'll give advice is you think

284
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:33,570
about it in terms of what would be a typical macronutrient distribution for a typical diet.

285
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,630
So I mean, I think protein came up a lot.

286
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:43,250
There was a couple where, you know, definitely when you did a nutrition analysis, it was like, wow, that's a protein.

287
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:54,459
I think about in general and I know that, you know, at the time that protein requirement is based upon the RDA of about 0.8 grams per kilogram,

288
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:59,260
but we know that that's for people that are rather sedentary and not active.

289
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:05,200
And we know also that most Americans consume far more than that because that would be 55 to 65 grams of protein.

290
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,209
And also, when we do that calculation, we often do it actually in body mass, too.

291
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:17,440
So that can vary, but so macronutrient distribution, you know, just like in terms of like what are you used to in a portion size?

292
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:22,750
The other thing that I tell people to think about for future recipe development, is this a snack or is this a meal?

293
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:29,320
So if you were having a meal, your typical breakfast is a 4 to 500 calories.

294
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:35,890
And what would be a 500 calories? You know, obviously, you know, an athlete might have a higher intake.

295
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,660
And so there's a lot of variability there.

296
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:49,360
Generally, if it's meant to be an entree without a lot of side dishes, you know, I'm looking at something for about 500 calories or so.

297
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:59,140
If you give me a product that has 100% of the saturated fat that you're supposed to consume per day and it's not even a meal,

298
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,460
then that would be concerning.

299
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:07,570
Or if you give me something that's two thirds of the protein or roughly two thirds of the protein in a serving size, then that also.

300
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,860
So just like a really big learning experience, to figure out how you do that,

301
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:19,510
you have to decide that size and advance whether or not it's kind of four inches or one and then make an estimate.

302
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:29,020
Okay. Yes, I. I have, but I need to learn more cooking more like you ought to use baking for baking oil.

303
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,920
That's a really good question, because when we think about the oils that we use,

304
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:36,370
we think about the purpose of it and we think about things like smoke point.

305
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:42,250
So we'll get into in this unit. Actually, when we talk about oils that are used for baking,

306
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:50,560
we'll talk about the variety of different oils and the benefits of them and the distribution of polyunsaturated, unsaturated and saturated fats.

307
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,600
The other things that you have to think about is what is the purpose of the oil?

308
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,990
Is it to impart flavor? So you're making an olive oil cake.

309
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:02,890
So an olive oil cake is going to have a distinct olive oil taste to it.

310
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:09,610
And you want that olive oil profile to come through. How are you making the brownie where you want the flavor to come through with that?

311
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:20,530
Is just this done? Amara, I think as I go back, if you want something to be really neutral, then you're looking at more a canola oil or corn oil.

312
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,079
If you're really cost conscious, maybe you would want to avoid an avocado oil,

313
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:32,950
which tends to be more expensive if you're just looking at has like a flavoring on top of something that imparts a lot of flavor.

314
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,989
And just sesame oil is more for a drizzle or something that you would put in a salad dressing.

315
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,629
So it really kind of depends if you're cooking with that.

316
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:45,340
You want to look at things like smoke point and then otherwise want to look at flavor profile.

317
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,209
And then the other thing to consider, just like this is food science.

318
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:53,560
So when you are looking at an oil, an oil has no water in it.

319
00:30:53,560 --> 00:31:01,270
So but if you're if you're using like a margarine substitute or some type of a butter spread or a butter or,

320
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:05,990
you know, butter itself has somewhere between 15 and 18% water in it.

321
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,840
So you have to take that into account. And when you're making recipe substitutions,

322
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:21,280
a half of a cup of liquid oil is not equivalent to eight a step or eight tablespoons of butter because of the water content in it.

323
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:27,909
So those are just things I'd like extremely right yourself, which I thought you guys did a really good job though this year.

324
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,550
Maybe because I emphasize it a lot with cost.

325
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:37,390
Like I didn't see any recipes that came across that were like a large amount of cost for the amount of calories.

326
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,610
That was something that I looked at really closely.

327
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:48,910
The standard style recipe based upon the PowerPoint description allows you to give directions and instructions in a paragraph format,

328
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:58,059
which is totally acceptable. I do have to say I slightly favor a numerical because even at some point I'll show you the difference.

329
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:04,570
It just reads a lot cleaner and easier for people because sometimes people get lost in a paragraph,

330
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,810
but they say, okay, I just did step two, I need to now do step three.

331
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,040
So for a beginner cook who's learning to cook with the recipe at like.

332
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:19,640
Easier to do it numerically. The other thing that I wanted to comment on was efficient use of ingredients.

333
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:28,940
So once again, if you have a recipe that calls for a portion of a can in your modifications or variations,

334
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,970
what could you suggest to the reader to do with the rest of it?

335
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:37,490
How would you store it? Or can you just make the recipe with the whole pan?

336
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:43,040
And then in your in your comments or your notes say, these are your this is your lunch for the week,

337
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:52,249
or you could freeze this and this is your dinner next week. So those are things that you want to do, a few of you, but not all of you.

338
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,120
And I didn't take any points off where it indicated that you washed your produce.

339
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,910
That's really great. So whenever you're using produce, especially produce from a farmer's market,

340
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,840
depending upon how it's delivered to you want to make sure that you wash it in advance.

341
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:11,030
Other things to think about with produce is if you're using a potato appealing or do not feel it.

342
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,250
People people with basic knowledge don't know what they need to do with that.

343
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:22,820
You can have the assumption that people would have a peeler because that would be one of the more basic ingredients.

344
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,380
Check your nutrition facts like for this next assignment.

345
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:36,080
If you're working in a group or two or three of each one of you, run that through a different online tool and see how they compare and contrast.

346
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:45,500
If you can't find a particular ingredient in the tool that you're using, think to yourself What is really close to this?

347
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:57,410
James Okay. If I use your example with the pork. So, so the idea came to me and said that he from your experience of seeing things that they didn't,

348
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,890
however you often notice that they had to work and people that had to do with that, right?

349
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,080
It was a really good idea to develop a recipe of using, you know,

350
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,510
can make because sometimes people just don't know what to do with it if it's not to enough.

351
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:19,770
But unfortunately, in a lot of the databases, you can't find the 24 out of of poor work in there and have any nutrient analysis.

352
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,479
So we have a conversation about what you could like.

353
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,210
If you're using half of that and it's 12 ounces,

354
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:35,090
just find like a pork tenderloin or some other like formless piece of pork that you could substitute in there and get as close as possible.

355
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:39,260
So but you're definitely going to have things that are great to find,

356
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,900
things that are amazing blue covered or other foods naturally that are underutilized.

357
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:53,090
That's what we want to do is trying to develop recipes. Are people feel comfortable because anybody any revelations from going to for those

358
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,480
of you that went to the farm market or those of you that went to a food pantry.

359
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:03,660
Was it a new experience for you? I know, yes.

360
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:11,900
And I find I find grating. Yeah, I find that finding ingredients is available to us.

361
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:16,750
And that's the first thing is to make sure it's available.

362
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:22,089
Yes. Some of you actually had like notations. All of these were, you know, stamp eligible or what that was about.

363
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:29,260
And that's really helpful on there to some of you utilized the concept of double up food books like you can go and you can purchase this,

364
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:35,889
but you could double it up and you would have more. So. Oh,

365
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:41,080
the last thing that I want to say is to avoid using name brands unless you're working for like

366
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,490
McCormick Spice Company or Del Monte and you have to because you're getting paid for them.

367
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:50,730
It can be confusing to the reader because they may be at their local grocery store, not be able to find that.

368
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,110
So just like there were some minor point deductions for the app.

369
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,110
Okay. Great. I think we're good with that. All right.

370
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:05,090
Let's jump into talking about. Okay.

371
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:11,900
Well, I'm going to talk until about 11 and then we're going to take a break and then

372
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:16,879
we will see what time we have and how far we got and what we need to cover.

373
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:27,530
So. Okay, so this is my just my little slide that has a variety of grains and seeds on it.

374
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:33,050
And just to make sure that we're all on the same page in terms of our basic knowledge,

375
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:41,870
there are some grains on here that are not gluten free and there are some that are gluten free.

376
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:47,660
So. Hold Bali. What's that?

377
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:52,500
Does it contain gluten? I'm saying yes. Yeah.

378
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,620
Barley in any form will contain gluten. Barley is tremendously underutilized.

379
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:02,030
Whole grain, I would say. People fear barley unless it's in soup.

380
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:06,950
I'm going to advocate that barley should be utilized more it though.

381
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:11,419
We will talk a little bit more about it as it is, depending upon the way you purchase it.

382
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:16,159
It's not always a whole grain because most people are purchasing pearled barley.

383
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:23,960
And we'll talk about that quinoa. Gluten free, probably one of the most ubiquitous gluten free grains that are out there.

384
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,180
Whether or not that's good or bad in terms of can we grow enough for the people

385
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,020
that demanded it and what does that mean for where it's growing naturally?

386
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:42,740
So. But the benefits of being gluten free, fairly high in protein and, you know, one of those great kind of more accessible form for grains, miller.

387
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:48,790
Lovely. Who's ever cooked with millet before the food.

388
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:55,100
Okay. So generally it's one of those gluten free grains that people don't cook with very often.

389
00:37:55,550 --> 00:38:01,970
It's mostly associated with birdseed because actually if you do not, honestly, if you buy it, if you buy birdseed,

390
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:07,130
you'll see it's a cheap filler into birdseed because it's less expensive than like sunflower seeds.

391
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,310
And so you tend to most birds have a lot of it.

392
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:19,070
We in the United States don't consume a lot of millet, but it has actually in countries where it's grown, it is consumed wholegrain rye.

393
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:31,009
Rye has that right. So we talk about rye rice, probably second to wheat in terms of the the flour that is actually used for bread making.

394
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:33,979
That would actually be really kind of exciting experiment.

395
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:39,860
If you can get your hands on some rye bread to make some rye or some pumpernickel, talk about that brown rice.

396
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,340
Any type of rice. Yeah, gluten free.

397
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:48,140
Again, careful in terms of the way that it's processed. Not all whole grains.

398
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,760
And we'll talk about the specifics of that and then buckwheat gluten free.

399
00:38:53,090 --> 00:39:00,140
Yeah, and that is really confusing for consumers because how could something that's gluten free actually have the word wheat in it?

400
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:04,910
So it's really important that you talk about that, you blog about it,

401
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:11,409
you write about it, you confirm especially in people that have celiac that is okay.

402
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:17,510
And there's lots of different forms of buckwheat out there in terms of I have actually whole buckwheat here.

403
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:21,709
We we have buckwheat that's been slightly processed and chopped.

404
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:27,800
There's buckwheat flour. So there's a lot of buckwheat available. So a couple of facts here.

405
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:34,670
So the average American eats less than one serving of whole grains per day and the majority don't eat any.

406
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:41,920
Why? You remember the old kind of like the old pyramid, the old my plate make half your grains whole.

407
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:49,780
That's not something that most people are doing something about. The average American is less than one per day of a whole grain.

408
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,960
And the majority of Americans don't eat any.

409
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,500
When we kind of look at these whole grains that are here, like, what do you think some of the obstacles are?

410
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:04,000
And what can we do in the field in nutrition type with our recipe development to change that.

411
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:08,889
Yes. Trying to cut time to cook. Yeah, there there is.

412
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:18,400
But, you know, for those of you that have cooked Penola before, you know, like 12 minutes for some pasta, quinoa, 12 to 15 minutes.

413
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,820
Maybe that's not necessarily true. Yes.

414
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:28,570
Somebody else had their hand up over here. Yeah. I feel like a few of these grains are only found at specialty stores.

415
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,060
Absolutely. Absolutely.

416
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:40,690
Not only at specialty stores, but sometimes like here by the ground milk, not really known as a discount supplier of some of these grades.

417
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:43,630
They tend to be found more in like you you did.

418
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:51,520
I realize that actually the Kroger on my side of town completely eliminated its section of like organic foods that have more of these grains,

419
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,900
and they integrated them into everything. So they're really hard to find, even more so now.

420
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,430
And there are unfortunately,

421
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:03,730
grocery stores put things they want you to find at this level and things they don't want you to find at a lower or higher level.

422
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:11,860
So, yeah, accessibility and cost in some ways going and telling people though, although with COVID,

423
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:19,329
unfortunately a lot of the bulk ways that we would actually eat some of these are or source some of these are unavailable because they don't want,

424
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:24,980
you know, the shared sense. But that would be one way my kitchen has the primal pantry master.

425
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,070
Things are bulk because they're not. Yes.

426
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:35,610
So that is also another problem, because there's nothing more disgusting than seeing a moth or a worm crawling around in your product.

427
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:41,620
Anything else? Cost, being unfamiliar, cooking time.

428
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:47,770
Yeah, I think that we covered all of that. Another fact for you.

429
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:52,190
So this has been proven in lots of different evidence based research.

430
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:57,010
Whole grain consumption is definitely associated with reduced risk of stroke.

431
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,030
So some of the research indicates 30 to 36% on that.

432
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:10,660
A reduced risk of type two diabetes, reduced risk of heart disease, certain inflammatory diseases, some gum diseases and colorectal cancer.

433
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:20,440
Sorry, I'm foggy up here. I say this because there's definitely trends in diets and there's an ongoing trend in the keto diet.

434
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:26,560
And with the growing trend in the keto diet, often whole grains are stigmatized and eliminated.

435
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,890
So just want to make sure that we're all on the same page as to where the research is in terms of grain consumption.

436
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:41,980
And then one more kind of statistics on that. If consumers were to just make one half of their grains whole, as the recommendations are,

437
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:48,309
all grains would also increase the substantially the percentage of various different new key nutrients,

438
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:56,150
such as dietary fiber, where we get most of it from whole grains and produce iron, folate, magnesium and vitamin K.

439
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:59,970
So just kind of some facts to chew on there. Okay.

440
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:06,940
Let's just move on to cereal grain. So in general, cereal grains are these are seeds in the grass family.

441
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:14,950
So they're most important in the world because for most of the world,

442
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:21,840
they're the primary food source and they will provide about 90% of calories for when we're talking across the world.

443
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:26,499
Now, we're not talking about the United States where we have a lot of processed foods, but across the world,

444
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,639
50% of the protein is consumed from cereal grains or some form of grain or pseudo

445
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:36,770
cereals and 90% of calories in the grass family where cereal grains are a powder,

446
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:47,080
kind of there's 8000 different grasses. But basically we only consume the what do I have like six that are listed here on any type of regular basis.

447
00:43:47,130 --> 00:44:01,810
So. So we do consume our whole grains directly in flours and grains and starches and oils and then indirectly through animal feed.

448
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,710
So when we talk specifically about some of the grains in the next few minutes,

449
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,320
most of the grains that we grow don't necessarily go directly into our body.

450
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:18,610
So we think about the corn crop. So this time of year, when you think of corn, what do you what do you think of GMO,

451
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:27,820
GMO and thinking about more in terms of like corn Kraft or what you might eat or corn on the cob, right?

452
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,180
Yeah. Yeah. Sweet corn. So sweet corn this time of year.

453
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:37,660
But the corn crop that actually grows across the world, only 5% of that is actually sweet corn.

454
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:44,470
Other corn goes into things like the corn oil that we use ethanol free for animals.

455
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:49,300
So that kind of indirect ingestion that we have. So just keep that in mind.

456
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,880
90% of the world's grains are actually wheat, rice and corn.

457
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:59,560
That shouldn't be surprising to you. You know, when you think about geographically where these things are grown.

458
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:08,080
And the other thing to think about is like people across the world consume the grains that grow well in the region that they have.

459
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:13,780
Majority of rice is actually grown in Asia because of actually the wet climate.

460
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:16,989
And rice can be grown in two different ways.

461
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:23,290
It can be grown in low lands where areas can be flooded and it can be grown in high lands where there's more naturally occurring grain.

462
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,709
There are some grains that are really hardy and they can grow in any type of temperature.

463
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:33,820
And the example that our climate, the example that I give for that is barley.

464
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:39,759
So barley can be grown in subarctic areas and it can also be grown in like rainforest area.

465
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,339
So it's just a hardy crop that can grow anywhere. And then moving on to cereal, pseudo cereals.

466
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:52,690
So pseudo cereals are many of the gluten free seeds that we mentioned earlier that will be part of the gluten free grain project.

467
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,540
And pseudo cereals are non grasses, so they're used like cereals.

468
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:07,839
They can be converted also into flour. One thing to keep in mind as we talk a little bit more about starch and flowers, for the sake of this class,

469
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:14,680
we're gonna really focus on wheat because wheat is primarily used in most basic products and is the primary grain that we use in the United States.

470
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:22,720
But anything that contains starch in it, starch in any form can be used as a flour.

471
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:27,999
So that's why something like I have the chickpea rice here because chickpeas can be ground.

472
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,250
Any types of rooms, any types of nuts, they have small amounts of starch in them,

473
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:37,060
other types of pseudo cereals that have starter and all different types of grain.

474
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:39,600
So we're going to be. Thinking about in terms of weight.

475
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:49,770
But keep in mind that starch is present in things like roots, like pasta and tapioca, and those are utilized in our diet in a variety of ways.

476
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,359
So this is just kind of because we're all nutrition students and we talk about

477
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,829
the nutrition facts label and we think about serving sizes that came across in

478
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:05,530
that last assignment that we have is that we just the point of the slide is just

479
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:10,480
to show you that one cup of each of these grains is not all created equally,

480
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,810
and so much of it depends upon the way that it's processed.

481
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:21,700
And the processing will definitely impact the amount of fiber that's in it and can also impact some of

482
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:27,370
the other macronutrients and specifically impact some of the vitamins and minerals that are present.

483
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,040
So this is just kind of a side by side comparison.

484
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:38,110
But in general, a cup of cooked cereals, roughly 160 calories, roughly 30 grams of carbohydrates and about six grams of protein.

485
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:45,850
We we know and I'm sure that you learned in 630, but just as a reminder,

486
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:53,050
in most of these grains are incomplete sources of protein because they lack one specific amino acid.

487
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,900
Who can pull that out of the cobwebs of your brain of 632 metabolic amino acids they lack.

488
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:06,010
It begins with an al saying atrocities.

489
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:17,510
Right? So we care about this because legumes actually lack the particular amino acid which begins with an AM Matthias.

490
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:22,609
Right. Right. So that's how it makes that perfect pair of complementary proteins.

491
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:28,900
So just keep that in mind. I say that because we also mentioned pseudo cereals and pseudo cereals are really unique

492
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:34,870
in that they actually have higher amounts of lysine in them and lysine is present.

493
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:42,940
So some pseudo cereals are completely considered complete proteins because they have the full complement of essential amino acids in them.

494
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:48,999
So when you start paring things and making recipes, you just kind of keep that in mind.

495
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,210
If you're looking to create something for a vegan or vegetarian crowd where you want to have a complete protein.

496
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:02,840
We're going to talk a lot some this week and that also when we're talking more about flowers

497
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:08,630
and what we process out of the whole grains and how that impacts the final nutrition facts.

498
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:12,330
Any questions here? Okay.

499
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:24,750
So although you may already know this, consumers are incredibly confused about what actually is classified as a whole grain.

500
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,310
In order for something to be classified as a whole grain.

501
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:34,080
And when you look at labels and you see the very first and great ingredient is not wheat flour,

502
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:37,560
because we know that that could be wheat flour, but it actually says a whole grain.

503
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:44,100
In order for it to truly be a whole grain, it has to have an intact brand, an intact and just permanent, intact germ.

504
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:52,080
Either there's something else that's on a a kernel of wheat or a seed of some kind.

505
00:49:52,080 --> 00:50:00,239
And they all also have a hold on them that's referred to sometimes it's called a hole or a husk in the first part of the processing.

506
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,570
And I'll show you the processing that's actually removed.

507
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:09,450
Anybody know what's done with that? The holes in the house that are removed as a first step of processing a whole grain.

508
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:20,560
Usually has like kind of two chains where it goes to want it to go to the animal feed and be fed to the animal or commonly in the human market.

509
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:28,740
It's actually gone is making fiber supplements. So a lot of those husks and holes go directly into some of the fiber supplements that we consume.

510
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:36,510
I am. Let's see. So we talked to our already about exclusion, such as being pearled barley and quinoa.

511
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:44,819
And the reason why I say those can be exclusions, it just depends upon how you purchase it is because in those particular products,

512
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,910
what they actually do is they scrub them or they polish them.

513
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,839
Curling is another word for polishing them. And when that happens,

514
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:59,069
although you might be presented with something that looks like a whole grain in a pearl barley and actually has the brand scrubbed away from it.

515
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:02,610
And so it doesn't meet that criteria of having all three of those components.

516
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:06,960
So it wouldn't be a whole grain if you or you have consumers that are looking for them.

517
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:12,209
So the word colonel and I do have some show and tell here.

518
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:19,770
I'll pass these around. The word colonel is also synonymous with other words that you might see on the market.

519
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:27,060
And Colonel is also synonymous for growth.

520
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:35,700
You may see it listed as a growth, and you also might see it as a very you probably have seen wheat berries, you've probably seen sparrow.

521
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:39,690
Both contain gluten, but have become actually more popular.

522
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:49,200
And they're all whole grains. So this is what, you know, the whole grain kernel looks like referred to as the growth, the kernel for the generation.

523
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,100
And then in the processing, when I show you, you'll see where this comes off.

524
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:57,420
The various different steps in the multistep process of processing these grains

525
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:02,190
actually extract things like the brand which can be sold separately and packaged,

526
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:06,870
and you will see that on the market and that also the germ which would then be sold separately,

527
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,909
I would say like within the last 20 years it's become less popular because people are looking for whole grains,

528
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,400
whatever ends up looking for components of whole grains.

529
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:22,320
But this once opened needs to be actually stored in the refrigerator because it takes that compound and the standard becomes rancid.

530
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:26,610
And then there are other ways like this is an example of over here.

531
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:31,889
And so basically what this means is the wheat is cracked and then it's parboiled.

532
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:38,700
And that's right. So it really depends upon where it is in the process of whether or not this has the brand intact.

533
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,610
And then also and then you can look at these during the break.

534
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:46,380
The other thing that I have here, because when we talk about the different types of wheat is semolina.

535
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:51,510
Anybody know what semolina is used for? Primarily just pasta, right?

536
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:56,250
So the color of it, the type of actually wheat and when it's grown,

537
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:02,930
the pigmentation in it and the high protein content all make it really acceptable for making that.

538
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:09,210
We'll talk more about that. Okay. I will share the slide with you, too.

539
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:16,649
And I think what's important to know is that the processing of these wheat really eliminates a lot of the nutrients.

540
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:24,180
So just by weight, we know that most of the kernel is endosperm and most endosperm is processed into white flour.

541
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:27,989
So about 83% of it is endosperm and it contains protein.

542
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:34,530
The carbs of starches that we're talked about, iron and small amounts of B vitamins and some of the soluble fiber.

543
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:41,190
So I've talked a lot actually about the brand, and the brand is about 14% of that kernel.

544
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:49,740
And when we take that off by polishing it, in the case of things like quinoa or sometimes rinsing and scrubbing it,

545
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,440
then we're actually taking off minerals such as iron, copper and can back.

546
00:53:54,450 --> 00:54:01,170
NASIR It also contains insoluble fiber, lots of antioxidants and also phytochemicals that you remove.

547
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:07,920
And then by weight, about 3% is the germ. The other word for the germ kind of in the technical terms is the embryo.

548
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:13,860
So and it contains, like I mentioned, the fat B vitamins, trace minerals and also vitamin E.

549
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:20,160
Any questions there about that? Okay.

550
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:29,090
Let's take a break and then we'll get into improving that nutritive value with just a little bit of review of enrichment or mean I did for you.

551
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:36,390
So what I would like you guys to do during the break, just before you leave, is to grab your grain, okay.

552
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:40,620
And with your find your partner. If you don't already know who your partner is,

553
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:46,020
you want to take your gluten free grain so that you have this to think about what recipe you want to be making.

554
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:50,460
The groups are actually linked in the gluten free grain assignment.

555
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:56,010
I actually will link the spreadsheet there. So everybody hopefully has partners in there.

556
00:54:56,550 --> 00:55:05,970
The other thing that I want you to do, I harvested to make all of this which I learned and you guys can take this.

557
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:11,850
So so I think I promised some of you last week that I was going to go and do a big harvest.

558
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:18,540
I had some small zipper bags that you can help yourself.

559
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:26,220
I did bring some of the heirloom varieties. This little beauty, when you actually slice it, it's kind of black on the inside.

560
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,790
Really delicious. I wish I had one for everybody, but this is the last one.

561
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:34,710
I got it. And then I just grab some other ones that were still on the line here.

562
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:42,510
But it mostly is composed of some of the small cherry tomatoes that were ready to be picked for I all organic,

563
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:46,229
no pesticides, but I have a lot of these, so they kind of have a little bit of dirt.

564
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:50,010
And so I want pop them in your mouth unless you want to increase your microbiome.

565
00:55:51,240 --> 00:56:03,930
Yeah. So go for it and take that. Let me know if you have questions and I will start back at Eleven's meds a little bit

566
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:19,050
more or less attractive packages to Europe like the smart enough for me to work on time.

567
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:23,690
Yeah. Yeah. It's funny, you know, blasted the other day.

568
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:36,020
I know you should right now I know like I won't go to the grocery stores like I have been packages of red lines and laughing.

569
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:44,400
Combine them all and I guess I can't do the black.

570
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:57,230
Yes, yes, that's right.

571
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:27,149
You are Alison chickpea rice and I've never done anything like writing about

572
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:35,870
Amaranth are I mean I feel like we both before so like yeah that's kind of like,

573
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:46,860
yeah, I think I was like, wow, you wonder what you want to do.

574
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,790
You just have to focus everybody.

575
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:57,300
I'm sorry. Woman Oh, yeah, sure.

576
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:10,610
I know that if you guys have questions, I do either on the part.

577
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:31,390
I, you know, I would like to read the book rationally by humans, right?

578
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:39,280
Just like you.

579
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:44,720
Like, you know what you're like.

580
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,840
You said yes.

581
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:57,900
Well, it would be really challenging because I'm not sure I want to try at home.

582
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:12,030
I don't know. I was like already on his behalf as well.

583
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:30,860
When I had to writer, I would. You guys can feel like it is okay to do some research is like giving us where

584
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:35,209
we are that usually how is it used and how can you make it into something?

585
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:48,020
That's one thing I want to welcome also.

586
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:53,170
Guys, if you probably get up here is something you want is not here, let me know because I probably have more.

587
00:59:53,180 --> 01:00:01,999
But you know what I'm going to do?

588
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,300
I'm going to move over here.

589
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:14,660
I know that, to be honest with you.

590
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:28,340
And you already know how you look.

591
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:32,360
Great. It's. I don't know.

592
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:36,060
I can't tell you much.

593
01:00:38,630 --> 01:01:09,750
I can't tell you. You're just like, you know, I think there is any type of process.

594
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:31,700
And sometimes they know that they care about, you know,

595
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:51,410
growing and ready for younger than I really have a matter of time until like it's not what

596
01:01:51,430 --> 01:02:26,290
you know guys but I have something to tell you I love what do like this all the time?

597
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:40,129
I was like I was really old and I was trying to find out.

598
01:02:40,130 --> 01:03:02,370
Most parents like, okay, so that's how I was always my first one.

599
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:27,960
I never I never knew that I wanted to do this year.

600
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:31,340
I just listen to them. I just listen to the ones that you have available.

601
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:39,530
I want you to put it in my family, trust me.

602
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:40,400
But it's not.

603
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:52,610
Actually, I have a can of harmony where I was able to access a reservation, which is like before it's made into like yeah, in about an hour.

604
01:03:53,060 --> 01:04:02,780
So I don't, I didn't have any money, but not many opportunities for you if you were thinking of doing it.

605
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:08,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

606
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:15,020
You know, um, culturally, like in the Midwest, you know, that, you know, it's much more like.

607
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:22,850
Closer to home in Texas and the Mexico border. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

608
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:34,430
And also, you know, when I talk about that a lot about the fact that, you know, I really got up there.

609
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:38,090
Yeah, I don't know. I heard something else lately. Unfamiliar.

610
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:43,430
I felt like. So if that is something that you like, you have a lot of family I want you to like, right?

611
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:49,840
The barriers and things that you're familiar or maybe incorporated change something like that.

612
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:56,090
That's okay. I'm never gonna know.

613
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:01,910
So why would anyone say, what are you guys building?

614
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:08,989
You're fine. Tomorrow. Tomorrow? Okay. I'll see if I can grab it tonight.

615
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:13,780
I mean, really. So if I can definitely have it by Monday in my office.

616
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:19,870
Unless you're planning on this weekend. The other option is together.

617
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:26,930
Okay. Okay, so let's play. If I don't hear from you, I'll pick it up and make sure it's an honor society.

618
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:31,220
Are you here for class? Oh, yeah, that's what I hear.

619
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:35,200
Okay, I'll put it in your. Okay.

620
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,920
All right. If you only.

621
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:42,690
Okay, I'll make sure. Yeah, okay. I just don't want to do it.

622
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:58,250
I it. All right. Thanks for letting me know that right now I am here to figure out why you have me out.

623
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:18,700
I my mom. Well, you know, I not really, really like right now.

624
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:27,070
I don't know. I want to bring her down.

625
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:36,620
Okay, guys, I do not want to take these tomatoes back with me today.

626
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:41,390
At some point, you take the big tomato.

627
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:59,330
I mean, I think this is a great deal.

628
01:06:59,330 --> 01:07:04,880
It's just like, yeah, oh, yeah.

629
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:13,100
I think once we get that done, you guys are going to have at least a little more breakout time.

630
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:27,140
You can come out later. You are still going to be the average person or whatever.

631
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:32,959
Exactly. So I am this is a good question that everybody might want to hear the answer to.

632
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,730
And I think it also reflects the some of the earlier conversations that we had lots of ingredients,

633
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:46,280
all the recipes all throughout this one doesn't have specific to the intended population so dramatically.

634
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:57,680
If you believe that people have celiac disease, obviously they would all have different and all about access to food.

635
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:02,090
So I would just keep it as cost friendly as possible.

636
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:09,510
And it would be your choice if you want to use something that quite possibly that you have already in your house or the person.

637
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:16,490
I wish I had something more special than me.

638
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:25,100
Yeah. Yeah. So again, I get to that question a lot and then there's also the issue of accessibility.

639
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:32,810
And depending upon where you are in the community having access to the same like grocery store,

640
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:44,930
that is, make sure or somebody pointed out that this was view only this gluten free recipe.

641
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:47,990
So I just wanted to let you know that now you can't edit it.

642
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:53,749
And what I would just like you to do is whatever your selected grain is to put it next to your group so

643
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:58,700
that I know what we have and make sure that there's a good distribution of all the different grains,

644
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,650
and I'll plan that out for the PowerPoint.

645
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:09,169
There's also a link, and I know it's really early since you're not presenting till October 12th, but if you want to have the PowerPoint ready,

646
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:14,150
just throw it into that link there and then I will consolidate all of them into one PowerPoint.

647
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:21,820
So there are basically two different dates for this. The actual recipe is due at midnight two weeks from today, which is on the fifth.

648
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:25,840
But you won't be making the PowerPoint presentation until the 12th.

649
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:30,830
Okay. Does that make sense? Okay.

650
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:34,270
I just I'm just going to see what we have left here.

651
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,470
So we have one millet. So somebody has millet both. Right.

652
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:47,889
That's kind of good that nobody to clean up. We have the corn grits, so it looks like we have a nice distribution of a variety of products.

653
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:53,050
And if you are somebody that has one of the flowers and you'd like to complement it with buckwheat flour.

654
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:57,050
Got me. No. Okay.

655
01:09:57,910 --> 01:10:05,210
Let's go back to. So here you really are.

656
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:11,870
Okay. So enrichment and fortification shouldn't be something that's particularly new for you,

657
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:15,230
because I'm hoping that you've covered this at some point last year.

658
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:19,810
I don't know whether or not it was part of assessment or if it was part of 630.

659
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:23,330
Jog My Memories is something that you guys have been taught in the past.

660
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:29,870
Yes. Yes. Okay. All right. So I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on it, but it's so important.

661
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:34,999
And it's particularly important when we're talking about grains. Another thing that if I don't have that link,

662
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,500
I will link it for you as a wonderful gastropub episode that talks about kind of the

663
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:46,190
history of white breads versus whole grain breads versus a shift back to artisanal

664
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:52,759
breads that talks about issues of race and why white breads became important during

665
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:58,610
times when we had more immigrants and other things about cost and accessibility,

666
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:06,590
and also has some really interesting facts about, you know, one reason why a lot of people won't choose artisanal breads,

667
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:11,480
especially if they're artisanal breads that are taken to food pantries because they're not sliced.

668
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,680
You know, the advent of slicing bread came apart in the early 20th century,

669
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:23,329
and that all of a sudden became made bread much more accessible, something as simple as packaging bread and safety.

670
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:27,170
And when you think about for those of you that might have read the Upton Sinclair book, the jump ball,

671
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:32,629
when we talk about like food processing, you know, people wanted their their bread packaged.

672
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:36,980
So like in 1908, cellophane, which is ubiquitous now,

673
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:42,230
cellophane was invented that allowed bread to kind of be packaged in a way that it could be distributed.

674
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:46,220
So great history there and great commentary.

675
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:56,030
I mean, some of this discussion about whole grain versus white goes back to like philosophers times and like Plato actually posed the question,

676
01:11:56,030 --> 01:12:00,530
if we were to build a utopian society, what would we see?

677
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:07,339
How would that utopian society be fed white bread or would they be set on brown bread?

678
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:10,120
And what are the advantage and what do we think about when we do that?

679
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:16,670
So I always find like it's like in the United States, kind of my commentary on this is joke.

680
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:23,290
It's just like fascinating and also sad in some ways in that we have what I just described.

681
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:28,490
You have these beautiful wheat berries and these groats that we call that are complete whole grains.

682
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,870
And then basically we process them and we take out all all of the goodness.

683
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:40,849
And then at some point, you know, flash forward, we learn like, oh, my gosh, we're in the middle of a war or in World War Two.

684
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:46,909
And we need to start enlisting young people, young men mostly to go to war.

685
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:51,860
And they're in really poor health and they're in poor health for a variety of reasons.

686
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:56,479
They're actually just coming out of the Depression, but they also have been fed white bread.

687
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,520
You know, that all of a sudden was like the end all and the be all.

688
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:07,790
And we thought that was great because we as Americans started getting away from brown breads because those were interest

689
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:15,860
linked associated with immigration and perhaps like people that some people in the United States don't associate with.

690
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:23,659
And it just comes with a long history. This this podcast also talks up, speaks a lot to eugenics and other things that are really disturbing.

691
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:28,370
So I would I would I would have you listen to it because from a food standpoint, it's really important.

692
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:35,150
So right around in 1941, the United States passed the enrichment act because they saw all these young

693
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:38,660
men that were actually malnourished that were coming to enlist in the Army.

694
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,540
We know that at that time,

695
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:49,940
white bread were consumed more than brown bread and people were missing the nutrients that are added back as part of the enrichment act.

696
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:58,400
So the original enrichment occurred in I believe it was 1942 because 1941, I think historically was the draft.

697
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:10,520
So and then the enrichment act, as you know, for those of you that have taken maternal and child nutrition, was actually expanded in 1998.

698
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:16,970
And because of the birth defects that we saw, because of a deficiency of folic acid, folic acid was added then.

699
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:24,079
So just so that you know that per pound of flour and primarily again,

700
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:32,660
we're referring to just wheat flour here because most flour that sold and consumed in the United States is wheat that's been ground into flour.

701
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,660
These are the requirements of what is added to it.

702
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:41,330
This is important in terms of when you're thinking also about your population and recipe development,

703
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:45,440
because if you are using, you have to look at the packaging of it.

704
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:49,550
It is not mandatory that the flowers be enriched.

705
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:55,780
So if you are using one of these gluten free flour, they may not be enriched and you may think,

706
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:58,939
you know what, I'm using a whole grain or a whole seed.

707
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:04,100
But if they've been around and something's been removed, you might not have the same vitamin and mineral content.

708
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:10,909
So enrichment is different than fortification in that fortification is adding

709
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:16,940
back in adding nutrients in that were never present in that particular food.

710
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:20,990
So obviously we mill something, we take away the brand and the germ.

711
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:25,910
Then we had a back in because they were naturally. And that's where we get these calculations from.

712
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:33,530
Fortification is different. So fortification is usually a public health response to a deficiency that we have

713
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:39,470
in a particular nutrient that we would like to see increased in the population,

714
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:50,390
in a food that is regularly consumed, in a food where when we add that nutrient back to it, it doesn't interfere with any other nutrients.

715
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:52,880
It's acceptable in that nutrient.

716
01:15:53,240 --> 01:16:05,810
And the other thing to point out is there is no mandatory USA fortification of any food enrichment is mandatory for flours for the wheat flour.

717
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:15,350
But fortification is not mandatory. The very first food that we fortified anybody remember perhaps what you had learned

718
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:20,150
in a previous class of what was the first food that we fortified when and why?

719
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:24,410
Yes, we're like flour with that is.

720
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:29,960
No, that would have been enrichment. Oh sorry. Yeah. It was a table top.

721
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:42,260
Yeah. Yeah, it was table salt. Yeah. And we fortified it with iodine because there was a preponderance of disease episodes on the goiter.

722
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:50,170
Goiter. Right. Which is a thyroid disease. And also it's also associated with a decreased brain development too.

723
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:55,489
So yeah. So there are some parts of the United States that have really low iodine content.

724
01:16:55,490 --> 01:17:00,770
So we probably drink a whole lot. I mean, we probably consume a lot more salt than what we need to.

725
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:07,530
Hence we have recommendations for it. So most table salt is now fortified with iodine.

726
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:12,650
There are definitely communities, though, across the United States that are like, don't mess with my table salt.

727
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:14,600
I don't want you putting iodine in.

728
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:23,630
It's kind of similar conversations that have gone out over time with fluoride too, so in Florida for fortification of water.

729
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:32,030
But again, if we're thinking about it from recipe development recommendations, depending upon the audience that you're working with,

730
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:38,780
there are lots of salts that actually are not iodized and those would be like kind of more of the specialty salt.

731
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:45,919
So there's been a preponderance of like sea salt and fancy sea salts that are available, not all kosher salt or iodized.

732
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,100
So think about the population that you're working with.

733
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:54,200
We don't see goiter hardly any more in the United States because nine is present.

734
01:17:55,220 --> 01:18:00,320
I haven't. It can also be problematic in some of the vegan communities also.

735
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,790
So other sources of iodine that you can get in the diet are seafood products.

736
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:10,279
So like kelp and algae, things that come from the sea do often have some iodide in them too.

737
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:16,130
So just keep that in mind. And then in the public health world, we also talk about bio fortification.

738
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:24,620
Anybody have any thoughts on what I mean by that? It hasn't received as much press as it did probably 20, 25 years ago.

739
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:27,230
There's a lot of like political reasons why not.

740
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:34,610
But Dr. Jones, if you've taken any of his classes, probably talks about this and crop fortification and bio fortification.

741
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:41,380
Any thoughts? As they related to soils or anything?

742
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:51,309
Well, it's in some ways it is, but it's also it's really related to finding areas around the world that have deficiencies in particular nutrients,

743
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:55,390
population wide, and then modifying the crop.

744
01:18:55,510 --> 01:19:00,730
So one would use crop modification. It can be considered a GMO.

745
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:04,540
Modifying the crop to contain the nutrient that's missing.

746
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:07,720
The best example of this is golden rice.

747
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:15,969
So you've probably heard of golden rice being fortified with vitamin A in areas that had more blindness and I concerns.

748
01:19:15,970 --> 01:19:23,110
And so there have been crop modifications. There's also been zinc modification in certain different crops.

749
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:25,959
Let's see, I have some other examples here.

750
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:36,850
So vitamin A, oranges, sweet potatoes, iron being infused into being perhaps iron and pearl millet in countries that actually consume millet,

751
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:46,630
vitamin A and yellow cassava, vitamin A in orange maize, the zinc and rice and zinc and wheat.

752
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:50,560
So some of those are some of the bio fortification that are currently occurring.

753
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:53,020
I have a couple of links here.

754
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:59,190
Hopefully they're not broken and working well for you about salt ionization and some other things about enrichment and fortification.

755
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:04,470
The next topic that I want to spend a little bit of time on was talking about fighting acid.

756
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:13,009
There's some great podcasts out there. Yes. Did your question? I was just going to say the link of the last one to the bottom.

757
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:16,040
One does not. Okay. I'll make sure that that's fixed.

758
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:19,370
And when I share this again, I'll just make sure that you have that link.

759
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:24,080
So. So let's spend a little bit of time talking about fighting acid.

760
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:30,920
Is it something that anybody is familiar with? It's very trendy, like in terms of blogs and podcasts.

761
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:36,100
I think I've recommended to you and Nutrition Diva in the past, she's got a great eight minute blog and I try to get that.

762
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:41,120
That really covers like 100 different articles of evidence based research to support it.

763
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,960
I can link it in campus so that you have an opportunity to listen to it.

764
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:49,069
So from the nutrition world, when we talk about fighting acid,

765
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:55,850
you probably might have heard it referred to as an anti nutrient and that term anti nutrient is used and

766
01:20:55,850 --> 01:21:02,330
things that we ingest that perhaps bind to nutrients that we would want to have available to us from.

767
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:06,890
We talk a lot in this class about culinary uses of food as opposed to botanical use.

768
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:14,660
So botanically fighting acid is the storage form of phosphorus, and phosphorus is needed in plants to grow.

769
01:21:14,990 --> 01:21:20,780
And when plants are watered or they're planted or the soil is wet, that's how you get acid.

770
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:26,570
The phosphorus is released for fighting acid and it's actually available for the plant to grow.

771
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:35,209
So it also the reason why it kind of had this like bad rap or this bad name is being

772
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:41,900
an anti nutrient is because in the intestine it actually can bind to some minerals.

773
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:47,330
And so it's known to bind to iron, to the zinc, to bind to calcium divide.

774
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:57,080
That means magnesium and maize and most concerned people are usually with higher and then with calcium.

775
01:21:57,230 --> 01:22:00,980
So but we have a lot of culinary.

776
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:08,840
We think about it from a botanical standpoint. We have a lot of culinary practices actually that release those nutrients from that state.

777
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:14,450
So in general, it's not that much of a concern because in also in most Western worlds,

778
01:22:14,450 --> 01:22:19,849
we have a variety of foods in our diet where we're not just consuming foods that are rich and fight.

779
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:29,570
The gas and fighting acids are present in things like seeds and legumes and grains, more concentrated in legumes.

780
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,900
There are always presents present in the outer layer.

781
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:37,250
So the minute you process a grain, we're talking specifically about grains here.

782
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:44,180
The minute you process it, it's gone and it's not present. So, so much of the food that we eat is processed, so you don't have to worry about it.

783
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:51,710
Finding it also is deactivated it by enzymes when we cook it.

784
01:22:51,890 --> 01:23:00,410
So if we cook it in any way, a lot of people who have really high fighting acid diets often will soak all of their grains and their legumes.

785
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:07,820
And by the process of soaking or germinating, you also will release anything that's found and not be worried about that.

786
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:12,710
So it has actually a lot of other good components to it.

787
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:18,200
So originally it was just looked at in this kind of very broad limiting category as being an

788
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:23,360
anti nutrient because of the way it found two very important minerals that we need in our diet.

789
01:23:23,690 --> 01:23:27,709
But as it was researched more, we realized, you know what, this is really strange.

790
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:35,000
There's like a study of women who were at menopausal age who consumed really high fighting acid diets.

791
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,200
And that might be an age where you're perimenopausal, post-menopausal, that you can sweat.

792
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,850
You're really concerned about bone loss.

793
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:48,950
But in women who consumed high diets of fighting acid, it was actually determined that they didn't have the expected loss.

794
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:56,909
There could be other reasons for that, but there was this association with the high concentration of fighting acids in their diet.

795
01:23:56,910 --> 01:24:06,680
It was thought that perhaps there are certain certain mechanisms that the fighting acids like were responsible for, for improving bone density.

796
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:12,230
And one of those was actually the presence of the way that the fight acids work.

797
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,839
You might have heard of a medication called Fosamax,

798
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:22,220
and Fosamax is really given to women of post-menopausal age or perimenopausal age to prevent bone loss.

799
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:30,470
And it works directly with the osteoblasts cells in preventing that kind of bone degradation.

800
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:37,550
So it seems like fighting the acid has some similar mechanisms to drugs that are used actually to prevent bone loss.

801
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:46,880
There's also been numerous studies where it seems to have a protective effect in various different cancers and diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

802
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:50,209
So there's probably more good to fighting acids in our diet.

803
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:53,570
We know people want to fight it. Yes. It's also have more firepower, too.

804
01:24:54,110 --> 01:25:01,130
So so again, just like making sure that you don't all automatically say anti nutrient bad,

805
01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:05,620
but there's a lot of actually good that comes from this too. So more.

806
01:25:05,730 --> 01:25:14,580
Science. That's like there are four things that you would like to read. So I have listed here the major cereal grains that we talked about earlier.

807
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:22,170
For the purposes of talking about flour in the future, wheat is the one that we're going to focus on.

808
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:29,790
So so about 75% of all wheat that's grown is actually milled into flour.

809
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:38,610
The primary points that I want to make here about wheat is that we grow a lot of it in the United States,

810
01:25:38,610 --> 01:25:43,370
but only second to Russia, where most wheat is grown because of the current war there.

811
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:46,370
There's problems with the imports and exports of all kinds of products.

812
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:51,000
There's been a demand for increase increased wheat production here in the United States.

813
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:56,879
What's important to you to know is that we all of these different grains have classifications.

814
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:02,580
And since we're focusing so much on wheat, that wheat is classified in three distinct ways.

815
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:09,899
And you will see this and you'll hear a lot about it in the Zingerman's demo when they're talking about how they select their flours.

816
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:14,670
And this also is important in how you would select the flour that you would use for pasta like the semolina.

817
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:20,279
So wheat is classified by the season that it's grown, whether or not it's spring or winter wheat.

818
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:24,180
Winter wheat tends to be a little bit hardier. It's classified by the color.

819
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:29,990
So whether or not it's red or white, the red outer layer has more pigmentation in it.

820
01:26:30,030 --> 01:26:34,470
That's why it provides that color. Once you brush off the outer layer, then the color doesn't matter.

821
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:42,960
The classification by both the season and the color also indicates the protein content.

822
01:26:43,290 --> 01:26:52,230
So how we is harvested and depending upon what flour you are milling it into and the uses of that flour are really important.

823
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:56,030
You might think, I don't care about this. I'm not going to be a farmer over here with that.

824
01:26:56,370 --> 01:27:00,059
But it's really important because you have to harvest a certain type of wheat for semolina.

825
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:03,480
If you're going to make that in the food business, you have to harvest a certain type of wheat.

826
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:09,780
If you're if you're using if you're using baked goods, when you're using like pastry flours and really delicate flours,

827
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:13,770
if you're making breads and you're going to participate in the bread extra credits,

828
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:20,040
you actually want a wheat that has a lot of gluten and a lot of gluten would mean a higher protein content,

829
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:26,040
and that would probably be a harder sell, a hard to eat that's grown in the winter.

830
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:33,620
So and then the final classification is by texture or actually I said growing season,

831
01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:41,430
winter and spring color red and then kind of a milder white and then texture, which is hard or soft, hard being higher in protein.

832
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:47,580
The other thing that also the different classifications can impact the flavor of it.

833
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:52,080
A lot of people will say like a red wheat berry would have a very bitter taste to it.

834
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:58,350
So again, depending upon how it's processed, whether or not that is is is prevalent.

835
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:07,170
So there's also been a lot of talk in the wheat categories and kind of a throwback in bread making to these ancient grains that I have listed there.

836
01:28:07,530 --> 01:28:11,160
You know, from there, for the purposes of gluten free, those all contain gluten.

837
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:17,489
So don't be fooled. If you see something like think Warren or Emmer or Pharaoh spelt Bulgar,

838
01:28:17,490 --> 01:28:24,390
those are all gluten containing wheat and they're just different varieties of wheat that's grown.

839
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:28,080
Okay. The next thing that I want to talk about is corn.

840
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:38,130
I gave you the statistics already. About 5% being sweet corn and the rest being used for animal feed or for fuel or for oils, etc.

841
01:28:38,370 --> 01:28:45,480
A lot of corn is processed into corn starch, corn sirup, other ways that we sweeten and we thicken our foods.

842
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:47,160
We'll talk more about that with starch.

843
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:57,389
But for those of you, we have some side conversations about processing corn into tortillas and various different dough products.

844
01:28:57,390 --> 01:29:04,020
Corn can be really, really challenging because corn is naturally gluten free and it doesn't since it doesn't contain any

845
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:09,990
this doesn't have that same elasticity and stretch ability and the ability to kind of mold and mix.

846
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:15,020
So you need to actually go through, you know, a process.

847
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:21,030
We think about processes in terms of processing wheat and taking out the good things,

848
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:28,790
but corn is completely opposite because when we process to make it edible, we use a process that's called mixed embolization.

849
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,730
I think I have it written there because it's kind of a hard work to say and that mixed

850
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:39,090
embolization is an interesting way of processing that corn to make it better in every aspect.

851
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:41,910
It improves its ability to work with it.

852
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:50,820
And the reason why you can work with it is as we learn more about fibers and starches, it contains heavy cellulose and it contains pectin.

853
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:57,450
And you need to free the pectin in the heavy cellulose by soaking it in a particularly high based solution.

854
01:29:57,780 --> 01:30:01,290
And by freeing those, it makes it more gel like an elastic.

855
01:30:01,950 --> 01:30:05,610
It improves it in terms of flavor and color.

856
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:10,110
And Obama. We're not 100% sure why that happens.

857
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:19,239
But we think also by the process of selecting the corn in this extended lying solution that you use that it probably in terms of the aroma,

858
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:22,780
it releases some volatile compounds that were trapped before.

859
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:28,150
It provides it more with kind of what we would like. I would classify it as that corn chip flavor.

860
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:36,030
Know, if you're just smelling corn that's dry that hasn't actually been mixed, has very, very little aroma to it by.

861
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:40,570
But this process will actually free those volatile compounds and improve the taste.

862
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:53,890
And since we're all nutrition institute budding dietitians here, it also improves the bioavailability of certain minerals, most importantly, niacin.

863
01:30:54,370 --> 01:31:01,060
So if that corn were not to be processed and utilize that before it was processed, you would not have niacin available.

864
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:06,890
But the process of rinsing it, taking the corn from the field, drying it.

865
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:09,670
Whenever corn is grown in the community where it's processed.

866
01:31:10,150 --> 01:31:18,690
So first, bringing it to a boil, adding this it can be referred to as cal or a lime solution.

867
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:22,330
It's not citrus lime, it's actually limestone.

868
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:31,090
And it creates a very basic environment, a patch of about 12 and a half, and that allows for these chemical changes to occur.

869
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:35,220
So it's often soaked overnight and then released.

870
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:37,120
Remember, we talked about that whole release,

871
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:44,409
the whole and then allows all of these wonderful things to happen today in terms of the world of the microbiome.

872
01:31:44,410 --> 01:31:47,740
We talk more about this now and precision nutrition.

873
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:57,290
It actually also has more of the process of allows more resistant starch actually to be released to public.

874
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:01,630
Probably when we were doing our microbiome in precision nutrition, we thought about this too.

875
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:11,380
So and we know that that resistant starch is great fuel for our gut and not only farmed, but we also think that it improves brain health too.

876
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:19,569
So more on that in the future. I just think next to this is really, really cool and you haven't really given it a whole lot of thought,

877
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:23,080
but people have been doing it for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years,

878
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:30,680
you know, to make this crop that grows regionally wherever they live into an edible, nutritious product.

879
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:39,970
So so I'm saying that and I think the takeaway point that I want you to have is that everything that I mentioned is that processing is not always bad,

880
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:45,130
and this is an example where it's actually positive. So, yes, it is.

881
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:50,020
It is. The things that we get like from the store has been through makes.

882
01:32:51,850 --> 01:33:00,280
So just so this actually when you go through that process, you you can utilize the wet dough.

883
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:02,829
Mostly when you have the wet dough,

884
01:33:02,830 --> 01:33:10,389
it's actually processed into tortillas either in a factory or at home or in a tortilla maker in your local community immediately,

885
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:18,520
because it doesn't have a very long shelf life after that. But then there's also the product that's dried and then created into like a mass of flour.

886
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:27,760
So the muscle, yeah. So and then that, that can also be utilized in different ways and different various different recipes.

887
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:31,390
So it's yeah, okay.

888
01:33:31,450 --> 01:33:35,470
You know, I'm, I'm going to spend because I think it's important to get through more of this material

889
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:40,750
we'll do our breakouts with I have an activity that I want to do with bars here,

890
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:45,460
but we'll do that when we have our small groups over the next couple of weeks because I want to get through more of the material.

891
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:52,480
We don't we don't consume a lot of oats in the United States that our animals consume a lot of oats in the United States.

892
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:57,610
But the oats that we do consume are almost primarily all in breakfast cereals.

893
01:33:58,390 --> 01:34:07,150
So and we do have kind of an increase in the amount of oats and oatmeal and the variety of oatmeal that are available in the United States.

894
01:34:07,150 --> 01:34:11,860
So I just wanted to spend a minute talking about that and breakfast cereals in general,

895
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:18,639
because so many of these grains that we're talking about are processed and we classify them as cereals.

896
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:26,200
But in general, when we think of cereals, we think of breakfast cereals and a variety of different grains are incorporated into breakfast cereals.

897
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:36,310
But primarily we think a lot about wheat. So and cereals are kind of an invention that really only came about like the early part of the 20th century.

898
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:41,680
And prior to that there wasn't a lot of consumption of cereals and it was really out of Michigan

899
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:47,709
and Kellogg and Post and the west side of the state what they called at the time a sanatorium,

900
01:34:47,710 --> 01:34:49,690
which was really kind of a health institute,

901
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:55,120
where it was thought like if we eat this whole grains and we processed them into these cereals, we're going to become healthier.

902
01:34:55,450 --> 01:35:03,100
So like, you know, the original Kellogg's, you know, had something, you know, they weren't processing Froot Loops at that time.

903
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:05,560
They were processing whole grains and eating whole grain.

904
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:12,180
In serial and sometimes I think like the catalog in the post family would probably originators of it would roll over in

905
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:18,120
their grave when they've seen what we've done to serials in the way that we've added colors and processed them and such.

906
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:23,040
But in general is really, you know, serial brains in and of themselves.

907
01:35:23,550 --> 01:35:28,770
They're not very palatable. Right. You know, you you have to put them you have to process them in some way.

908
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:33,780
You have to turn them into something edible in order to digest them and eat them.

909
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:38,639
So the ready to eat cereals were grown out of Kellogg and Post.

910
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:42,570
I'm not going to show this video now, but in your free time, take a look.

911
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:50,820
It's a really cool process of showing you not only when we're talking about grains are process into possible grains or processed into cereal.

912
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:56,459
Most of it is processed in these really technical factories that use extrusion molds where you're

913
01:35:56,460 --> 01:36:01,020
like pushing a paste or a doll through something to get the variety of shapes that we have.

914
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:08,610
So extruding I have bolded here because it's an important term that you just need to know because we'll refer to it in pasta making also.

915
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:16,020
But all of these other processes that we think about in terms of cereal like shredding and puffing and flaking and graduating,

916
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:22,260
they all were invented in the west side of Michigan at Kellogg in post in the early parts of the 20th century.

917
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:27,600
And then we went on to add flavoring agents and sweetening and coloring agents and such.

918
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:36,870
So but, you know, I think we're also all in public health and we can't stigmatize breakfast cereals that much because we have to think about now,

919
01:36:36,870 --> 01:36:38,520
I'm going to go back to the enrichment.

920
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:45,810
You know, most of the breakfast cereals that that are, you know, people in the United States and then young children are eating are enriched.

921
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:50,849
And if the diets are overall poor and contain a lot of processed foods and may

922
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:54,989
not have as many fresh whole grains or fresh fruits and vegetables and such,

923
01:36:54,990 --> 01:37:01,140
and they are having enriched products in their breakfast meal that maybe it's not such a bad thing.

924
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:04,170
So but there are definitely compromises that we can make,

925
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:11,370
but we don't want to over stigmatize breakfast cereals in populations where that is their cereal of choice,

926
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:14,879
that is their breakfast of choice because of cost or other factors.

927
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:17,550
So I just want to keep that in mind from a public health standpoint.

928
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:23,970
So from a cookery standpoint, we know it makes it more palatable and makes it more digestible.

929
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:30,060
It softens the cellulose. I gave you. The example of the corn in there were mobilizing pectin and heavy cellulose.

930
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:33,149
And also we're going to we're going to talk in the next couple of weeks a lot

931
01:37:33,150 --> 01:37:37,809
about starch and the process of gelatinous Asian to starch in and of itself.

932
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:42,750
So if you remember at all from 630, I know you talked a lot about kind of like the digestibility of it,

933
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:47,910
but when we're using it, when we're cooking with it, it doesn't dissolve in water.

934
01:37:47,910 --> 01:37:53,100
You know, you mix cornstarch with water and you want to add it to thicken something or make good gravy.

935
01:37:53,430 --> 01:37:57,690
It's not until you actually heat it that you start swelling those starch granules.

936
01:37:57,690 --> 01:38:07,320
So we'll talk more about that. And the example that I like to give also here specifically in terms of oats is the different ways that we process oats.

937
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:13,560
And again, when we think about processing and we think about it from a standpoint that maybe sorry,

938
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:19,470
the my here for a minute when we think about, you know, the good and the bad of processing.

939
01:38:23,370 --> 01:38:28,979
We think about kind of this continuum. So I showed you what wheat berries look like if you were to look at oats.

940
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:35,370
And oak is very similar. And oak grove with look like steel cut oats that hasn't been chopped in four pieces.

941
01:38:35,370 --> 01:38:44,040
So that's kind of the way it originates. When we're consuming any types of oatmeal, it actually is not particularly shelf stable because remember,

942
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:48,120
the germ has that little bit of fat in it, so it makes it less shelf stable.

943
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:50,790
So prior to even getting steel cut oats,

944
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:57,179
which are the least processed of all oats beyond that overall is actually heat treated to actually stabilize that.

945
01:38:57,180 --> 01:39:04,709
So it's shelf stable. So then you kind of have this continuum where you would have a you would have a steel cut oats,

946
01:39:04,710 --> 01:39:08,640
which would be like, you know, an old growth that's maybe chopped into 4 to 6 pieces.

947
01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:12,150
Then you would have Scottish oats that are chopped up a little bit more.

948
01:39:12,450 --> 01:39:18,510
Then you move into old fashioned oats, which is actually been kind of steamed and pressed a little, but there's still the whole grain.

949
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:24,660
And then you would have more of like the categories of the quick bones and the instead elsewhere.

950
01:39:24,930 --> 01:39:29,940
When you get down to like the quick and instant, sometimes just a splash of hot water will actually gelatinous.

951
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:31,770
Is that to the point where it's edible?

952
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:38,280
But when you think about all of that, you know, what would you think about in terms of like the fiber content of all of those degrees?

953
01:39:38,490 --> 01:39:41,010
That's like the decreased degree of processing.

954
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:49,409
It's also a as you go down the continuum, it decreases the amount of time that you have to cook something.

955
01:39:49,410 --> 01:39:54,030
For people who are busy, it's really hard to cook steel cut oats in less than ten or 20 minutes.

956
01:39:54,900 --> 01:40:00,200
But what about fiber? What do you think it does to the fiber? Increases.

957
01:40:01,190 --> 01:40:04,280
Yeah, one would think that it dramatically decreases.

958
01:40:04,610 --> 01:40:14,990
But, you know, the reality of it is because they're all various different processes of the old growth that actually differ that much.

959
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:23,090
There's a slight like it's really like a difference of 5 to 6 grams per serving with six grams being in like the steel cut oats.

960
01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:26,570
And then as you go down to continue on like somewhere around four or five.

961
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,049
Now originally when I started teaching this huge difference,

962
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:36,020
you had to be like seven grams in a steel pipe at close to nothing in an instant or but but it's not.

963
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:42,349
So there's actually still, again, a lot of benefits depending upon the population as to the amount of fiber that you can get,

964
01:40:42,350 --> 01:40:47,389
something that's more processed in that way and perhaps actually leads to more convenience,

965
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:54,290
because if not anything, the food industry is driven by the consumer and the consumer often demands convenience.

966
01:40:54,470 --> 01:41:01,670
So we know, you know, as you're expanding your skills in nutrition and cooking, also you can do things like,

967
01:41:01,670 --> 01:41:05,510
you know, overnight somebody had a great recipe for overnight oats or you can.

968
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:12,200
So it's like decreases, you know, cooking time or you can cook those steel, cut oats and crack pots and then save them.

969
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:17,480
But those are things that we need to educate others about. Okay.

970
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:24,740
So kind of rounding out the cereal grains here, try to cow is actually something that people are not very familiar with,

971
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:31,129
although it's becoming more popular, they just have to have different ways of processing it and growing the crop.

972
01:41:31,130 --> 01:41:36,650
It's a combination of rice and wheat and there you might see some new bread varieties that are made out of it.

973
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:42,740
Rice, probably the second flour that's used, second most popular flour that's used in breads.

974
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:49,220
It tends to be used in more Eastern European breads because they grow a lot more rye because of the climate there.

975
01:41:49,970 --> 01:41:59,750
It grows really well often in Black Planet. Interesting fact also like Rye is often thought of as one of those and that obviously it contains gluten,

976
01:42:00,110 --> 01:42:04,460
but it's considered even more so than wheat to really be rough around the gut.

977
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:07,730
A lot of people have digestibility problems with rye.

978
01:42:08,090 --> 01:42:13,550
If you have ever consumed, if you've got a Zingerman's and you've had rye bread or your family, you grew up to have rye bread.

979
01:42:13,850 --> 01:42:18,050
Rye bread often has caraway seen for that. And if you've ever thought about that.

980
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:22,070
But actually, just like we put caraway seeds into things like sauerkraut,

981
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:26,540
we put caraway seeds on rye bread because there is some thought that it helps

982
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:30,799
with the digestibility there's a distinct type of rye bread called pumpernickel.

983
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:35,420
Pumpernickel is very German and origin and it is slightly different rye.

984
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:40,100
But the deeper, darker side that's often used from a sour dough starter, that's what makes it unique.

985
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:46,389
Some like, like what we do in the United States, like we kind of like to take shortcuts.

986
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:52,250
So some of our rye bread in the United States as caramel coloring in it and other additives to make it brown.

987
01:42:52,940 --> 01:43:01,099
We've talked a lot about barley and the different processing of it, and I think most people are familiar with barley and soups.

988
01:43:01,100 --> 01:43:06,709
I'm a big advocate of substituting any other grain that you're currently using with barley because of that rich,

989
01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:12,800
nutty flavor without having the presence of nuts for people that are actually allergic to a variety of nuts.

990
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:20,210
I think Pearl Barley is a nice substitute for that. When we get into fermentation, we'll also talk about the malting process for barley.

991
01:43:20,870 --> 01:43:24,230
So it's key in making beer on the malting process.

992
01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:28,220
And we'll talk a little bit more about more about the enzymes that are used there.

993
01:43:28,580 --> 01:43:34,850
And then we have the less common pseudo cereals. That's probably where I'll end for the day too, and I have those listed there.

994
01:43:35,210 --> 01:43:41,940
One thing that I always grow in my garden and notions about tomatoes does everybody know what this is?

995
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:48,759
That Cameron is Cameron? Yes. So the reason why I bring this up,

996
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:56,620
I wrote mostly for the flower because it's really pretty and I had no idea the first time I had all those would be it's like massive.

997
01:43:56,620 --> 01:43:59,590
And the stocks are like this, but it's really beautiful.

998
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:06,220
It's kind of taken on its fall look, but it also dwarfs any other plant that's underneath it because it's so large.

999
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:11,170
But what I wanted to show you there, it's kind of messy, but you see that.

1000
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:14,170
So the who has an amrit who has apple.

1001
01:44:14,170 --> 01:44:25,450
So yeah, so this is actually the this there's a bug, but these little amaranth seeds here come out of the plant here.

1002
01:44:25,450 --> 01:44:31,029
But I think what I want to show you too is like how we also have a huge a tree.

1003
01:44:31,030 --> 01:44:36,680
And that's how I want to add a huge appreciation for our food system, because can you imagine this?

1004
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:43,870
Can you imagine growing this and then harvesting it, having a sieve that's even small enough to capture it,

1005
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:49,450
washing and getting the debris as it prepares the bugs, you know, getting the bugs out of it.

1006
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:58,090
That was actually a huge reason why a lot of people did originally wanted to have flour that was unprocessed because they saw it as dirty.

1007
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:01,209
They thought like, oh, probably like some Iraqi system.

1008
01:45:01,210 --> 01:45:07,360
There are probably sticks and some twigs in there. And then there were the other associations that were made with that.

1009
01:45:07,630 --> 01:45:12,580
But, you know, I just want everybody to think like that little jar of Amyris that you have.

1010
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:16,420
The work and the labor that had to go into getting it is tremendous.

1011
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:22,930
I think we should always have a nod to the growers and all of the different products that they grow in our food.

1012
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:25,840
So I just wanted to bring that in with you.

1013
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:37,060
I don't you know that I don't actually grow it for the seeds, although I would like to just because that is just kind to me and there's a lot there.

1014
01:45:37,330 --> 01:45:47,230
So do those things were going well, you know every year I planted Amaranth once from a little plant and I've never planted it again.

1015
01:45:47,890 --> 01:45:56,980
So it's kind of like making your garden once you plant it, it keeps growing up over and over, unless it's just hardy to the winter that we have here.

1016
01:45:57,400 --> 01:46:01,580
You know, it's kind of strange, like some things they say you have to replant and take out.

1017
01:46:01,690 --> 01:46:06,350
Like I grow dahlias every year and you're supposed to winter them here in hold in your.

1018
01:46:06,490 --> 01:46:11,049
But that just grows. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1019
01:46:11,050 --> 01:46:16,090
You can definitely take it and all the bugs with it. All right.

1020
01:46:16,090 --> 01:46:19,260
So look, there's some communication about this on Zingerman's.

1021
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:24,550
I'll try to work out the logistics and the cost that nobody can make any money to get there.

1022
01:46:24,940 --> 01:46:33,150
And I'll just be a good time with you is please take some tomatoes.

1023
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:41,230
I think more time. I think I know, I know.

1024
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:45,780
I've been know I love.

1025
01:46:46,330 --> 01:46:51,360
Is it more like driving ten times better than I am.

1026
01:46:51,670 --> 01:46:55,580
I'm taking the right anything ever you say because when you put it back in.

1027
01:46:56,260 --> 01:46:59,709
Yeah. Oh no. Let me know that I'm like, lesson learned.

1028
01:46:59,710 --> 01:47:05,260
Yeah. Now we have a instead of things I can do at your house.

1029
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:09,080
Yeah, I know, I know.

1030
01:47:09,370 --> 01:47:32,800
Like, I'm sure I can even get you my, my favorite book on now is the box, which I can bring that into lives in office.

1031
01:47:33,550 --> 01:47:38,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah. If I remember the name of it and I'll try it.

1032
01:47:39,430 --> 01:47:50,410
Yeah. But I think also let's remember, look at the bread, you know, I think there are some resources there and now that we've run out of options.

1033
01:47:50,420 --> 01:47:56,680
So, you know, we're not there are resources, okay.

1034
01:47:57,380 --> 01:48:04,730
Yeah. Everything is going to be okay.

1035
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:09,700
Yes, they're going to be laid out. Okay.

1036
01:48:10,510 --> 01:48:18,819
And the problem. All right. So if you're interested in housing, there are some morning appointments and we completely worked around you.

1037
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:24,450
Let me know. So would you do something so that I can try it?

1038
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:30,350
I know. Yeah. Okay, great. Thanks for talking with us.

1039
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:38,030
Sure. So with this background work that you're doing, are you interested in being like student counselor?

1040
01:48:38,030 --> 01:48:42,090
Do you have the time for that? And that's always the question to times.

1041
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:42,580
I know.
