1
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:04,529
amondul: Alright i'm gonna go ahead and share my.

2
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,360
amondul: share my screen.

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:11,940
amondul: one.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,200
amondul: Alright, so far, what about was about measurement error of exposure so essentially you were asked.

5
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:39,420
amondul: Investigators decided that they'd like to investigate the relationship between high blood pressure and heart attack within a cohort study, so they decided to collect self reported hypertension, of the questionnaire rather than conduct measurements of blood pressure on all.

6
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,070
amondul: Participants because they have a limited budget.

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,900
amondul: Right, they also needed to cut some corners on their definition of a myocardial infarction.

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:58,320
amondul: And today, we will explore the impact of the resulting measurement error of the exposure and outcome on their findings under several scenarios, so this is the two by two valuables represents the truth.

9
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,550
amondul: In our hypothetical covered study Okay, and the risk ratio.

10
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,030
amondul: The true risk ratio is 1.3.

11
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,220
amondul: That makes sense.

12
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,790
amondul: So you were asked to construct a new two by two table.

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:22,260
amondul: Under the scenario that 40% of people with true hypertension, independent of disease status, meaning 40% in those with and without disease will report that they have none.

14
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,360
amondul: And all people would know hypertension, are going to correct the report their hypertension, the status okay.

15
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:43,950
amondul: So you're going to get 60% of what you should have in the hypertension row in both the myocardial infarction an unknown myocardial infarction column, leaving you with 2760 in cell a and 9930 and selby.

16
00:01:45,090 --> 00:02:00,180
amondul: Okay, and so, then what you get is you're adding this these 1800 40 who moved from here to here, so this cell becomes 5550 in this cell becomes 25,178.

17
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,780
amondul: Is that what you guys all got I think we were all checking your tables, as we went trying to make sure that you didn't.

18
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,500
amondul: have an error in the table that then propagated so that is how you get table the table and question one.

19
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:23,520
amondul: you're asked to draw some arrows between the cells reflect how people are migrating between the cells of your two by two table due to this exposure menu.

20
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:35,190
amondul: measurement error sorry I was looking at the word menu instead of measurement and that's what came out of my mouth exposure measurement error so essentially you're moving people from here to here and from here to here and therefore from here to here.

21
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,110
amondul: And so.

22
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:53,460
amondul: The question is, would you call it differential or non differential, and this is non differential because the air is the same, the exposure error is the same among those with and without the outcome.

23
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:04,200
amondul: Okay So the first thing you have to say, is what are we miss classifying or what are we assessing misclassification of in this place we're talking about misclassified the exposure of hypertension.

24
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:13,680
amondul: And then you have to say Okay, is he misclassification the same and those with and without the disease and, in this case, yes, we said it was 40% this classification.

25
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,790
amondul: In the regardless of disease status right so it's the same in both, which means that it is non differential.

26
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,260
amondul: Okay.

27
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:30,000
amondul: Given the movement between the cells and the fact that the risk ratio, with a specific agent is 1.2.

28
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:43,770
amondul: You were asked to try to explain the differences in the observed versus the truth, and we, the risk ratio is lower than the true risk ratio and bias toward the know right because the incidence in the expose does not change, and the incidence of the unexposed gets larger.

29
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,790
amondul: But we knew it would bias toward the know because it's non differential right, we could have said that.

30
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,730
amondul: isn't really confused when I say toward the no.

31
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,120
Nolaundron Harris: Yes, I am.

32
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,440
Okay.

33
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:15,990
amondul: So let's let's see can I write it is look at that all right so imagine a number line right and then no value for a relative measure is one correct.

34
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,670
amondul: We learned that, so this is our truth, which is 1.3.

35
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,170
amondul: And our with our measurement error, we end up with 1.2 so that is biased toward the know.

36
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,390
amondul: Now let's pretend.

37
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,570
amondul: pretend that we had a situation.

38
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,580
amondul: Right there's are no value, because one of a relative risk or an odds ratio any kind of relative measure.

39
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,360
amondul: Of one means no association right, so it is no the association is no.

40
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,340
amondul: So.

41
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,170
amondul: pretend we had a truth it was Point five.

42
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,230
amondul: And we ended up with.

43
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,380
amondul: After with with miss measurement our truth is point eight five.

44
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,350
amondul: Our bias is again.

45
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,990
amondul: toward the know right it's getting less strong.

46
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,570
amondul: Does that make sense.

47
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,500
amondul: I think we're mostly going to be talking on the mobile scale joshua.

48
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,700
amondul: Okay, so.

49
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,330
amondul: Does everybody understand that I can I didn't i'm not sure who said they were confused.

50
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:54,930
Nolaundron Harris: was just saying it's going towards but I mean either way either way, whether it's Point five or one or 1.2 if you can draw an arrow pointing whichever way so.

51
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,560
amondul: Is there a red, so the reference is from the truth.

52
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:05,940
amondul: Okay, so here, the truth is 1.3 the bias moves them moves it toward the no.

53
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:14,820
amondul: Okay, in this case let's let's do another pretend one one point out, I don't know what that point is there, sorry that's 1.0 that's our reference.

54
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:24,210
amondul: say, the truth is 1.3 again but let's pretend that we had non differential bias, for some reason and our our new.

55
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,440
amondul: biased measurement, so this is truth, and this is bias.

56
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:35,220
amondul: So, which way did it move from the truth to the bias It moved away from or toward the Dom.

57
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:36,870
Nolaundron Harris: Okay gotcha.

58
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,460
amondul: that's a way from the know.

59
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,000
amondul: That make sense, yes.

60
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,520
amondul: Alright, so now.

61
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,440
amondul: ignore all of my scratching my chicken scratch.

62
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,100
amondul: I don't know how to get rid of it now oh now we're stuck with it.

63
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,250
amondul: Raw well.

64
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,440
amondul: Alright well just pretend it's not there sorry guys um.

65
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:19,620
amondul: So in another scenario, the investigators retrospectively obtained medical records on all participants with them is allowing them to accurately assign hypertension status for these individuals using blood pressure measurements recorded in the medical record.

66
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:25,500
amondul: So they know the truth about hypertension status, but no such review was conducted for people to out, am I.

67
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:37,020
amondul: So the investigators must continue to rely on self report so 44% of people with true hypertension important no hypertension so already you should be very uncomfortable with this description.

68
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:45,930
amondul: Because you were talking about assessing exposure differently in your cases and in your non cases which is like a major huge, no, no, do not do right.

69
00:07:46,500 --> 00:08:01,530
amondul: It would be better to get not great information on everybody, the same way, rather than get great information on cases and crappy information on the controls and try to compare them right because you've already introduced a differential measurement error that way.

70
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:10,050
amondul: Alright, so if we did our two by two table we're getting perfect information among those with them is so it's the same as the truth.

71
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:23,130
amondul: And here we have our bias our our information bias, where 40% arm is classified okay so we're kind of taking the first column from the truth table, and the second column from our table.

72
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,890
amondul: In number one right.

73
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,380
amondul: All right, and then you were asked to draw cells, and so we end up with these little arrows.

74
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,260
amondul: And this is differential in there right, because it is different.

75
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,530
amondul: In those with and without the outcome.

76
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:52,200
amondul: The the error in assessing the exposure is different in those with and without the outcome, so it is differential.

77
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:54,930
amondul: So.

78
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:09,210
amondul: With misclassification you get a risk ratio of 2.46 right, so in this case, we could have I could have waited until now, this is the no value, this is the truth.

79
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,260
amondul: And then way out here is our observed.

80
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,350
amondul: So with this differential misclassification we get bias away from the norm.

81
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:34,890
amondul: Okay, so there is gracious much larger biases away from the novel in this scenario only people without an EMI are moving between exposure groups with people switching to the know hypertension group from the hypertension group.

82
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:47,100
amondul: So, with the misclassification some people would move from selby to D and the result will be biased away from and also the cumulative it's that it's the exposed is now larger and the cumulative it's in the incidents and the unexposed is lower than the true value.

83
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,160
amondul: That makes sense.

84
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,270
amondul: Excuse me, so now we're talking about misclassified me outcome.

85
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:14,340
amondul: Okay, so we're imagining that the the exposure is measured without error but there's misclassification of the outcomes, so the investigators are basing their definition of Am I on symptoms and ECG findings, but no party or biomarkers are available.

86
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:23,400
amondul: And as such 20% of my cases are missed for those with and without hypertension OK, so now you're asked to create a two by two table, but this this classification.

87
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:37,620
amondul: So this was the truth right and 20% of these earnest so we only get 80% of the cases that we're supposed to have in both the hypertension and no hypertension groups right.

88
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:46,980
amondul: So that leaves us with this and then the the 20% of for the 600 guests scooted over here and added to the people in this column.

89
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,090
amondul: Does that make sense, how we move people.

90
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,910
amondul: here's the arrows.

91
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,570
amondul: That show you how people are moving.

92
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:07,680
amondul: And again, this is what kind differential or non differential I already stretched a little too far, so.

93
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,320
amondul: You had to read it, but.

94
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,030
amondul: What do you think.

95
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:23,640
amondul: Chelsea says non differential that is correct, good job because the degree of misclassification of the outcome is the same in the exposed and unexposed groups okay.

96
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,770
amondul: So.

97
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:46,380
amondul: There are equal percentages of people moving from the disease to non disease groups among the exposed and unexposed so there's no effect on the ratio, because both numerator is are applied by the same value, while the denominators do not change does that make sense.

98
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:59,460
amondul: Alright, so now you're supposed to imagine that a blood test that provides information on them, I was available for people with hypertension, since they were part of an established CBD clinic.

99
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:13,230
amondul: As a result, there's no misclassification an outcome among the hypertensive but again 20% of my cases during this for the non hypertensive so in this case again we're putting the truth for this row, but the misclassified values for this row.

100
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:28,890
amondul: And if we draw our arrows we're only moving people here and therefore here, and this is differential misclassification because the air is different, among those with and without hypertension, in this case we get a risk ratio is much larger than the truth.

101
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:36,240
amondul: Okay, so the relative risk for the misclassified data is 1.63 and you're supposed to try to explain these differences.

102
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:47,040
amondul: So, within this classification some participants would move from self C to D and the result will be biased away from the novel if you see it mathematically you can see that the numerator down here.

103
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,860
amondul: Is smaller so your denominator here ends up being smaller, which makes the whole relative risk larger.

104
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,310
amondul: Does that make sense to everybody.

105
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,490
amondul: All right.

106
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,500
amondul: Any questions before we move on to confounding and effect modification.

107
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:25,740
Nolaundron Harris: Would you suggest us going through these last few in class activities before exam number two again.

108
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:35,850
amondul: yep that's one way to do it, we also have more practice problems so there's new new problems for you to try.

109
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:46,560
amondul: That are along the same lines that are maybe a little simpler in terms of the calculations, or at least the calculations are more indicative of the kinds of calculations, that will be on the exam.

110
00:13:48,330 --> 00:14:00,840
amondul: Okay, so similar to exam to exam one for exam to you've got practice problems, and those are posted on the exam to review day page on canvas.

111
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:10,500
amondul: We are going through these is also a great way to do it and, if anything, is still confusing if you can you know go to office hours and needed to, as you can get a little one on one help.

112
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,570
amondul: Does that make sense.

113
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:14,970
yeah.

114
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:18,780
amondul: Okay.

115
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:26,220
amondul: So we are now going to move on to confounding and effect modification.

116
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,170
amondul: Okay, is everybody seeing my slides.

117
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,680
Yes.

118
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,690
amondul: Alright, so let's first talk about confounding so we've seen this a bunch of times now.

119
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:57,030
amondul: But remember, we want to know if the exposure, causes the outcome right if we see an association, we want to know is it real or is it due to bias.

120
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:10,050
amondul: And we've already talked last time about a couple of sources of bias, we talked about measurement error and selection bias and now we're going to talk about confounding, which is another type of bias kind of the third big category of bias.

121
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:26,910
amondul: And that could be just you you've seen it before, so what is, confounding So this is the folk confounding triangle, this is near and dear to every epidemiologists heart it's it's probably what haunts the dreams of everybody who's taken introductory EPI methods course.

122
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:37,470
amondul: We love to draw these so we have our exposure in our disease, so this is our association association of interest, we want to know is the exposure, causing the disease right.

123
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:48,300
amondul: But we may have some third variable that is associated with our exposure and also causes heart disease, and if so, we could get the wrong answer here because of this association.

124
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:57,900
amondul: Okay, and let's look at an example I think it'll make it clear, so what if we think that more coffee drinking is associated the higher risk of pancreatic cancer.

125
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,180
amondul: well.

126
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,540
amondul: We know that people who drink coffee are also more likely to smoke there's sort of a relationship here.

127
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:20,250
amondul: And we know that smoking causes pancreatic cancer, so if we just look at coffee drinking and pancreatic cancer, without taking into effect in there into account the effect of smoking, we might get the wrong answer between coffee okay get cancer, because.

128
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:25,230
amondul: The coffee itself isn't doing anything isn't actually causing pancreatic cancer.

129
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:37,140
amondul: If the fact that people drinking coffee or also smoking in the smoking is what's causing pancreatic cancer right, so we would get the wrong answer about coffee drinking if we did not take into account this third factor does that make sense to everybody.

130
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,500
amondul: let's look at a more real life example.

131
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,910
amondul: Here you go, this is the prevalence of down syndrome at birth by birth order Okay, so this is the.

132
00:16:48,690 --> 00:17:02,490
amondul: Number of affected babies per 1000 live births, who were the first baby born in the family, the second, third, fourth and fifth baby and you can see that the risk of down syndrome seems to be quite a lot higher in the fifth baby born, then, in the first right.

133
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,080
amondul: What do you think is birth order, causing down syndrome.

134
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,560
amondul: What do you guys think is going on here.

135
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,790
Divya Manohar: The age of the model.

136
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:25,680
amondul: that's exactly right so maternal age is a risk factor for down syndrome and if you're the fifth baby born your mom's probably older than if you're the first than when you're the first baby born right.

137
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:32,220
amondul: So, if you look at maternal age, you can actually see a much stronger and more direct association here.

138
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:47,490
amondul: And so, this is where, if you just looked at this picture you might think that there was a relationship between birth order and down syndrome, if you did not actually take into account their relationship with maternal age that makes sense.

139
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,450
amondul: So this is our confounding triangle, we were interested in birth order and down syndrome.

140
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:04,980
amondul: But birth order is associated with maternal age, and we know that maternal age causes down syndrome, so if you have accounted for that you probably would not see an association between birth order and down syndrome.

141
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:17,820
amondul: Alright, so a variable is a Co founder if it is a known risk factor for the outcome, and it is associated with the exposure, but not a result of the exposure.

142
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,830
amondul: Alright, so let's think this through ask yourself three when you're trying to evaluate whether something is a potential confounders.

143
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:34,590
amondul: You want to say is that variable associated with the outcome is it associated with the exposure and is it a result of the exposure.

144
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:36,720
Right.

145
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:50,820
amondul: So in our attempts to determine whether smoking as a founder of coffee drinking and pancreatic cancer let's try to answer those three questions so remember we've got our confounding triangle, we have.

146
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,840
amondul: Coffee and pink.

147
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:06,810
amondul: pink get cancer, and then we have our founder, which is smoking right, so the first question is is the confounders associated with the outcome.

148
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,150
amondul: So in our data we can look at that what kind of data, do we have here.

149
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,260
amondul: what's study design this as a cohort is an rct is that a case control study.

150
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,590
Nolaundron Harris: This control.

151
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,400
Divya Manohar: Is control.

152
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:31,740
amondul: You are right it's a case control study, because it says cases and controls that's your first clue your second clue is that you have 300 cases in 900 controls.

153
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:45,600
amondul: Which is just a lovely three to one ratio and does not happen in nature right so somebody picks these cases and mash three to three controls per case essentially or pick three controls per case is what happened here okay also.

154
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:53,460
amondul: pancreatic cancer is rare, and if you took a random sample you would never expect a quarter of your people to get it right, so this all of this should clue you in.

155
00:19:53,820 --> 00:20:08,730
amondul: Case control alright so let's do the odds ratio right and we do our cross product, so the odds ratio equals 120 times 700 divided by one at times 200 anyone got a calculator handy.

156
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,610
amondul: wants to do that for me.

157
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,920
amondul: We can have a race.

158
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,930
amondul: I think we can already see it's going to be a big number.

159
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,640
amondul: Alright, so it says 2.33.

160
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,320
amondul: So what do you think is smoking associated with pancreatic cancer.

161
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:41,580
amondul: What would this number be if it was not associated, it would be one is that one.

162
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:52,980
amondul: It is associated Okay, so we can say yes to that question next question remember our confounding triangle.

163
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:58,170
amondul: We have coffee oops we have coffee.

164
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,460
amondul: And pancreatic cancer that's what we want to know about.

165
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,800
amondul: Right, but we have our smoking can founder.

166
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:18,330
amondul: So now we want to know we already said that yes, you check that box, now we want to know is smoking associated with pocket drinking okay.

167
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:26,220
amondul: So what do you think this is a percentage of smokers among our coffee drinkers, and this is the percentage of smokers among our non coffee drinkers.

168
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,120
amondul: What do you think here is coffee associated with smoking.

169
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:50,880
amondul: yeah I think so right 35.2 is more than 10.7 shirts, so that looks like yes we'll check that box and then so we said yes, smoking is associated with pancreatic cancer, we said yes, smoking is associated with coffee drinking.

170
00:21:52,080 --> 00:22:01,950
amondul: The other question is that smoking is not the result of coffee drinking right I don't think that's true I don't think that like you drink coffee and that causes you to smoke and then that causes pancreatic cancer, what we really don't want.

171
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:08,730
amondul: is for there to be kind of a straight line between these things right you don't want it to look like coffee.

172
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:25,770
amondul: causes smoking, which causes pancreatic cancer that's a whole different thing that's holding mediator, is not a Co founder we're not going to cover that in this class it's kind of advanced thing, but you just don't want that to the you know, on the causal pathway essentially.

173
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:32,490
amondul: So I think smoking is not the result of coffee drinking I jumped a lot of coffee and I don't smoke, so I think we're good.

174
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:42,840
amondul: Alright, so, in summary, confounding is when our ability to observe the true association between exposure and outcome is impeded due to the presence of a third variable.

175
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:50,520
amondul: A co founder must be a risk factor for the outcome be associated with the exposure and not be a result of the exposure and i'm have to say that this.

176
00:22:52,440 --> 00:23:01,710
amondul: bothers a lot of people who are new to EPI because they want like a rule with numbers, they want to say Okay, but if the odds ratio is this much different it's a Co founder or.

177
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:13,170
amondul: Do you see i'm saying, but there aren't really those rules it's kind of like do you think it's meaningfully associated and you have to kind of look at that and decide for yourself, it should not be based on statistical significance it's really.

178
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,680
amondul: Being calibrated and a decision of logic right.

179
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:21,900
amondul: And that's something that people struggle that people struggle with when they start to do an analysis.

180
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:35,160
amondul: To try to you know it seems very straightforward and then you get into your own data and you're trying to decide if this thing might or might not be a founder and it's not quite as straightforward as it seems like it should be, because there's not really just a hard and fast rule.

181
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,110
amondul: it's a matter of logic and kind of.

182
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,890
Deciding.

183
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:56,040
Nolaundron Harris: I hate to bring this up, but you just brought up something really important, so my question is what's the what's the thing to put in place to you know not have to put impose yourself and not go by these rules what's the thing to do to to check yourself on that.

184
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:06,450
amondul: There isn't anything it's a it's a judgment call whether you just determined that something as a co founder in your data or not is a judgment call and it requires kind of doing.

185
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:17,430
amondul: A fair number of analyses in order to have really good judgment about that, but the way you make that judgment call is to kind of ask yourself these three questions okay.

186
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:26,460
amondul: And that's the part that makes people uncomfortable like they want a very clear like rubric a very clear rule like yes, yes, no right but it's not.

187
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,980
amondul: it's you have to think it through the, this is the definition of the co founder, you have to use this co founder to kind of ask your.

188
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:43,320
amondul: Excuse me, you have to use this definition to kind of ask yourself these three questions and decide whether you think this variable might be a confederate in your in your analysis and it's not cut and dried it's not black and white.

189
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,190
amondul: And people hate it at first.

190
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,410
amondul: that's the bad news i'm sorry.

191
00:24:54,540 --> 00:25:02,130
amondul: Oh, you have if you, you need to understand the true relationship between the exposure and outcome considering confounders to really know where to focus your public health efforts right.

192
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:12,060
amondul: If it's not coffee if it's smoking, then we don't need to tell people to stop drinking coffee, we need to tell people to stop smoking right and that's that's why we really need to understand these relationships.

193
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,020
amondul: Okay So how do we deal with it.

194
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:24,210
amondul: Now I can show you this again so you can do it in two ways, you can do it during the study design phase, and you can also do it during the data analysis.

195
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:35,340
amondul: And we've talked about all of these study design ways before right matching individual and group matching are both strategies to address, confounding at the design phase.

196
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:41,100
amondul: randomization in randomized control trials and experimental studies, this is a is a tool.

197
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:51,030
amondul: To deal with confounding right, you are breaking any association of a third variable between your exposure and outcome because you are randomly assigning people to the exposure.

198
00:25:51,480 --> 00:26:03,780
amondul: it's essentially if you have a exposure outcome potential confounders you cannot have this is broken by randomization because you are randomly assigning people to an exposure.

199
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:05,610
amondul: Right.

200
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,980
amondul: So that is pretty great.

201
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:18,000
amondul: And in matching you know you're matching your cases in your controls on factors that you think might.

202
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,580
amondul: make them might might be related right.

203
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:31,110
amondul: So you are breaking you're breaking this one really right there it goes right.

204
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:38,010
amondul: yeah so you're imagining kind of breaks this this rule here breaks that arrow.

205
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,110
amondul: Okay.

206
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:48,840
amondul: So we'll talk a little bit about matching again remember in matching your matching cases to control us by a variable that you think may be a possible can founder.

207
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:57,870
amondul: So we will almost always match on age, you might match on geographic location body size, I would say that sex and race or two that frequently get matched on.

208
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:12,480
amondul: If you do a match, and if you do a match study you must conduct a match analysis Okay, this means that the pairs of Baptist individuals must be linked in your data analysis remember when we do our matching.

209
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:28,050
amondul: analysis, are two by two table are pairs not people okay and you're only going to use the discordant pairs ease to when you do your match odds ratio calculations.

210
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,120
amondul: Right it's be oversee.

211
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:47,280
amondul: So let's go through this example real quick, so if this is sell a B, C and D who goes and sell a the cases exposed and the control is exposed which pairs have that.

212
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,830
amondul: pair one.

213
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,930
amondul: And hair 10 right did I miss any.

214
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,960
amondul: So we put two pairs here.

215
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:04,410
amondul: Now let's do be our discord itself where our case is unexposed.

216
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:19,530
amondul: went away like our cases exposure control is unexposed i'm sorry I don't know what my brain stops working for a second be is when the case is exposed and the control is unexposed okay so here's the.

217
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,850
amondul: here's the here's a be.

218
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,510
amondul: here's a Beige did I miss any think that's for.

219
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:35,160
amondul: Okay, see is our discordant pair where the case is unexposed and the control is exposed.

220
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:44,520
amondul: This is a see, and this is a see so if that to there and in order to calculate our math odds ratio we don't need to do this last one, but it looks like there's two.

221
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,470
amondul: So are matched odds ratio, how would we calculate that.

222
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,160
amondul: For over to.

223
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,370
amondul: Our master at ratios to.

224
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:11,520
amondul: So if you find an association between your exposure and your outcome, it is not due to any factors that were matched on.

225
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:21,840
amondul: Right, so this is more efficient than stratified analysis which we're going to talk about in a few slides you cannot, however, conducted analyses for the mass variables and the outcome.

226
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,590
amondul: Right, because you have created the association between those variables and the outcome in your design.

227
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:37,230
amondul: So you never want to you really only ever want to match on things where the association was known and no one cares to look at it, because we just know right.

228
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:48,240
amondul: that's why age is a great thing to match up like in cancer studies yeah we got it all people get cancer check you don't need to look, you know what I mean we just need to make sure that we have good control of compounding.

229
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:50,280
amondul: Okay.

230
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:59,880
amondul: Alright, so randomization again is when you randomly allocate the exposure or the treatment by the investigator does this right.

231
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:05,850
amondul: So you're assuring that the two groups exposure unexposed are the same, except for your exposure of interest.

232
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:17,100
amondul: And what's really cool about this is that you're controlling for both known and unknown confounders all the distribution of all of these third variable should be equally distributed between the groups, because you've randomly assigned them to those groups.

233
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:23,400
amondul: Okay, so we can't match on something if we don't know that it's a can founder and we can't.

234
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,310
amondul: do anything about it in our analysis like we're going to talk about in a few slides if we don't know that it's a founder.

235
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:45,480
amondul: We can only deal with through matching and adjustment and stratification things that we know about, but the beauty of randomization takes care of everything doesn't matter if we know about it or not, it's going to be randomly distributed, because we randomly assigned people.

236
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:51,840
amondul: So that's why randomization is so powerful for dealing with confounding.

237
00:30:54,870 --> 00:31:02,100
amondul: Alright, so now we're moving into those were things you can do in the design phase matching and monetization now we're talking about in the analysis phase you've got your data.

238
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:17,310
amondul: And how can you deal with the potential for confounding in your analysis, so you want to examine the relationship between the exposure and outcome with the within each stratum of a potential, confounding variable so you're doing you're essentially holding the confounding variable constant.

239
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:24,360
amondul: So let's go through an example we're interested in the association between.

240
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,970
amondul: marital status.

241
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,560
and

242
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,550
amondul: me osteoarthritis okay.

243
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,880
amondul: that's today ugliest day.

244
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:44,040
amondul: Okay, so marital status is our exposure knee osteoarthritis is our outcome that we are interested in.

245
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:58,140
amondul: This potential third variable like whether sex might be potential confounders okay so just for fun let's calculate our crude.

246
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,200
amondul: What are we going to be calculating here.

247
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,680
amondul: let's calculate our.

248
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,010
amondul: crude odds ratio okay.

249
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:33,360
amondul: So what do you get so he's got a calculator out she's our official resistance point 697 again point 640 Point six nine.

250
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,780
amondul: Okay, so if we don't account for sex it looks like.

251
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:46,680
amondul: marital status this associate of the lower risk married people are less likely to get knee osteoarthritis.

252
00:32:49,410 --> 00:33:00,120
amondul: So, in trying to determine whether sex is sex is a risk factor for me osteoarthritis we have marital status me osteoarthritis and then our third variable is sex.

253
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,720
amondul: what's, the first question we have to ask ourselves.

254
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,310
amondul: What are the three questions we'd have to ask.

255
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,500
Nolaundron Harris: Oh.

256
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,710
Nolaundron Harris: he's dead associated to the.

257
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,980
Nolaundron Harris: law that is associated with the exposure.

258
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:38,340
amondul: yeah that's one of them that's the second question we're going to ask is is the Co founder associated with the exposure what's, the first question we're going to ask.

259
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:40,710
Nolaundron Harris: Is.

260
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,380
brenda.w.campbell: This back to the outcome.

261
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:53,880
amondul: of correct all right, and so, here we have a table looking at our founder male female and our outcome of the osteoarthritis so let's do a quick odds ratio.

262
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,170
amondul: To figure it out tell me how I would set that up.

263
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:04,920
amondul: If there's an association between sex and the osteoarthritis tell me what you're right in the numerator.

264
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,370
Nolaundron Harris: 14.

265
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,400
amondul: So that goes into the denominator.

266
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,690
amondul: right because we're going to take this times this.

267
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:30,300
amondul: divided by this that we do our cross product right, so it goes in the numerator goes on top.

268
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,640
Geehan Suleyman: isn't it 171 times to 90.

269
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:45,390
amondul: minute Chelsea did that too that's right 171 times 291 divided by 340 times what.

270
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:48,840
amondul: You 6061 that's right.

271
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,170
amondul: Anybody got a calculator.

272
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:55,080
amondul: 0.56.

273
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:00,000
amondul: Yes, that is correct alright so.

274
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:06,270
amondul: what's the answer to our question one is our co founder associated with our outcome.

275
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,700
Geehan Suleyman: Now, less than one.

276
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,520
amondul: i'll if it is right it's a submit its associated in a inverse way.

277
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,420
Geehan Suleyman: Right, so it.

278
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:29,640
amondul: equals, so it is not associated with equals one, but this is telling us that males are less likely to get me off osteoarthritis and females right.

279
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,240
amondul: Does that make sense or that females are about twice as likely.

280
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,550
amondul: We did it the other way.

281
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,570
amondul: So i'd say yes, this is associated.

282
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:52,230
amondul: Right, because only ever not associated if that if the odds ratio or the ratio measures equal to one, so I say yes we've met this requirement, do you guys agree.

283
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:02,430
amondul: Okay let's go on to question to Question two is whether our potential confounders associated with.

284
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,230
amondul: Our.

285
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:13,230
amondul: kosher in this case marital status So what do you think we've got among the married people 63.1% are men and.

286
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,530
amondul: 25.9% are men.

287
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,330
amondul: What do you think.

288
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,430
amondul: Does that look like its associated or not associated to you.

289
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:43,800
amondul: Yes, that is associated correct so we've answered yes to Question two and then the third question, of course, is does marital status.

290
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:56,340
amondul: cause sex, I think, no right clearly da right, so we can we can say no to question three and therefore yes.

291
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:09,300
amondul: Sex might be a Co founder of marital status So what do we do about that in our analysis phase, well, we would stratify by sex, so if we go back a few This was our crude table.

292
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:21,150
amondul: Okay, and this was our table by sex we had 511 men and 552 women so now Those are our totals Okay, so in this case we have our table of men.

293
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:34,980
amondul: With a total of 511 and we've distributed them by marital status and the osteoarthritis and we've got our 552 women who are now distributed by their marital status and the osteoarthritis okay.

294
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:51,780
amondul: So if we calculate the odds ratios now our strategy is specific odds ratios among men, we get 134 times 74 divided by 37 times 266 today but everybody see how I did that.

295
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:57,660
amondul: So among men, what is the odds ratio between marital status and the osteoarthritis.

296
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,850
amondul: I believe it is one yeah.

297
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,530
amondul: yeah Okay, what if we do it among women.

298
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:26,850
amondul: Times 169 divided by 149 times 122 and if you multiply that out is also one.

299
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,940
amondul: These are both different than what we got for the crude which was Point six, nine, I think.

300
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:43,620
amondul: Alright, so if we do not take into account, sex, it looks like there's an association between marital status and the osteoarthritis but that's because there's more men.

301
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:50,640
amondul: Among the married people and then are less likely to get knee osteoarthritis than women.

302
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:59,040
amondul: So, once we take into account, sex, we can see that there is no association, here we get the no value in each strategy.

303
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:09,300
amondul: So this is how you can tell if you have, confounding if your stratum specific estimates are the same as each other but different from the crude you have, confounding.

304
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:14,400
amondul: If they are the same as the crude you do not have, confounding.

305
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,520
amondul: there's a flow chart at the end that I think will help with this.

306
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,330
amondul: All right, you can also do adjustment.

307
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:39,960
amondul: A statistical technique that can be used to examine what the association between exposure and outcome would be if the founder was not associated with the exposure, we did an example of this when we did age adjustment remember.

308
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:56,100
amondul: Right remember our example with Sweden and Panama, the crude mortality rate in Sweden was nine for 1000 in Panama, it was 741 thousand, but when you took into account the age structure of the population, it became clear that the mortality rate was actually higher in Panama.

309
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,730
amondul: Right it's just that Sweden has more old people.

310
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:14,190
amondul: So this is an example of adjustment in papers, you will actually see this done using modeling techniques like logistic regression or linear regression or something like that, and they can take into account multiple potential confounders at once.

311
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:26,340
amondul: And we will not be covering that in this class, but just recognize that modeling where you're including potential confounders in your model is a method of adjustment for controlling that's what they're trying to do okay.

312
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:41,610
amondul: So we try our best, but there's always the possibility of residual confounding So what do I mean by that I mean, confounding that remains, even after we make our best efforts to control for it and the design and then the analysis phase.

313
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:53,160
amondul: residual confounding I would say is really not as big of an issue and randomized control trials right because you're you are assigning people to exposure so you're taking care of known and unknown confounders.

314
00:40:54,360 --> 00:41:01,710
amondul: We may not have data for a Co founder if you don't have data for you can't match on it or adjust for it.

315
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:09,840
amondul: or stratify by it, we can't we may have measured confound or poorly like if you're measuring confounded you have a lot of measurement error in that can founder.

316
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:20,280
amondul: Even if you adjust for it or stratify by it or match on it, you aren't taking fully into account, confounding by that factor right because you haven't measured it well.

317
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:32,340
amondul: And there may be factors we don't know about that are confounders that we just don't know where confounders and therefore we can't possibly adjust for them are stratified by them or match on low right because we just don't know about them.

318
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,180
amondul: So always considered that we might be missing a part of the puzzle.

319
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,010
amondul: Okay.

320
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:48,930
amondul: So this is our summary, confounding is when our ability to observe the true association between exposure now counters impeded due to the presence of a third variable.

321
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:57,780
amondul: strategies to control for confounding include matching or randomization of the study design phase and stratification and adjustment in the data analysis phase.

322
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:05,550
amondul: If we use matching to control for confounders we must conduct a match analysis and we must be conscious of the possibility of residual compounding.

323
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:08,970
amondul: Okay.

324
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:17,010
amondul: Alright, so let's now talk about effect modification.

325
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:27,390
amondul: So, remember, confounding is where we're seeing the incorrect association between exposure and disease, because of this relationship with this third variable.

326
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:35,010
amondul: A good example here is smoking and alcohol drinking and car crashes, so if we're interested in the association between smoking and car crashes.

327
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:44,550
amondul: We know that smoking is also somewhat associated with alcohol drinking, so if we don't take that into account, we might see an erroneous association between smoking and car crashes.

328
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:47,820
amondul: Okay.

329
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:54,390
amondul: If we were to look at smoking stratified by drinking and non-drinking.

330
00:42:56,010 --> 00:43:09,510
amondul: In the drinking strata, we would get an odds ratio of one and the non drinker strategy, but also get an odds ratio of one, whereas the crude association was 2.8 So what if I told you, the first thing to say, is Are these the same as each other.

331
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:13,470
amondul: or your stratum specific estimates, the same as one another.

332
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:17,700
amondul: Yes or no.

333
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:24,810
amondul: Yes, yes, are they the same as the crew, or are they different from the crew.

334
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:31,140
amondul: they're different from the crew, so this means you have, confounding.

335
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:42,210
amondul: You stratified the stratos transpacific estimates are the same as one another, but they are different from the truth, that is, confounding so confounding is a kind of bias.

336
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:52,620
amondul: About adjustment for a Co founder or estimate of the association between exposure and deceit disease includes both the contribution of the exposure and a confounders so you can overestimate the true association.

337
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,940
amondul: or underestimate the true association that's called positive or negative confounded.

338
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,660
amondul: But effect modification, on the other hand, is a real phenomenon, it is not a bias.

339
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:10,080
amondul: Okay, it is a real biological or physical phenomena it's true differences and the association between exposure and disease.

340
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:15,810
amondul: among people who have a different characteristic defined by a third variable which we call an effect modifier.

341
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:26,520
amondul: Okay, this can be synergistic or antagonism meeting, but the two that the third variable and the exposure work together to increase the outcome, or against one another to kind of decrease the outcome.

342
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:34,170
amondul: We, this is also sometimes called interaction so effect modification and interaction or words that will be used kind of interchangeably.

343
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:41,130
amondul: So let's use a silly fictitious example our exposure in this case is kryptonite.

344
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,340
amondul: And the outcome is feeling weak.

345
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,990
amondul: You guys were exposed to kryptonite you think you would feel weak.

346
00:44:50,850 --> 00:45:02,040
amondul: What about Superman yes and that's a real biological difference right you're not from the planet krypton and, therefore, we do not feel we couldn't we are supposed to grip tonight so.

347
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:13,410
amondul: This is a little bit silly but it gives you an example of a real situation in which it would be very reasonable to expect the two different kinds of people would have a different exposure disease relationship.

348
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:21,090
amondul: About a real world example that's not so silly alcohol flushed cheeks and alcohol dehydrogenase.

349
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:36,450
amondul: So, most people when they drink alcohol do not experience flush cheeks But some people do, and this is because they have different genotypes for the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme OK, so the effect modifier here is the alcohol dehydrogenase genotype.

350
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:50,700
amondul: OK, so the relationship between alcohol and flush cheats is biologically is true it's true it's not bias, there was a real difference in people who do and don't have this gina type okay.

351
00:45:51,750 --> 00:46:00,060
amondul: How about air pollution, respiratory symptoms and age well children have fire breathing grades and small airways so they're more affected by air pollution.

352
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:16,350
amondul: So if we actually look at the stratum specific estimates between air pollution and respiratory disease in young people, we find a relative risk of 1.7 and, if you look in adults, you find a relative risk of 1.06.

353
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:24,360
amondul: This is one way that you know you have effect modification when you stratify and you find different results in your to strategy.

354
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:39,450
amondul: Right, remember, I told you for confounding if you stratify and you have the same result in each stratum they're the same as each other but different from the group that's confounding when you stratify and you get a different answer in your two straight up.

355
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:48,420
amondul: that's effect modification there's a different relationship between air pollution and respiratory disease in children them in adults.

356
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,030
amondul: And it makes sense.

357
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:59,070
amondul: Okay, you can also have effect modify owners don't actually have to be biological let's think about air pollution again.

358
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:09,180
amondul: The relationship between air pollution and a person where where where a person lives and respiratory disease might be really different depending on whether they do or do not keep their windows open right.

359
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:18,900
amondul: And that is a real difference and even though it's not biological it's important right because the public health intervention might be hey keep your windows closed when everything's really high.

360
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:39,450
amondul: And how about the use of hearing protection if you're working in a noisy environment right so exposure to noise and hearing loss might be very different and people who do and do not wear your protection, so this is not a biological thing but it's like a physical intervention right.

361
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:53,400
amondul: So what do you do about effect modification well remember that this is a true difference in the association between exposure and z's among people who have different characteristics design defined by that third variable are effect modifier.

362
00:47:54,750 --> 00:48:03,870
amondul: And so you want to stratify by levels of your potential effect modifier you're going to compute your stratum specific estimates and then you're going to evaluate the similarity of those estimates.

363
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:13,200
amondul: The effect is not uniform you have effect modification if they're the same you do not, and then you may have, confounding that's kind of the next question right.

364
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:27,480
amondul: let's don't worry about this so let's talk about smoking heart attack and age okay so here's our crude association looking at smoking as our exposure and heart attack, as our outcome.

365
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:36,750
amondul: And in this case we've got cohort data so we're doing a risk ratio, so this is the cumulative incidence of EMI and the smokers right.

366
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:47,670
amondul: Over 512, and this is the cumulative incidence of that I have a non smokers and we get a risk ratio of 2.5 for you are also given a confidence interval here.

367
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:56,340
amondul: Remember, I told you i'm not going to make you calculate them on a test, but I might ask you to understand what this means so is this a statistically significant finding this 2.54.

368
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,620
Clifton Addison: Yes.

369
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:11,130
amondul: Yes, because it does not include one, it does not include the no value Okay, so that is a statistically significant association between Nokia device.

370
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:21,450
amondul: Now, age, in this case is our potential effect modifier so you are going to then compute your stratum specific estimates right.

371
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:38,250
amondul: So the relative risk relative risk among the older people is going to be equal to 72 divided by 232 over 20 divided by 240 right and he was set that up the same in the younger people.

372
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:50,970
amondul: Okay, so what you would find is a relative risk of 3.72 and you're older people with this confidence interval and one point for and you're younger people with this confidence interval.

373
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:57,450
amondul: Do you think those are different from one another, or are they the same.

374
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:01,380
Geehan Suleyman: and

375
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:08,460
amondul: I agree, I think they are different right they're both in the positive direction right they're both suggesting that.

376
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:19,470
amondul: Smoking is associated with Am I right, but in this case it's much stronger, and this is statistically significant right because it doesn't include one.

377
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:30,090
amondul: whereas this is pretty modest and this competence interval does include one yes so quick question when we are the examples are brought in from found in your odds ratios.

378
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,390
amondul: retention, yes, when you're comparing.

379
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:45,600
amondul: What would you do the math, is it not, is there a preference for completing observation is the spreadsheets for effect on patient was compounding know you're going to calculate the measure of association that's appropriate for the study type that you have.

380
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:51,930
amondul: So in this case we're looking at cohort data so it's appropriate to calculate a relative risk, and we will compare those.

381
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:57,120
amondul: Whatever the appropriate measure of association is for your study you'll compare that in Australia.

382
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:04,650
amondul: If you've got case control data, you would calculate odds ratios and compare those right so it's just a matter of choosing the measure of association.

383
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:13,020
amondul: is dependent upon the study design and then you're going to calculate that within your state and compared to each other, does that make sense yep yep no problem.

384
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:23,940
amondul: Okay, so I think we agree that these are different, we have a much stronger Association and the older people in it is statistically significant, but it is not statistically significant and the younger people now.

385
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,920
amondul: There are tests to determine whether.

386
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:38,970
amondul: you're straight up your strategy specific estimates are different from what went on there, so you can apply a statistical test to see if this is a statistic if these are statistically significantly different.

387
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,290
amondul: Like we can look at them and qualitatively say this looks different from this right.

388
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:55,620
amondul: But there are tests that can actually tell you what they are statistically significantly different one way to do it is to look at the confidence intervals, and I will tell you that this is not going to be statistically significant difference because we have.

389
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:13,920
amondul: say this is our number lines is our no value so for the old people, it goes from like 2.35 up to 5.91 right for our young people, it goes from 0.808 up to.

390
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,800
amondul: 2.4 or five.

391
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,000
amondul: These confidence intervals overlap.

392
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,520
amondul: That means that these are not statistically significantly different from one another.

393
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,050
Okay.

394
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,630
amondul: So you can I would say that now.

395
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:43,530
amondul: If you added on hundred more people they might suddenly be statistically significantly different, because your your confidence intervals are getting narrower the bigger your sample size right.

396
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:51,000
amondul: So I don't think it would be appropriate to put these together as if they were the same, but you cannot say that they're statistically significantly different from one another.

397
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:59,190
amondul: You might read your paper and say there's a suggestion that there's effect notification by age, although it's not statistically significant and show the different the different stream right.

398
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:06,690
amondul: So this is one way of looking at the competence intervals and seeing if they overlap with each other if they do not.

399
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:14,790
amondul: than it is statistically, the two straight are statistically significantly different from one another, if they do overlap they're not statistically significantly different.

400
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:27,390
amondul: I am saying that this is borderline, this is a borderline example right because they only over out a little bit, this one is statistically significant on its own, that one is not and they're quite a bit different right.

401
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,220
amondul: So this is again, one of those things where it's kind of a judgment call.

402
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:43,170
amondul: And this is to show you that it's not always like completely straightforward, but I think they're different enough that it would be really I do think it would be inappropriate to pretend there's no difference here right.

403
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:49,830
amondul: All right, this is the kind of say that statistical significance is everything.

404
00:53:50,850 --> 00:54:01,410
amondul: You don't want to just ignore the magnitude of the associations in favor of looking at statistical significant statistical significance as a piece of the puzzle, you have to look at kind of all the pieces if that makes sense.

405
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:15,060
amondul: So you might also see a P value for a breslow day test it will tell you whether the two straight are different, or maybe whether one is different from the crude Okay, so there are statistical tests to kind of help you determine that.

406
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:21,360
amondul: Alright So what do you do if you find an interaction or an effect modification right.

407
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:33,030
amondul: You should only report the stratum specific odds ratios, it is inappropriate to put these things together if they are different right the the summary measure means nothing if there's true biological difference between these groups.

408
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:42,120
amondul: So among older adults smokers had nearly four times the risk of a heart attack and non smokers, but in contrast younger smokers and closer to one to one and a half times risk of a heart attack that non smokers.

409
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,210
amondul: Okay that's how you look report that.

410
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,490
amondul: So.

411
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:57,030
amondul: Remember that your third variable excuse me, can be an effect modifier confound or both if it's an effect modifier you have to show your status specific estimates.

412
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:06,720
amondul: And they won't be confounded and if it's not an effect modifier you must still confirm that they'll confirm with his presence, so this is the flow chart I was telling you about so you stratify.

413
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:16,560
amondul: you're going to compare your strategy specific estimates are they the same no they're different from each other, you have effect modification you report your shadow specific results.

414
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:20,760
amondul: Are they, the same as each other, yes, great.

415
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,460
amondul: Are they, the same as the crude.

416
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:28,710
amondul: Yes, then you have no confounding or interaction, you can report your crude.

417
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:34,590
amondul: But if you're if you're at a specific estimates of the same as each other but different from the crude.

418
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:39,960
amondul: You have, confounding and you're going to want to report some kind of summary measure you can still report your shadow specific estimates.

419
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:53,130
amondul: But really you probably report some sort of summary measure that takes into account, confounding by that variable we are talking about how to calculate those in this class but it might be the results but modeling strategy or the demands will cancel odds ratio relative risk.

420
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:56,100
amondul: That makes sense to everybody.

421
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:10,710
amondul: When you're gonna have plenty of time to grapple with this in your in your.

422
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:18,360
amondul: exercise for today okay so today's exercise is quite long i'm going to admit it to up front it's long.

423
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:26,580
amondul: And I think we should all take our time and work through it, and so we are going to just take the rest of this class to work on it.

424
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:32,400
amondul: And we'll see where we are, that if we need a little more time to finish it up at the end of next class, we can do that.

425
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:42,210
amondul: Or we can just you know take our take today to finish it and we will at the at the earliest, we will go over the answers at the beginning of next class.

426
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:53,010
amondul: Because next time our our exercise is not that long and even if we needed to like push into look doing the answers for the next exercise on the exam review day we can do that, we have time.

427
00:56:53,580 --> 00:57:05,250
amondul: So I think the right thing to do is to take our time and make sure everybody gets to think through this and we're not rushing so we're going to take the rest of today to work on this in class exercise if you get done early you can leave.

428
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:15,060
amondul: But I want everybody to take their time and work through this Okay, so you don't have to be worried that you're not doing it fast enough and then we're going to go back.

429
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:16,530
Nolaundron Harris: and go for you're done.

430
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:30,510
amondul: Okay, no worries those take a 10 minute break come back at 240 i'm gonna stop sharing, so I can see all of you anymore I okay so everybody take a 10 minute break come back at 240 and we will get into our groups okay.
