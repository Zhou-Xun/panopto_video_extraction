1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,790
Thank. And.

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,930
Okay. I think we're ready to go. So you guys all should have got an email from you regarding your first assignment.

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,100
And that was horrible. I mean, this should be challenging.

4
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,680
Okay, I'm going to post the solutions outside my office on the fifth floor in an opposite corner.

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:44,310
Okay, to be honest, this wall to your helpless wall of capital, our lives, we don't lost on any questions that you might have on your responses.

6
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:55,559
Come and see me after your review of the homework. If you're interested, the grades out of 25 spanned from like 17 to 24, something like that.

7
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,590
So it's a good range I'd like to see above 20.

8
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,300
Okay. But you know, it's just one other indicator in this class.

9
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,870
And you know, the idea here is to build from inside.

10
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,820
The next homework is here are distributed.

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,450
It's also online. You can go to the canvas site and take a look at it.

12
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:24,450
It'll be do that. Well, three weeks from now, it's almost the end of November classes.

13
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,899
And the prior week. There are new teams. There are new assignments for teams.

14
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:40,530
Again, I'm partnering with DHS and CS students and I'm also doing some other maintenance to try to equalize the between.

15
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:46,770
Okay. I would say most of the teams seem to work out, but a couple of words of advice.

16
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,090
Review your other members work here. I mean, it's pretty clear to me that that didn't happen in the course of all the cases.

17
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,350
And I think in most cases they didn't do very well. Okay. So that's really a team thing.

18
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,600
I mean, you're both to learn about this, okay. And if you divvy up the work completely that way.

19
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,160
Okay. The presentation, I thought was really good. Okay.

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,600
But show your work. Okay. If you say the answer is 46%.

21
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,260
I mean, and it's not the answer that I could figure out.

22
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,969
I have no idea how you got that.

23
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:28,470
It may have made sense in particular for the apportionment question, you know, the wastewater treatment I wanted to do.

24
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,990
There's lots of answers. I don't take all the wrong answers from my different answers from mine.

25
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:42,750
I just want to see what you doing. This World War Two involves a groundwater problem.

26
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,770
So you're ready to go on that.

27
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,080
Okay. And it involves some air pollution problems. And we're in the midst of that right now.

28
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,889
Only two written assignments in this class. Okay. No big exams.

29
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:04,380
Just weekly quizzes. Okay. On the quiz today, I thought it was pretty good.

30
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:14,220
We have clarifications on PM and I'll talk about that a little bit later and on the next.

31
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,290
And I'm not going to talk too much more about the Nacs just recognize that stratospheric ozone,

32
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,100
which is the good ozone, is not directly regulated by the Clean Air Act.

33
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,450
Okay? It's regulated in a sense by an international treaty.

34
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,200
Okay. Which bans precursor emissions international.

35
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:39,330
Okay. The next suffers because it only has six pollutants found in the boundary layer in the lowest layer of the atmosphere.

36
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,290
That's it. Okay. Nothing else has a lot of teeth in the clean air.

37
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:54,420
Okay. We had talked about different types of sources, and there's a lot of pictures of different types of sources here.

38
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:04,770
The sources are to be encapsulated or summarized in something called the national emissions inventory.

39
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,149
Okay. Did I didn't talk about this last week because we got a little too late.

40
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,180
I think this is a summary by EPA.

41
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:19,200
EPA takes data collected by states and the inventory is enormous.

42
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,480
Thousands of sources, typically sources that require air pollution permits.

43
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,080
Okay. There are lots of other air pollution sources that don't get permitted, and they're not any any often.

44
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,720
EPA has been working to expand the NEA. So point sources.

45
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,020
This is what you traditionally think of as air pollution sources.

46
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,500
Larger ones will be in there. Smaller ones will not be. Okay.

47
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,120
Non-Point sources. These are also called area sources.

48
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,620
These are typically too small to get a permit. Okay.

49
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:59,220
Like, you know, if you open up a barbecue or a restaurant, you have a lot of emissions of PPM,

50
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:08,130
but you're not going to get an air pollution permit for that. On road and on road or part of the mobile sources.

51
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:15,270
And, you know, I didn't spend too much time, but ships and trains and things like this constitute mobile sources.

52
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,420
What's the largest category of mobile sources on road?

53
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,050
Okay. The passenger cars and trucks and SUVs and all that.

54
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:34,680
What's the second most significant? Almost a significant category of mobile sources, airplanes.

55
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:43,230
That's a great question or a great answer. No, but they are very important right near the airport for sure.

56
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:54,510
But actually non road equipment, construction equipment, earthmovers chippers for wood trees and things like this.

57
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,500
Those are second to second major source typically in urban area.

58
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,540
And then EPA in the last couple of years have added on what they call events data,

59
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,640
things like wildfires, because these have become so significant in portions of the country.

60
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:18,230
So they're making an attempt to have a holistic inventory and to increase the number of pollutants beyond the criteria,

61
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,900
pollutants including CO2, methane, other greenhouse gases.

62
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:33,750
In the Michigan area, the southeast area, we pulled together some compilations a couple of years ago for the and I it's done every three years.

63
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,740
2001 is a couple of years out of date. Now the latest is 2017.

64
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:46,680
If we look at oh, let's look at Wayne County, this is area including Detroit, plus the approach of other communities.

65
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:55,900
And this is PM 2.5 emissions. EPA's inventory estimates 2000 tons per year of emissions and the biggest sectors look

66
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,530
like their other two informative industrial processes and dust from sleep roads.

67
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,940
And then there's fuel combustion, industry, boilers, all kinds of other things.

68
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,920
Okay. Take all of this information with a grain of salt.

69
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:18,120
Okay. Most of it is not directly measured. Most of it's estimated using an emission factor approach.

70
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:25,160
Okay. An emission factor approach means an industry is producing so many widgets,

71
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:31,800
we estimate how many pounds or tons or whatever per widget and multiply those two together.

72
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,180
Okay. So it's quite approximate typically. Sometimes it's good.

73
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,830
For some pollutants, but for PPM and for toxics, it's not too accurate.

74
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:49,650
This is a picture of the southwest Detroit area.

75
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,030
Some of you may have been there. The new bridge is going up right here.

76
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:59,170
Zug Island. Makes a lot of steel and coke on the River Rouge complex.

77
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:04,160
This is showing you these dark circles, industry sources that are listed down here.

78
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,100
And it's just a very intense industrial area.

79
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:17,609
If any of you have been up there before and this map shows are also monitoring sites that have

80
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:26,100
been established in the field right here to try to get a handle on some of the emissions.

81
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:34,350
The number one pollutant affecting or the number one source affecting this area is diesel exhaust.

82
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:39,360
It's actually not industrial emissions. It's mostly diesel exhaust from truck traffic.

83
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,210
Industrial emissions are very important, too, to you have the refinery over here.

84
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,240
We have what is the Coke facility, the steel over here.

85
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:59,070
They're also big sources. Some of you guys may have been on the tour a couple of weeks ago.

86
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,550
We visited a couple of these facilities in Detroit.

87
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:12,030
And just to contrast sort of the nature where we have, for example,

88
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:20,309
emissions are elevated from a refinery versus all the different paint operations and coating operations

89
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:26,070
from the Dearborn truck assembly factory that are released just a little bit above the building.

90
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,820
Okay. Dispersion impacts are going to be very different.

91
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:36,490
Here's another here's a wastewater treatment plant with an uncovered settling basin.

92
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,499
Okay. And you can imagine sometimes it doesn't smell that good. Okay.

93
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,560
They have covered most of it. Okay.

94
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,820
I need to get into the science of the air pollution context, okay?

95
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:57,370
What we do is we characterize emission sources in terms of their emission rate, physical, chemical composition controls that might be placed on them.

96
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,860
And from that, we get things like the emission inventory, how many tons per year for the different pollutants.

97
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,060
These are released into the air.

98
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:15,370
They undergo a transport and they processes transport dilution, physical, chemical reactions, settling so forth onto the ground.

99
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:28,780
And then the dispersion and the transport brings them into contact with people or other receptors and they cause then impacts on human health,

100
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:34,660
animals, ecosystems and so forth. Okay, so it's kind of a linear model from left to right.

101
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,330
And we've talked about different examples of air pollution. Sources Point, Mobile Fugitive.

102
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:48,180
We characterize the emissions as the primary emissions from a facility.

103
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:52,620
These may be transformed in the atmosphere to form a secondary plume.

104
00:10:53,850 --> 00:11:03,360
The most important terrestrial secondary pollutants are sulfate or so forth, which is produced by oxidizing SO2,

105
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:14,430
the gas and the reaction between volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides with some sunlight and some temperature and heat producing ozone.

106
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:22,710
Okay, so ozone and so forth are not emitted in any large quantities by any facility.

107
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:29,350
Okay. Sometimes I'm asked, well, we have a lot of sparks at this facility or electric busses or whatever.

108
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,370
They emit ozone. Yeah, maybe, but it's minuscule enough.

109
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:41,400
Okay. Most of it's formed after a couple of hours of the chemical soup stirring and mixing and reacting in the atmosphere.

110
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:50,730
We form those secondary plumes. Okay, so it's really important to understand the difference between the primary pollutant or secondary food.

111
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:58,980
The air pollution picture is complex, not the different pathways depicted in this picture.

112
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,360
We have different sources on agriculture of fire, lightning.

113
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,990
Lightning does produce a lot of ozone, but it's not typically where people are living again.

114
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,780
It's a smaller source from the standpoint of exposure.

115
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:19,770
Balloons are dispersed, prevailing winds take them down. And this picture shows a number of different pathways.

116
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,559
We have the photochemistry, the chemical transformations. These can occur in and beyond or below.

117
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,640
Clouds perceive and form those secondary pollutants.

118
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:41,040
If there wasn't a removal mechanism for these pollutants, concentrations, which is build up and up, okay.

119
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,380
And there are a number of different removal mechanisms.

120
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:51,720
One is that the photochemistry or the other chemical processes will end up oxidizing the pollutants, giving a finite half life.

121
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,730
Okay. And, you know, we talked about CO2 with a half life of like 100 years.

122
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:04,200
That's why it's building up. On the other hand, if I release benzene in the air, it's going to react in a couple of days at most,

123
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,000
probably a few hours and go away so it doesn't build up.

124
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:20,940
We also have wet and dry deposition. This is both particulate pollution settling down onto the ground or aquatic systems as well as gases.

125
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:29,890
Because the gases touch a surface, they tend to stir. Even if they're not that soluble, they're removed on contact or picked up by a surface.

126
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:36,910
We call that dry deposition. Okay.

127
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:43,540
So we have emission processes, we have transformation and transfer, transport transformation,

128
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,840
and then we have removal processes and it's a mass balance to the level that's in the atmosphere,

129
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:54,370
represents what goes in versus what comes out and the reactions in between.

130
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:04,360
And this picture is also showing how wet deposition, for example, can take the pollutants and put them on a tourist trail ecosystem.

131
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,929
Going back to here, these are two forms sulfate.

132
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:13,390
This may turn into sulfuric acid and cause acid rain.

133
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,870
It may also be ammonium sulfate, which is a small particle.

134
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,130
Okay. Constituting roughly 20% of PM too far.

135
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:31,150
We good with this picture. Lots of things going on, lots of different scales because it's so complicated.

136
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:38,140
I like to break it down into a simple black box engineering style model.

137
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:44,650
Again, we have pollution emissions from a stack, for example, leading to a concentration in air.

138
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:51,129
We breathe that in. We're concerned. We want to keep those concentrations below dangerous levels.

139
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:56,650
That's why we have the standard flight connects, because this is what you see here.

140
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:07,209
A think there. Okay. We also have this indirect pathway where the pollutant emissions get into soils, deposit on plants,

141
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:15,550
vegetables, water, move up the food chain, the fish, potentially the animals and meat products we eat.

142
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:21,880
These products can have further concentration and we get exposure via the dietary pathway.

143
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:32,200
We also have the possibility that a nursing home has uptake this way and provides chemicals to her nursing.

144
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:42,820
So for pollutants like mercury or PCBs, this is the dominant pathway.

145
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,620
That's why we have a problem in the Great Lakes State. Okay.

146
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,660
It's not that you're breathing these chemicals in.

147
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,310
Rather, it's that they're moving up the food chain in this secondary pathway.

148
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:59,530
That understanding is pretty recent. When the Clean Air Act was written, we didn't know that.

149
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:05,350
Okay. So, I mean, that's in the last 20 years, this has become an emphasis.

150
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,710
Basic definitions of gases and vapors and volatility.

151
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:23,830
This is important because the volatility determines how much of a substance gets into the air.

152
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:34,360
And we typically talk about very volatile, volatile, semi volatile and nonvolatile pollutants based on their vapor pressures.

153
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:45,180
Particle definitions are shown here. I'm not too hung up on this, but basically we talk about particles or aerosols.

154
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:52,560
These can range from molecular clusters to basically anything that can say suspended in air for a while.

155
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,280
Maybe a millimeter in size. That's pretty big.

156
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,639
It's going to fall out the size.

157
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:05,130
Distribution is important. We talked about that a little bit already and some definitions there.

158
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:09,170
There are other terms, droplets, fog, mist, plume.

159
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,630
You can look at these one that I don't use as smog.

160
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:18,479
Okay. Smog to me is not a good term to use.

161
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,660
It's still in the press, but smoke and fog, it's really not accurate to use.

162
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,290
I mean, don't tell me something.

163
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,990
Is smog. Okay.

164
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:44,540
This is an important slide and ideally one that you guys understand because it demonstrates at least three or four important points.

165
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:59,660
What we have on the axis here is a log scale for particle size, ranging from essentially nanoparticles to micron to hundreds of microns.

166
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:06,590
Okay. PM 2.5 is particles less than two and a half microns.

167
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,629
So I kind of have a line about that. Like those smaller particles,

168
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:21,650
sometimes called fine particles as compared to coarse particles and the sort of conceptual terms of a tri modal distribution.

169
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:31,580
Okay. The first mode, very small particles are essentially molecular clusters or primary particles from combustion process.

170
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:36,980
And the hot gas cools and we form these very small molecular clusters.

171
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:43,160
They aggregate, they grow bigger various ways and coagulate.

172
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:50,510
And the particle size shifts to a larger mode around 0.4.6 microns.

173
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:56,910
Still pm too far. Okay. These can grow a bit too.

174
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,740
They can coagulate, but not a whole lot. They're pretty stable in here.

175
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,890
They can drift long distances. They're small enough that they don't settle out very fast.

176
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:14,270
Instead, the removal is largely clearing out in wash, out drops falling through and precipitation.

177
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,570
Pick up the particles and wash it out. Okay.

178
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:24,530
This is called the accumulation mode. Sometimes this is the most common mode, so we really don't see this mode.

179
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:32,210
It's kind of smeared together because these small particles are coming from a combustion source.

180
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:40,460
So they're primarily carbon trace materials in fuel.

181
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,230
For example, a little bit of metals. Okay.

182
00:19:46,980 --> 00:20:01,380
This third mode is completely different. Typically, it's windblown dust, Seaspray, volcano volcanoes, pollens, grinding processes and so forth.

183
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:08,430
They're very large particles. They don't stay in very long. Their composition, you could imagine, is quite different.

184
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,570
If they are in train, dust and soil.

185
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:21,960
What's dust and soil? Mostly silicon, calcium, aluminum, you know, things like this.

186
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,320
Okay. What's dominant in the earth's crust that form soil?

187
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:34,620
So the size also tells me something about the composition and the source.

188
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,650
Okay. And then it also tells me something about the removal processes,

189
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,200
because these large ones basically fall out of the ground quite rapidly, fall to the ground quite rapidly.

190
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:50,760
The smaller ones can stay suspended for a long time so they can travel long distances.

191
00:20:52,290 --> 00:21:01,200
And then if I'm going to measure these particles, I need to have techniques that capture very small, medium and very large particles.

192
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,840
So typically there are several different techniques that are used a lot on the fly.

193
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:13,420
Questions for me on this. You're quiet today.

194
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,710
So I think I showed you this picture before and I'm going to show it again.

195
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:29,420
Here is another picture of what particles tend to look like.

196
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:40,219
Actually, very regular, heterogeneous particle size distributions are expressed in a number of different ways where we can try to

197
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:49,610
get back those distributions so we can express them in terms of surface area or mass or particle number.

198
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:54,730
And that's what these slides represent. And I've talked about the origin.

199
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,180
Again, a little bit of particulate matter can be primary emissions.

200
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:08,960
And now because we have so many controls, our primary emissions, the secondary emissions are becoming more and more important.

201
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:17,089
And so if you release those gases, false organics, nitrogen oxides, a lot of them will form PPM through chemistry.

202
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:22,280
And here's some examples of some of the precursors that formed this year.

203
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,400
Okay. I briefly talked about deposition. This slide tries to show you some graphics of this.

204
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:48,240
There is, in fact, exchange between terrestrial and aquatic systems and the atmosphere in both directions.

205
00:22:50,880 --> 00:23:02,070
And many of the plumes involved as secondary plumes can travel very long distances.

206
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:10,920
For example, probably a lot of the sulfate particles that we see in Detroit are from the Ohio River Valley,

207
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,220
maybe three, four or five, 600 kilometers away. Okay.

208
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,800
And yes, they're still present at reasonably high concentrations, despite,

209
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,900
you know, undergoing removal processes like wet type as a songwriter position.

210
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:44,480
For organics. It's very interesting to have what we call hopscotching program or phenomenon going on where, for example,

211
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:53,000
some volatile compounds like some of the PCBs may or dioxins may get into the air from combustion processes,

212
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,940
go into the ground, stay there for a while.

213
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,790
Next summer comes around, the ground heats up. These have a small amount of volatility.

214
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,559
They get back into the air. They move a little further north, gets cold again.

215
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,700
So they're sort of frozen for a while in this process, takes some years.

216
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:16,700
But then even these semi volatile pollutants that aren't very mobile get globally distributed.

217
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,920
Okay. So it's kind of hopscotching around.

218
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,550
So some definitions, the formalized deposition.

219
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:42,560
Essentially it's a way to have a media transfer from the air to the soil or vegetation or water.

220
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:50,540
I had a person come up to me the other week and said, Well, I want to monitor Lincoln in the Detroit area.

221
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,370
And the technique is that you you know what?

222
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,099
Like, you know the stuff that grows on the north side of trees.

223
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:08,000
You scrape it off and then it picks up pollutants via deposition processes so you can put it in your petri dish and solvents extracted.

224
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,660
Do a GC analysis actually measure different compounds.

225
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,040
And like interns who have been there for a long time.

226
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:26,570
So it's sort of accumulated over the years. So it's it's an okay technique, but it it's like one or two, but it's another example of deposition.

227
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:36,960
So you might be surprised at the extent of the deposition that occurs.

228
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:43,200
This is millions of tons going into these different bars.

229
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:50,490
And you also might be surprised that it's providing a tremendous loading of nutrients like nitrogen.

230
00:25:51,270 --> 00:26:00,600
So if you look at, oh, I don't know, the Chesapeake Bay right now, 45 million tons per year are coming from the air column,

231
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,470
representing about a third of the total amount of nitrogen that's going into that water body.

232
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,580
So it's not just, you know, waste coming down the river in the same, we could say for Lake Erie and so forth.

233
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,690
But it's also you've got to factor in the air pollution burden.

234
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:26,610
Okay. And in the Great Lakes area, we do have nitrogen coming down,

235
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:35,190
but we also have many of these contaminants primarily distributed or brought to the Great Lakes via air deposition.

236
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:44,340
And that includes some metals, legacy, pesticides, things that aren't used anymore like Claudia and DDT, Aldrin,

237
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:56,310
etc. Benzene, Linda and includes mercury I mentioned and other metal, PCBs, dioxins and durians and so forth.

238
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:05,760
So Great Lakes is different. And the reason is the lakes are huge, very large surface area and very, very slow turnover.

239
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:14,090
Residents, time is really long. Plus there is a sports fishing industry and people want to eat those fish only by.

240
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:33,100
So the. 15 key pollutants identified for the Great Lakes are listed there, and these are all toxic.

241
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:41,780
Okay. Some more definitions I intersperses because it's so boring to see a whole bunch of definitions at one time.

242
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:47,990
Okay. Again, I say don't use smoke, soot, smoke, fumes, dust.

243
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,610
All of these are somewhat ambiguous, but they're still used.

244
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:06,480
Okay. We're going to turn a little bit into some of the mechanisms in the atmosphere to transport pollutants.

245
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:19,280
To do this, we have to get a few definitions. First, 50 meters of the Earth's atmosphere near the ground is what we call the surface layer.

246
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,410
This is dominated by shear stress and friction.

247
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:33,320
So the wind has to move around or over obstacles, causing that stress and friction up to about 500 meters.

248
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:43,320
We have influence of the surface layer that diminishes, but we also have some larger scale impacts due to pressure gradients,

249
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,110
highs and lows at the regional scale,

250
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:59,190
plus Coriolis forces and differences in the heat between heated areas and cooler areas above that 500 or so meter layer.

251
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,010
It's what we call the geostrophic layer, only affected by horizontal pressure gradients for those forces.

252
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,880
The holes here at a ten kilometer region is called the troposphere, and above that is the stratosphere where that good ozone is.

253
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,660
Yes. One of the questions in the quiz has some deletions here.

254
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:22,830
I don't remember exactly what it was, but it was I was confused about the wording, like the the answer to it, I guess,

255
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:30,540
because I should put the question was but something about the stratosphere and how like particulate matter or something.

256
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,229
I think I asked about ozone in the stratosphere. Yeah. Yeah.

257
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,309
So I mean, the ozone in the stratosphere is not regulated by the NAC.

258
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:47,160
So I think that was the question in there. Okay. It's only the ozone in the troposphere and actually really just in the surface layer.

259
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:56,459
Okay. And then the other thing is that that ozone isn't really affected by tropospheric contribution.

260
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:03,030
So you could have a la ozone at ground level. It's not going to produce ozone in the stratosphere, but it is something else.

261
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:10,149
Yeah, that's. Okay. So quickly, we're going to go through some of these rigs.

262
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:16,600
We've already talked about them. This drives policy in air quality and is very important.

263
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:26,380
Essentially, the modern era started about 1970 with Clean Air Act, with amendments in 77 and 90.

264
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:37,090
The act has 11 titles. I'm not going to go through the 400 pages of law and the thousands of pages of regulations.

265
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:45,090
Obviously, I don't know them all, but title one is critical because it's the achievement and maintenance of the air quality standards.

266
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:49,000
And essentially this defines what the National Ambient Air Quality Standards are.

267
00:30:52,840 --> 00:31:04,330
These are complicated standards, and they represent a level of for these six pollutants which are supposed to be protective for health.

268
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:11,770
Okay. And what happens if you exceed that health protective level?

269
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:23,210
Well, like that picture of Southwest Detroit that I showed you with all those different sources that has exceeded PPM ozone.

270
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:29,860
So to. That's standards in recent years.

271
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:36,490
What has happened to hope that for those areas, those people living in those areas.

272
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:53,330
It's complicated. It's. Very, very briefly, if, for example, you exceed the sum to max, then there may be offsets that are put into place.

273
00:31:53,960 --> 00:32:04,610
What that means is that if you want to build another facility that emits PM, you have to find other facilities that take back emissions.

274
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:13,370
And it might be that if an offset ratio of 1.5 so if you want to emit ten tons per year,

275
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:19,760
you have to sort of find 15 tons per year that you're going to remove leading to a net decrease.

276
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:25,670
Okay. And the offset ratio depends on the severity of non-attachment.

277
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:36,440
You can impose same sanctions. You can say you cannot build any more roads, factories.

278
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:44,810
You cannot sell or distribute or produce certain products that emit these types of things.

279
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:50,540
You can imagine this is not very popular. Okay.

280
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:57,500
You can say you cannot paved roads during the summer because asphalt fumes.

281
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:02,630
Have you seen producing ozone? Again, not very popular.

282
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:16,430
You can say if you don't do these things, I'm going to take away your EPA funding for maintaining or building wastewater systems,

283
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:22,670
your roads and highways, things like this. Again, not very popular.

284
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,510
EPA would pretty much shoot themselves in the foot if they did that.

285
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,560
Okay, so there's issues, but anyway, it's allowable.

286
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:41,330
And then PTSD prevention of significant deterioration.

287
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,830
What this means is that if you have an area which is relatively clean or very clean,

288
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:56,420
and I tell you, the ozone level is 70 parts per billion, the PPM level is 12, etc.

289
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:01,340
Does that mean you can go in there, construct a facility, pollute up to that level?

290
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:09,890
No. The scheme is to prevent clean areas from getting dirty.

291
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:18,230
And they do this by setting up a two year increment, which is typically five or 10% of the standard.

292
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,399
So the most you might be able to pollute for PPM, for example,

293
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:28,640
in a pristine area is additional one microgram, something like that, rather than 12, which is the standard.

294
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:39,030
So Title one is supposed to take polluted areas, bring levels down and keep clean areas clean.

295
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:46,680
This is amazingly complicated. Have you seen anything like this before?

296
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:54,430
It's not one sentence. It's mostly a hammer. From a policy standpoint.

297
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:04,170
That's interesting. Okay. We'll come back to it again when we talk about the actual title to his mobile sources.

298
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:10,600
And if you have bought a car in the last 30 years, there's an EPA sticker on it.

299
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:16,680
It has requirements for different pollutants, NOx, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide.

300
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:21,270
It says that your catalytic converter has to last at least eight years.

301
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:26,910
We reformulate gasoline to reduce emissions.

302
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:32,970
For example, in a summertime, the volatility of the gasoline is reduced.

303
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:37,980
So not so much evaporates in the winter.

304
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:44,730
If you burn that gasoline, your car won't start because there's not enough volatility to actually have ignition.

305
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:52,650
So they put back some of the volatility. So the read vapor pressure or the volatility is adjusted seasonally.

306
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:02,610
Title one. Title two primarily has to do with the six pollutants regulated as max.

307
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,410
Title three is called Hazardous Pollutants or the Toxics.

308
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,460
This is a long story.

309
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:18,710
Also, Congress that enabled EPA to identify additional pollutants in the original Clean Air Act besides the original six or seven and regulated.

310
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:24,380
After 20 some years, EPA had a handful of additional pollutants.

311
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:28,760
It was a hugely burdensome, litigious process.

312
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:34,910
So Congress got fed up and said, okay, here's 189, you're going to regulate.

313
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:46,460
And EPA developed what's called maximum achievable control technologies, and this applied to larger sources greater than ten tons per year.

314
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,179
And there's an interesting risk assessment process that's used.

315
00:36:50,180 --> 00:37:03,989
I'll show you that in a second. In the mid-eighties, we started seeing forest dieback in high altitude lakes in the Adirondack Mountains,

316
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:07,320
for example, in New York State, due to acid rain.

317
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:18,510
And so this 1990 amendments included acid rain provision, which required utility emissions of sulfur,

318
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:27,720
mostly SO2, but again form sulfuric acid to be reduced and a 20% reduction in NOx, which also can form an acid.

319
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:36,450
And the innovation here offered, by the way, by the late John Dingell from Michigan,

320
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:46,770
was to allow the states east of the Mississippi River to buy and sell credits to achieve these reductions.

321
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:53,910
And so this innovative trading program helped politically.

322
00:37:54,360 --> 00:38:05,070
And this was passed. The other permits are relatively less important for us.

323
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:13,290
There's a fee program. Title six does deal with ozone depleting chemicals to protect the stratospheric ozone level.

324
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,320
This is driven by really compliance with the Montreal Protocol.

325
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:25,320
There's enforcement and miscellaneous provisions. The key one is Title one.

326
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,010
The national of air quality standards are listed in this slide.

327
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:36,480
The evolution of these things changes because every five years the standards are supposed to be reviewed,

328
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,480
and there are also short and long term standards.

329
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:49,620
What's amazing to me is for 50 years, the form of these have hardly has hardly budged.

330
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,130
For many cases, there have been changes, but not that much.

331
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:59,910
Sulfur dioxide is regulated 80 micrograms per cubic meter annual average.

332
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:08,339
There's some short term standards 24, three hour, one hour ppm is a much bigger concern.

333
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:13,110
Many more areas are effective. PM ten used to be the standard.

334
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:22,200
Now we're looking at smaller particles. PM to five people want to look at PPM one because that's even more dangerous.

335
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,540
But we're not there yet. This is currently under review.

336
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:29,610
Changes at 12 down to eight or ten maybe.

337
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:37,980
W.H.O. has a guideline of five. There's a short term standard on a 24 hour basis.

338
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:43,920
Kurt Monoxide doesn't affect so many people. Most areas are compliance.

339
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:49,860
Ozone has changed over the years. It's currently eight our standard set to 70 parts per billion.

340
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:58,680
Nitrogen dioxide is hardly ever exceeded and there's an LED standard as well, which is interesting because it dropped ten fold.

341
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:05,090
Yes. Why is Kim one more dangerous than that?

342
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:16,640
It's a good question. When you look at PM 25, it actually includes a lot of the course combustion, aerosol pollens and train dust and so forth.

343
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:25,580
Those particles don't penetrate down into the alveolar region of your lung and they also have less toxic material associated with them.

344
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:38,450
So there are a lot of lab studies, mostly comparing epi studies are limited by monitoring data and so forth, so it's harder to separate one.

345
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:45,020
But we'd kind of like to focus on the ones that penetrate deeper into our respiratory system.

346
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:54,230
So can B be like smaller? So the is smaller.

347
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,240
Now, there's also interest in dealing with ultra fines. These are less than point one.

348
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:08,660
Okay. And these are a very high surface area. And so if you have surface active toxicity, then this could be really important.

349
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:12,750
We don't know how to measure these reliably. Okay.

350
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:17,930
Which is pretty essential for a standard. So that's another issue, too.

351
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:33,420
Good. Other questions? So currently the PM to five standard is under review.

352
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:42,490
There's an integrated science assessment which is the scientific background for understanding the health effects.

353
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:47,070
It used to be called the criteria document which has been assembled in your homework.

354
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:52,380
If you want, I provide a link, I think, to the CO2 Integrated Science Assessment.

355
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:59,310
This is kind of like the world's biggest metal study. So they're taking all the literature and trying to assemble it together.

356
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:04,110
And so this is justified as a standard based on all literature.

357
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:11,770
Okay. So a lot of notes for the next.

358
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,530
They have changed a little bit. They've gone down a bit in time.

359
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:25,270
The averaging time sometimes changes. The goal is to protect the most sensitive cohort.

360
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,820
There is no calculation of cost in setting these standards.

361
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:33,040
It's very different from the occupational standards.

362
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:47,400
You can read some of the impacts of these pollutants I showed you last week, the health metrics folks assessment of deaths from air pollution.

363
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:55,870
Most of it was driven by PPM. Okay, so PPM is probably the most significant one from aggregate health perspective.

364
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:10,420
EPA spends a lot of time with hundreds of folks involved in each pollutant in this process depicted here.

365
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:22,870
I've mentioned this integrated science assessment, providing the science background for developing the standards and for policy.

366
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,640
There are two types of nacs. One is the primary standards.

367
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:40,120
These are used to protect public health, the law, the language and the law.

368
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:45,550
We need to have an adequate margin of safety. And that, again, is for the most sensitive cohort.

369
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:50,350
There is a secondary standard, which is materials and welfare related.

370
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:56,260
It is interesting. For example, the ozone standard is currently 70 parts per billion.

371
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:05,860
But if you're a farmer growing, I don't know, vines with grapes or alfalfa, you might start to see damage to the leaf stomata.

372
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:09,760
The thing at the bottom of leave that takes care and at a lower concentration,

373
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:18,670
there is a secondary standard which is designed to protect that in the formative days of these standards.

374
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:28,630
Most of the secondary impacts were things like rubber cracking due to ozone exposure, discoloration of surfaces.

375
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:32,790
Because you hang out your laundry, it gets dirty. Okay.

376
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:43,990
We're kind of beyond that at this point in this country. Are any of you using sensors in your work or you've heard of like air quality sensors,

377
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:49,990
like Purple Ear or even this thing that I bring around here is a little air quality sensor.

378
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:54,040
You can measure these pollutants using lots of low cost sensors,

379
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,770
but they don't give you any ability to check the standards because EPA wants you to

380
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:04,750
use what's called a reference monitoring method or an FAA federal reference method.

381
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:11,380
And this is a method that is supposed to have, you know, a lot of high quality to it.

382
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:20,590
And typically they kind of look like this for particulate matter.

383
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:33,370
And then the gaseous equipment is put in a trailer and these odd shape boxes have the sensors inside and then the top stuff.

384
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:40,540
It's basically different techniques to stratify the particles so that they measure PM10 or PM to five or whatever.

385
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:52,479
And these things are all over the world, typically with a weather station and the instruments inside are typically mounted on a rack.

386
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,650
This particular one in a trailer just allows you to see what the instruments look like.

387
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:07,750
In Michigan, we have about 40 to 50 different sites where pollutants are measured.

388
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:16,270
And I showed you some pictures already in the Detroit area and some other pictures as well.

389
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:27,750
It is an example for Esso to. This Southwest high school site, which is right over here, typically had the highest levels.

390
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:35,130
The standard is the staff line. This is the site that drove noncompliance, not attainment.

391
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:44,190
The other sites were lower and as a result of this, for years, a couple of years back,

392
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:50,250
we were we defined this area and read as non attainment in the homework.

393
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:59,310
One of the documents refers to Detroit, but because there's so many different S0 two sources, it's too complicated for you guys to look at.

394
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:10,250
I do have sympathy on you for the homework. Okay. So I'm giving you a somewhat simpler as though to not attainment from around Alpena, Michigan, okay.

395
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:13,800
Which is a pretty rural area, but there's some big cement facilities.

396
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:38,819
You know, one thing that this slide doesn't point out too well, but you can see, for example,

397
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:46,560
Detroit Edison's Monroe power plant has also two emissions on the order of 85,000 tons per year.

398
00:47:47,450 --> 00:48:01,409
And this facility has four coal fired boilers, each one of them, you know, Modern Supercritical, I think it's 750 or so megawatt electric.

399
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:06,360
So it's pretty big. It's about as big as they get. And as for, they all have scrubbers.

400
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,930
Okay. If you took off those scrubbers, emissions would be at least ten times higher.

401
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:15,870
Maybe 20 times higher. Okay.

402
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:25,290
And you have to think in the Clean Air Act, when that was written, there weren't scrubbers, there weren't particle filters on these facilities.

403
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:32,160
And the emission rates were so much higher than what you have at this point.

404
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:41,550
It's almost hard for us to imagine sometimes when I give a talk to even a very astute audience like air pollution regulators,

405
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:50,460
and I show them an old grainy picture of what the Detroit riverfront used to look like where you could hardly see.

406
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:56,520
And I asked them, what year was this? And they all say, oh, 19, 20, 1930.

407
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,600
But it's not. It could be the sixties or seventies. Okay.

408
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:05,400
But after that, things transformed a lot. This law, in fact, was really successful.

409
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:19,180
One of the techniques and you're going to do this in your homework to understand local transport is to draw a wind rose.

410
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:25,240
And here I have superimposed wind roses on top of the top of the map.

411
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,670
And we're going to get more into groups.

412
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,930
We're going to go. I lost my picture here.

413
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:44,670
We're going to get more into these things. But basically, these white roses are defined around the compass points.

414
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,020
The sector, where the wind blows the most, has the longest arm.

415
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,780
And then the different colors here are showing the different wind speeds.

416
00:49:55,410 --> 00:50:00,510
You can see them up at the top here. And I'll talk more about this briefly in a few minutes.

417
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:08,040
There are so many different sources for data and some of these are also listed in your homework assignment.

418
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,590
I'm going to close out on the next and then we'll take a break.

419
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,820
You know, we do a lot of occupational work as well.

420
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:30,630
And people look at the PPM standard in particular, you know, which is 12 micrograms, probably coming down to ten, maybe eight.

421
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:42,630
Again, W.H.O. wants five and then you go into a workplace, could be a furniture maker, could be a repair place, it could be a production facility.

422
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:52,010
You say, what's the right standard in a workplace? Well, there isn't really a PM to five standard.

423
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:55,790
There is a PM standard 10,000.

424
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:04,280
That's ten milligrams per cubic meter. You can probably relate to MG okay.

425
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:09,090
As compared to a few micrograms in the environment.

426
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:20,850
What's the difference? Why are we willing to have such higher standards or levels in a workplace than in the environment?

427
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:28,170
Yeah. You mean like shorter duration? Yeah.

428
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:37,470
So that explains, like, 2.4% or 2.4 factor because you work 8 hours compared to being 24 seven.

429
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:43,650
I should say three factor of three. Factor of three doesn't explain the difference between 12 and 10,000.

430
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:57,570
What else? In the workplace they're filtering in now, but the success of the standard is still 10,000.

431
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:01,490
So despite the filters, you're still wearing protective.

432
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:05,749
Exactly. So that's one difference that you do use at times.

433
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:09,620
PPE, personal protective equipment. Okay.

434
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:15,760
What else? Any other thoughts?

435
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:25,470
Yeah. Using an industry that there is going to be higher levels of pollutants when you.

436
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:36,650
It's all for care and. More care is being considered for that industry.

437
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,260
I'm not sure I follow. If it was more care, I would expect a lower level.

438
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:58,660
Yeah. Okay. Just maybe because like any industry, you are grinding, you know, like grinding and slickers coming off.

439
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:07,270
Yeah, I mean, not for health reasons, but that industry actually needs it to be ahead of its time so that they can.

440
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:15,550
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think you're on to something that they're actually doing something with a value to it that is essential for that.

441
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:24,910
So there is a sort of profit or necessity or something like that, and workers are being paid in the contrast in the environment.

442
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:30,580
Nobody's paying you to breathe polluted air. So there is this equity issue that way.

443
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:38,229
Yeah, these are all part of the answer. A couple of other factors is that when I explain the national air quality standards,

444
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:43,480
I said that they're designed to protect the most sensitive cohort of the population without regard to cost.

445
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,050
Right. The occupational standards consider costs and feasibility.

446
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,860
Okay. So that's a big difference as well then.

447
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:56,380
There are lots of other factors. The way they're set up, the occupational standards have much more industry input.

448
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,860
There's a industry there's a healthy worker effect. You can't take it in the workplace.

449
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:07,540
You quit leaving people who maybe don't have chemical sensitivities and things like this.

450
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:19,059
You probably don't have occupations that are very hazardous with asthma, with pregnant women in it and so forth.

451
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,370
Again, part of a healthy worker aspect.

452
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:27,940
So there's a number of differences that go back to the formulation and the implementation and design of standards.

453
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:32,410
Just be work. Break 25 minutes, please.

454
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:47,960
I will. On your way back here, put out a new homework here so you can see the groups and then hard copies of your homework form comparing.

455
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,630
Where you go to remove.

456
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:17,140
This is the new one. The old one.

457
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,510
Any particular reason? Yeah. Oh, okay.

458
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:43,550
Near the village table. Well, it. Yeah.

459
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:52,860
No one is going to root on them, but you probably can't read what I wrote.

460
00:55:52,860 --> 00:56:01,950
So I thought about what was important. You know, I have writing is unfortunately, it gets worse every year and it seems to do anything.

461
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,020
Uh, unless you're going to do it, you're good.

462
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:19,520
Did you have some questions for me that I didn't get to? Yeah.

463
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:27,860
Yeah. So I sent you the 26 year book, The Math, and then we still need to map those 15.

464
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,730
Yeah, I didn't see. Did you do that? No. Yeah, no.

465
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:35,720
I'd like to see where the sites live with respect to the airports.

466
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:41,810
Okay. So, so and then somehow on the maps show what the levels are of the formaldehyde.

467
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:51,500
But I do want to plug in whatever this person delivers shouldn't really matter so much.

468
00:56:51,800 --> 00:57:02,180
Um, but I don't know if there is a fast way, maybe never a fast way to actually get like the data in there,

469
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:10,430
you know, and then switch, you know, to, to show my little box with the table around each monitor.

470
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:16,740
Or you could just do a bar graph or whatever.

471
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:28,230
You could write it on it. I don't care. But I mean, you know, it'd just be nice to be able to show sort of some of the data that we have,

472
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:34,740
because what we're trying to understand here is the is there a proximity effect?

473
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:42,720
So do these locations very close have a much higher level than locations farther away?

474
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:47,960
I try to rig this relationship. Right.

475
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:51,450
And in the thing is, what you're regressing is like a centroid.

476
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:55,950
And so that's not a very useful thing.

477
00:57:56,190 --> 00:58:05,220
So what I thought was just displaying what the numbers were would allow us to sort of interpret it more directly.

478
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:17,260
Mm hmm. So only do one geographical metabolic graphs, which I don't do.

479
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:22,540
Graphs are going to be helpful because I don't think they show enough information because we have to know where things are.

480
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:29,760
Right. And so, I mean, you could do the map showing location.

481
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:32,860
Some of them have a number of sites. Others don't have many.

482
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:37,580
And then. I.

483
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:42,800
I mean, we need to see what the levels are.

484
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:55,159
So I had to get the chance to look at 2086 approved by 86 because I used different dataset to Lester would discuss

485
00:58:55,160 --> 00:59:04,760
about the passengers and other things to find the Missouri airports where I got another dataset that has been.

486
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:08,830
But I think what you have to do is you have to make some decisions here. Okay.

487
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,590
In there. I mean, if there's no monitor within five kilometers.

488
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:19,390
Yeah. Then you've got it at 345 B Airforce.

489
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:24,800
Okay. They have I mean, the alert based on this passenger.

490
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:29,640
Okay. And then. Within five kilometers or something.

491
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,990
Okay. So that's 46, 45 maybe.

492
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:46,050
And and then if we increase more like ten kilometer, 30 kilometers, which is more I think 13 is very high.

493
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:51,870
Yeah. Well, in that case, you might want to do a plan and then see.

494
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:59,580
But I mean, the concern I have is that the if you're just plotting from the centroid, some of these airports are pretty big.

495
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:04,870
But yeah, give that a try first. Did you do that? Yeah, I send you that.

496
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:07,079
But there's I'm saying that you still do.

497
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:15,090
I need to plug in because I changed the criterion even though there we didn't get an airport because then, I mean,

498
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:25,530
the only concept that closes jumper or or integrated you got at least 40, 40 have to be in there within five km.

499
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:30,870
Right. But do you have how many sites do you have in the area?

500
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:36,660
Because you have one within five. And then are there any other sites I can check?

501
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:44,819
Okay. Maybe no. Okay. But so if there are more sites, then I think we want to point out that it's okay.

502
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:46,740
If there aren't any, then it doesn't make any sense.

503
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:55,650
But I think you have to look at these individually to get a sense of what's going on, because a distance measure is just not enough.

504
01:00:55,980 --> 01:01:02,250
Right. You know, and like the one in O'Hare, the Chicago airport, it's right at the edge of the runway.

505
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:11,260
Right. Okay. But it's two K or more from the centroid, so that doesn't help you do the same.

506
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:19,940
So I think you need to just go in and and look, I think and then what I do is I just do a screengrab so I recorder so I don't have to do it again.

507
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:36,220
That because you think. Oh. Feels good.

508
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:49,010
Yeah. So we don't have like a final for this class of partners, right.

509
01:01:54,990 --> 01:02:10,910
The. And do we get to, like, a lot of these while we look at the, uh.

510
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:18,500
Oh, sure. Yeah. I don't want to bet. Oh, yeah.

511
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:25,760
A drink. We're doing something for you guys.

512
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:50,430
So there are you know, I would suggest contacting your partner or partners in one place to figure out the logistics on this.

513
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:56,460
Then you'll be results back in three weeks that be permanent.

514
01:02:56,790 --> 01:03:02,040
I love it. Is there going to be another like in class question?

515
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:05,640
Yeah, yeah. We're going to do that. We'll do some of that next week.

516
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:12,980
Okay. And so that our last class we have one of two classes.

517
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:19,160
Yeah. So it'll be, we'll do some next week and then maybe a little bit the following week as well.

518
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:27,130
Okay. On here, there are some options in terms of the software.

519
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:36,200
This can be a snag. So don't wait until the last minute. I want you to download a nice program from our friends at Lakes Environmental.

520
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,100
It's a consulting firm. They make available some freeware.

521
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:46,940
One of the programs I'll demo next week is called Scream three.

522
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:52,400
It is a easy to use dispersion model with a nice graphical interface.

523
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:58,370
You need to go to their site. This is described on page two.

524
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:08,930
Actually, they call screen view. So what they've done is they've taken an EPA model written by the way, in Fortran,

525
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:17,780
developed a nice user interface and they've made it available for free in the hope that you will buy their fancier software.

526
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:25,400
Okay, but these guys are okay. They don't bother you or anything if you register and then download the model.

527
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:30,050
But do that because it takes a day maybe for your name to clear.

528
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:34,550
And then if you have a mac you may have a problem.

529
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:47,210
So you may need to find another place to run it. Okay. I'm also saying that you can download also from the same place, something called w r plot.

530
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:51,920
This does the wind roses, but in fact there's an easier way to do this.

531
01:04:52,790 --> 01:05:02,330
And that's the last bullet on page two, which is to use what Noah supports at five or six different regional centers.

532
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:05,660
The one I'm using here is the Mid-Western Regional Climate Center.

533
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:12,140
I think they're at Purdue right now, and they have some easy to use software, and I'll demo that for you as well.

534
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:18,110
And that allows you to get literally data from thousands of airports very, very easily.

535
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:22,220
And in some ways, it's nicer than your.

536
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:33,670
CLARK Okay. But you're definitely going to need a little time to get both of these pieces of software.

537
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:40,660
Okay. So next week, you don't know a little bit of the roses in the plotting.

538
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,190
Yeah, we'll see what we have time for, but I'll definitely get into one of them. Okay.

539
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:52,700
How long will the results of the last one be up? Oh, I'll just leave it through.

540
01:05:52,710 --> 01:06:11,520
You have to turn. And this screen view program is used by regulators.

541
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,780
So it's a real piece of software used by lots of different folks.

542
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:25,920
Okay. Typically, they move into a different piece of software when they need more sophisticated analysis.

543
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:30,690
This is a screening program that allows you to get very quick answers.

544
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:43,010
Okay. Still extensively used. And again, I'm happy to answer questions like, okay, back to Clean Air Act.

545
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,200
So again, the Knicks are six pollutants out of potentially thousands that are out there.

546
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,710
Congress to find actually 190 compounds.

547
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,880
They didn't understand that two of them were the same thing. They just had different names.

548
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:06,910
And so there is actually 189 and is an interesting thing because many of these are smaller sources and some of them are larger sources.

549
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:15,520
The strategy was to do industry specific standards using so-called MAC technology, maximum achievable control technology.

550
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:20,800
This is somewhat flawed because it's based on best demonstrated control technology.

551
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,850
It's not technology forcing. And so, you know,

552
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:33,280
EPA looks and sees what industry is achieving and then sort of sets the floor at the best level that industry is currently achieving.

553
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:39,550
Very different strategy was taken for the next thing where technology forcing the meat industry to do more.

554
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:45,040
This can apply to major sources as well as smaller sources considered area sources.

555
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:49,750
What's also very interesting with this approach, if you are a risk or risk assessor,

556
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:54,880
is the explicit use of risk assessment in setting these standards.

557
01:07:55,540 --> 01:08:04,990
And for carcinogens after setting maximum achievable control technologies, a certain amount of time went by to implement them.

558
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:11,230
And then EPA was to do a health based risk assessment and see if the level of residual risk,

559
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:15,400
i.e. after these sources have been cleaned up, was acceptable.

560
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:24,820
And this is one of the few cases where a law actually specified the level of cancer risk, which is one in a million.

561
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:38,680
Okay. So the process is interesting for those reasons.

562
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:42,790
It applied to a number of different pollutants.

563
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:46,330
EPA said 189. That's too many to work on.

564
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:56,049
They prioritize. Here's 33. Split up by volatility and mixtures of organic inorganic.

565
01:08:56,050 --> 01:09:04,780
In the very volatile compounds we have these chemicals, including unsaturated compounds that are very reactive.

566
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:09,190
These are also carcinogens. We have volatile organics.

567
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:13,420
These are both aromatics as well.

568
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:18,100
Many compounds and others. Semi volatiles.

569
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:23,980
Probably the best known is to 373 CBD or what people just call dioxin.

570
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:27,700
Okay. There's lots of other containers, of course.

571
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:33,980
EPA also regulates mixtures, including things like cucumber emissions.

572
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:46,150
And then there's a number of inorganic. And so the process is just depicted on this slide where EPA had the 189 compounds.

573
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:52,300
Boiled it down to 33 developed source categories, came up with maximum achievable control technologies,

574
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:58,840
gave a three year window to apply these to industry did monitoring.

575
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:05,410
After that, if the level was too high, then based on a reasonable residual risk,

576
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:09,670
i.e. more than one in a million, there's a need for additional standards.

577
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:14,420
And if not, then you can go and provide permits.

578
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:25,029
There were other they tried to build in some incentives for early adoption and things like this that are shown off in some of the boxes to it.

579
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:28,209
Right. Again, a pretty complicated process.

580
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:32,710
This involves lots of people, the EPA. Oops.

581
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:37,110
Well. Okay. I would be.

582
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:48,200
Somebody is taking over. I would be remiss not to talk about greenhouse gas pollutants in this unit.

583
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:52,940
So I'm not going to spend too much time. These aren't conventional plumes.

584
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:57,500
They're not regulated under the Clean Air Act directly and indirectly.

585
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:07,820
Everyone's aware of this increase in temperature projections are not positive right now.

586
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:12,140
We're going to need we're staying within 1.5 degrees to the end of the century.

587
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:18,410
What's happened today is about 1.1 degree increase.

588
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:27,980
The drivers, based on the later assessment reports, are primarily carbon dioxide, methane,

589
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:36,070
smaller contributions from nitrous oxide somehow, which are gases and some from viruses.

590
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:42,740
And then there is some offsets and cooling actually that occurs most of it due to sulfur dioxide.

591
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:46,850
And the reason is that sulfur dioxide produces ammonium sulfate.

592
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:51,050
This is a whitish, very small particle that reflects sunlight.

593
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:56,419
Okay. So it actually leads to a cooling. And so it's quite interesting.

594
01:11:56,420 --> 01:12:00,650
Adding new scrubbers to old whole facilities removes that.

595
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:06,230
So to okay, it improves health conditions locally, but in fact it increases warming.

596
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:19,970
Okay, but and if you sum the positive bars, the negative bars, you come up with a 1.1 degree shift shown here.

597
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:30,830
Organic carbon also can form these small particles and reflect some of the sunlight.

598
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:35,719
On the other hand, other organic carbon called black carbon does the opposite.

599
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:43,700
It absorbs solar radiation. So carbon is quite complicated and then later transferred.

600
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:47,000
And the impacts are just summarized here and I'll let you read this.

601
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:56,120
So COP 27 was extended a couple of days to this weekend because there were some agreements reached

602
01:12:56,120 --> 01:13:04,340
in the US turning its stance around that they are going to provide support for at risk nations.

603
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:07,670
It's not clear how much money, so that's quite a positive result.

604
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:17,389
Okay to wrap this up. Looks different from occupational standards.

605
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:20,930
It's health based, not based on cost or technical feasibility.

606
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:28,490
If we look around in the US, the most problematic criteria a pollutant could be considered to be ozone.

607
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:32,000
It's a secondary pollutant because it's so widely distributed.

608
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:36,980
On the other hand, PPM probably causes a larger health impact in aggregate.

609
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:43,160
This is largely combustion related. We didn't talk very much about source standards.

610
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:52,070
We talked about ambient standards like Max. Max Maximum Achievable Control technology is an example of source standards,

611
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:59,120
but EPA has a whole slew of regulations implemented by the states called source standards.

612
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:06,500
So, for example, if you are going to construct a new facility, you have to comply with these source standards.

613
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:17,150
Okay. Source standards also are what regulates emissions from your car's tailpipe as well as what we call non running losses.

614
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:21,620
Non I'm sorry, non tailpipe losses.

615
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:29,630
So these include things like volatile zation from the fuel tank or other components of the car's fuel system.

616
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:40,580
And those are also regulated, too. And by the way, it's EPA lab here in Ann Arbor that checks all of those standards.

617
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,090
They have some very interesting facilities if you have a chance to go there.

618
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:58,040
So, for example, one of the most interesting things is they have these boxes you drive a new vehicle into, okay, it is climate controlled.

619
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:05,570
The heat it up. They call it down. They measure the emissions that leak from anything in the car and that's controlled.

620
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:18,040
Okay. So. 189 pollutants called haps hazardous airplanes greatly expands EPA's authority.

621
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:24,250
Some of these are very problematic. Formaldehyde is one that we're looking at now.

622
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:29,560
It exceeds the risk base levels that we'd like almost everywhere that we look at.

623
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:41,080
And the current approach, again, uses these MAC controls with this risk assessment evaluation.

624
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:46,330
Okay, let me stop here. Questions on any of this regulation?

625
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:56,610
This may affect you very directly next year or the following year, because if you're in Michigan,

626
01:15:57,330 --> 01:16:03,510
because it looks like we may be moderate, not attainment for ozone, if that's the case,

627
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:08,370
then you will have to get your car inspected potentially once or twice,

628
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:16,830
once or once a year or every other year to make sure it's not producing the ozone emissions and NOx emissions that cause ozone.

629
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:20,640
But that would be a real big pain for everybody.

630
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:25,470
What makes something moderate non-attachment versus just nodding?

631
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:32,520
Yeah, so that's a good question. There are several different levels.

632
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:34,800
There's attainment.

633
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:46,230
Okay, agreement, low pollution levels, there is maintenance, which means that you have once perhaps been exceeding the standard, but now you're good.

634
01:16:47,430 --> 01:16:57,930
There is moderate, which I think means that over several cycles you've been above the standard and then there can be severe,

635
01:16:58,290 --> 01:17:01,730
which means like it's no question you're out of compliance, you know,

636
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:15,090
so Houston and L.A. and these other areas have been severe and without the controls, they could be much worse.

637
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:23,760
And so it's it's really hard to evaluate ozone controls.

638
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:35,730
I believe that for the other pollutants, they don't use this level of moderate and severe.

639
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:39,870
It's a yes or no. EPA has something called a little green book.

640
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:46,440
Don't ask me why it was published screen and you could look it up on the web and see which areas are in treatment or which aren't.

641
01:17:48,600 --> 01:18:02,210
Good questions. Who regulates how and who regulates the people and in their core aspects of like how to go about the current situation.

642
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:16,520
Yeah. Good. Depends where you live. Uh, if I lived in California, uh, you drive to a state sanctioned facility, which is able to do that.

643
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:20,750
And I don't remember how much you have to pay if you're on the East Coast.

644
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:26,810
The approach was that the states, at least some of the states, set up state run facilities.

645
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:37,340
And the difference is interesting. And then if you're in New York, you go to a garage and the garage tests you, and if you're out of compliance,

646
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:42,380
you can sort of fool around with a carburetor or something or get you back in compliance and certify you.

647
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:53,419
So they'll do both repairs as well. Inspection, that's a little bit frowned on because it may not work as effectively in Europe when I've done it.

648
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:57,230
It's always been at a state facility. Yeah.

649
01:18:57,740 --> 01:19:02,450
Just to make sure that I'm understanding correctly what you're mentioning is the equivalent to a smog.

650
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:06,980
Exactly. Yeah, smog check. But I don't like to use that word.

651
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:11,090
I know. So yeah. But that's a great way to say.

652
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:19,520
Yeah. Yeah. You know, these days it's very interesting because if you buy a gas appliance like a leaf blower,

653
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:26,930
okay, it actually produces probably more VOCs than your big SUV.

654
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:33,260
Okay. And now they've started to put a little catalytic converters on there, bring it down and they work.

655
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:39,470
So and that's the problem with ozone,

656
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:48,170
because if it is both limited and this means that we have to clamp down more on the AC emissions and they're really, really hard to do that.

657
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:54,800
Okay. There's so many sources that release bosses, including as one of our former president said, vegetation.

658
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:56,149
Okay.

659
01:19:56,150 --> 01:20:06,590
So Isoprene and these other terpene oils are released by pine trees and other vegetation, and they actually can form ozone if there's NOx around.

660
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:13,510
It takes combustion products to produce NOx. Okay.

661
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:18,700
So the question is what works if you work in this field?

662
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:24,310
This is really important. It drives a lot of the policy decisions, of course.

663
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:29,290
One pollutant I didn't talk about is shown in these pictures.

664
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:33,490
It's visibility. Okay. It's actually regulated like a pollutant.

665
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:41,080
The difference in these views in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia is not ag or haze.

666
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:47,850
It's particulate matter. If you guys go out to the Grand Canyon or someplace, you'd like to see for Miles.

667
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:52,840
Right. And so EPA has been regulating visibility for many, many years.

668
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:56,510
Okay. To try to clamp down on diminishment of views.

669
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:03,400
Let me start that. These are probably from the seventies.

670
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:17,740
Okay. The world. But in the Grand Canyon area, the best known source are the coal fired power plants of the Four Corners region.

671
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:24,730
If you've been out there. These are massive power plants and you could see their plumes for hundreds and hundreds of miles.

672
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:35,630
And they would diminish your view of the canyon at times. So that kind of brings us into the next topic, which is air pollution meteorology.

673
01:21:36,110 --> 01:21:40,730
This could be like some of the other things in this course semester long sequence.

674
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:49,250
I'm going to give you in a very short time some of the fundamentals to understand urban scale or local scale dispersion.

675
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:53,810
And the key areas that I'm going to focus on are listed here.

676
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,620
We've talked already a little bit about layers of the atmosphere.

677
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:03,920
You guys can envision winds, but there are some very interesting patterns that we're going to talk about.

678
01:22:04,490 --> 01:22:10,670
Temperature profiles are what we call lapse rates. This is a key parameter we need to spend a little bit of time on.

679
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:22,070
Wind speeds, wind speed profiles, stability, inversions and stability lapse rate are all critical to understand the impact of local sources.

680
01:22:23,450 --> 01:22:29,120
We're going to be looking at a subset of air pollution meteorology, which is in turn a subset of general meteorology.

681
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:32,120
We're not going to get too much into air pollution chemistry.

682
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:39,500
This is yet another extension of this work where we're dealing with formation of secondary plumes.

683
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:46,520
To get started, we already talked about the troposphere first ten kilometers of the atmosphere.

684
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:52,550
What's interesting in the troposphere, besides that, we live there is the temperatures,

685
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:57,920
the temperatures decline with heights following what we call standard lapse rate.

686
01:22:57,940 --> 01:23:07,220
We're going to talk about this in a lot of detail. So when you're in that plane at ten kilometers up or higher, it's really cold outside.

687
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:13,730
Right. And it follows this line on average in the stratosphere.

688
01:23:15,170 --> 01:23:19,340
The next 30, 40 kilometers, temperatures actually start to increase.

689
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:26,090
But there's so few molecules, you know, around, it doesn't have a lot of inertia.

690
01:23:26,630 --> 01:23:31,940
Above this is the mesosphere thermosphere way out from where we are dealing with.

691
01:23:32,030 --> 01:23:35,180
We're just going to be dealing with things that happen in the troposphere.

692
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:40,910
This is where our weather takes place. Where the winds take place.

693
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,460
So temperature density rapidly decrease.

694
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:54,410
This typical slope is defined up here, 6.5 degrees C per kilometer.

695
01:23:55,490 --> 01:24:00,800
But this is a very dynamic process that changes from hour to hour, from place to place.

696
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:06,830
Generally we consider the troposphere well-mixed.

697
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:16,100
Okay. And so if you have a pollutant release and it's a long live pollutant, it will distribute up and down and around in the troposphere.

698
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:24,390
Okay. In contrast, the stratosphere is kind of like in a permanent inversion situation.

699
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,970
It's very stratified. It's very stable. And again, this is where the good ozone is.

700
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:38,459
Good things don't get transported between these layers very frequently, except in the case of, like, stratospheric intrusion,

701
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:46,410
one part of the stratosphere will dip down, and once in a blue moon, you'll actually have that occur and see an ozone hit or something like that.

702
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:50,190
But it's very unusual, very stable system.

703
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:57,700
So again, we're going to focus on the lower troposphere, the planetary boundary layer.

704
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:08,710
And this is where pollutants that are discharged from sources get dispersed, get diluted and transported by winds.

705
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,150
And I mentioned already the first 50 meters.

706
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:25,210
It's affected by stress and friction flowing around objects and layers and terrain above that geostrophic only affected by horizontal pressures.

707
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:41,740
So. If I go outside today, it's quite gusty, quite windy, and I have a weather vane showing me which direction the wind is blowing.

708
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:51,490
I get a pretty irregular trace typically. I mean, the extent of the variation depends on many factors, but it's quite random looking.

709
01:25:51,900 --> 01:26:07,570
Okay. And what this is actually depicting, in a sense, is the effect of things like eddies and spirals and heat and temperature differentials,

710
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,270
physical objects that all kind of interact,

711
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:20,590
that cause this dispersion or these eddies or these different differences in wind direction from minute to minute or point to point.

712
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:26,510
This is much faster than a diffusion process.

713
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:32,350
Again, a diffusion process is typically considered to be, you know, microscopic in scale.

714
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:40,660
This diffusion process with these larger eddies is due to both mechanical forces and thermal forces.

715
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,190
I'm going to get more into that.

716
01:26:48,270 --> 01:27:00,060
So if we look at just winds and wind speed and direction, essentially four factors that influence the vectors or the wind speed and direction,

717
01:27:00,330 --> 01:27:04,440
pressure, Coriolis force, convective circulation, surface friction.

718
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:10,440
And basically together this adds to turbulence which produces the mixing.

719
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:17,310
And I have the sequence of events or processes that affect concentrations.

720
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:25,980
Starting off with what affects turbulence and the temperature profile, the lapse rate influences the atmospheric stability.

721
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:31,170
The atmospheric stability is the tendency for air to mix in a vertical way.

722
01:27:31,170 --> 01:27:38,579
Primarily, this influences turbulence, the amount of turbulence influences mixing, the amount of mixing, influences dilution.

723
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:45,120
And then finally, when you have a source that dilution determines the concentration, you go back.

724
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:55,319
If this was a constant line without any mixing or dispersion, that would mean if I'm downwind of a source,

725
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:59,610
it'll always be coming to me, producing potentially very high concentrations.

726
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:03,150
But that's not what happens. It moves around. It's very random.

727
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:17,450
So we need to understand these for a first to be able to understand the ultimately the concentration that results from the source.

728
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:26,330
So I'm going to go over these quickly. And first, start off with pressure gradients.

729
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:30,450
You all have seen maps simplified here.

730
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:33,590
Here's a high pressure system. Here's a low pressure system.

731
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:40,100
What this means is an air mass is descending through the western U.S., compressing here a little bit.

732
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:51,860
Producing a local high. An increase in pressure now is because air is ascending coming up, sort of sucking here out, producing a low pressure.

733
01:28:52,650 --> 01:28:58,190
Okay. Well, just like water will flow from high location to location.

734
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:04,640
Air will flow from a high to a low as well following the pressure gradient.

735
01:29:05,110 --> 01:29:10,190
Okay. That's what we call the pressure gradient force.

736
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:20,360
And just like groundwater, this pressure gradient forces perpendicular to the lines of pressure.

737
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:23,660
Not here in this case, put pressure, atmospheric pressure.

738
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:33,640
Yeah. So is the pressure gradient like the force that's coming down or going up?

739
01:29:34,610 --> 01:29:39,580
No, the gradient is the difference between two locations.

740
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:45,760
Okay. And so, for example, this might be a high pressure with maybe 1010 millibars.

741
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:52,090
Okay. And because these both are on the same line, there's no difference between the pressure.

742
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:57,340
So there's no gradient at that point. But on this low might be 970.

743
01:29:57,610 --> 01:30:03,040
And so we have a 40 millibars difference. And so winds are going to flow from high to low pressure.

744
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:10,870
Okay. Now, the earth is not flat. The Earth is round, it's rotating.

745
01:30:11,290 --> 01:30:15,050
And we have complexity in this picture.

746
01:30:15,070 --> 01:30:19,780
We call this apparent force called the Coriolis force.

747
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:27,280
And what it basically means is the winds coming in are going to spiral in the

748
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:33,430
north and circle to the right and when it's descending out or spiral to the left.

749
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:37,780
And if you look at your weather map, you'll see this occurring,

750
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:43,900
whether it's a tornado or whether it's a hurricane, a low pressure system or a high pressure system.

751
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:50,980
This happens for a couple of reasons. But first, let me talk about convective circulation.

752
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:56,380
Take a very simple box picture, inflated room.

753
01:30:58,030 --> 01:31:01,180
I put a flame or some source of heat here.

754
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:09,130
Air is going to rise. It reaches the end of the box. So it's going to go horizontally, descend where it can, because there's a low pressure here.

755
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:14,950
So we have a convective cell. Okay. Driven by buoyancy due to temperature.

756
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:26,260
Okay. All right. Think of the Earth as being heated by the sun coming down most intensely at the equator.

757
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:34,300
This will be a hotter region. This air is going to rise just like it rose in my thermal self.

758
01:31:34,810 --> 01:31:39,549
It will disperse and come down at some other location,

759
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:47,560
forming a convective cell in a parallel convective cell in the opposite hemispheres north, south and north.

760
01:31:48,890 --> 01:32:00,320
Okay. This area coming down will induce a little more air with another potential convective cell in the mid-latitudes, both north and south.

761
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:04,220
And then often you'll see this in the polar latitudes as well.

762
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:08,750
There's so much more happening when it arises.

763
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:15,770
It cools right. When you're cools, it loses its capacity to hold water.

764
01:32:16,910 --> 01:32:19,970
Okay. And this results in precipitation.

765
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:21,470
Okay.

766
01:32:21,530 --> 01:32:35,200
So we have in the tropics a lot of rainfall because of the typical low pressure system that we have with this center here in the mid latitude region,

767
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:38,510
we often have deserts, okay.

768
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:46,220
Because there's high pressure systems that produce very little moisture overall and very smart as well.

769
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:51,440
And then further north, we have again ascending sending.

770
01:32:51,710 --> 01:33:02,080
And obviously this is all very simplified because the earth is hugely complex and I convective so the top of the box is formed by the tropical cause.

771
01:33:02,570 --> 01:33:05,630
This tropopause is dynamic. It comes up and down a little bit.

772
01:33:06,110 --> 01:33:11,390
It is typically lower as you get to more northerly or southerly regions.

773
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:20,129
You know, these pictures of the Coriolis force either go over or don't go over.

774
01:33:20,130 --> 01:33:23,280
So, you know, you can think of the Earth as rotating.

775
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:31,110
And if I have a ball that I roll across in this direction because of this rotation, it's going to appear to curve off to the right.

776
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:39,630
Okay. And that's as far as I'm going to go in describing Cornell's course, because it just never works on a 2D picture of the sort of two.

777
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:51,390
But that's basically the idea that what looks like it's going directly north in a rotating system will apparently look curved or will be curved.

778
01:33:51,630 --> 01:33:58,350
If you're your observer on the globe, there's some good YouTube videos you can watch.

779
01:33:58,470 --> 01:34:01,830
Yes, it will make a lot more sense in a video. Yes, it really does.

780
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:07,190
And I can't I can't say. So if you're curious, you send out that word.

781
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:13,080
Words easy to find. Yeah. Yeah. But if the earth wasn't spinning, it would be different.

782
01:34:13,290 --> 01:34:20,040
Okay. And that's important as well. So basically what this means from our air pollution standpoint is simple.

783
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:26,399
Here's a high pressure. Here's the low pressure. The gradient force just due to pressure.

784
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,910
Gradient would be perpendicular to those pressure lines. Okay.

785
01:34:30,210 --> 01:34:35,100
But because of the Coriolis force in the Northern Hemisphere, it curves things a little bit to the right.

786
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:42,570
So instead of the Air Castle moving along the red line, it's going to move more along the green line because of that.

787
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:50,520
Conventionally, what we would do is depict this, for example, with the geostrophic where.

788
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:54,980
Remember again, Geostrophic is about 500 or a thousand meter height.

789
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:59,130
We use symbol U as wind speed. This is the height.

790
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:06,930
That wind speed might be in this direction, but at the surface it's going to be rotated to the right in this picture by 15 degrees.

791
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:18,450
In a more severe case by, say, 50 degrees. You know, this is all I have to say is somewhat academic, because when you use meteorological information,

792
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:22,880
you get it either from monitoring stations or from a weather simulator.

793
01:35:22,890 --> 01:35:26,580
And so you should just understand why it diverges.

794
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:35,880
Okay. So winds at higher elevation typically are more counterclockwise than they are at lower levels.

795
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:40,320
And we're dealing with a three dimensional picture. So this can be important.

796
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:49,690
The degree of wind shift in these two pictures depends on a number of parameters,

797
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:54,010
including the height, what we call the surface roughness or how much friction there is.

798
01:35:54,430 --> 01:35:59,860
And again, this term called atmospheric stability. Okay.

799
01:36:00,910 --> 01:36:10,120
This picture is an attempt to put together and again, a YouTube video might be better, but basically we have convective cells at the equator.

800
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:16,540
We have descending air at so-called hoarse latitudes in a temperate area.

801
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:29,500
We have another convective cell. And interestingly, where we have air ascending and descending, there's not much velocity to it and put down.

802
01:36:29,830 --> 01:36:33,940
And the sailors knew this and their names were the doldrums.

803
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:38,200
Okay, you get stuck in your sailboat at the equator, you have no wind.

804
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:44,680
And the reason is because we have basically vertical you're more than horizontal jets.

805
01:36:44,690 --> 01:36:48,399
You're in the north and south about.

806
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:51,760
We've had the trade winds which will blow you westward.

807
01:36:52,090 --> 01:36:56,980
And then we have another section where air is descending.

808
01:36:57,100 --> 01:37:00,580
Again, there's not much horizontal velocity.

809
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:05,410
Sailors would get stuck here, too. They call these the horse latitudes and both north and south.

810
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:10,230
But they knew if they got above this westerly so they could sail back to Europe.

811
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:11,799
Okay.

812
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:20,920
So some of this stuff has been known for hundreds of years, but you should just understand that these are, again, sort of long term patterns useful,

813
01:37:21,490 --> 01:37:31,120
but they may not apply at any particular point in time, but they're just some of the larger influences on the on the weather patterns.

814
01:37:34,990 --> 01:37:45,430
At the building scale, the local scale, these influence how pollutants are dispersed.

815
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:49,480
We're going to start off simple. Here's the ground. Here's the building.

816
01:37:49,490 --> 01:37:56,680
Here's the smokestack. Typically, we're burning some sort of fuel, producing an elevated temperature,

817
01:37:57,700 --> 01:38:02,980
ejecting a plume out with some velocity because there's a fan or something driving it through the system.

818
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:11,440
So the stack height is here. The plume continues to ascend because it's hotter than the surrounding air.

819
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:19,330
So we have a buoyancy effect and because it's ejected with velocity, that leads to an inertial effect.

820
01:38:19,690 --> 01:38:26,370
Okay, the sum of those two is called plume rise and added to the stack.

821
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:31,600
Height determines to fine tune the high risk factor.

822
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:37,810
So all things being equal, a hotter plume goes higher because there's greater buoyancy.

823
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:42,310
A plume which is ejected faster goes higher.

824
01:38:43,630 --> 01:38:48,370
You guys, when you walk around campus and you look at a lot of lab buildings,

825
01:38:48,370 --> 01:38:59,290
you see these white sort of things on the roof, which are basically fans to take lab air and ejected out.

826
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:06,340
It's not heated that much, but they have a lot of momentum or a lot of inertia because it's moving a lot of air.

827
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:13,750
And that's designed to bring it away from a ground level because you don't want to know what's coming out of those labs,

828
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:18,790
vents and hoods and stuff like that. Okay. You want to get it away from the ground level?

829
01:39:22,270 --> 01:39:29,860
In the old days when energy was cheap and we had a pollution problem, we could just turn up the temperature, let this go up much higher.

830
01:39:31,150 --> 01:39:40,000
Okay. Now, power plants are trying to wring every jewel of energy out.

831
01:39:40,330 --> 01:39:48,790
So sometimes the exhaust gas temperature is not much hotter than the surrounding air, which means you no longer have much buoyancy.

832
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:56,500
Okay. And so what that means is plume rises reduced and you can have higher levels of pollution from your source.

833
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:06,950
It's a big role. We were looking at one AC power plant along the Ohio River Valley.

834
01:40:07,030 --> 01:40:10,890
Anyone been down there? Lots of coal fired power plants there.

835
01:40:11,910 --> 01:40:24,120
They were adding NOx controls using selective non catalytic reactors catalytic system to reduce NOx required coupons.

836
01:40:26,070 --> 01:40:33,240
This these facilities were so large that they could fill up the Ohio River Valley system in a matter of hours.

837
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:43,770
And because it wasn't heated enough to break free of in an inversion condition, it could really produce high concentration.

838
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:49,740
Okay. Anyway, the goal is typically to understand the plume center line, the height,

839
01:40:50,130 --> 01:40:54,960
and then the velocity at that center line to come up with the final plume height.

840
01:40:57,160 --> 01:41:04,150
I'm sorry. Yeah. Can you go over the center line again and how that is different to me?

841
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:10,170
Sure. Starfleet is a physical height, like a power plant.

842
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,100
This might be in the case of, um. I think it's.

843
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:17,130
They took it down. I don't know, maybe 200 feet.

844
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:25,200
And then, because the gas is coming out with a velocity and it's heated, typically hotter than surrounding air,

845
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:31,320
it will rise due to buoyancy and momentum and final height where stabilizes and levels off.

846
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:35,670
Might be, in this case, 300 to 1000 feet.

847
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:42,120
It could be much, much higher. This is important because the highest concentration would be along the two center line.

848
01:41:45,350 --> 01:41:48,890
And that's just where the most concentration.

849
01:41:49,190 --> 01:41:53,389
Exactly. Okay. And I'll show you some pictures in just a second.

850
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:58,010
Let me jump ahead. I got to jump in here to show you this.

851
01:41:59,270 --> 01:42:04,640
But typically, you know, the truth will come out and it will spread in each direction.

852
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:09,710
So the higher you get this height away from the ground, the lower the ground level concentrations will be.

853
01:42:11,690 --> 01:42:21,100
It will come back to the. Okay.

854
01:42:21,820 --> 01:42:27,580
An additional thing that happens is winds typically get faster as you go at higher elevation.

855
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:31,440
This is what we call the wind speed profile. There's a profile for life.

856
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:39,340
Here's one for day. It can be much, much faster at 100 or a couple hundred meters above the ground as compared to surface level.

857
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:44,770
Winds at airports are measured at ten meters height. Okay.

858
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:51,730
And that's pretty standard across the world. And you can see it ten meters high way down here.

859
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:56,530
You can see winds being several factors of that at higher elevations.

860
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:01,180
This also obviously affects travel time. Okay.

861
01:43:01,390 --> 01:43:08,620
So winds aloft go pretty fast. What brings this wind speed down from the friction at the surface?

862
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:19,360
Okay. It's trees, it's buildings, it's topography. So, in fact, if you have winds over a lake or the sea,

863
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:27,580
they very rapidly increase in velocity in comparison to, say, winds over a city which slow it down a lot.

864
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:33,459
This has a lot of implications for cooling and climate change,

865
01:43:33,460 --> 01:43:41,050
because if you're in a city and you want to have some nice breezes, the city itself cuts down wind speed.

866
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:45,310
So, in fact, you have less cooling from, you know, moving air.

867
01:43:49,750 --> 01:44:01,090
Typically a simple parallel is used to extrapolate the wins to height z whatever you want from the reference Z not using a power.

868
01:44:01,450 --> 01:44:06,790
P And there are some examples. For example, under neutral conditions.

869
01:44:06,790 --> 01:44:11,140
D The most common this P is typically .25.

870
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:16,780
So you might take a, I don't know, five meters per second.

871
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:25,480
And if you're interested in 100 meters elevation compared to your reference of ten, so it's ten to the 0.25 power.

872
01:44:25,780 --> 01:44:29,950
I don't know what that is, but probably the wind speed would be almost twice.

873
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:40,160
Okay. Based on this problem, all extrapolation. So here is, in fact a worked out example.

874
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:46,910
I'm interested in 150 meter height. I measure wind speed and tend to be three.

875
01:44:46,910 --> 01:44:51,830
I take the ratio, multiply it. And so it's again, just about twice the speed.

876
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:08,870
They talked about wind roses. And this is kind of a long term synopsis showing the joint frequency of wind direction and wind speed.

877
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:16,280
This is actually pretty similar to the homework, but it's older data from Alpina.

878
01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:23,570
Winds in this picture are mostly coming from the south, the west, the northeast.

879
01:45:27,630 --> 01:45:35,310
The middle area represents calms. These are when winds are typically below a meter per second, something like that.

880
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:40,020
So there's no real strong wind, no apparent wind direction, perhaps.

881
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:44,640
Couple of things. These represent long term statistics.

882
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:49,470
Okay. Winds could be very different today or tomorrow in the long term picture.

883
01:45:52,350 --> 01:45:57,930
They also average over the day or the year are typically constructed using five or ten years of data.

884
01:45:59,010 --> 01:46:07,320
So critical periods of interest might be when you're home, outdoors, barbecuing or something.

885
01:46:07,530 --> 01:46:12,090
You know, this isn't going to represent maybe an evening period for you.

886
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:16,499
Why is this important? Oh, well,

887
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:24,750
let's say you're considering buying a piece of property and you know that there's a paper mill or a wastewater treatment plant a kilometer away.

888
01:46:26,310 --> 01:46:37,260
If you were to look at the wind rows like this, or let's say you were interested in citing an emergency response headquarters for a chemical spill.

889
01:46:38,310 --> 01:46:47,180
Okay. What direction should you be from that spill or from the wastewater treatment plant or paper mill or whatever?

890
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:51,500
If this was your wind, rose, where would you want to live?

891
01:46:51,860 --> 01:46:56,850
In the Northeast. I live in the Northeast.

892
01:46:59,550 --> 01:47:03,060
Most of the time the plane is going to be going towards the northeast.

893
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:11,340
So I want to be southwest of that source.

894
01:47:11,970 --> 01:47:20,910
Okay. CONAN Three. So the wind is leaking from the center?

895
01:47:21,570 --> 01:47:25,200
No, no. These always show the direction the wind is coming from.

896
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:31,020
So the wind is coming in this direction or in this direction or in this direction.

897
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:34,960
It's rarely coming in this direction. Okay.

898
01:47:35,690 --> 01:47:40,160
Well, that's confusing. I read it backwards. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

899
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:45,110
But that's the way these are always drawn. I think it's where the wind is coming from.

900
01:47:46,070 --> 01:47:52,700
Okay, so most of this is an odd one because the wind is almost coming from all directions except from the northeast.

901
01:47:53,960 --> 01:48:03,060
Okay, so if I. You know, want to be not downwind.

902
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:12,030
Okay, then having the source to my northeast would produce lower concentration.

903
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:22,140
So being in the South was something like living there. You're getting less of the pool, but more of the men.

904
01:48:22,590 --> 01:48:26,040
No, no. We're making this too complicated. It's really not that complicated.

905
01:48:26,430 --> 01:48:30,800
But this is an odd one. Again, because the winds are coming from all directions with it.

906
01:48:31,050 --> 01:48:34,500
Let's just assume most of the winds are from the west. Okay.

907
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:37,920
So that means it's blowing to the east. So you don't want to live to the east?

908
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:43,190
Oh, okay. Yeah.

909
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:47,990
To clarify, uh, the concentric circles are just distances away.

910
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:51,910
And so these concentric circles, actually, I'm sorry, I should say this.

911
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:59,620
This is 2%, 4%, 6%. It's the fraction of the time that the wind is in that angle, in that work.

912
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:07,640
So in this case, coming from the West, it's three, four, six, 8% of the time it's in this one sector.

913
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:11,660
In this picture, we have 16 sectors, so each is 22 and a half degrees.

914
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:16,340
So within this 22 and a half degrees sector, it's coming 6% of the time.

915
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:26,420
This is a great compilation. I'm going to ask you to do this for piano or any report of your choice.

916
01:49:27,470 --> 01:49:40,550
This is just showing you what's happening in Detroit over seasons and these vary by season a lot currently were I guess in either I guess.

917
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:46,850
Spring, summer, fall, winter. We have a lot of winds.

918
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:52,340
We're coming from the southwest, maybe more pictures.

919
01:49:53,210 --> 01:49:57,410
This is where it's coming from. This direction, a long winter, actually.

920
01:49:57,890 --> 01:50:00,950
It's coming down from the northwest, west, northwest.

921
01:50:03,410 --> 01:50:06,780
How we doing on time? We're done. We'll pick up winds.

922
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:15,720
It's windy today. Think about those directions. Think about the last three dispersion on your have tailwinds for the week.

923
01:50:18,810 --> 01:50:25,030
Everybody pick up a copy of the homework and consider high numbers.

924
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:32,160
You're also talking about.

925
01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:38,870
And.
