1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,560
Another of points
that I really like;

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,885
that really resonated
with me is that,

3
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:14,835
people are often rational,

4
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:16,500
but not necessarily in the way

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,615
that others expect them to be.

6
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:20,130
Could you give our students of

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,595
health economics a couple of
examples to illustrate that?

8
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:25,560
Well, I think that
there's a couple of

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,630
aspects to this question.

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,890
One is what people
actually care about,

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,580
is often more complex

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,400
than our economic
models fully engage.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,750
When start drawing supply
and demand diagrams

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,765
and the rest of the
technical apparatus,

15
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:47,845
we're very focused on
economic outcomes.

16
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:50,780
Especially in healthcare,
there are things that

17
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,225
people care about that
are distinct from that.

18
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:55,040
One is people's
sense of dignity and

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,760
autonomy and social status.

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,810
Suppose that I have a problem.

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,010
I have an addiction
disorder and I show up

22
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,860
at the health care provider
who's trying to help

23
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:13,790
me stop smoking cigarettes
or stop misusing alcohol,

24
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,375
or whatever my issue is.

25
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,390
It may well be that
the best way to get

26
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,480
me off of that substance is

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,550
a very coercive intervention

28
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,105
but one that I find to be
violating my own dignity.

29
00:01:25,105 --> 00:01:27,680
That's not going to help
me if you offer me that.

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,765
First of all, I'm
not going to do it.

31
00:01:29,765 --> 00:01:33,350
Secondly, it might harm me even

32
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,685
if in fact it
addresses my problem.

33
00:01:36,685 --> 00:01:40,490
If it undermines my dignity
as a person or I feel like

34
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,800
the process by which
my care was provided

35
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,380
didn't really respect
me as a person,

36
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,540
you've actually injured me
and so if I were responding

37
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,820
as a patient in a way
that the physician

38
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,790
regards as non-adherent
or irrational.

39
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,500
It's not that I'm being
irrational is that I care about

40
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,240
my own dignity in the process.

41
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,435
If we think about actors,

42
00:02:03,435 --> 00:02:06,990
not patients but say
physicians in the hospital,

43
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,015
nurses in the hospital.

44
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:12,170
People care about how they are

45
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,110
treated in a way that
we can easily miss.

46
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,110
I do a lot of work with
people who are at risk of

47
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,170
a behavioral crisis
with first responders.

48
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,170
Say somebody who maybe has
a serious mental illness

49
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,020
or has some other issue
that might create

50
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,140
a potential risk that
they're going to get into it

51
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,260
with police officers or
ambulance folks whatever.

52
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,740
One of the real things that
we find is that some of

53
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,210
the best police officers who

54
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,180
respond to those types
of crises are women.

55
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,520
In a way that is
counter to some of

56
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,920
the priors that some of
our colleagues might have.

57
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,620
You might think, well, I
really should send a burly man

58
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,540
to that incident because

59
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,220
that's going to keep
everybody safe.

60
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,930
It turns out a lot of the people

61
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,105
who have these sorts of issues,

62
00:02:59,105 --> 00:03:02,780
it is easier for them to feel

63
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,760
like they can respond in

64
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,010
a more positive way
to a woman who says,

65
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,870
"You're talking really loud and

66
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,120
that's scaring these
children over here,

67
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,995
and if you could
just pipe it down

68
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:15,410
for me that I would
really appreciate it."

69
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,195
A lot of the people who are

70
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:19,870
in those types of
situations often can say,

71
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,965
"Oh, sure, of course I'll
be happy to do that."

72
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:23,815
Whereas if you tried to say,

73
00:03:23,815 --> 00:03:27,290
"I'm going to make you
quiet down because you're

74
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,520
scaring those children" and

75
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,525
I'm towering over
you to do that.

76
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:33,705
That's much harder for them

77
00:03:33,705 --> 00:03:36,710
to respond in a cooperative way

78
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,030
because you are
humiliating them.

79
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,920
I'm also going to flip
that and say we are

80
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,140
imperfectly human and we try

81
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,910
to be rational but there's

82
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,310
limitations to how
rational we are.

83
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,220
Let me give you some
examples of that.

84
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,640
Suppose that I'm a patient in

85
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,750
the hospital and I'm scared,

86
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,140
I have an eye problem
and there's a question,

87
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,915
should I have surgery
for my eye problem?

88
00:04:00,915 --> 00:04:03,500
You come in the hospital
largely because

89
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,060
the risk management part of

90
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,385
the hospital has created
a consent form for me,

91
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:10,340
it lists every
possible side effect

92
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,825
of this surgery for my eye.

93
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:13,490
Let's suppose that
the surgery has at

94
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,030
95 percent chance of success,

95
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,540
it has a 4.99 percent

96
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,210
chance that t will
actually make my vision

97
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,780
worse because the type

98
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,030
of diabetes that I have
doesn't always respond well

99
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,045
to the surgery and there's a

100
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:30,710
0.01 percent chance
that during the surgery

101
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,480
my eyeball actually pops out of

102
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,970
the socket and it
hangs down and there's

103
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,250
this brown fluid that
runs down the side of

104
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,550
my face and eyeball
goes like that.

105
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,740
Just by signing this form,

106
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,510
you have agreed that
you understand all of

107
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,155
these possible side effects

108
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:52,080
and you consent to the surgery.

109
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,250
Now of course what the patient

110
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,330
is sitting there
thinking about is,

111
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,740
can my eyeball even come out?

112
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,230
How does your eyeball even
come out of the socket?

113
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,085
What is that about?

114
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:03,500
What's that fluid?
Is that the piece?

115
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,240
Does that say that my
eyeball has a leak in

116
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,325
it or something?
What's that about?

117
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:11,140
Spending their entire
time focusing on

118
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,460
this really rare outcome

119
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,490
that should not be
swaying their decision.

120
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,290
The real decision as
the 4.99 percent versus

121
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,120
the 95 percent versus

122
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,219
whatever the alternative
is to the surgery,

123
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:24,400
which might be doing
nothing and wait it.

124
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,310
But because it's so vivid,

125
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,535
a fragile human and

126
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:32,830
who has to make a very
complex decision in

127
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,020
a scary circumstance is

128
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,145
going to have a really
hard time doing it.

129
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:39,130
If I draw out the decision tree

130
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,750
for that patient
and I assume that

131
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,610
they're going to solve
their expected utility

132
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,360
effectively in that moment,

133
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,970
that's probably not describing

134
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,760
accurately what's
going to happen.

135
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,830
I think that people

136
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,840
are often rational in ways
that we don't understand,

137
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,980
because we don't value

138
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,600
the things that
person is valuing in

139
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,280
that moment or I'll give you

140
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,090
a second example of how
people are rational.

141
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,445
Let's say that, I
have a single man

142
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:04,945
who has prostate cancer,

143
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:08,890
who is 85 years old and
there's a question,

144
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:12,040
should I operate on
his prostate cancer?

145
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,160
One of the side effects of

146
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,650
this prostate cancer operation

147
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,085
is that he will lose a
lot of sexual function.

148
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:21,830
The doctor very often
might be thinking,

149
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,830
this guy, he's not married.

150
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,780
He's at a very advanced age,

151
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,140
he's not having a lot
of sex right now.

152
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,170
If this helps him with
his prostate cancer,

153
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,120
I think it's a win and
that may be a win.

154
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,730
But what that patient
could be thinking is,

155
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,940
it's core to my own
identity as a man,

156
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,500
that I have this
sexual function.

157
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,730
Even though it's not I'm
having wild sex parties,

158
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,415
I actually care about that
and that's totally rational.

159
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:53,610
The humane clinician instead

160
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,780
of imposing his or

161
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,715
her own preferences in
that person should say,

162
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:57,945
here's the side effect.

163
00:06:57,945 --> 00:07:01,370
Let's talk about what you
think about that and let's

164
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,735
help you make a decision that

165
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:05,670
matches what you care about.

166
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,150
If I don't understand
what your values are,

167
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,770
it's hard for me to
understand how to

168
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,065
help you as the surgeon,

169
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,180
as you deal with
your scary cancer.

170
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,390
I might be assuming based
on my own stereotypes,

171
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,040
something about
what you care about

172
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,225
that you don't
actually care about.

173
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:22,580
I went on great length
about that, I apologize.

174
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,600
But those are some examples
that come to mind for me.

175
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,890
That's a good one. One of
the things I really try to

176
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,229
emphasize with my
students is that,

177
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:32,720
people pursue their
self-interest as they

178
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,460
understand it and define it.

179
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,450
We have to respect.

180
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:41,025
That's a great aspect
of economics actually.

181
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:42,710
There's a lot about
economics that can

182
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,150
be critiqued by
other disciplines.

183
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,535
But the idea that, I
have a utility function

184
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:49,750
and it's mine and you
should respect that.

185
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,740
That's actually really
humane as an insight.
