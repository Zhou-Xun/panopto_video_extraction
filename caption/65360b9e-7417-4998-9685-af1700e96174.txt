1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:29,579
So not only do we need to do that with slamming down the water bottles, but I noticed about half of these retentions.

2
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,080
So I see the logic of gambling with a water bottle.

3
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,290
All right, welcome. And I'm sorry I'm not going to be as good as my day speaker, but I'll do my best.

4
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,580
Today's topic is framing and social construction. It's going to include a little bit of exercise for a bunch of concepts that have

5
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,030
this lovely combination of being really good analytical tools to understand

6
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:59,920
the world around you and simultaneously having this weird tendency to disintegrate in kind of late form conversation about the nature of reality.

7
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,820
So which I guess is not such a bad discussed definition of life.

8
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,720
So we're going to talk through some of these concepts with examples,

9
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,550
and we're going to try to understand one small but typical event in American political history.

10
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,680
Then we're going to go into an exercise ground in one of the readings, which is on the.

11
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,499
This is one of these moments when I just have to know if you had gotten me in 2004 and said there would be such a

12
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,030
thing as a trans rights movement and that there would be such a thing as a backlash against the trans rights movement,

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,830
and that there would be such a thing as, say, gender neutral bathrooms in public institutions.

14
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:40,210
I would have thought you were crazy. So our exercise is partly going to be focused on in the case of specific case of gender affirming health care.

15
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:48,640
What happened to cause this in many ways very, very improbable, qualified, but nonetheless, successful success.

16
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:55,240
Successful success. And please note, this is a politics class.

17
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:03,010
If you want anything about the technical details of gender affirming health care or technical details of any form of health care for that matter,

18
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,230
let alone in under this conversation about gender and sexual identity.

19
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,730
I'm not your guy. This is about a set of political events and how they worked and how to think.

20
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,850
So we're not having a debate about people's humanity.

21
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,840
We're having a conversation about a set of political events that are shaping a lot of our politics and directly relevant to our health care system.

22
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,540
Okay. So not a normative conversation and not a biomedical conversation.

23
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,530
There's plenty of those. So that's a long winded way of saying.

24
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:45,129
Besides, let's say we. So I realize it's risky in 2020 to say this, but you can use Lenin's definition of politics if you want it on a very,

25
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:50,910
very concise step, which is politics is keeping. You don't sound like an ideologue when you say the Russia.

26
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:59,440
Who does what to whom? Which is not, if you think out the best way to think about the political systems, but about health.

27
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,070
But it's also about identity. Who is us? Who is cool?

28
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,219
Who is who? Who is whom? Who is us that are doing.

29
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,370
Who is us that are done to. Who are they that are done to? Who where?

30
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,709
They are doing a lot of politics from at least middle school onward.

31
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:21,190
If not, elementary school is about figuring out who are we and who are our enemies against whom we define ourselves.

32
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,070
Right? Who is the Ohio State that helps make us great? You know, not us.

33
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,000
We don't define ourselves in a position like Indiana. Okay.

34
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,910
Here's an example of a very high stakes definition of who and who.

35
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,050
This is a correspondent, I believe, for USA Today.

36
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,420
This is talk of October 2020, first of all, about Sanford, Florida, in the middle.

37
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,070
Not especially well known outside Florida, but who? His most famous visitor.

38
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:03,320
Does the name Trayvon Martin ring the bell? What happens to see these things work.

39
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,540
This is the inevitable comic interlude where I fight with this.

40
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,040
It's like. No. Oh, yes.

41
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:25,050
Really? Let's have a. A huge shock.

42
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,410
What did you make of it?

43
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,790
Yeah. I mean, George Zimmerman saw a black kid wearing a hoodie.

44
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:41,860
I'll pick it up. So last week, his 14 year old daughter, anybody decided he was up to no good.

45
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,360
Call the police. And on George Zimmerman's Night on the BLOCK watch. And I think this kid's up to no good.

46
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,260
Please leave him alone. You have a right to walk on the street. Who do you?

47
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,310
Nobody. Zimmerman decided this was not appropriate and shot at.

48
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,390
Needless to say, the criminal justice result was a circus.

49
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,319
And we also then decided to have an additional circus about racial politics.

50
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,750
When Obama made it, to my mind, completely uncontroversial that if I had a son who looked like Trayvon Martin,

51
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,550
this was taken as a sign of Obama something something white people.

52
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,710
The whole thing was a circus. But it means that for people of a certain age, Sanford, Florida has a very concrete meaning.

53
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,770
It's the place where George Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin. Reason got off.

54
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:31,130
So that's the background. That's our location. It's also got, as you see, a large runway to continue Air Force One.

55
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:42,800
What do you see in this picture? Instead of hurling this thing around the room to stick your hand up and I'll repeat what you said.

56
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,440
The microphone. Blue Lives Matter.

57
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,070
A Blue Lives Matter flag. Do you or somebody else want to exhale change?

58
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,060
I want to expand on what that means.

59
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:07,820
It was a movement that kind of is created in response to the Black Lives Matter movement in support of these laws.

60
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,950
It's actually testament to the nature of University of Michigan undergraduates,

61
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:19,519
because we was actually at the law school students undergrad who realized that life was better halfway and the police didn't have a flag.

62
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,040
And, you know, we had one flag opposing flags so you can make some money selling flags.

63
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,460
So you designed this very successful black. Yes.

64
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,460
I think it is a testimony to the entrepreneurial skills of our students.

65
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,150
It's in opposition to Black Lives Matter. Now, look at the iconography of it.

66
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,820
Right. What does it show? This is not a trick question.

67
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:56,580
Describe what we're looking at. This is so far from being a true question.

68
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:04,950
What does it look like? A big crowd and a lot of people write that.

69
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,840
They're looking at it as the Red Bull account,

70
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:15,600
which I gather they originally started wearing because it's never been worn around when you get around this iconic period of times.

71
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:27,479
Somebody be specific about flag was the flag. Black and white, black and white have taken an American flag.

72
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,700
Remove the colors, black and white, which is much more appropriate. And the blue line.

73
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:38,180
What do we call that? It's called the thin blue line.

74
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:44,230
In order that prince. You want to tell us what it means?

75
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:54,480
A lot of this stuff is really simple. Particularly, I'm not sure I just do good enough to be here.

76
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,629
But you know, I'm not sure it's Ross, you know, it's good for all you know,

77
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,380
because in an art student, for example, I'm sure that's how they think about matters.

78
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay. The big blue line is a phrase that you heard before the flag was invested in that flag.

79
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,420
And it refers to the police being the thin blue line, which means something inside.

80
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,790
Is it in line? Reached back in.

81
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,150
And one of the something in the something. Citizens of Israel.

82
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:38,260
Citizens and criminals with law abiding citizens are protected by a thin, fragile blue line from the Arab peace that is within our society.

83
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,480
Or is it in our society? Let's go back to what this slide basically was developed in opposition to.

84
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,390
Who specifically is being affected by the July.

85
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,620
Work is, however, who's on episode one?

86
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:08,860
The spectacle of, I don't know, on Puerto Ricans on the film about two blocks.

87
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,470
In other words, with what we're doing here, you're taking the American flag.

88
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,690
The fact that it's been changed quite radically will be the side that all of us.

89
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,730
The Thin Blue Line is a philosophical proposition that about a third of all people on the planet will sign up,

90
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:33,060
which is if you don't have strong authority, including coercive police authority.

91
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,850
You will have an IQ of crime, right? That's kind of a process by human nature.

92
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:42,360
They're about 30 human psychopathy, which is you don't have to be tough is good already.

93
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,450
You are going to have a good price. Okay.

94
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:51,040
Now, that's quite abstract, which is how you can get people in India and Russia and Brazil to sign up to the proposition.

95
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,930
It takes different senses,

96
00:09:52,930 --> 00:10:00,340
a different context in the context of a Trump rally in 2020 to say that the thin blue line is saving good, law abiding citizens.

97
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:08,560
From. The anarchists associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, you know, the Democratic Party.

98
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:13,880
What happened? So that's the iconography that's being developed there.

99
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,170
Right. Is it's a statement about authority. It's a statement about who is good.

100
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:24,709
It's a statement about who is bad and the best of the people who defends innocent, law abiding citizens.

101
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,920
Right. No, they got this in the 1980s.

102
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:37,230
But it used to be that if you had a private American flying helicopter that you couldn't fly outside very specific circumstances.

103
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:43,919
There was a whole lot of reverence for the flag and a lot of rules about us approaching associated elements.

104
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,870
The oldest and certainly. Well, that's largely gone away.

105
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,840
But there's still a very old generation of people who would say that that constitutes desecration of an American flag,

106
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:03,790
because they're not quite, to my knowledge, a single American flight. We have something to the president of American political reality.

107
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,740
Still very complex.

108
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:16,460
There's a reinterpretation of who we are that goes to, in a sense, making a statement about who is the United States and what is their flag.

109
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:27,650
There's a lot going on here. It also matches the Air Force One, but that was designed at the behest of John F Kennedy.

110
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:34,940
So I don't think that was intended, but it's nice to see a big apparatus of state power there lurking behind some force.

111
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:44,230
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it? What we got here is a whole lot of framing and social construction, much of it summarized in applied.

112
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:53,140
Like the location of the tower. The flag, which contains a philosophical position of proposition about order and anarchy,

113
00:11:54,070 --> 00:12:02,020
and contains a very concrete American proposition about who is heroically defending who from whom.

114
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:09,740
And then also, of course, the crowd, which is, you know, fairly ordinary for politics kind of thing,

115
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:15,770
they're all wearing sort of a symbol of their affiliation. This is the equivalent of the Women's March on Washington.

116
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,370
Okay. This is how politics is. Donald Trump is highly innovative.

117
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:26,170
It gives me more to work with. Right? Most campaigns have the same consultants, which is why most campaigns are a bit dull.

118
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:33,239
You know, to go on about this greatest. I just spotted, for example, the guy who wearing a black athletic shirt.

119
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,000
Except that says Trump, 45. Here's the updated version of that classic article.

120
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,870
I can read the text, but there's two things going on here, which is why there's two books.

121
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,410
One is the social construction of target populations.

122
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:53,910
The first, a cultural characterization of the popular images of persons and groups whose behavior well-being are affected by public policy.

123
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,730
What this means is that how you are viewing this is going to give it nebulous but it matters

124
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,500
by the political system tends to affect the kinds of public policies that are needed.

125
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,880
Take, for example, the entire history of drugs in the United States.

126
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,470
Marijuana was fairly much ignored. Until it became associated with Mexican immigrants.

127
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:22,050
Sara That's very specific for the scheme that we ran in the 1940 for the United States.

128
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,719
It became associated with Saracens. He began to see local bands.

129
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,360
When it became associated with hippies, it became very heavily criminalized in the 1960s because,

130
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,220
you know, Ann Arbor hippies were the enemy of all true good.

131
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:41,520
Gradually when it turned to what it obviously is in Michigan, which is a bunch of, you know, middle aged people having edibles on Friday night,

132
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,500
it became harder and harder to maintain the criminalization because the fragments started to look a lot more and more like a folk.

133
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,480
You know, one of my predecessors in his job, we had this recumbent bike,

134
00:13:52,220 --> 00:14:00,780
bearded gray dude who would ride his bike up and down here on River Drive on Sunday, rigged up with speakers like classical music.

135
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:07,240
Right. That is not the image of a frightening hippie who wants to undermine Western civilization.

136
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:12,210
It is what it is. It's the image of an elderly lawyer listening to classical music on a bicycle.

137
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,870
I was traffic. What do you got?

138
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,910
You get quite a lot of marijuana legalization and seeing the same thing with LSD because when the LSD and pot were associated with hippies,

139
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:29,440
all of a sudden. When they become associated with middle age people who might have been vaguely hippie a long time ago.

140
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,860
Suddenly the for. Opioids.

141
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:40,910
Excellent one. I don't see the wire. If you haven't, you really should.

142
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:47,570
Even if the particular details of the drug dealer's pages in Baltimore probably seem a bit antiquated to you,

143
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:57,230
it's really, really good social commentary. The Wire is set in the middle of a giant opioid use epidemic.

144
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:03,150
Overwhelmingly black people, overwhelmingly in majority black city in the United States.

145
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:10,169
It got coded and framed as a problem of black criminality,

146
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:15,100
and the result is a healthy community that's largely participation of the United States in violent

147
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,800
policing was enabled by the war on drugs and the drugs that were specifically going at people crack.

148
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,049
It's still not popular for a long time, but a sense of despair.

149
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:30,930
And if you had other cocaine where federal charges are weaker than if you could just crack because guess what?

150
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:36,870
Practice put it in one set of people and other papers quoted other types of things like Calvin Klein.

151
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:44,690
And whereas Crash was a differently, it had much tougher penalties.

152
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:53,330
So let's move on. Opioids opioids got a very good criminalizing response when they were seen as a problem.

153
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,900
Yes, it's still a city problem, but how are they being discussed today?

154
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:14,500
A suburban and rural problem as a declining rural town problem is that we simply learned about things like the alarming areas of East Liverpool High.

155
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,480
What do you think it is? Small town high unemployment.

156
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:28,190
Staggering problems with opioid use disorder. Because what is medicalized and medicalized?

157
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:35,810
Drug problems that are associated with groups that are socially constructed as disorder or anything happens to them,

158
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:41,780
that they need help and criminalize things that are associated with groups that are not socially constructed as deserving.

159
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,730
And this changes over time. I'm focusing on the way that particular drugs change their balance.

160
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,270
But you can also see how groups can change that if these are also novel diseases that Western civilization.

161
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,930
So that's one side. The policies that are made affecting youth are made based on images of you.

162
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:11,650
But one of the really striking things is the turn against young people in about a third of the American population approximately 2012.

163
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,520
It's really interesting. But on the other side, public policies construct you.

164
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,399
Obviously if you've committed a felony, then you get constructed as a person who in a sense is marked for life even

165
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,840
after you've paid your debt to society and just been discharged from prison. But equally some public policies seem designed to Juliet.

166
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,410
You and others don't. Think about all the different ways to pay for stuff around this university.

167
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,790
You know take a look at there is. For example, we're going to be doing this later.

168
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:45,350
But if you try to apply to Medicaid, you need to be very, very bureaucratically literate.

169
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:53,380
So a lot of batsmen never done that. But wasn't it? Are you being constructed as a dependents?

170
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:58,660
Now the FAFSA stands out because it's one of the few times that you get a proper bureaucratic humiliation.

171
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:05,250
If you belong to the American middle or upper classes. But picture being stuck with those forms all the time for everything you're trying to do,

172
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,290
you can imagine that's what happens when policy is constructed.

173
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:15,190
You have somebody deserving of the track. So social construction works in two ways.

174
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,630
The policies made to effect. You are made based on your construction.

175
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,590
And the policies may shape your construction.

176
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,849
Like a little one. A lot of Medicaid clinics that take primarily Medicaid.

177
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,270
Everybody gets a nine hour. Bill Clinton doesn't need to have an appointment at 9:00.

178
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:39,000
It means you all children that apply to pick a number of weeks. That's pretty humiliating and wasteful of your day.

179
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,490
It's done because Medicaid populations are being so poorly constructed, is less desirable patients,

180
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:51,290
and the effect is that Medicaid recipients will get stuck sitting at the doctor's office all day, being kind of bored, humiliated.

181
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,040
Well, how do we turn that into something people care about?

182
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:07,310
Framing a newsworthiness so frames is a quote from broader organizing principles that are socially shared and assisted over time.

183
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,500
Work to structure. Meaning to structure the world. Notice, by the way, that that doesn't even have to have anything to do with reality.

184
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,780
Right. Take the example of the deficit.

185
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:22,690
The deficit is a perfectly well-defined accounting and macroeconomic concept.

186
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,570
In American politics, it is basically an indicator of whether I think the country's economy is going in a good direction,

187
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:34,890
whether I like the government. So if you ask American voters to estimate the size of the deficit, they basically tell you their view.

188
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,330
You'll be astonished to learn that in the eyes of Democratic voters, the deficit shrank as soon as Joe Biden was sworn in.

189
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:47,820
And in the eyes of Republican voters, the deficit exploded. The deficit is entirely untroubled by what the voters think,

190
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,620
but the voters are essentially saying things are going wrong and the deficit is a code word for things going wrong.

191
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,740
The same with inflation. Even though we all see these gas prices as a proxy for inflation, which is bananas,

192
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,740
but we call the Inflation Reduction Act instead of build back better.

193
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:10,970
Right. That's framing. That's the framing. You do what you have to get a vote from the median senator from West Virginia.

194
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:18,160
What are some other examples of pranks? Or framing.

195
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:40,680
You do it all the time. My daughter does it when she frames a cookie as a snack.

196
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:55,570
I was thinking how more of that relating to property preferred to maternal and child health?

197
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:05,370
Where exactly is that suffering and what is the health of Mother Earth?

198
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:12,450
And it's certainly the center of the family, because it's well-established that in conservative politics,

199
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:20,780
invoking the family as sort of the sources of authority and a single unit that impermeable walls really, really works well in rhetoric.

200
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,150
And it's because it strikes a chord with a lot of other people.

201
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,960
So that's a really nice example or in some other cases of friends.

202
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:41,300
I love watching you trip all over myself. Do you talk about people who give birth or do you talk about living together?

203
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:52,590
We have entire political campaigns on our Facebook. Like watching campaign ads, which is not something I recommend you do that you value your sanity.

204
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,820
And the number of Republican ads that basically say, I believe a woman is a woman.

205
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:02,110
A man is man. They're framing a whole set of issues.

206
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:07,660
They want to do that. Want to give me one more example of how we do on.

207
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:15,200
Oh three example post sorry. Messages of support.

208
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:23,240
I'm coming to Boston. So this is like our life versus our hearts.

209
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:34,200
This is like our choice or anti-choice or like it's different sides.

210
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,050
It's perfect, right? And if you try to be polite and come up with, say, pro-choice versus pro-life,

211
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,450
you see both people are framing and you don't make a lot of sense as a result.

212
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:53,880
And that's by design. People can say, well along the same lines or notion that the time is right, that they can make up the right to choose.

213
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,440
And notice how they both go for something strong, right?

214
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:02,000
Because if you accept the premise that abortion is murder, then yes, you do you very, very good.

215
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:12,530
If you accept the premise that abortion is necessary for women's equality, then you're going to go for choice because that's marketable based upon.

216
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:18,760
Okay. Thank you. Most of these items.

217
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:32,229
Oh, yes. Got that right. Yeah. Those ones that are just 3 to 4 right handed guns is how we're secure in our democracy.

218
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,740
Because the guns to give us the militia to fight against the oppressive government.

219
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,960
By definition, any efforts to restrict guns is an attack on democracy security.

220
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:48,630
Nice isn't. You accept that, frankly, that we need a well armed citizenry from a dictatorship?

221
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,390
Anything that makes the citizens less well armed is therefore a move towards dictatorship and should be resisted.

222
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,670
That is essentially the Arab argument for the last hundred years. Okay.

223
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:07,799
All right. Well, and the joy of dreaming is to build into the language itself, premises that can't be argued about disappearances.

224
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:14,270
Animal health care, managed care. Who here wants unmanaged unfair.

225
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,379
Strategic purchasing. Who wants other strategic?

226
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,920
Nothing. Knows what's going on here.

227
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:29,420
Evidence based medicine. I don't know what the alternative is if you want to.

228
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:37,220
Watch what's happening. Right? What do you introduce? A concept you minimally emit in a way that makes it hard to argue it.

229
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:42,510
Inflation reduction. Hands up if you want more inflation. Patriot Act.

230
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:47,340
And if you're not a patriot. It goes on forever, right?

231
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,150
So those are examples of framing.

232
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,019
And it's a crucial political tax rate followed by inheritance tax.

233
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,770
The death tax is a great way to turn people off of it.

234
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,270
Calling the Affordable Care Act mandates that there be kind of life counseling.

235
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:10,929
A death panel was a really great way to wrap the entire portable care act and then

236
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,840
having the messaging discipline to get that framing out there is really important.

237
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:22,900
So, for example, one of the problems in now that abortion is front center is after the Dobbs decision and then after the Dobbs decision,

238
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:29,740
you had a bunch of cases such as Michigan, where there was a law that would not be enforced for another, which bans abortion.

239
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:38,270
Now, the organizational hub of the pro-choice movement is Planned Parenthood by parenthood, as most of you know, as a provider,

240
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:46,760
as well as a lobby organization, as to why it was one of the political donations that has stood up as a provider to reduction targets.

241
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:53,830
Most of America. So Planned Parenthood couldn't do coherent messaging.

242
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,840
Because they had to get up there and say abortion is still legal in the state of Michigan.

243
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:05,009
Well, that's a really right way to begin a rally opposing the illegality of abortion.

244
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:09,180
Right. Like if we are protesting an abortion ban.

245
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,550
But abortion has not that bad. But that's a real messaging mess.

246
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:21,450
And you could see how having a health care provider driving the messaging produce that incoherence.

247
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,640
Meanwhile, the National Right to Life Committee is saying don't talk about what we've done,

248
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,629
because what they're worried about is that the social construction of people who

249
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:37,840
get abortions was asked basically a bunch of like goofy by the 18 year old.

250
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:42,370
Right. Elective abortions, because they can't be bothered to organize their lives properly.

251
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,900
That's why we're simply having an argument about a topic for pregnancies.

252
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,340
That's why we're simply having an argument about very severe birth defects,

253
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:56,830
which means that they did not survive because we're arguing about how to frame people who get abortions.

254
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:03,430
Because when it was framed as part of a construct of sexual behavior.

255
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,740
Well, a lot of people think that you should you know,

256
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,680
as I'm tried to remember which gubernatorial candidate was a few years ago who said, I believe in the pill.

257
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:17,210
Keep an aspirin between your knees, ladies. Very with all the joints joke.

258
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,560
If that's the primate of sexual behavior,

259
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:30,620
then you can see how you it's very easy to frame abortion as something that you do because you can't get your sex life and self-control together.

260
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:39,370
Turn it around and say ectopic pregnancies. These people are going to die because they haven't covered pregnancies that the doctors will treat.

261
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,820
You suddenly totally reframe the issue. So abortion is health care.

262
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:53,160
Did you take it with the take? It didn't take until we started banning abortion and discovered we were banning standard of care for ectopic pregnancy.

263
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,260
So we're reframing people who get abortion right now under our noses.

264
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:03,760
That's a lot of the fringe concepts happening. Because it's one thing if you think you are banning.

265
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,290
A behavior associated with sexual violence.

266
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:13,870
It's another thing if you think you're battling necessary health care for a large number of people in the society.

267
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:21,720
That's the framing device. How do you get it into the news? You all read the short little article about newsworthiness.

268
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,630
Keep that article. You ever did anything in politics, in public affairs?

269
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,650
You'll need to know that. How do I get the media to pay attention?

270
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:38,110
Which also is kind of like, I think if you go viral by way. Although being outlandishly stupid.

271
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,530
What's better in terms of morality than in terms of mainstream media attention?

272
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,190
This the mainstream media can't cover everything because outlandishly stupid.

273
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,840
What if I actually don't want to look like quality? It would be to make care for the day on Twitter or something.

274
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,020
What do I do to get the attention of the press?

275
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,100
What are some of the characteristics of a good story?

276
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:11,680
You here, tell me about the reading or you can think about it or realize that people are dying and maybe more people will love it.

277
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:17,580
Pakistan, like a third of the head of the land in Pakistan is under water right now.

278
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:26,249
Again. People are dying. We'll probably. And we have nonstop coverage of the queen of apparently America,

279
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,550
because I don't see why the America is spending so much time on a royal figure from different countries.

280
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,870
So I guess she must have been our queen. Okay, two hats.

281
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,210
I'll start with you.

282
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:52,480
So going after that because it's all people are saying that if it was people in this country, it's hard to get relief to the woman from the really.

283
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:02,810
Yeah, I can say the same in some cases. I think that the disasters do get media attention, but it just comes on like a relative to the audience.

284
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:11,440
I think one of the reasons that could be why the person that's why you're not hearing about it as long as the fact is the other one

285
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:21,200
is that this person is if it was a natural disaster in one of the states that would get media coverage are definitely safe for sure.

286
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:27,510
African American population actually built for citizens.

287
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:43,440
More stuff that attracts the press. Stories that are understandable to the general public.

288
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,420
So this is like some complicated scientific discovery I just said.

289
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:54,670
It's not connected to, but it's something. Exactly.

290
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:59,030
This is a big problem. This is a flat earth society.

291
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:02,240
Biology is what they are experts.

292
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:14,940
This is kind of general, but the bad news is we don't have any media that happens like it is the news that people like to watch,

293
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,010
at least for some reason, and kind of in the same vein.

294
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:31,659
That's always a significant result of this, even if there is a signal that it is a standard problem like National Geographic,

295
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:38,890
as much as the Syrian people with the horror, of course, that's going to destroy the networks.

296
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:48,440
We're getting most of the media and people. Interestingly, countries are interesting, relatable issues that people understand and security flights.

297
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,310
I mean, this stuff triggers the brain in many ways for everything.

298
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:59,380
Personal life, happiness. We have experienced like horror movies for the heart.

299
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:06,540
This it's going to be one more. What else do I do?

300
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:11,920
What else want to do? That that as a producer, as a commissioning editor.

301
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,930
I want to. Keep people watching my show.

302
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,660
We've got activity, reliability, the weakness.

303
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:33,160
But those conflicts. Conflict framework.

304
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:41,500
Right. That's part of the thing that you see on the cover of Democracy right now is the conflict between Ron DeSantis and Joe Biden.

305
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,020
Is a structurally better story than Ron DeSantis is doing a thing, right.

306
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:51,409
So it's trivially easy on The New York Times to write a story which has a proposition to write,

307
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:54,230
to suggest it's doing something the Times readers regard as bad.

308
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:01,720
And then instead of stopping there, which is what liberals would like them to do, they go on a frenzied as political conflict.

309
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,350
In other words, elite conflict activity during this conflict.

310
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:15,440
That's enough to get you The New York Times and Washington Post. So you want to pay attention to this?

311
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,630
Because if you're saying why is this the issue I'm talking about newsworthy, think back to the free streets.

312
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:25,910
Why is it the organization and why priorities get any attention to the problem?

313
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:35,319
A lot of the time the answer is that you're failing on newsworthiness. Because news organizations are going to cover the things that they think people

314
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:40,480
will be interested in and they are going to cover with what they can pay.

315
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:46,210
So Trump rallies, for example, are awesome. The latest is Donald Trump.

316
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:51,440
Conflict? Definitely. Reliability.

317
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,910
He's an excellent communicator. Most of The Apprentice, like when I was in middle school.

318
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,920
People knew who Donald Trump was, and that was basically known to everybody.

319
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,370
You can see how they're. You can see there for how a conflict.

320
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,629
Negativity. If you wish to see it. Inspiration and group formation.

321
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:15,040
If you wish to see it. Elisa said it's also very easy to find to tell the a about.

322
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:23,810
Whereas there was a memorable moment in Detroit, for example, in the airport rallies right after Trump was sworn in and passed the Muslim ban.

323
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:32,160
And it was really, really striking how a huge rally erupted in Detroit Metro Airport,

324
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,060
which is the last place you normally expect to see a large political rally.

325
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,090
The media all under contract.

326
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:50,010
I can travel to majority Muslim place in Detroit and the press are we're going to get shots of young Muslim men like with Iraqi flags.

327
00:34:50,880 --> 00:35:00,380
And instead, they came racing over like an hour before the Metro Airport rally ended because the unexpected phenomenon of a bunch of naughty white,

328
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,060
suburban white people holding posters,

329
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:13,260
a smell was far more attractive to the media than the, frankly, fairly stereotypical image of a small group of Muslims protesting anti-Muslim policy.

330
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:19,229
Right. That's how the newsworthiness works. And so you sort of saw this explicit moment they all set up.

331
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:23,370
They'll set the cameras in other angles, like on the news trucks. They're in traffic because I think people.

332
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:29,450
It filters through to them that the actual exciting news where the action meeting,

333
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:34,309
the thing you didn't expect is Metro Airport and they packed up their trucks and they went racing out there.

334
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,840
And you saw the same thing with the politicians.

335
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:41,750
You know, suddenly members of Congress are all kind of looking at down I-94 in order to get from Hamtramck,

336
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:47,569
not newsworthy the Detroit Metro News lady because the incongruity of having several

337
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:52,400
people and people holding a political rally at the baggage claim was newsworthy.

338
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:58,470
Okay. Here's our exercise. Here's the puzzle.

339
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,720
There's almost no theory of politics that says that trans rights would have any success, period.

340
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:13,800
If you are trans, especially transitioning a whole host of bad things get done to you by society.

341
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:20,850
Everything from the likelihood of police violence through to the likelihood of catastrophic health care costs.

342
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:25,530
Transitioning can be very expensive in itself. It can be very socially isolating.

343
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,400
You give people a lot of stigmatization, blah, blah, blah.

344
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:36,980
Furthermore, because we're talking about a minority group of people who are suffering a whole bunch of intersectional blows to their status as well,

345
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:40,950
basically just stand out as a cold eyed political scientist.

346
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,960
This is not a movement you want to organize. However.

347
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,170
It works. I mean, it works to the extent that it's worth today.

348
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:57,650
So this is really interesting because you have a group that is on the receiving end of a vast amount of negative social construction,

349
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:04,740
a vast amount of ignorance, and is quite weak in terms of a lot of the basic kind of sinews of organization resources.

350
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,930
And nonetheless, you see gender neutral bathrooms.

351
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:14,840
You see an extensive range of legal protections for various things to do with trans people's rights.

352
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,520
How did it happen?

353
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:26,570
Because if you are interested in the welfare of anybody who is in that situation, of being a group that is isolated, substantially dumped upon.

354
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:35,770
This is a great learning case. And furthermore, by the way, synchronization is working great as a political strategy.

355
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:41,290
Around the 2000 formula, things like that were built right where you would tee up as a Republican politician,

356
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:47,700
basically election legislation on stuff like banning gender neutral athletes in order to,

357
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:52,180
you know, get some turnout, get some excitement around your political campaigns. And that's still strategy.

358
00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:00,240
Well, the answer is give me an accurate. The other expanding accurate.

359
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:06,520
So in the 1990s, there was a rapprochement between the gay movement and the lesbian group,

360
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,120
because basically the movement got started a little bit earlier.

361
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:14,100
The lesbian movement got started sort of a little bit later in the seventies associated with the women's movement.

362
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:19,000
HIV meant that everybody was doing something else in the 1980s.

363
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:27,820
In the 1990s, you began to see the formation of the L lg of lesbian.

364
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:37,629
Gay was a phrase. A lot of people used to have to go back into the street, fight words, and then you had to be bisexual and a strategy.

365
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,350
And that identity began to evolve.

366
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:45,490
But it's almost kind of like a movement against gender essentialism, which represents, as this mother elaborates, growing African.

367
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,820
Right. What you're seeing here is a process of group formation.

368
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,030
And you can imagine it going differently, right.

369
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:57,190
You could have imagined having a little bit of gay men to be fairly strong and a movement of lesbians which might not be so strong.

370
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,090
And then a whole lot of other people whose movements are very weak or that closed up entirely.

371
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:11,170
Instead, you begin to see this meta identity evolve that politically gay men are presumed to have something in common with all these other identities.

372
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,190
All these other positions in relation to gender.

373
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,830
So it's essentially the anti gender essentialism movement, but it comes out as a list of identities and an acronym.

374
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,249
That movement's existence and the integration of trans rights is one of its objectives radically increased its power.

375
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,670
Because once you tap into really well-established organizations like Land,

376
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:35,500
the Human Rights Campaign, you're actually talking some real Washington power politics here.

377
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:42,460
And on the more dramatic level, you're creating an identity that's going to have sort of a ready to go activist base in every town in the country.

378
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:51,340
So that's a really striking case of how it's not a solitary movement that came out of nowhere and won a victory like all successful movements.

379
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,700
It's plugged into other things, right? If we were doing it to the other side, we were doing, for example, the religious freedom movement.

380
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:04,670
You would want to talk about how it's connected with conservative legal. So we're going to talk this through with the board.

381
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:10,150
Groups of three or four people. I think you know how to do that pretty well.

382
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,339
About 20 minutes. The key thing is going to be reporting back,

383
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:19,720
sort of formulating if this is one of these exercises where the journey is more interesting than the destination.

384
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:25,140
Right. What is your process of thinking and what you report back is like one sentence.

385
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:32,570
Despite the fact that some of your cases are really interesting. Isn't going to do is a legislative tracker.

386
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,560
I'll show you. But it's like the canvas, as is the canvas.

387
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:41,020
Pick a state and then you scan over. So.

388
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,240
Let's go to the tracker. The people who do this are, I think, grossly in favor of trans rights.

389
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,500
So that affects the scores.

390
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,880
So a high score constitutes a state that is positive in supporting trans rights.

391
00:40:55,030 --> 00:41:00,400
Who both sports is negative. Here we have private insurance happens to be what's up on the front page, right.

392
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:05,500
So if you have little star, it means that you're transgender. Exclusion to health and service coverage.

393
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,780
Right. So if you're getting cancer, a private health insurance policy that includes the trans fat excluded.

394
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:18,910
In Arkansas. At the other end of the spectrum, the law explicitly permits insurers to refuse gender affirming care.

395
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:24,040
It says a lot of political variation here, and you'll notice that it's only 70 predictable.

396
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:30,910
Because as usual the Midwest and the West where the exchange. So you think it's safe?

397
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:41,950
And here's a broad scan of what they're up to. All these different legislation either passed or under consideration.

398
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:48,770
You can do. It's for their sake.

399
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:55,180
Answer these questions. The first one is how trans rights advocates define the key problem in your state.

400
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,929
California The answer is going to be there's not that many problems to do with

401
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,200
gender affirming health care from the point of view of trans rights advocates.

402
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,820
If you're in Arkansas,

403
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:12,110
it's from a prioritization because the entire Arkansas legal framework is designed by people who are anything but advocates of gender affirming care.

404
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:21,150
Gender affirming care. You don't need to go too deeply into what it means, but it essentially needs health care that affirms gender instead of sex.

405
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:28,860
Meaning essentially it's about. What your brain works like as opposed to the external flight.

406
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:37,800
Why should you try to avoid giving a lecture about the topic? Look at how the laws and spending bills frame gender affirming health care.

407
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:41,010
Again, you don't need to read the laws, but you'll be struck right?

408
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,280
Some states are entirely obsessed with high school sports, for example.

409
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:47,910
Other states, it's about child abuse. Other states have the mental health argument.

410
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,470
Why do you think legislators are doing it this way?

411
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:56,840
Why do you think legislators in some states are framing this with the sort of banner image of some eight foot tall,

412
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:02,600
hulking basketball player who transitions and then joins the women's basketball team in order to win the state?

413
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,350
That seems to be a very frightening figure for a lot of our state legislators.

414
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:14,389
It is, of course, nonexistent category of people in reality and other positions of legislators.

415
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:19,490
Very. Okay. So going to work on this question of states doped up on states.

416
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:25,700
All the states are interesting, by the way. There's no such thing as like a bad state, even if you all read about Arizona and Arkansas.

417
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:33,400
And 20 minutes. And then the last 5 minutes, I'll actually come up with an answer to the reflection question.

418
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:41,390
Technical questions. The links are all on campus government.

419
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:30,570
What it's like to see that we do so much and don't get it.

420
00:44:32,040 --> 00:45:30,240
Well, I just think if you have the stuff, it's a lot easier.

421
00:45:39,630 --> 00:46:04,810
There are a lot of things out there all the time get.

422
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:17,660
Oh, yeah, sure.

423
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:43,930
Oh, yeah.

424
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:06,460
Oh, okay.

425
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:51,830
So, you know, I didn't have to worry about that now.

426
00:47:53,060 --> 00:48:02,640
But I think the point is that they know that there is.

427
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:06,820
Yeah. Yeah.

428
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:25,730
So it's funny, but you never know.

429
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:54,700
Right. So, yeah, I know we don't touch it.

430
00:48:55,610 --> 00:49:27,290
At the time that we found about it, I just had to go over there, cause you have to find out.

431
00:49:32,270 --> 00:50:16,280
There is so much more so than anything.

432
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:31,340
Yeah, but I think that was so busy because now.

433
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:37,810
So. I guess so.

434
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:45,290
Yeah, I think so.

435
00:50:45,290 --> 00:51:04,870
And I think she was actively just looking to hear what it's like.

436
00:51:12,350 --> 00:52:09,530
But I think it's not just because I think there are a lot of things.

437
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:53,300
So it's not like, oh yeah, I'm not sure about that.

438
00:52:55,590 --> 00:53:03,760
I really don't know why.

439
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:31,250
Only then they feel like, Oh, you know, if you haven't heard from this problem yet yet, start turning towards this next question.

440
00:53:32,510 --> 00:54:07,980
How often do not have to have a fully comprehensive list of the top of your house?

441
00:54:20,630 --> 00:55:14,870
So you want to say the least I can do is I always try to help you.

442
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:42,700
Yeah. Oh, yes.

443
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:54,500
I don't know. I think.

444
00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:00,810
I think maybe.

445
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:05,570
I think.

446
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:32,520
But they still have something to say about something like that.

447
00:56:37,650 --> 00:57:08,810
I haven't seen anything like it.

448
00:57:14,430 --> 00:58:09,380
And so I think that explains why.

449
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:25,520
Yeah. So I don't know.

450
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:45,959
I guess I was actually looking for another language to make sure that, you know,

451
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:53,190
trying to get the suspects in question, have something to say to the rest of the class about the state.

452
00:58:53,190 --> 00:59:01,530
And that is what it is you learn about proving so often in their application.

453
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:58,120
Three or four years or so.

454
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:52,480
It's not all and things like that.

455
01:00:54,050 --> 01:01:02,450
So let's make sure you have a reflection question answer that can be a person such as the better.

456
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:06,279
It is awfully easy to have it.

457
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:10,420
All right.

458
01:01:12,060 --> 01:02:08,630
So I mean, it's it's not like I said, I am trying to happen I have ever very few things like that.

459
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:18,930
But yeah.

460
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:27,770
Yeah, well, I guess.

461
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:40,410
Yeah. And you look at them, right?

462
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:49,960
Yeah, it is.

463
01:02:52,640 --> 01:03:00,770
Okay. I sat at the break up what looked like a lot of good conversations as you voyage around the United States to discover how we think about gender.

464
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:05,170
But let's get some answers to the reflection question.

465
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,870
So we have volunteers and we just throw it to see what it's.

466
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:14,120
Ohio. Ohio.

467
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:21,700
Oh. Obesity rates of obesity plus issues of unnecessary people.

468
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:34,300
So they'll still protect. They'll have to have an inspiration list for adults who are gay and adopt children or foster children.

469
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:42,280
But when it comes to educating the population, so students and children,

470
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:52,940
they really are high on being gay as a possibility and as such something that is as necessary.

471
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:59,860
So I think, yeah, there are lots of questions for students.

472
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:06,240
No actually laws and they don't take any laws basically.

473
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:17,620
And there's also the same act so saved adolescents from experimentation, which is a really crazy way a president,

474
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:29,259
basically the U.S. or France is something that should be protected and I'm not against that.

475
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:40,430
And people say, well, and that's so good at this map, sort of the framework of sort of I shall take it away from you, which is a big thing.

476
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:44,710
You hear a lot from parents who are not doing well after it comes out.

477
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:49,990
Yeah. So, so think about this. Which values?

478
01:04:56,090 --> 01:05:06,220
We are not the only talk about how to have a staple in sports at the Shadows Hall of Fame.

479
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:11,600
That's a lot of the gender identities. Super fun stuff happens.

480
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:18,590
We talked about how hard of the to women's sport that takes away obviously the spotlight from the careers of

481
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:33,230
children who wanted to see the other pretty much the focus is on like victimizes children who jump on the stage,

482
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:40,159
not on. So we're talking about how that for me, at least in the last few seconds,

483
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:53,930
case of laws that are just more digestible and lets voters shield their own biases by victimizing other issues on the other,

484
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:59,719
the sports one is surprisingly common is just the number of state legislatures that

485
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:04,670
appear to be motivated this issue entirely by certain high school volleyball.

486
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,320
Okay. So we were right.

487
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:28,719
And they found that they consider their standard and they have no flaws and they only had an absence of some detection loss because like I say,

488
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:34,660
the defense processes, the it's across party lines.

489
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:48,020
They execute upon this essential standard of care and governance to execute upon us and have a long lives separate us life.

490
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:51,340
So there's two things going on. We've moved into a much more state. Right.

491
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,820
And one half Republicans apparently decided they're not going to get votes on this issue.

492
01:06:55,900 --> 01:07:01,420
And on the other hand, that's a whole separate you know, they don't want to sit down anymore than the legislature.

493
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:09,300
I can. People. Somebody on the side of the room surely wants to go.

494
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:27,490
So you guys are aiding and abetting, but still ignoring our own viewers.

495
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:32,479
And that is because there was no protections for housing discrimination.

496
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:37,540
There was protections for the participation of those is not the only one that they have.

497
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:43,450
Well, it could change in a way that is less this is impossible.

498
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:48,450
If you want to change your name, you have to publish this paper.

499
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:59,830
So it's really just like a mobilization of those societies with the public that they would like to have.

500
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:09,910
And one of the things is that, remember, the way that the protection laws work is that we enumerate the grounds for discrimination.

501
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:17,500
So if I'm an employer, I can fire you a will unless you can show that I was discriminating and a list of protected categories, right?

502
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:26,200
So I can fire anybody I want. But if I fire them after establishing it as a racial prejudice, then it's a civil rights claim against me.

503
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:30,670
You don't have a right to a job, right to not be discriminated against in the deliberate category.

504
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:39,520
So if Wyoming simply doesn't add France to that category, then, for example, it's completely legal to fire people because the trans.

505
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:50,900
Okay. Let's wrap this up. What I think is striking is the diversity of the different trends that we're seeing and the sense of that goes to abortion.

506
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:56,690
Are we talking about this as a way to properly replace the sports?

507
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,409
Are we talking about it as just something stigmatized?

508
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:05,000
Or would you have said you're protected from talking about it as necessary form health care.

509
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:10,069
These are all different ways legislators trying to frame it and the extent to which they're working

510
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:14,720
on the issue and how they frame it reflects their own political calculations about how Republican.

511
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:20,360
And a lot of this, you can tell, is primarily a culture war signaling.

512
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:25,480
So take the high school. We have basically set up a structure and I'm braced for it.

513
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:36,270
It's going to be gruesome in which you invite small losers to request that the gender of the star players of the opposing high school be evaluated.

514
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:41,730
So there's a really tall woman playing basketball with kind of straw goal line.

515
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:48,450
There's now a legal framework in a number of states for the losing to parents to request the test,

516
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:55,520
to have to evaluate because it's so small if you've got anywhere near a high school sports so that

517
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:59,700
you can imagine that this is going to be a perfectly normal tactic for some more affluent parents.

518
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:03,990
Right. It's going to be so much fun watching how that plays out.

519
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:11,290
Okay. It is what it is. Say that thing.

520
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,710
Do it. Self construction. Pay attention to it.

521
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:20,360
And do it. And do it thoughtfully. Because this is how you lose arguments, not data.

522
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:35,600
Yeah, well.
