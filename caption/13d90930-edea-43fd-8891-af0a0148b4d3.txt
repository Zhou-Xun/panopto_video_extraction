1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,170
A couple of quick things.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:10,950
So first thing is we have a class gets a lecture today, but she's actually going have you guys do discussion groups today unlike the last lecture.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,470
So we are going to do discussion today. And then I don't think anybody had an issue with it last time,

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,140
but session evaluations do also get filled out for guest lecturers in case there's any question about that.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,350
And I also saw some questions this week about missing class.

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,540
So I wanted to just remind everybody that if you do miss a class, you do still need to answer the discussion questions.

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:38,080
And just got an email from Joe, everybody.

8
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,860
And I never got a clip, so I guess I'll just update people. But I'm on the end of Allan Poe.

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,319
I am the director of Infection Prevention for the Health System, and I know many of you from earlier classes,

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,229
but I'm today I'm just going to give a little bit more of a deep dove into some of the infections that we see in hospital.

11
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,040
So definitely feel free to ask questions throughout.

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,359
And then I have the discussion questions for each group at the end and we can kind of

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,570
check out a little bit about them if we have a few extra minutes at the end as well.

14
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,720
And it's hot in here. I did already talk to somebody calling facility like my hair is getting bigger and bigger.

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,590
So today I am going to talk about hospital policies and how they interact with infection prevention

16
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,470
and kind of how infection prevention utilizes policies to sort of run things at hospitals.

17
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,209
And we're going to look at several types of hospital outbreaks and investigations

18
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,190
and also look at a couple of different outbreaks and cluster investigations.

19
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,949
And then sort of the bread and butter of infection prevention is preventing the device

20
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,239
associated and procedure associated infections and looking at issues when those arise.

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:56,549
So we'll talk about that as well. So policies are sort of the bane of our existence in infection prevention, but we need them.

22
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,960
So you have to have policies and guidelines for pretty much everything.

23
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:07,020
And most institutions should be governed by their infection control committee.

24
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,839
And the Infection Control Committee is a multidisciplinary committee,

25
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:19,050
but it's chaired typically by the hospital epidemiologist and that is who governs the policy, the priorities, etc. for infection prevention.

26
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,030
And in our institution here, we're a subcommittee of sort of our medical executive committee.

27
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,150
So that's sort of where we get our power to do what we do.

28
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:34,350
And you'll sometimes encounter a situation that doesn't have a policy, and you just have to kind of plan accordingly.

29
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:41,550
And this is why you don't want your policies to be written so specifically that you can't ever allow for flexibility or leeway,

30
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,920
or sometimes you do have to read, right kind of interim guidance documents and things like that.

31
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,150
I will say I think that it depends on the institution you're at,

32
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,969
but I do think over the last decade it's really changed and people have become incredibly policy centric.

33
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,030
So I know when I started in infection prevention,

34
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,560
it was at a different hospital and people would ask me questions and I'd say, Do this, and I'd say, Sure, no problem.

35
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,760
And when I got here, I'd say, Do this. And they say, Show me where that is in the policy.

36
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,909
And I'm like, What are you talking about? So it's really and I think that it's kind of moved to that even more over the years as

37
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:20,880
regulatory agencies and places like that have gotten more involved in infection prevention.

38
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,600
So I do think that it's important to make sure that your policies can be followed and offer you some leeway,

39
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,210
but still provide relatively clear guidance too, so that folks are on the front lines.

40
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,340
So these are sort of a summary of hospital outbreaks.

41
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,930
We're going to go through each of these. But of course, are bacterial infections, viral infections.

42
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,260
You have a lot of compromised patient populations in the hospital. So there you actually do see fungal infections.

43
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:58,620
We've seen emerging issues with water. There's a lot of issues with disinfection failures and there's a lot more complex equipment out there now.

44
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,170
And so trying to make sure all those things are cleaned properly and between patients is very key.

45
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,570
And I would say one big one is endoscopes.

46
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,870
Endoscopes are all sorts of things now and they can be very challenging to clean and just employed practice failures.

47
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:19,560
If you don't clean something or you don't wash your hands or you don't reprocess something properly, then patients are at risk of infection.

48
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,950
Okay. So the bacterial infections are really common.

49
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:33,590
You know, typically cross-contamination from health care workers hands could be equipment that wasn't cleaned,

50
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:43,550
could be the environment was contaminated. Will often see these with C difficile with baker myosin resistant enterococcus, sometimes pseudomonas.

51
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,889
Typically it is equipment or hands. You could, you know, see things from the environment.

52
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:56,700
And there is literature out there that people who occupy a room that had incident patient in it previously are at higher risk of getting sicker.

53
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,480
And there's a lot of things we now do to try to reduce that risk.

54
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,100
You will occasionally see bacterial infections from contaminated products, but it's pretty unusual.

55
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,320
So this is one that that did occur.

56
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:18,799
I'm just going to throw this out for a quick discussion. So you identify several cases of hospital acquired.

57
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,900
Burchell There is a patient in adult Nancy outpatients an outbreak and call for

58
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:29,710
cases for pediatric uses communicate and what should you do so I'll just definitely

59
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,809
you have thoughts on the shot them out I'll give you some background on

60
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,910
burkholderia cepacia it's it's sort of a water ish pseudomonas type of organism.

61
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,149
It's really significant in cystic fibrosis patients. It's something that you always want to avoid in your cystic fibrosis patients.

62
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:50,059
So if you have a cystic fibrosis patient with that, you want to keep them very separate from anybody else with cystic fibrosis.

63
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:57,260
So this happen in patients here that we're not see our patients.

64
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:04,310
And so and it was unexpected and there had been an outbreak in a couple of cases in pediatric ICUs.

65
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,610
And what ended up happening with this and you can look at the details of the outbreak.

66
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,340
So what we typically do first is verify the existence of a problem.

67
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,100
So that's always your first step because that always sounds really exciting.

68
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,660
But then you can kind of go off the rails and do a lot of work that maybe wasn't necessary.

69
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:28,310
When you look and say, Hey, this is just what we always see. But in this case we start to look at versus place and time.

70
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:35,570
We start to look at what units running on and they're on different units and you know, what products are used on these patients.

71
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:45,320
And so the thing that that comes up in these if you review their medications and products was a medication called that you said it's a laxative,

72
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:51,290
but there was a contamination of this oral laxative and actually a recall went out.

73
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:56,240
It was a voluntary recall, which are terribly unhelpful when you are trying to pull things from the shelves.

74
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:03,260
So, you know, that's we were able to kind of pull off the product that we had in our pharmacies.

75
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,260
But when it's voluntary like that, there's places, you know,

76
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:12,170
like the retail pharmacies may or may not be pulling it so that it's sort of like how do you communicate to your patients to say,

77
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,319
hey, you're at high risk for this type of infection?

78
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,780
Like, see, in particular, if you have any of this, throw it away or don't buy this right now kind of a thing.

79
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:26,419
So that I think becomes the larger issue. I don't recall there being any adverse events from this,

80
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:32,299
but it was just interesting and this is kind of a good example of being really familiar with

81
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,610
your electronic medical record so that you can pull out the drugs and kind of easily search,

82
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:45,590
you know, what's what, what are they? And the other thing that you'll often see with burkholderia species, there have been outbreaks of wipes.

83
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,980
So baby wipes, bathing wipes, those kinds of things that get used in the hospital a lot.

84
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,840
So those are the kind of red flags, things that come up to us when we see Burkholderia.

85
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:04,159
We're also really lucky here because our one of our pediatric ID folks runs the Sierra Research Lab,

86
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,940
so they actually sequence all of the organisms for that anyway.

87
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:13,700
So whenever there is an outbreak, you can typically tell us ahead of time, Hey, you've got a weird outbreak strain of X, Y, Z.

88
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,510
So that's always really helpful. All right.

89
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,950
That's the only one we're going to chat about. There's more bacterial outbreaks in the discussion.

90
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,720
All right. Viral outbreaks are often respiratory viruses.

91
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,740
Of course, common horse flu, RSV sometimes as well.

92
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:39,850
You definitely see these commonly in skilled nursing facilities, in jails, etc.

93
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:47,410
You can see blood or pathogen outbreaks. HIV, Hepatitis B and hepatitis C and hepatitis C being the most common.

94
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:55,450
And these besides being respiratory viruses, you'll often see contaminated blood or equipment.

95
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,370
That's sort of the issue there.

96
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:08,379
And often it's a reuse of a Sharps device, which there's been a lot of programs by CDC to try to stop that and just contaminated medical devices.

97
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:15,220
And one key one is a glucometer. So what you use to check blood sugar, those are kind of a hot topic right now,

98
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,810
an infection prevention, but something that you never, ever want to see blood on.

99
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:30,690
So this investigation is that you have several cases of hep C and patients that have been admitted from assisting assisted living facilities.

100
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:38,760
What are you thinking about? So in this one and again at the Outbreak News Center,

101
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:45,480
and this kind of gives you a summary of hep C outbreaks in skilled nursing facilities and other places over a period of time.

102
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,850
But there there were a couple different contributing factors. One was dirty glucometer.

103
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,249
So not cleaning the glucometer in between.

104
00:09:53,250 --> 00:10:00,420
Patients and hospitals do have a glucometer and you use a different lancing device and strep for every patient.

105
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,830
But the device itself,

106
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,700
the glucometer itself is used between patients and supposed to be disinfected in between with something that kills all blood or pathogens.

107
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:16,379
But of course, that's dependent on the user doing that. So there have been outbreaks associated with the device not being cleaned properly.

108
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,780
And so just cross-contamination causing hepatitis C.

109
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:25,799
And unfortunately, there have been especially in skilled nursing facility in the past, there was issues with reusing single use lancing devices.

110
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:32,760
And so that's another, another way. Typically what we see now are just the single disposable use ones.

111
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,450
But if you have a lancing device and just put a new needle in that, not sufficient.

112
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:40,710
But I think people used to think that it was so using plastic emanation that way.

113
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,990
And outbreaks as a result. All right.

114
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:52,830
So we've seen a lot of emerging water issues with the Flint water crisis.

115
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,760
We also saw Legionella cases that were really significant.

116
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,610
We also use a lot of really complicated devices in health care.

117
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:08,670
And most electronics have some kind of fan system in them to cool them down.

118
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,409
And then some of these also use water. I'm going to go through one in just a few minutes.

119
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:21,120
And I know some of you have seen, but maybe others haven't. But these devices can then be sort of a reservoir for pathogens, for patients.

120
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:28,649
And then just this kind of highlights why your facility needs a water management plan and what kind of things

121
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:34,200
you should be thinking about for that to avoid the risk of waterborne pathogens infecting your patients.

122
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,600
So this is one of the most interesting outbreaks that I encountered.

123
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:45,060
So it had to do with non tuberculosis mycobacteria, we call it NTM.

124
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:52,200
So it's a ubiquitous environmental organism, just like tuberculosis.

125
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,780
It's it's acid based. So that's a specific stain that you do to detect this organism.

126
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:05,429
And you do need a special culture technique. So if you're just doing a routine culture on somebody, you won't be looking for mycobacterium.

127
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,919
You have to you have to actually request the Mycobacterium culture and do the acid based smear.

128
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,000
So it often gets missed for a while because of that, because it's not routine.

129
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:22,530
It can be obviously like anything if you have it in a culture, it can be infection, colonization or contamination.

130
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:31,500
And the particular organism here was called Mycobacterium Chimera, which is a member of the Mycobacterium Avium complex,

131
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:37,860
which we call Mac, which we see pretty frequently in people with different respiratory infections and things like that.

132
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,370
It's another acid based bacterium, but these are non tuberculosis.

133
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,520
Mycobacterium is basically all the other mycobacterium that aren't TB.

134
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,650
So heater cooler units think of it as the bypass machine.

135
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,010
When somebody is having open heart surgery,

136
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:05,450
they have the heater cooler machine to get really cold and stop their heart so that they can do the procedure and then warm up after after the fact.

137
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,440
So the the cold side is the cardiologia and then they warm the patient back on the after.

138
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,169
And this happens by using water, too, because now the water doesn't have any contact with the patient.

139
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:21,809
The water is just what the tubing goes through to heat or cool it so there isn't any

140
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,980
communication unless you had a significant issue with the patient's blood in the water.

141
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:37,080
So the machine sits in the operating room and you put ice in it and water and it goes through its process throughout the procedure.

142
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:47,070
So what happened? Is there actually a global outbreak of Mycobacterium Chimera was identified after open heart surgery.

143
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:54,209
There were more than 70 cases throughout the world and it was identified that a particular type of heater cooler

144
00:13:54,210 --> 00:14:00,930
unit was called the sauna three team was actually contaminated with Mycobacterium chimera during production.

145
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:07,410
And we did whole genome sequencing and there were matching isolates here in the U.S. and Europe and in Australia.

146
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:15,990
And they sampled water at the manufacturing plant from the new machines in the same strain of Mycobacterium chimera there as well.

147
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:24,660
What they were doing is putting the water in the machine to test it and then draining it, drying it and sending them out.

148
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:31,049
And of course, the mycobacterium was remaining in there and we put the water in and then there was some level of mycobacterium.

149
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,370
And I'm going to be totally honest,

150
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,250
the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning these were questionable at best because nobody really worried about it,

151
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,790
because it's not touching the patient. The patient's blood doesn't go through it.

152
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,470
You clean and disinfect it quarterly. It would have, like a really low level of bleach, like a swimming pool.

153
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:54,090
Nothing. Nothing too crazy. But Mycobacterium can obviously form a biofilm.

154
00:14:54,090 --> 00:15:04,350
So it was hanging out in there, and the machine design was such that there was the water part and there was a fan beneath to cool.

155
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:11,910
And what happened during practice is the water would splash out of the machine onto the fan and get kicked up into the ear in the operating room.

156
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:20,370
And what can then happen is I don't know how many of you are familiar with the operating room here, but we do what's called laminar flow.

157
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,149
So basically it's kind of an air curtain around the patient.

158
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:31,200
And if this video works, I'll show you. But they did a smoke test with this and basically the air from the heater cooler gets

159
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,160
sucked right into the air curtain and was just getting pushed right down into the patient.

160
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:42,420
So yeah, and these were a lot of open heart surgeries. So you have a big open chest cavity that's getting inoculated with this organism.

161
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:48,020
Now, the other thing, here's a little peek. Sure of it is that it's really slow growing as well.

162
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,409
So it doesn't causing an infection quickly.

163
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,890
It was sometimes taking years for the infection to develop.

164
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:01,910
And then, as you might imagine, people would have weird symptoms, but not necessarily any overt, you know, appearance or anything.

165
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,610
And when they would do regular cultures, nothing would come up.

166
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,709
So until they started looking for acid based bacilli, they weren't able to find anything.

167
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:26,450
So if this works. Well, you should be able to see.

168
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:32,970
That brings you to the. It's not available anymore.

169
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,590
Sorry, you guys. So. Well, what happens in this?

170
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:43,990
The spoiler alert is they had the smoke machine going at the heater cooler, which is right here.

171
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:51,429
And then the smoke did make it right into the air curtain and was basically going like this down to the man where the patient would be.

172
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:57,950
So presumably inoculating the chest cavity, you know, with whatever microorganisms were in there.

173
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,940
And this was interesting because, you know, think about how much open heart surgery happens.

174
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:08,259
And there were maybe like, what, 100 infections or whatever. But like the amount of time we spent on that,

175
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:14,020
there were so many FDA calls and things like that because their alert came out and everyone was trying to figure out what was going on.

176
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:20,110
And we were using these machines and we actually did see a couple of infections here,

177
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:26,020
but we had all kinds of alerts in place now that if people had infection or open heart surgery during this time,

178
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,880
in this time, then they get screened every so often for these symptoms so that they don't fall off our radar.

179
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,590
And I think we've just about reached the time where we think of the incubation period, if you will, is over.

180
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:41,440
So we'll stop doing that. But open heart surgery is emergent typically, right?

181
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,059
So you can't just stop doing it or people will die. You have to kind of weigh the risk benefit of this.

182
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:54,310
And we were very fortunate to be able to really quickly get rid of the saw in machines and use a different machine and not impact our program.

183
00:17:54,310 --> 00:18:00,430
But some people move their machines outside of the O.R., so they had like longer hoses, which is got some risks as well.

184
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:05,350
Some people just retrofitted them with various filters, which, frankly,

185
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,590
you're not technically allowed to do per the manufacturer, but it solve their problem.

186
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,240
Some people just pointed it away from the operating field and and continued on.

187
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,440
So it was just really variable, I think also dependent on if you saw cases or not.

188
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,639
Like I think when you saw cases you felt really compelled that yikes, this is really bad.

189
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,900
They're really significant infections and really, really impactful to the patients as well.

190
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,010
So that's our big, you know, sort of water story.

191
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,710
We actually do Atmel here, too.

192
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:42,989
For those of you who aren't familiar with Elmo, it's sort of the life support that basically is like the heart and lung machine, just kind of pumping.

193
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:48,479
You're pumping your blood through all the time. And those machines are our heater.

194
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,250
So it's, you know, there's no cooler, but there's a heater. So we've always worried about that risk, too.

195
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,989
And as such, we've done a lot of culturing of our echo machines and revamped the protocols and

196
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,990
things like that so that we can avoid infections in those types of patients.

197
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,420
So it's not just atypical Mycobacterium. There's lots of things that grow.

198
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:15,090
And we did culture brand new machines from our Elmo machines and cultured very add in rare water organisms.

199
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,790
So we know, you know, we can't treat these things as sterile. We know that they could pose a problem.

200
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,450
And we have to have really conscientious procedures about how to set them up so that we're not

201
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:31,409
cross contaminating with the with the water reservoir and the patients lines and the lines,

202
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:37,590
our central lines that go to you for Elmo. And they're really thick. So, you know, big opportunity for cross-contamination.

203
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:43,049
And as soon as the device is in you and you get a bacteria in there, it pumps throughout your whole body.

204
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:48,360
So it can really quickly cause a significant infection or even a movement of Legionella.

205
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:55,470
So Legionella, I think, really has has always been a concern.

206
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,250
But I think it was really brought to light when we had the water issues in Flint,

207
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:04,260
in the cases that happened there in the hospital there, and the lawsuits that followed.

208
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:12,240
And I think that was really what pushed there to be requirements for facilities to have specific elements in their water management plans.

209
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:20,069
But it's really important to consider the types of patients you take care of, what are the amounts of exposure and also the equipment, too.

210
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,879
But I think that at most hospitals you have compromised people.

211
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:31,650
And I think that, you know, we've come up with all sorts of new ways to compromise people's immune systems to save their lives.

212
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,860
So it's really great that we're able to manage their disease process,

213
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:41,399
but it puts them at risk for other things, such as Legionella, such as other opportunistic pathogens.

214
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,800
So looking at those patients and where they might get exposed, whether it's from the shower,

215
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:52,500
whether it's a sink near a bed, those types of things are things that are important to consider.

216
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,190
I have seen less Legionella with equipment, especially in health care.

217
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:05,879
I think we've seen some really odd community cases from like a air conditioner purchased at a garage on your things like that.

218
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,140
But nothing, nothing equipment related to Legionella and health care that I can recall.

219
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:17,240
The other big opportunistic pathogen is more than fungus.

220
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:24,800
You don't typically see significant infections in people with competent immune systems of these types of things.

221
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,959
You will see them in immunocompromised patients, but you won't expect to see a lot.

222
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,610
Or that might be a problem within your facility and it's typically related to the environment.

223
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,120
In the health care setting, you can see these infections from construction projects that create dust.

224
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,799
It could be contaminated air, water, linen, various supplies.

225
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,540
There have been lots of outbreaks related to hospital linen. It's obviously not sterile.

226
00:21:50,840 --> 00:22:00,500
And then there can be conditions where the contamination grows, if you will, so that there's a lot that might impact a compromised host.

227
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:06,770
We do a pretty, pretty in-depth surveillance on mold.

228
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:13,910
And so it's hard mold is really hard to do surveillance because there's not really a widely accepted definition for hospital acquired mold.

229
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,239
So you kind of have to make it up and stick with it, right.

230
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,370
So that's what, you know, we have guidance from CDC and other entities, but nothing is really in stone.

231
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,490
So we have a specific definition that we utilize.

232
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,589
And of course, we're really concerned if we see mold in one of our compromised patients.

233
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,430
Right. And we do a full on investigation and check out the environment. And certainly if we see more than one,

234
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:43,219
but we still care if we see mold that isn't really causing clinical infections in people where we wouldn't expect to see it because then we think,

235
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:51,379
yikes. Is the is the environment contaminated there such that it could impact somebody who could, you know, get sick from the mold.

236
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,800
And so trying to track all of that in a meaningful way is really challenging.

237
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:01,250
And I think that we've come a long way to that and been able to, I think, really impact a lot of our processes that way.

238
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,629
So it's definitely in-depth but and challenging.

239
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,190
But I think kind of once you get it going,

240
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:14,630
we have a we have a daily huddle on something called Monday as we talk about our new mold cases on Mondays and what's going on with them.

241
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:21,410
And that way the whole group can hear so that if there's something similar in another area and then we do a monthly mold,

242
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:26,299
we call them kind of critical event reviews of the infections to try to classify them and make sure that we are

243
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:32,090
going through the checklist of what you should look for on your unit if you have a hospital acquired mold infection,

244
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:40,400
and some of these can lead to a larger scale investigation if it's linen, etc., then it would move out to that sort of institution level.

245
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,140
So emerging pathogens are what we've been dealing with a lot more lately.

246
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:55,680
So Ebola back in, I think, 2014. And I'll talk a little bit more about sort of how Ebola looked in the United States.

247
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:03,420
Health care accurately is obviously the pandemic and I don't think I have slides on candida auris, but i'll quickly tell you about it.

248
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:09,479
Candida Auris is an emerging pathogen, a fungus, and it's really resistant.

249
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:15,780
That's the issue. So you will see fungal infections and immune compromised patients not terribly infrequently,

250
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,160
and especially if they're on a lot of antibiotics and things like that, it can cause the fungus to overgrow.

251
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:30,839
But Candida Auris is incredibly resistant. And we actually unfortunately had cases in Michigan recently in skilled nursing facilities.

252
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,319
And so that's kind of where it starts in those really, you know, high risk patients.

253
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,010
And then those folks will flock back and forth between hospitals and things like that.

254
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:45,389
So we've really been working with our partners in public health and in all of the hospitals in Michigan to kind of talk about how to

255
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:53,340
alert each other and make sure that we're aware when we get a patient that has Candida Auris so that we can treat them appropriately,

256
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,290
make sure that the environment is cleaned appropriately and screen other patients if needed.

257
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:03,480
So that one has been interesting. And what we've done is added this to our travel screen.

258
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,559
So we do a lot of screening and triage. So when people come in,

259
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,340
so they have specific risk factors and they've been to a skilled nursing facility that has that or

260
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,719
they've been ventilated in a skilled nursing facility or they've been in a long term acute care hospital,

261
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,910
those types of things would trigger them to get put into precautions and then screened so that we can

262
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:26,130
make sure that we're not placing them with a roommate and then they'll later end up with Canada or us.

263
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:33,420
It's interesting because this couple of years ago we would really only see Candida Auris from people who got medicine in other countries.

264
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,640
So somebody who got medical care or was hospitalized in another country where Candida Auris was more prevalent.

265
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:45,380
But now we're seeing it in our skilled nursing facilities. And we've had a number of cases in Michigan, unfortunately.

266
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:52,400
All right. So with the emerging pathogens, the keep me says they require quick action.

267
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:57,060
And I think the key piece of that is the risk communication.

268
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:02,960
What you typically see we saw with Ebola. So it would go back and the recommendations change sometimes on a daily basis.

269
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,850
And communicating that in a meaningful way to people who are taking care of

270
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:12,510
these patients and making sure they continue to trust you is very difficult.

271
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:20,570
So that, I think is the key piece, is the communication side on how people put on PPE, take on PPE, that kind of thing.

272
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:29,630
And it might require you to change your triage or your screening process, change your PPE model and definitely change your cleaning model.

273
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,230
So those are things that that come up pretty quickly with these kinds of things.

274
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:41,630
So with Ebola, I want to talk until when I was supposed to start the discussion.

275
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:51,079
So usually those until about 12:24 p.m. to be okay with Ebola, I won't go into the background of it.

276
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,580
But in general,

277
00:26:52,580 --> 00:27:02,300
we did not see Ebola in the United States and in and it was really in areas of Africa and really wasn't spreading outside of those areas.

278
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:12,230
But in 2014, there were large outbreaks in West Africa and imported cases and then transmission also in the United States.

279
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:19,190
And so I will say that CDC guidance around Ebola or hemorrhagic fevers,

280
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:26,270
pre Ebola ever being seen here where minimal like they told you to do contact precautions and it

281
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:32,149
was like no big deal until we started to see cases here and transmission and health care workers,

282
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:39,100
which I'll talk a little bit about. So this was like a crazy like how are you going to deal with an Ebola patient?

283
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:46,999
Was that was a big deal here. Now, when you think back to how Ebola transmitted, it's direct contact with infected body fluids.

284
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,129
Right. So it's not super easy to catch.

285
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:56,600
It's not like airborne unless you're totally unprotected and somebody is like vomiting or you're doing resuscitation or something like that.

286
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:04,400
People don't aren't infectious. When they're not symptomatic, they get a lot more virus in their blood as they become sicker.

287
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,670
And it's pretty easy to kill, too. You don't need crazy chemicals.

288
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:11,780
Regular cleaning and chemicals kill Ebola pretty readily.

289
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,120
But the 2014 outbreak was the largest that had hit that we had seen.

290
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:22,369
And there wasn't an outbreak in the United States, but everybody was like panicked about it.

291
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:26,569
And then when there were two health care worker cases in Texas,

292
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:34,250
they they had direct contact with a Ebola patient that wasn't identified very quickly and both became infected.

293
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:38,000
And I don't know if you guys remember, but one got exposed and then was traveling.

294
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:47,120
So it was just like a big ordeal. And my I think that, you know, at the beginning, the PPE model for this was like tie back.

295
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,930
It was like hazmat, like everybody was wearing like the full Tyvek, etc.

296
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:56,209
You know, if you're providing care to somebody very sick, you probably need that level of protection.

297
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:03,140
But to be honest with you, when you look at the health care worker transmission, my opinion is that as health care workers,

298
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:09,560
we don't do a great job of just following standard precautions and taking off the PPE is like the biggest risk.

299
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,049
So making sure that people properly dock.

300
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:20,090
And when we have an Ebola suspect, we have a trained observer watching and checking, you are okay, take off this glove, wash your hands.

301
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:26,899
You know, it's like a whole process. But I think that level of detail is really needed because it's life and death and

302
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,520
it's really high stress situations and just making sure that people are comfortable.

303
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,550
It's not like you're going to see something like this frequently. Thank goodness. Right.

304
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,399
But that means it's really hard to keep people competent with this.

305
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:44,389
So we sort of have a process in place where we have safety folks that are on call to come in and

306
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:50,990
be trained observers and kind of walk people through everything as we're triaging the patients,

307
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:59,180
the guidelines exchanging, as I said, it was super lax PPE before this became a thing in the US.

308
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:03,500
And frankly, health care workers don't really trust the CDC either.

309
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:10,999
I think that I can remember when we had somebody who was I think had been traveling in West Africa,

310
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,900
but they didn't really meet the criteria for being exposed to Ebola at all.

311
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,030
And we ran it past our public health partners in our state and everybody was like, no, no deal.

312
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,360
And our providers are like, No, we don't trust them.

313
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,470
We want to call CDC. So we had to have a conference call with CDC and walk through everything.

314
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:35,870
So it was very dicey and stressful for people and high demand for the Tyvek suits, etc.

315
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:45,950
So those were some of the big challenges I think that we ended up here at the time creating a special unit that because of the scale.

316
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,200
It was like the Special Pathogens Containment Unit or something like that,

317
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:57,870
but it was several rooms and there was a lot of space for supplies and donning and doffing and it was so expensive.

318
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:02,370
And we did all sorts of training for people just in case, and thank goodness we didn't have to use it,

319
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:06,590
but the amount of time and energy that was spent on that was significant.

320
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:12,929
So now I think that most places would probably not elect to care for Ebola patients.

321
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:19,050
They would sort of keep them for a period of time and then send them to Nebraska or one of the large sites that does or Bellevue or,

322
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:24,780
you know, that that is equipped to deal with these sorts of special pathogens on a larger scale.

323
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,030
I think we can talk through these. Oh, just some things to think about, though.

324
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:40,119
So reaction to reading the script from the screening and triage are pretty simple, but it's like, where are you going to put the person right?

325
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:46,239
So you want to make sure as soon as you identify that this sounds a little bit questionable that you have a room.

326
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,090
And luckily both of our emergency department rooms have kind of a hazmat room in case of like chemical things as well.

327
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,870
So we can typically find a space like that.

328
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:03,790
I said, I told you the challenges with training personnel, the transport was humongous when we were thinking about how are we going to get

329
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:09,910
this patient from the emergency room up to this 10th floor room in this hospital?

330
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:16,210
And we had like a hood thing that went over the bed, an elevator disinfection protocol, and it was like complete insanity.

331
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:23,469
Lab test. You can't be taking blood that might have a high level Ebola of Ebola in it across your health system either.

332
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:26,080
So we had a lot of point of care testing set up.

333
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,700
We had like a mini lab set up next to the room where we were going to be able to care for the patient so that we

334
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:36,160
would just be able to run the test there and people wouldn't be transporting blood throughout the health system.

335
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:45,700
We utilize our telemedicine. We did equip the rooms with a lot of video conferencing stuff so that like consultant providers wouldn't be going in,

336
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,930
that they would just be talking on the on the devices.

337
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,750
Visitors are it's always tough, right, because it's like you don't want any visitors, you don't want to get infected.

338
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:59,500
But then when you're talking about like a parent child situation, it's a whole nother ballgame.

339
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:06,670
So trying to manage that, figure out what you're going to do with this visitor who's then potentially exposed is is very challenging as well.

340
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:14,830
Also, if you have staff caring for these folks, making sure that we're screening them in case they had an unknown exposure,

341
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,170
and if they develop symptoms and having a place for them to sleep,

342
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,710
if they don't want to go home and like those sorts of things all come into it as well.

343
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:27,070
Cleaning and terminal disinfection. It's so funny with Ebola, I said it's super easy to kill, but everybody was like,

344
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,129
No, we're going to throw everything away after reuse and then we don't care.

345
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,400
Like they were very at the beginning, like, nope, we're not going to use this again.

346
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,260
We have standard operating procedures. That's what sops our core everything.

347
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:44,919
And we walked through them in that scanner and, you know, practiced them, you know, day after day after day and luckily didn't need them.

348
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:51,370
But we were ready for it. This was our this is our current PPE model as well.

349
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:58,030
It's sort of the triage PPE when you're worried somebody might have Ebola, but you're not actually going to be providing care,

350
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:04,120
but just kind of getting them to a room versus actually providing care, which continues to be the high level.

351
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:11,200
It's not exactly the Tyvek anymore. We have lighter weight suits and some different know lighter weight things,

352
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:16,420
but it's still something that we have to figure out how to keep people competent on.

353
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,979
So the pandemic response, I'll just tell a little bit about that, especially.

354
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:30,410
It's interesting, I was thinking back to this as we're kind of transitioning into doing less and less and less so with personal protective equipment.

355
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:38,420
Again, there were frequent updates and we had very crazy supply chain issues where there were days that I thought, we've been around masks.

356
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:46,969
It was really, really high stress figuring out in this case we were like, Yikes, we think it might be airborne for some at some level.

357
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:53,990
So figuring out the negative pressure environments, creating negative pressure environments, all that kind of stuff, the communication, again,

358
00:34:53,990 --> 00:35:04,070
we you we sent out at least daily staff emails about the changes from that day and what had happened that day from the hospital command center.

359
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,659
The education was significant in going.

360
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:19,219
We at the beginning did open up the we called the review the regional infection containment unit, a big negative pressure unit that we that we have.

361
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:26,450
And we ended up having to surge into many, many spaces because at the first surge, we actually had a couple hundred ICU patients.

362
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:33,379
It was it was pretty, pretty bad. And going to those units and walking people through the PPE and how to put it on and how to take it off.

363
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,720
And then, oh, this doesn't make sense, you know,

364
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:42,200
just trying to walk through everything and make sure everybody felt comfortable and we had to do this with PPE ever use too,

365
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:50,480
because we didn't have enough masks. Nobody did. So to figure out how to safely reuse, we ended up putting into place disinfection of the masks.

366
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,410
So we did let you be in infection for a short period of time, thankfully.

367
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,020
But all of that was, you know,

368
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:02,480
coming up with places to put the masks and making sure the right mask got back to the right person and all that kind of thing.

369
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:09,350
We had to wind down operations at the beginning. The hospital was just full of COVID patients.

370
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:16,790
Everything else was pretty much shut down. Our ambulatory care was emergent only so most of the clinics were shut down to very limited capacity.

371
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:20,330
And then the other interesting thing with that is when we ramped back up,

372
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:25,430
it gave us an opportunity to collect baseline data for our water management planning because we had

373
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:29,509
to do a lot of flushing and things on these buildings that had been used for a couple of weeks.

374
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:35,780
And then we were able to test the water and check the chlorine and the temperature and all those things and troubleshoot those issues,

375
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:39,290
which was again, maybe like of some of this.

376
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:46,430
And the screening was significant too. And we're still dealing with this and figuring out how to win back things,

377
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:50,149
you know, with the screening of everybody who comes in the building all the time.

378
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:56,360
So these were all really significant issues, definitely putting out the PPE and taking it off.

379
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:02,179
And then this particular incident too, we had a couple different and if I missed too,

380
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:06,770
so we had to kind of make sure everything was similar enough that the instructions weren't

381
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:10,460
different or make sure that people who had different masks had the different instructions.

382
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:18,530
And it was actually stunning how people didn't really seem comfortable doing hand p swabs when we've been doing I'm like for flu season for,

383
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,909
you know, for a long time.

384
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:27,410
So it was just like making sure everybody was comfortable doing those things as well so that we were getting good samples and things like that.

385
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:32,330
So those are kind of the crazy outbreak kind of things.

386
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,520
It's not well outside of the pandemic. It's not what we, I would say, spend most of our time on.

387
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:42,679
Our regular work has a lot to do with preventing health care associated infections,

388
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:49,190
specifically related to devices and procedures and things that you're exposed to in the hospital.

389
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,300
So the big bucket items are central line associated bloodstream infections.

390
00:37:53,300 --> 00:38:03,230
We call them Clancy's catheter associated urinary tract infections or Cordis surgical site infections or exercise Clostridium difficile infection,

391
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:08,180
and also just multi-drug resistant organisms. And the arrows is another one that we deal with as well.

392
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,170
So how we do this is policies.

393
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:18,110
There's lots of policies with classic prevention policies or chaotic prevention policy with the do's and don'ts.

394
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:23,330
But bundles are the key piece to preventing hospital acquired infections in most situations.

395
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,889
And it's a bunch of things that you always do to avoid infections.

396
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:32,900
And most of the time the literature is such that they've not been the pieces haven't been studied on their own.

397
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:39,170
It's just like this is the bundle, just do it. And it's interesting because for example, for a central line insertion,

398
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:45,469
you wear a head cover or you wear a mask, you know, sterile gloves, sterile drape, all these things.

399
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:49,280
And then people will complain, do I really have to wear, you know, a or whatever?

400
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,609
And it's like, I don't know, but we're doing it. You have to do all these things together.

401
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:59,419
That's, that's what's been shown to be effective. And making sure that that's consistently done is the other kind of key piece.

402
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:05,299
And I think that's where you'll see backsliding is you'll have these in place, but people maybe have backslid.

403
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:16,820
I'm doing this. There are guidelines around this pack, be it through CDC puts out big changes to these and they put it out as.

404
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:26,380
Strength of evidence. So they'll have stakeholders from hospitals and they'll have infectious disease and vaccine prevention and hospitalist,

405
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,409
critical care docs, all, you know, vascular access,

406
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:35,860
all those folks will come together and put together the recommendations and they do the strength of evidence based on the available literature.

407
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,460
So and then they'll basically say, if it's one thing you should implement, if it's,

408
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:43,629
you know, one B, you should consider it in these circumstances and that sort of thing.

409
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:51,510
So that's typically how those are written. And there's regulatory requirements to the Joint Commission has national patient safety goals and they

410
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:57,540
expect you to do certain things with regards to having an insertion bundle for inserting central lines,

411
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:06,030
for example, or things like that. So this is these are sort of the activities that that are done to prevent infections.

412
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:15,390
So I'll give this one as an example. If you see an increase in cavities in patients with, they also find in a variety of your medical wards.

413
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,260
How do you investigate this? I'll give you a little background on dialysis lines.

414
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:24,750
Patients that are hospitalized and need dialysis,

415
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:34,950
there's usually a specific dialysis catheter that they are using and typically only dialysis nurses will be touching the dialysis catheter.

416
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:41,280
That's kind of just like the normal practice and they'll come and do the dialysis and keep the line up.

417
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:45,480
Well, what was happening is that when patients were critically ill,

418
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:52,559
they were getting a central line put in that they call a trial design, and it was a dialysis line with an extra port.

419
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:59,580
So it could be used for other things. But they had dialysis and then they didn't actually need the dialysis anymore and they were sent

420
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:05,100
to the general care because they kept that line in because they were still using the other port.

421
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:10,229
And so nobody was maintaining the dialysis lines because the nurses on the floor had been trained to never,

422
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:15,320
ever touch the dialysis line, but dialysis wasn't happening. So you can see how those sorts of things would happen.

423
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:22,680
So I think a key piece is sort of going and seeing when something happens and asking a lot of questions because if you read your pulse,

424
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:27,690
you're like, Yeah, this adds up. But when you actually go and ask people and then they say, Oh yeah, you know,

425
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:30,659
that came off of our dialysis centers because we're not having dialysis anymore.

426
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:36,890
And it's like, Oh, well, they still have this line and nobody's dealing with this one port and then it's getting infected.

427
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:42,270
So that was sort of something that we had experience with people with dialysis lines.

428
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:51,230
So this one is an increase in sea death and a step down year to step down unit is where you go after ICU,

429
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,020
not critical care, but kind of the next step down.

430
00:41:54,020 --> 00:42:01,790
You're not totally doing great yet, but not critically ill and the patients are all being seen by the same service.

431
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:11,690
So what are you going to look at? And the little wheel that I included here is sort of the different areas that we try to hit with seated prevention.

432
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,440
So contact precautions and hand hygiene are key.

433
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:22,549
If you have seen cases, environmental and equipment cleaning are key and the environmental cleaning is typically done by environmental services,

434
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:29,840
but the equipment cleaning is typically done by whoever used it testing appropriately in antibiotic stewardship.

435
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,919
So people being on certain antibiotics put them at much higher risk RECEI difficile.

436
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,250
So if there's a better option that that should be selected.

437
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,140
And just sometimes the antibiotics in general put them at higher risk.

438
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:46,920
So they're all seen by the same service. That means the same group of doctors.

439
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:56,389
So let's say it's urology. So we would probably start by looking at that and saying, are they all in the hospital for the same thing?

440
00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:02,780
Are they on the same antibiotics? You know, maybe we would round with this team and see if they're washing their hands.

441
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:12,079
And you know what else is happening there? I think that I had a unit once and I think it I think it was in the urology

442
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:17,210
patients and they had an increase in C difficile and we could not figure it out.

443
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:24,379
And the antibiotics were, you know, not great but not totally abnormal from what you would see in other institutions.

444
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,530
There's patients that have certain procedures are at really high risk.

445
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:34,190
Well, the unit that they went to had they call them the Jack and Jill style bathroom.

446
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:39,349
So it'd be like a double room and a private room, but they would share a bathroom.

447
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:44,990
So be three patients using the same bathroom. So I was like, Oh my gosh, problem solved.

448
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:50,390
My analysts and I had like a map of the unit stretched out across the whole floor to make everybody out.

449
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:54,950
Like, for sure this is going to be the cause. And it wasn't. I mean, I was figuring it out it.

450
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:59,750
So they resolved, which is kind of the disappointing part about infection prevention.

451
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,549
You do a lot of these things, but you don't you often don't find out what the cause was,

452
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:07,790
but you just do a lot of things and the problem ends up going away.

453
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:10,910
So this was kind of one of those examples.

454
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,220
Do people have questions before we move into the discussion questions?

455
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:26,290
All right. So I so I think there's seven groups, so I actually do have seven questions and you guys should have access to the slides.

456
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:32,160
You should be able to see which ones are for your group. But just in general, I will just give some tips.

457
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:38,129
It's really always important to to verify the existence of a problem or the baseline or usual

458
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:44,790
rates that you see or cases that's important as you're trying to decide what direction to go,

459
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:51,540
certainly knowing what the usual practices are and if they're being done.

460
00:44:52,650 --> 00:45:01,740
The literature is huge to to look at anything similar to see, you know, if anything similar to what you're seeing happen elsewhere.

461
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:09,510
And there is an outbreak database where you can almost always find something that you're looking for and the organism characteristics as well.

462
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:16,619
You want to know if it's in the water, if it's in the dust, if it's fecal, oral, you know, those sorts of things.

463
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:22,350
So those are kind of key items that think about when you're looking into something.

464
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,120
So since you have them, I probably don't need to read them. Right?

465
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:31,970
I can just you guys can just split into your groups or our write up and then we can maybe talk about a couple and,

466
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,910
you know, 10 minutes or something like that. Okay, thanks.

467
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:56,170
I don't think he would look at that one, stuff like that.

468
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:11,500
After I got a female doctor, I guess it seems like it was nice that she was just like, yeah, it was so funny.

469
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,360
Yeah. Yeah. I guess.

470
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:21,200
What? I guess so. I don't know. Yeah, I know that.

471
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:27,340
That's really such a hot topic.

472
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:40,790
Yeah, I like. Oh, I goodness.

473
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:56,610
I mean, it's like, you know, I haven't got like, discussion.

474
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,410
I personally. Yeah.

475
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:20,530
But she also said that because I mean, it's just like the first thing that I said that I hurt my initial thought and I was doing learning.

476
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:35,770
So I don't know, because of course I do.

477
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:45,700
Anyway, I think.

478
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:52,690
I mean, I don't know.

479
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:58,560
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

480
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:05,200
You know, some of those are gone.

481
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,350
Oh, really? Really?

482
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:14,770
Yeah, I think that's right. That's right.

483
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:30,020
I think there's something else. I don't think that it's like going to be transferred from, like, because I, I guess I,

484
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:45,220
you know, I personally, I think I was trying to pretend that I know what I was going to say.

485
00:48:45,490 --> 00:49:09,910
You know, he question because that was the first you're here.

486
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:27,280
I'm good. How are you? Oh, really?

487
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:38,260
Yeah, that's that's interesting.

488
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:59,400
I guess I want to show you, like, examples, like, you know,

489
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:09,320
he was probably providing like when they were showing solidarity or if there was an announcement.

490
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:23,360
Not like, you know, it's like I thought it was funny, but I think that I don't know.

491
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:30,670
I mean, you know, you look at first like.

492
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:46,340
In the sense of General Journal readers.

493
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:57,090
Well, you don't like to be asked to really watch that.

494
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:06,310
We don't have access. But like, thanks for doing that.

495
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:27,660
And I think it's Susan, rather. I mean, you know, I never really let her know what it is that you're supposed to do.

496
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:35,790
Yeah, but I mean, I don't know. Why does it seem like like any of the all these biotech classes have her, like,

497
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:43,950
overlapping each other and just learning this little, teeny, tiny thing that was really hard.

498
00:51:45,080 --> 00:52:02,880
You've got to kind of like, at least to be called mutations which are recorded on sterile,

499
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:12,470
unstable substances and progress made miserable feeling, I feel.

500
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:29,460
So, yeah, this is this is the thing about the world where certain people say the word number seven.

501
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:37,590
I thought it was exciting. Oh, yeah. We did not talk about that.

502
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:43,990
It feels like it's sort of the competition for something.

503
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,660
Oh, I don't.

504
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:53,290
I don't have any idea. Oh, no. Oh, I know she doesn't.

505
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:58,690
And I'm. I'm really.

506
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:06,000
Yeah, she's a good source for other side.

507
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:13,050
Like I'm at the station sort of complain, but I just think that she is easier than I was thinking about.

508
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:20,100
So I think it's different pretty by the end, I don't know.

509
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:30,890
I just really think that's probably a good thing to do that people can just listen.

510
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:38,100
Yeah, that's good. I think that was my first thought was just that it was like it just wasn't sterilized correctly.

511
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:43,880
Yeah. Like, and then I thought they were going to be like.

512
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:52,510
Yeah, I guess so. Like when, you know, a lot of people, I mean, not enough data and I know that I know it's expired.

513
00:53:53,480 --> 00:54:02,530
Yeah, but I feel like I see where we need to be getting results.

514
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:21,009
And I was like, okay, but they are, they're like, they're not going to like and it's like, that's awesome actually.

515
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:33,460
Like, but the is I, you know, you're giving them to make, right?

516
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:46,030
Yeah. Yeah. And I was like, maybe even if they were like, even if they.

517
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:10,310
Well, and that's gazpacho, informatics. You know, I always think about all sorts of reasons.

518
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:17,780
When I first heard about, I was worried about their jobs.

519
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:28,450
And I think this is just another day I'm going to do.

520
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:47,570
It's not like I like where. But, you know, I think that this economy is something that was pretty much.

521
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:52,090
I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

522
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,329
I think so, too.

523
00:55:55,330 --> 00:56:09,409
Her husband. I know it's so scary looking around and, you know, starting to my lovely.

524
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:16,910
Oh, my God. You know, that is a good time.

525
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:37,740
There must be something I'm trying to do that should have real issues, like, oh, my God, please don't cover everything.

526
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:41,140
So what did you do? Something like choose.

527
00:56:41,210 --> 00:57:06,030
You know, I don't think she was like, almost like I don't know if I had to leave the country.

528
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:24,740
I know. It's really scary, Ali.

529
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:47,340
You know, you never know what's going to happen.

530
00:57:50,660 --> 00:58:01,340
And I guess sometimes I have like a positive.

531
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:10,290
Oh, yeah. I mean, you know, I don't think I'm like three.

532
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:31,660
Yeah. So, you know, it's like they're really in their hearts since I know the first time Sterile was used for them when started.

533
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:40,350
I know. Yeah, I know.

534
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,880
I know that she is sitting there talking to him.

535
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:50,300
Yeah, yeah.

536
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,770
I mean something like that.

537
00:58:56,180 --> 00:59:04,060
Yeah. They're going to be so paranoid and you think you're going to be like, Oh, my God, what is it?

538
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:18,260
You know, I was like, Oh, I don't like the issue with that because it's just like annoying thing about, like, what I was doing on T.V.

539
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:25,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I wouldn't watch any of those so much every day.

540
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:31,610
Like, literally type of like you're just like, oh no.

541
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:35,770
That's specifically for like whose job is try to relax when they should.

542
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:42,400
And you know, sometimes it's not.

543
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:52,670
And I guess because like you said, you have it just seems.

544
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:06,950
So I think, you know, it's nice to have you know, I have no idea why.

545
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:28,820
Yeah. I mean, this is just going to end up in our hearts and minds.

546
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:52,950
Yeah. I mean, it's just it's always been this thing that you hear from each other through email, you know?

547
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:57,370
I don't know what to say.

548
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:06,770
Oh, I don't know.

549
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:15,240
I can't let you start working here.

550
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:27,319
I mean, it's like, that's great for me.

551
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:45,750
I'm just trying to find out what was that all about?

552
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:51,710
Like what he said about what would you like, get out?

553
01:01:51,710 --> 01:02:01,610
I don't know. I don't think it's really for you.

554
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:15,480
I know it's a lot of construction, so it seems to work in, like, gas fields.

555
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:33,890
And I know, I guess you're right, but it's just like every time I think that, you know, I have always been like,

556
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:57,400
yeah, I just think it's just like, yeah, I've just I just got like 50 different things.

557
01:02:57,850 --> 01:03:30,620
I never pulled down like 40 minutes, you know, which was like on a good point about what's going on with you.

558
01:03:31,510 --> 01:04:01,440
But mostly, I mean, yeah, there's some areas like that, but I wouldn't say that it really all is exactly what going because I was just like,

559
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:24,710
I don't know, it's just like feel like the houses, anything like, you know, I think that people.

560
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:39,570
Why don't you try to do those things?

561
01:04:46,950 --> 01:05:02,620
I don't make. But I don't know what it's like to be Gertrude Stein.

562
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:12,270
Yes, it was good. Looks like there's been some static.

563
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:19,080
So we're not involved in making it look like everyone gets pretty.

564
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:31,240
Pretty. So how do you like it?

565
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:45,330
I think that it wasn't because, you know, like you said, I think that the prizes are like that.

566
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:52,890
That's that's what I like about how you go about having these events, because it's sort of like social or something social.

567
01:05:52,960 --> 01:06:04,350
Like I love social, but it's $3 for a chicken, which is ridiculous in the way that it's really okay.

568
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:25,260
I used to really like social, but I feel like I have to kind of like sometimes like I usually it's just like.

569
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:30,620
But no one in particular, I guess.

570
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:40,980
Yes, I totally agree.

571
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:56,140
I mean, because so far it's been it's a really it's a great since then.

572
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:13,780
Like Detroit is Detroit now, I don't know, 37 West Michigan.

573
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:22,590
Like I was expecting to see what we could do that to be like that, you know.

574
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:29,400
Yeah. Yeah. You never think about it now. People are like klausner bars and clubs and it's crazy.

575
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:44,090
I, I think it's just, like, told me. It's like, you can't stay there for a baseball game whenever you get out there.

576
01:07:44,190 --> 01:08:05,790
Yeah. Now it's different articles from last week which I've heard from people like, Are you guys ready to do a quick share?

577
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:16,050
I'm told I'm supposed to start with this site today. It's Wednesday, so I don't want to say which one is did and then chat about it.

578
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:25,230
So we did discuss in seven, which was an increase and surgical site infection and abdominal surgery.

579
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:35,310
So our first three was thinking about kind of it not being disinfected correctly with like better, but that's what they like to actually do that.

580
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:39,470
And then another part could be the sterile fields that have been violated.

581
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:48,390
I'm touching this on my band, not sterile anymore and instruments could not have been sterile or for hand hygiene and PPE usage.

582
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,690
So those are kind of theories. I think those are all good theories.

583
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:57,360
I think that typically when you see an increase in size, you go in the hour and see what's going on.

584
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:00,780
And I think you almost always see that the prepping isn't perfect.

585
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:02,909
So I think your first one is spot on,

586
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:09,149
especially when it's skin organisms and it's a lot of different skin preps out there and they have to be applied in different ways.

587
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:14,760
And so so but I do think all of those could absolutely be contributing factors and things that you would want to look at.

588
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:20,850
And I know that somebody came up and chatted about preoperative bathing, and I think that's a good, good thing, too, because, you know,

589
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:27,270
if the patients show up dirty, you know, and they haven't had a shower that morning and they haven't had a wipe down or whatever.

590
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:30,630
Then certainly there's more organisms on their body that can get in the good.

591
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:37,580
Good job. All right. So I'm assuming six that you guys.

592
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:44,880
Yeah. So we were. I suppose we see more collapses than normal, all caused by common skin organisms.

593
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,010
What would you be looking at?

594
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:56,870
First we said looking to see how the skin is being prepped and making sure that central beds are being inserted in a sterile manner,

595
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:02,660
looking at hand hygiene practices and making sure that health care workers are adhering to them.

596
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:10,350
Looking at all aspects of the bundle, making sure the ports are being cleaned with alcohol before they're exposed.

597
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:22,620
Making sure patients are getting sieged baths. The maintenance of the central line and making sure dressings are cleaned or changed.

598
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:26,000
There's not like blood or anything on them and the ports are cleaned.

599
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:34,200
And then looking at the location of the central line, like whether it be in the groin or neck and like if the patient's touching them.

600
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:38,820
Yeah, really good points. And just this picture is making me think of it.

601
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:45,180
This is an age line. And sometimes, especially in cardiac patients, they have these things called cornices and they're super heavy.

602
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:49,110
And so the dressing will get pulled down. And at the same time, some of them have tricks.

603
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:52,400
And so you can imagine trying to keep it clean. But yeah, exactly.

604
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:56,489
One thing I would throw out there too is that all those things are correct.

605
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:59,969
And I think a key piece when you're looking at this is when did the infection happen?

606
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:02,040
Was it pretty quick after it got inserted?

607
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:09,890
And if so, pretty good chance that it was the insertion and if it was later on, pretty good chance it was the maintenance practices that did you.

608
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:15,149
All right. You're fired. So yeah.

609
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:21,690
So we're going to we're going to see if there's a little uptick in colonies in surgical wards or.

610
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:29,020
Things we ought to think about would be to go to the unit and sort of assess the insertion practices and hygiene.

611
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:29,670
We talked about that.

612
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:40,220
Then we want to talk with the unit staff and see if there's any blocks with how they're inserting it or if there's anything there.

613
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:49,880
We also want to see if there's a trend and who's inserting as a resident, as the nurses that are attending patient cleanliness or pre-op cleaning.

614
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:53,630
And then we also want to look at the amount of time that the catheter is in place.

615
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:01,280
Really good. Yeah. So and that last one that you hit on, how long is the catheter about in place?

616
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:09,880
This is important. It's about every day you have a Foley and it's about a 3 to 5% chance of bacterial contamination in there.

617
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:15,020
So every day that that grows. And so after you've had a Foley in for a week, if you culture your urine,

618
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:21,800
whether you have an infection or not, you're probably going to grow bacteria. So it's always interesting to see if it's a true infection or not.

619
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:26,629
And you never know, right? It's you usually shouldn't be culturing unless there's symptoms, but we'll we'll see.

620
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:30,800
As in like the ICU setting, if somebody gets a fever, the culture, everything.

621
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:35,900
And so then you have a positive urine culture and you're like, Oh, they're getting treated for this, but it's probably not a clot.

622
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:41,720
One of the things we've done to try to combat that is said the body's been in place a week.

623
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:46,220
You need to take it out and put a new Foley in in that culture through an old sort of crusty Foley.

624
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:50,240
But the compliance with that is very questionable. Yeah, all those are really good.

625
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:54,469
The this is just to comment on the picture on this.

626
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:57,200
Those little tubes are what we collect the urine in.

627
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:03,200
So there's like an access port and the Foley to collect the urine and these have preservatives in them.

628
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:10,190
So if they didn't get right to the lab, it doesn't sort of overgrow which we saw a decent decrease when we started using those as.

629
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:16,240
Which are you guys? All right. Before.

630
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:27,490
So we were first presuming that they already have a positive PCR test and then it's already been taken care of for this scenario.

631
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:34,600
And so we were saying that we had to first ask the patients who they came in contact with and test those individuals and then ask the

632
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:44,049
health care workers whether they were wearing proper PPE or using proper hygiene and where they were working with which ward at the time,

633
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:49,240
and how many patients or which patients they saw. We were also talking about how they're.

634
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:57,620
If there is a common link, the need to check the other patients that those healthcare workers also treated and then confirm the time and

635
01:13:57,620 --> 01:14:02,420
space for the patient that could have been and find out who and what had been in the same place at the same time.

636
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:09,610
Also need to know when was symptom onset so that you could understand if it was community acquired and brought into the hospital.

637
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:12,890
If it was something that happened while entirely while in the hospital.

638
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:20,500
All the questions for contacts should be within the exposure period. Yeah.

639
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:29,830
Really good. One of the things that we do is we test everybody when they get here to try to capture whoever asymptomatically is has covered.

640
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:32,350
And oddly enough, during this last wave,

641
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:40,180
I would say it's been about only 25 to 30% of our patients hospitalized with COVID are actually here for COVID,

642
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:45,459
like the rest of them to, you know, 75% of the others just tested positive on admission.

643
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:50,860
We're actually here for something else. So that's just an interesting fact about like the Apple brand and what we've been seeing with that,

644
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:57,759
which to me indicates less severe disease for most. Yeah, the contact tracing is huge.

645
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:02,709
I think that it's always difficult to try to see when did it occur and where they incubating on admission.

646
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:06,940
You just didn't catch it or did they get it from somebody? And the contact tracing, you're right, is the key.

647
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:17,110
Whether it's the health care workers or the other patients. We typically tend to see transmission when we see it among roommates.

648
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:18,219
So if one roommate gets it,

649
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:23,560
then there's a pretty high chance that the other person's going to get it if they've been there for any length of time, which is awful.

650
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:27,970
And that is why I hate semi-private rooms so much. But this is the world we live in right now.

651
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:33,040
All right. Thanks, you guys. Good job. All right. Script three.

652
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:39,430
Yeah. So when we were looking at this, we had a series of ideas to cross off different possibilities.

653
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:47,059
I was seeing like a nonclinical decision. So one thing we were going to look at is the possibility of contamination and when it occurred.

654
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:51,740
So look at seeing if other pulmonologists are having the same problem.

655
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:57,920
So we might see light contamination either in the teams that are collecting samples or the swabs or

656
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:03,920
whatever we're using or possibly that there's lab contamination and bio matrices are augers we're using.

657
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,830
If that doesn't seem to be the case, if it's only for this.

658
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:15,140
Particular pulmonologist that it might be that her scope is contaminated and not being cleaned properly.

659
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:21,740
So that might be a problem. It's just like a decline in the proper sanitation of supplies.

660
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:26,180
And then it seems to be fairly universal even at other facilities in the area.

661
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:37,009
We would want to look at whether patterning. So if there's been like more of a kick up in like winds, that might be why we see non clinical symptoms,

662
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:41,270
but certainly presence and air passages and if it only seems to be at this facility,

663
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:44,660
then we're going to want to look at just more information about the patients,

664
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:50,780
especially where they were staying in the hospital, where they have the same area, same ward or different areas.

665
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:54,260
And it just obviously got to this pulmonologist that's good.

666
01:16:55,250 --> 01:17:05,479
So I had something similar to this. And what had ended up happening is that the a lot of places clean their scopes

667
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:08,959
with automatic scope reprocessing and sort of like a washing machine for scopes.

668
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:13,280
And so you wash the scope and get the channels cleaned out and then you hook it up and then

669
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:17,359
it pumps the disinfectant through and rinses it and it actually does an alcohol rinse,

670
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,180
too. And then you're supposed to force air dry. That's kind of just a scope thing.

671
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:27,860
But in this case, the staff had been told by the rep, Hey, you only have to change the filters every,

672
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:29,990
I don't know, three months or six months or something like that.

673
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:37,409
But really, you were supposed to be looking at these pressure gauges and changing the filters when it was at some differential,

674
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:44,330
and they didn't do that. And so we found that the sediment filter was so full that it was kind of like

675
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:48,680
overwhelming the bacterial filter and the mycobacterium was getting through.

676
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:53,689
And I don't think the scopes were probably getting totally forced air dried either.

677
01:17:53,690 --> 01:18:02,030
So I think that contributed. So that was what we hypothesized was causing the mycobacterium the mold, I don't know,

678
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:06,259
but I think it was how they were handling the scopes and like grabbing them without

679
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:09,709
gloves and putting them on the counter without protection and stuff like that.

680
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:13,400
But it was I don't know, any one of those things that you mentioned could have also been the cause.

681
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:17,950
So nice job. All right. Group two.

682
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:26,740
Yeah. So we said talked about there being like two main problem locations either, uh,

683
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:33,550
pre prep for surgery or like the actual or like the surgery room and then the ward after surgery.

684
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:43,059
And so, ah, I guess our first course of action was to look at both locations and see if there's like contaminated equipment, like in surgery.

685
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:48,830
It could also be improper hand-washing. But we were leaning towards more like the equipment and contact services.

686
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:56,560
So treating those also just kind of doing a deep clean then post surgery, it could be a medication thing.

687
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:02,420
I think that's less common and I think yeah.

688
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:07,809
So that was the big thing is because it's a big concern on surfaces.

689
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:11,760
So like cleaning everything. Yeah, I think that's a really good point.

690
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:17,829
So if they're all going to the same word and that word is discharging us to the patient and whatever, then they would be at increased risk.

691
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:26,500
And I look for a lot of these types of surgeries. They sort of pound people with antibiotics to prevent other things and puts them at higher risk.

692
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:31,620
So absolutely. Good job. All right. I think we might not have time for the last groups.

693
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:34,840
I don't it? Sorry, guys. I know you're probably really busy.

694
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:53,660
Just be careful not to go in the same room.

695
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:53,930
But.
