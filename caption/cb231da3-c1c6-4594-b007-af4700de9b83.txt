1
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,590
Hey. Good morning, folks. Selection day.

2
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:34,850
Yay. Uh, if you haven't already had a chance to, I strongly encourage you to, uh, a lot of time to get out and vote today.

3
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,730
Very important understatement there.

4
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:47,690
Um, I wanted to add, before we get into today's material, I wanted to circle back to the calendar and mostly talk about the proposal.

5
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,070
I am aware that that's top of your mind lately.

6
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:58,570
Thanks to everyone who has reached out with questions over email, I'm trying to respond as soon as I can.

7
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:05,090
I think I'm up today, except for one from last night that I can even address in class today.

8
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:12,410
But just to clarify, the proposals are due basically before class starts on Thursday.

9
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,960
Uh, how to submit them? Just to clarify, there's an assignment.

10
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:24,110
There is an assignment called proposal and it's simply an upload of your file.

11
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,430
Whatever file is most convenient to you if you're working on it in word if it's

12
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:34,610
a PDF doesn't matter to me any any questions about that as a as a logistic.

13
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:47,899
Okay. Um, going back to the I was actually going to pull up the proposal assignment and just walk through it again,

14
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:57,530
but try to draw out some specific kind of comments in response to a lot of the questions that I've been getting from folks.

15
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,649
And they're really great questions and it's not due until Thursday.

16
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:06,229
So if you continue to have questions or are seeking clarification, don't hesitate to reach out to me.

17
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,540
I'll try to respond just as quickly as I can.

18
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:20,929
I wanted to encourage folks to, uh, the we're not always there to say but not overthink because I'm not asking you to,

19
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,080
like, recreate the world with this.

20
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,219
It's not a research proposal. You're not being asked to go out.

21
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:34,310
And what was something that no one else has ever thought of before in terms of what you're being asked to do,

22
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,780
is kind of utilize what you've learned in this class as the basis for how to propose an exposure

23
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,240
assessment strategy for perhaps someone who who's kind of been out of the literature for a while,

24
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:54,170
doesn't understand maybe the how to implement the latest and greatest approaches to exposure assessment.

25
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,440
So this is an important one. I wanted to start up here.

26
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,650
Yeah. So this this first sentence.

27
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:15,920
So in your proposal, you'll need to briefly introduce and describe the historical problem of P force as a contaminant in community settings.

28
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:25,730
So when we go down to like the grading rubric where it says introduction to contamination, that's that's what you're being asked to address there.

29
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,160
So I'm not going to talk about p loss right now to basically tell you what to write.

30
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,020
I'll choose a different pollutant. So lead, for example.

31
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:45,140
Right. And you know, the understanding here in assigning this is that we have talked about and learned about in this class quite a bit about,

32
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,509
uh, chemical exposures, right? Which, which p force is one.

33
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:55,970
And so as led as that, with the example that I'll give right now about how to classify chemicals,

34
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,700
what about chemicals is relevant to know are they volatile at room temperature?

35
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:12,860
Are they do they bio accumulate right. And this helps to inform what are the exposure pathways and the rules of exposure

36
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:18,290
that we would be concerned about in proposing an exposure assessment methodology?

37
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:24,320
Right. So in the case of the lead, lead is a solid at room temperature.

38
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,850
Most ambient temperatures in it's not volatile.

39
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:37,399
So for me to propose doing gaseous air sampling as one of my exposure assessment methodologies wouldn't really make very much sense.

40
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,460
Right. But that might be something that I give as part of the background for my rationale for what I am proposing.

41
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:50,240
It wouldn't make much sense to do that. These are some approaches for assessment, but in the case of light, this wouldn't be a good one.

42
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,640
Wouldn't that be good if that is say theory?

43
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,080
So. So the distinction there is that it's not volatile and it's not a gas.

44
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:09,950
It could be in a particulate. Right. But again, this would be something that would be relevant to kind of discuss about the

45
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:15,770
contaminant and what might inform how we would propose assessing exposures.

46
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,440
So that's what we talked about, kind of chemical classification and things that are relevant.

47
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:30,080
We've also talked quite a bit about those pathways, right, about those routes, whether it's being in something that's inhaled and ingested.

48
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,780
And we've talked about ways to actually assess exposure, not specifically around us.

49
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,820
I think it's come up, you know, a few people are part of that is one of the exposure science and the use topics.

50
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,360
We definitely haven't talked about how to assess exposure to people typically,

51
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:52,700
but we talked about a lot of exposure assessment for Professor Megha was here and talked a lot about biomarkers.

52
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,300
That's an opportunity and we we've talked about the hierarchy of exposure assessment approaches, right.

53
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,460
Starting with those at the top with like the personal exposure assessment, you know,

54
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:12,260
actually measuring what someone with an individual's exposure to all the way down to things that are less preferred,

55
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:18,200
but also recognizing that there's often barriers in logistics.

56
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,380
Right. So some of these approaches have advantages and disadvantages.

57
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:29,750
So that's also worth discussing as you're kind of working through the description of your exposure assessment methodology.

58
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,900
You could say we're going to do, you know, phone scans and blood draws.

59
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:42,860
The whole state for to assess their exposure to lead scientifically and as an

60
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,430
exposure assessment approach that would probably give us some pretty good data,

61
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,420
but there are some real challenges to us actually being able to pull that off.

62
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:56,180
Right. It's highly invasive. So getting people to agree to do it is going to be a huge challenge.

63
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,150
And from a resource perspective, it would be a huge cost. Right.

64
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:09,790
So we were proposing approaches for these would be things that you'd want to kind of like flesh out and propose and make your your client,

65
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:18,850
I guess, in this case, the state of Michigan, you know, aware of. That said so yeah.

66
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:27,130
So that's kind of the point of the introduction is so for lead, I might say it's actually been around for thousands of years.

67
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:36,640
Right. You know, the ancient Romans were the ones who were credited with, uh, led plumbing to distribute, uh, you know, drinking water.

68
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,070
And so that was how people were first kind of introduced, how that pathway was created.

69
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:49,030
And as a round of exposure in more modern times, we used to Adelaide gasoline.

70
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,580
It was widely distributed throughout the environment.

71
00:07:52,480 --> 00:08:03,309
It was also used in paint so that in and older housing, uh, paint chips, uh from peeling paint that, you know,

72
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,410
children then are exposed to as they kind of crawl around on the ground with, you know, hand to mouth.

73
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:14,589
This is kind of the historical problem more recently. It's just, uh, aging infrastructure, right?

74
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:24,549
Our, our drinking water, municipal drinking water distribution systems that have lead in the plumbing and that has leached out.

75
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,400
Right. And we have communities that have been exposed.

76
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:37,450
So that might be kind of like a an example of, you know, what's the historical, uh, problem of lead as a, as a contaminant in community settings.

77
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,790
So you would take know a similar approach to that for this, for this assignment with us.

78
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,419
Uh, the gist of the proposal,

79
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:55,540
and again I hope it's illustrated by the point allocation is really in component to here proposing what you're fleshing out,

80
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,630
what you're actually going to propose as an exposure assessment methodology.

81
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,920
So talk about those sampling strategies that you might consider.

82
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,920
Talk about what's advantageous, what's, what's dis advantage.

83
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:21,040
Um, and then based on that, what you're actually going to suggest the state can do in this instance or in this case this future scenario and why.

84
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,790
Right. And you've already kind of justified that. Here are options.

85
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,110
Here are the pros and cons of each because of the, you know,

86
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:35,229
the chemical characteristics of what its exposure pathways are, where the likely roots of exposure is.

87
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:40,090
This is where we would want to focus our measurements in a future scenario.

88
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:47,030
The one around uncertainties. So let me come back to this one.

89
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:55,910
So for that four component to you should be able to rely on for all of those different approaches is really what we discussed in class.

90
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:03,710
The class material that higher hierarchy of exposure assessment approaches the pros and cons.

91
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,120
I'm not looking for you to kind of like research that from scratch in the literature.

92
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:16,310
That should be the basis. What you will need to tap into the literature for is for us specifically, right?

93
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:22,370
Because we haven't talked in class about how to, you know, how to design a detailed exposure assessment for people.

94
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:27,290
So based on that knowledge of your different options for assessing exposures,

95
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,249
going to the literature to learn a little bit more about people and what makes the

96
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:37,910
most sense to propose to the state in this case with regards to uncertainties.

97
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,980
Again, it's uncertainties and how we discuss them in class.

98
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:49,550
There's been a couple of lectures where we've talked about uncertainties, and what I'm hoping that you're able to clarify is,

99
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:55,399
okay, you've gone through all of these different exposure assessment possibilities.

100
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:02,930
Is these measurement data collection opportunities, the pros and the cons you've decided on this one makes the most sense.

101
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:09,200
Okay. We're going forward with that one. What are the uncertainties involved in that approach?

102
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,390
Right. Where do we still have knowledge gaps?

103
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:23,060
Where should we not be blind to, you know, having perhaps missing information or variability that can be inherent in our resulting data?

104
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,940
I'm not asking you to quantify like some value, right?

105
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,620
Like ten plus or minus three. It's a more qualitative assessment.

106
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:39,920
Is there a large amount of uncertainty associated with what you're proposing, or is it relatively small?

107
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,280
And a lot of it is going to be relative. Right.

108
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:50,570
Compared to other exposure assessment approaches, this exposure assessment approach might have a large degree of uncertainty.

109
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,750
The one that I'm proposing might have a smaller degree of uncertainty.

110
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:58,160
And that's, again, another kind of justification for why we want to use that one.

111
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,900
Yes, I see. This is going back to the methodology side of things.

112
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:11,330
If we find examples in the literature of things like diaries or survey questions.

113
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:20,870
I guess my real question is, do you want us to include what those questions would be or would that be more like an appendix sort of situation?

114
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,280
Or do you even care to see if it's an entire diary?

115
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:30,980
Knowing that some of them can be pretty elaborate and detailed. I would definitely use it as an appendix.

116
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:38,390
Or even just site it and maybe draw out the kind of essential components that you're hoping to get from it.

117
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,750
Looking at information on X, Y, and Z in a couple of sentences within your paragraph.

118
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,810
I imagine you don't want to read through like I would be.

119
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,910
I'm going to check it out because like like we talked about from the first day of class.

120
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,860
I am learning from you all as part of this class, right? Hopefully you're learning something from me.

121
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,420
What you bring to this class and this assignment, as I'm reading all of these proposals,

122
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:11,950
I am absolutely going to be learning about the latest and greatest for how we would assess exposure to people.

123
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,330
Because you guys are going to unearth some cool things, like a diary that was just published,

124
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,630
you know, in the last couple of months that I know nothing about at the moment.

125
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,350
So I thought I touched on uncertainties, so relevant standards.

126
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:34,450
So this is just acknowledging that you understand, a, whether there are standards in place or not.

127
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:43,210
And location wise, since we're talking about a community in Michigan, it might be a federal standard, it might be a state level standard.

128
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,440
Or, you know, maybe there's something else going on in Arbor is pretty progressive.

129
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,480
Maybe, you know, the city of Ann Arbor is coming up with its own, you know,

130
00:13:51,580 --> 00:14:01,360
sort of standards or expectations or the levels of contaminants that are of challenge.

131
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:09,910
So being able to address that, right. So for example, you're proposing this method, we're going to collect a bunch of data.

132
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:17,040
And what's going to inform how you interpret the data is by comparing it to whatever standards might be there.

133
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:26,460
And so if levels are lower than this, that would be an indication that, you know, perhaps there's not reason to be concerned.

134
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,210
Likewise, at levels are above this or that and it could be in many different media.

135
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:39,060
Right. Maybe you're collecting drinking water at at someone's home.

136
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,040
Maybe you're doing taking blood samples. Right.

137
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:52,740
So it's not a it's not a single standard. There might be standards in place or different types of measurements or samples that you would collect.

138
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,040
There also may be a lack of standards. Right.

139
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,810
So this would also be something that you could address to say this is something that the state should know.

140
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,750
Right. EPA has done this, that or the other or they haven't.

141
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,580
Or CDC has this guideline or they don't. So, you know, the state can expect to have this challenge.

142
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:18,810
We're going to have data. We're going to be able to comparatively look at what these levels are, how we're going to interpret that,

143
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:28,290
whether in having standards or regulations, is kind of a starting point for how we would advise the state to be prepared for.

144
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:43,669
So so based on, you know, that kind of refresh and hopefully I've touched on maybe some areas that I that I didn't elaborate on previously from this,

145
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,340
you know, kind of proposal assignment documents.

146
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,910
Are there any other questions that folks have on their mind at the moment?

147
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,400
So for your community, I was kind of looking at it two different ways.

148
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:10,850
One would be like a geographical location, but can one be like what can the community be like a certain type of person?

149
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:17,240
Like, for example, like farmers. Like, if I'm interested in addressing that, would that be considered a community?

150
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:29,750
Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm encouraging you to completely take liberty with whatever helps you to present the context and to address it.

151
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,750
So, yeah, you can it can be a real community, right?

152
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:40,640
That exists like like Ann Arbor or Traverse City or Grand Rapids, you know, whatever.

153
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:50,270
And at which point you can actually pull real demographic information right about that location and kind of consider it as part of your proposal.

154
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,350
You may also make up a community. Right.

155
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,929
Amy, though, that is, you know, located on the west side of the state or in the upper peninsula of Michigan,

156
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:06,200
whatever it is, it's composed of, you know, 90% of the people that work in the farming industry.

157
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,710
And this is their, you know, income level, their whatever.

158
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:16,010
You can totally take liberty with that if it helps you to kind of think through this this exercise.

159
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:28,390
Any others that are coming to mind. Yes.

160
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:35,950
It's very still like that expectation to use Michigan standards where it would be like make up our own if it's a match.

161
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:42,970
Yeah, good question. So so the answer is down here, right?

162
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,050
So description and application of relevant standards, you can't make up your own standards.

163
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,990
So that would be a rule for for this.

164
00:17:52,430 --> 00:18:00,200
You could, uh, perhaps, uh, Michigan, uh, does or doesn't have a standard.

165
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:06,110
You could absolutely draw on other states that might have standards in place that are different than what

166
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:13,430
Michigan has in place and suggest that that could inform how the data could or should be interpreted.

167
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:20,000
Uh, based on whether you think, you know, Michigan's existing level of standards are adequate or not.

168
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:25,430
I would actually be an opportunity to kind of pull from other areas or other locations.

169
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:36,530
But you should at at minimum at least investigate and address, you know, what what standards are relevant geographically here in Michigan.

170
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:51,580
I guess you can have a after you go through all of what does exist and what is real and what of the standards or levels are.

171
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:57,790
You could weigh in, you know, based on your expertise now as an exposure scientist and have an opinion that,

172
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:02,799
you know, those standards are too high to low and adequate, whatever that would be.

173
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,360
Okay. It's not a requirement, but that it would be okay if you did that.

174
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:16,239
I'm probably overthinking this. You said state. And so I'm like, Oh, can we not use international standards?

175
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,270
But no, yeah, sure I would. That is, we're approaching this from a from a science perspective.

176
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:22,740
Right.

177
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:31,080
But understanding that, uh, it's a state government entity that we're trying to inform and recognizing the boundaries that they're working with.

178
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:38,140
And I also imagine, as I've mentioned before, that politically mentioning international ones sometimes is.

179
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,090
Fraught with it. Well, just like a lot of Americans hate the U.N., so.

180
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,650
Yeah, you don't you don't need to consider. Ask me. Maybe you do.

181
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:54,180
I mean, we're talking about, like, what's a burden on a participant, right?

182
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:00,150
Or what's easy for, uh, a staff person to implement or not.

183
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:07,810
Um, I guess political barriers could exist as well, right?

184
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,580
For for implementation. But, uh, for this, you don't need to.

185
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:15,060
You don't need to go there. You can really have the science. Be the driver.

186
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:31,590
Any other thoughts or questions? All right.

187
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:40,150
Well, like I said, don't hesitate between now and Thursday to reach out to me if additional questions come up or you're seeking clarification.

188
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:47,530
And I can sense we won't have a chance to be together before again before Thursday morning.

189
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:54,730
I can post those announcements. Any other things that came to light that would be worth additional clarifying to the post, to the whole class?

190
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,100
You're going to do great. Don't stress too much. Like I kind of started with, you know, don't don't overthink it.

191
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:09,450
You only have 8 to 10 pages to work with. And. Right. So that's kind of an indication of the level of detail that I'm looking for here.

192
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:17,130
And again, focus on the point allocation. If it's 8 to 10 pages, don't don't write a six page introduction.

193
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:25,650
Right. Just in terms of how much effort you would be focusing on it, too, is where you should be spending most of your time.

194
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:32,710
All right. Let us shift gears into today's topic.

195
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:46,710
So last class we talked about occupational exposures and opportunities for controlling that.

196
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:54,470
Right. Can we look at this hierarchy of control and what the what the preferences are, where some of the challenges are?

197
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:03,140
Today, we're going to shift gears on a similar topic, but shift from that workplace setting into more of a community kind of environmental setting.

198
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,170
Talking about exposures.

199
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:12,080
But again, looking forward, you know, what are those opportunities for mitigation and for controlling those exposures on a community scale?

200
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:19,220
What are the some of the regulations in place? But as you might imagine, and we've already talked a little bit in this class about,

201
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:22,670
you know, what are some of the inherent challenges in this as well.

202
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:32,600
I probably said or hopefully already said most of this you understand the opportunities for regulation and control in community settings.

203
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,390
We will talk about some examples and considerations for implementing them.

204
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,759
And then, yeah, I appreciate, you know,

205
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,940
what are some of the emerging issues within community settings that perhaps we're not doing so well and addressing?

206
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,890
And what are the ones that are especially challenging or complex?

207
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,630
Okay. We already looked at this slide last time.

208
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,730
Again, within that workplace settings.

209
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,510
We're going to use this same hierarchy of controls as we talk through controlling exposures in community settings.

210
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:14,870
They'll be applied a little bit differently just because it's such a different environment and in some cases from a workplace to a community.

211
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,040
But we're really going to look at the most effective being if we can eliminate it.

212
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,180
Right. That's the best. Another approach is substituting it.

213
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:28,130
And then we're going to go down the list of your engineering controls, warnings, trainings, procedures.

214
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:33,110
And the least, least effective and least preferred is personal protective equipment.

215
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:45,080
And I already just said that. Yeah, we're kind of translating this hierarchy from occupational to community settings.

216
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:54,600
And a lot of cases, you know, we talk about elimination and substitution, you know, from a in a workplace,

217
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:03,299
we talked about how we might substitute a process or a task or a specific chemical that's used right where worker exposure is a concern.

218
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:08,370
If we can replace it with something else, that would be great in a community setting.

219
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:17,490
Uh, it's, it's more kind of policies that are allowing for something to be eliminated or substituted versus right.

220
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:23,160
Like a manufacturing setting. It's an individual organization is making a decision to change something out.

221
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,340
All right. Similar to what we did last week as we talked about this for each one of these,

222
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:36,580
we'll have just a couple of minutes for turning to the person next to you and to that come up with some examples.

223
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:46,540
So within this community environmental setting, what would be some examples of control options with regards to elimination?

224
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,700
So go ahead and take maybe two or 3 minutes, turn to the person next to you and then we'll reconvene.

225
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:05,880
You can party in case something happens.

226
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:20,030
Let me just lastly, we kept in place already taking your time elimination.

227
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:25,170
Well, as again, completing the remediation.

228
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:36,640
I would just say that that's the only way to think about leveraging the start up that's already there.

229
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:45,990
So. This is telling.

230
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:50,950
This is my favorite.

231
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,700
Don't think she was a big fan. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

232
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:04,110
So it's like, yeah. And it's she's not even by name yet.

233
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,569
I think this makes me think how he could still say I know.

234
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:15,230
Ah, yeah.

235
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:27,030
Come on. You know what I mean?

236
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:44,060
Okay. So she looks I change my way into that situation, which I think like it could be.

237
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:50,150
I needed relevancy, maybe. Did you? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

238
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:57,970
I doing sorts of things. You could do anything.

239
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:19,780
I think it's worth it, because I don't think there's a guy like they shut down as fast as they can.

240
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:31,780
So it's not just power at the short time, which is always, I don't know.

241
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:33,700
Yeah.

242
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:57,100
I think to have her groundwater, the groundwater, the water supply in this country is actually something I think you're always learn about first.

243
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:15,940
Or just like I was like bus driver when I was like, y'all did this ceremony.

244
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:26,889
Something like this happens to your PFOA and there's been a lot of regulations later, but.

245
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:32,110
Right, yeah. So I think that's what they're saying here is that like I was copying,

246
00:28:33,580 --> 00:29:02,130
so it just kind of came out of necessity after some sort of testing of these guys for what it is.

247
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,670
Are you saying there's some sort of police?

248
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:18,970
Like there's biological hazards and sanitation is just sort of like water filtration, just like, you know what?

249
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:25,420
You know, that's okay. All right. So what did folks come up with more examples of elimination?

250
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:31,440
Was it a community setting? You just.

251
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:42,130
Just some of these is really just getting your mind wrapped around it, right?

252
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,680
You're really just immersed in the whole workplace thing.

253
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:51,010
Finally got yourself rolling and now you're out of that context and it's like considering things from a very different perspective.

254
00:29:52,450 --> 00:30:00,340
What might be some examples of elimination within a community set of policies for like no smoking indoors or having a designated smoking areas?

255
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,000
Excellent example, right? You don't have to go back long.

256
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,670
Maybe ten years or so.

257
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:15,009
There were still, you know, restaurants and whatever where you go in and they were, you know, totally smoke filled or they had special seating, right?

258
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:22,930
Like in the non smoking section or the smoking section. I don't remember what the exact timeframe was, but the state of Michigan, uh, banned things.

259
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:28,600
I think the campus here actually was a little bit ahead of that, uh, in terms of University of Michigan.

260
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:35,950
Yeah, great, great example. It's a policy at a community level that is having a huge impact on controlling,

261
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:43,510
uh, people's exposure to secondhand smoke and creating new infrastructure.

262
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:53,050
So you have the old facilities like flooding leaching into the water, just preventing people from being exposed to that through new infrastructure.

263
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:59,630
Yeah, sure. So we have the issue of aging infrastructure and uh,

264
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:06,069
as we learned in multiple locations now unfortunately, but most prominently, the community of Flint,

265
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:18,430
just a little bit north of us here in Ann Arbor where um, slightly improper maintenance of it, totally through the whole system out of whack.

266
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:23,290
And we have large amounts of lead leaching out of that aging infrastructure.

267
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:31,480
So yes, we're taking a you're basically eliminating or maybe substitution actually, because you still need the infrastructure to distribute the water.

268
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,510
So you're replacing the leaded pipes, right,

269
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:41,860
with with the new plumbing that would it would definitely have a large impact on controlling future expenditures.

270
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:48,120
I see a hand over here. Any others, the folks who came up with.

271
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:56,229
Something we talked about but weren't like 100% on. Would eminent domain technically be an example?

272
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,890
Because even at the like, the hazard is still there. The people are gone.

273
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,190
Yeah. So did you two did you discuss that example to get to that point?

274
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:21,290
Well, like the Gordie Howe bridge site, they're like asking residents to do a housing swap, like because building a bridge causes a slew of issues.

275
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:25,070
So removing people from that site of potential exposure.

276
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:33,650
Yeah. Uh, trying to figure out how to formally fit it in.

277
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:41,950
I'm here. Uh. You're not substituting hazard.

278
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:48,430
You're substituting the household, perhaps. But I don't think that's the same.

279
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:55,370
Spirit of substitution. It's a good question.

280
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,740
Yeah. Do a thoughtful have thoughts on this?

281
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:08,240
Well, I was thinking of elimination in terms of like similar things to that with eminent domain and like Superfund sites and like remediation,

282
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,680
heavy metals and. Yeah, I mean, in that particular case, I don't.

283
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,240
They're great examples for sure, of opportunities for controlling exposures.

284
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,650
Right. So that what I'm struggling with is where in that hierarchy are we?

285
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,889
Are we getting at is that it's not really a warning, though,

286
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:31,620
because you're not telling people like this is a potential site, you're actually asking people to like vacate the premises.

287
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,540
I mean, is it that engineer? Is it in an engineering control?

288
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:42,240
Yeah. What I what I'm wondering, you know, that you're basically, um, there are lots of opportunities,

289
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,390
but creating a barrier to separate people from the source of potential exposure.

290
00:33:53,380 --> 00:34:01,010
It's interesting to think on my own a little bit. Any others that folks came up with for elimination or substitution?

291
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,380
All right. And of course, yes, we have substitution here.

292
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:13,220
Let's let's take one more quick minute.

293
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:20,719
All right. So we were focused specifically on elimination. If this broadens your perspective a little bit or allows more for you to take another

294
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,410
minute for discussion and see if you can talk with those that are truly substitution.

295
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:33,860
This weekend, I spent too much time looking at substitutes for people keen to hear you play that rap.

296
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:38,070
I really did. And basically, they don't have good.

297
00:34:38,400 --> 00:35:00,030
They don't want me to name. Should I write about the big things like, you know, corn starch or just total different?

298
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,060
Okay. Jesus. I'm like, oh, no, no, no, no.

299
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,230
I'm sorry. I just wasn't giving an example.

300
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:26,219
I was really kind of like, Oh, you're supposed to put the flour on, because I think that's really what I think you should do.

301
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:33,870
Separation every time you drop in on it.

302
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:37,860
I think that they really do.

303
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:45,719
They have you know, it's just like on the immigration system, you can say, oh, I read all about it.

304
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:56,700
It said online about me. And I'm so at this point, I'm sure you asked me if you like to compromise,

305
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:07,590
but do you guys think that like encourage but it is a problem like that it seems.

306
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:11,210
I encourage people to individuals.

307
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:26,560
So, you know, so many people ask me, so, you know, yes, I can.

308
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:34,150
Okay. MORGAN So you were talking about concerns at first.

309
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:43,480
Yeah, it was a bit like that was my one. But yeah, that's my take on that.

310
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:55,560
No, you heard me right. The focus was on the questions and I didn't even give a Segway.

311
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:06,470
But it's cool that you don't have or without feeling sorry for substitution.

312
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:12,080
So that seems like a different way.

313
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:18,240
Yeah. You're like, you're quite right.

314
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:26,910
I'm used to super straight to the point, so it's one of those things.

315
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:35,250
All right, folks, come up with other examples that are more specifically substitution and not being tasked with eliminating.

316
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:41,320
Yeah. I got cornstarch instead of talc and baby powder.

317
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:47,379
Okay. Yeah. So an excellent example of this is for, like, an individual product, right?

318
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:51,250
With it's widely distributed and consumed by consumers.

319
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,780
So the example of substitution. What else?

320
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,580
Yeah. Just like switching everyone over to a different water source.

321
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:09,970
That was yeah, that actually is one of the, um, uh, it's a great example of like an acute response when, uh,

322
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:18,980
when exposure is discovered right from, uh, from a source is like in, for example, a massive distribution of bottled water.

323
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:22,700
Right. For or for bathing, for drinking, cooking and so forth.

324
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,060
So that would be absolutely an example of substitution.

325
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:32,880
Any others the folks came up with.

326
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:45,580
Recently, the city of Ann Arbor, like within the last few years, switched their firefighting chemicals from ones that contain positive ones at home.

327
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:54,420
For sure, it's a great, great example. Again, this, you know, this real it's for the the drinking water source.

328
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,390
You know, this could be something implemented on a small scale and even an individual behavior, right.

329
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:08,980
Someone could choose to drink bottled water with bottled water and not use their, you know, their tap if they're concerned about exposure.

330
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,769
Others, you know, that individual choices is a bit more concerning.

331
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:19,380
Right. There's very few people of us have enough of an opportunity to, like impact.

332
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:26,020
What firefighting protocols are employed in our communities.

333
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:33,639
So that's a great a great example where a policy came into play that resulted in

334
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:41,590
substituting one particular chemical with a different approach for extinguishing fires,

335
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:46,070
creating examples. Okay, let's see, what do I have here?

336
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:53,590
Yeah, I have some really large scale examples and you all have come up with some that are already fit into this a little bit.

337
00:39:53,980 --> 00:40:00,980
But yeah, we do have some overarching federal policies that have been in place for a long time.

338
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:04,090
Right. One of them we talked about this much earlier in the semester,

339
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:12,850
the Safe Water Drinking Act that actually sets standards or the amounts for levels of contamination of

340
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:21,640
different chemical and biological components that are allowed to be in that that that tap drinking water.

341
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:35,020
Another one on the theme of water, uh, but also it is looking more at our surface waters, our lakes and rivers and so forth,

342
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:43,690
which is the Clean Water Act, which ends up being, in many cases, the source of that drinking water in the first place.

343
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:47,850
And then I have one more idea.

344
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,120
I wanted to talk about this one.

345
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:57,490
And so the goal is to kind of weave back and forth through each of these topics about, you know, where is opportunities for control?

346
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,749
Where are we maybe doing a good job of managing things?

347
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:07,299
But what are some of the challenges? And urban runoff is a challenge, right?

348
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:15,740
So we've talked about the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Clean Water Act, uh, urban runoff is,

349
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:25,390
is a big source of potential contamination to those surface waters and then also potentially to our drinking water sources.

350
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:33,910
Uh, and it has to do a little bit with the amount of runoff that's generated in the first place.

351
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,370
So we had we have a lot of impervious surface in urban areas, right?

352
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:48,580
Shingles, rooftops, metal roofs, concrete, right streets, sidewalks, all of these things.

353
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,080
None of it actually soaks up precipitation.

354
00:41:53,500 --> 00:42:03,880
Right. Like the comparison here is, you know, this urban area with a much more natural scape with grasses and trees and so forth.

355
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:13,300
And how much of that precipitation is absorbed and taken out by the natural ground cover versus in an urban area?

356
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:20,469
And how much of it is actually runoff? So the comparison in this scenario is where, you know, in that nature scape,

357
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:26,410
it's about 10% of it is runoff, whereas in the urban area, it's about 55% of it.

358
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:36,160
Okay. That. Yeah, you mean. So what the difference between this and engineering controls.

359
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:46,350
Yeah. So I'm, uh, introducing a, an example of a policy that's in place, right?

360
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,710
They would start at the top.

361
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:58,180
Isn't that kind of like elimination substitution with the Safe Water Drinking Act and the Clean Water Act and starting to highlight,

362
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:04,660
uh, examples of where that's on its way to falling short or already is falling short.

363
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,780
And talking about that, about urban runoff as one of those challenges.

364
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:20,890
So yeah, there might. And again, like we talked about in the last class, oftentimes when we're trying to address an exposure issue,

365
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,120
we're not just taking one of the control options.

366
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,820
Oftentimes, it's a combination over a lot of of a couple of them.

367
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,040
And that would certainly be the case here.

368
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:42,370
So, yeah, there would be certainly other opportunities for control that would be characterized, you know, further down that hierarchy.

369
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:49,830
But what I wanted to point out is that, you know, in the urban area, it's not just the case of,

370
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:55,770
you know, how much water is running off from precipitation into surface waters.

371
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,579
It's what contaminants are then part of that urban runoff.

372
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:09,600
Right. So that urban landscape where we're producing and emitting a lot of pollutants within that urban area, you know, oil, grease,

373
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:21,959
chemicals from, you know, motor vehicles, pesticides and things and lawns and gardens and pet waste, failing septic systems.

374
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:27,360
Road salt is a huge one. Right. The further north you go. Uh, it's not snowing yet.

375
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,450
I'm really happy. It's actually like another great week.

376
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:35,810
Eventually it's going to start. And, you know, one of the interventions for.

377
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:43,050
For safety, for driving and operating automobiles is to salt the roads to help snow and ice melt.

378
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:52,820
That's a good thing. It's not a great thing for the environment. So road salts are a huge contaminant into urban runoff.

379
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:58,380
I talked about shingles, heavy metals and even thermal pollution.

380
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:03,660
So it's not just that the precipitation is falling and running off.

381
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:08,730
We'll talk, I think, in a moment, in a different context about urban heat islands.

382
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:14,190
All of these impervious surfaces actually take up a lot of heat from the sun.

383
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:21,390
And so we're actually warming that precipitation and then running it off into surface waters

384
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:28,410
so that the rivers and lakes actually become artificially warmer as a result of urban runoff.

385
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:37,500
Yeah. Okay. To go back to urban runoff. I know there's like a few examples in Ann Arbor of like places where they've tried to decrease

386
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:44,370
runoff like the garden and they built that community parking lot with to try to prevent wastewater.

387
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:51,299
And then there was also like when they tore down the old way and built a parking lot next to the bus station.

388
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:56,160
That is technically a not impervious. What's the opposite permeable surface?

389
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:03,160
I don't know why that's only about one parking lot, but they decided to make it just start, right?

390
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,980
Yeah, they did that like 20 years ago, so, like balloons.

391
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:17,670
And then just to contrast that, it's not simply that, you know, urban areas are only issues that we need to be concerned about.

392
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:27,690
Agricultural runoff has become a huge, huge source of contamination to our surface waters and that even our drinking water systems,

393
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:40,030
you know, large scale commercial farming, application of lots of fertilizers, lots of pesticides, excessive irrigation.

394
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:45,000
Right. Is actually contributing to how much actually gets runoff.

395
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:50,850
So what are the consequences of this? One of the big ones is is harmful algal blooms.

396
00:46:51,150 --> 00:47:00,600
So all of the nutrients that are a part of fertilizers to help those crops grow and be a

397
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:08,219
bountiful harvest also contribute to other things growing like algae in in water bodies.

398
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:18,480
And so when enough of that nutrient and runoff as a contaminant into surface waters, it can result in and really harmful algal blooms.

399
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:24,000
This is an issue, you know, across the globe. I'm going to give an example of one that fits very near by here.

400
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:30,989
This is going back to not too long ago, 2014, the city of Toledo.

401
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:35,490
So actually, if I can orient us, uh, that's the Ann Arbor.

402
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:41,100
Yeah. So here's us. And then just a little bit to the south, I'm going to say,

403
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:48,900
like 50 miles or so is the city of Toledo, Ohio, that is pretty near the shoreline of Lake Erie.

404
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:56,310
And the drinking water source is just a couple of miles offshore into Lake Erie.

405
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:05,400
And there was a big algal bloom, uh, that exceeded water quality drinking water criteria.

406
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:12,030
And so for a couple of week period, there were a couple hundred thousand people, residents of Toledo,

407
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:16,800
that are part of that municipal drinking water system that didn't have access to potable water.

408
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:21,660
And so, yeah, the acute response was, you know, massive distribution of bottled water.

409
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:26,669
In the meantime, you know, boiling water and so forth, a lot of things.

410
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:36,810
It was a huge deal. And the the unfortunate news about the less good news is that the problem is getting worse.

411
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:41,090
It's not something that has historically happened. This.

412
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:48,020
Let me go back to this slide. Better. This is illustrating the base in the Lake Erie Drainage Basin.

413
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:54,080
There is a ton of very productive farming throughout this whole region.

414
00:48:54,860 --> 00:49:07,100
So application of all of those, not just the pesticides but the fertilizers that is running off into Lake Erie and it's creating these blooms.

415
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:17,960
And because of the the hydrodynamics of the lake itself, that the worst blooms tend to be this extreme western part of the lake,

416
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:24,500
which is, again, here's the city of Toledo and just offshore where the source of the drinking water intake is.

417
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:34,730
And so that the risk of algal blooms. And through modeling by know what is increasing over time.

418
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:43,520
So 2014 was very much an alarm to try to have to raise awareness around the

419
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,210
issue to address it directly because the problem would just get worse otherwise.

420
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:58,940
All right. Keeping us on track here, going further down that hierarchy of controls, staying within this community, environmental settings.

421
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:05,750
Take a couple of minutes and think of examples that you can come up with for how we might implement engineering controls.

422
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:17,160
It's impossible.

423
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,300
It looks like there was a comeback either.

424
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,450
Yes, it was.

425
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:42,550
Because there's like injury breaks. I don't know if it's I think it's also agriculture.

426
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:51,970
Currently, there is like a medical emergency.

427
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:58,440
That's true. Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

428
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:09,060
I mean, that's our company operating as you have or something like that.

429
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:22,030
Just to be more creative, particularly because we have stuff like, yeah, because it's okay.

430
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:29,080
But then we have to say we're not really getting screwed like we really don't.

431
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,240
It makes sense that much more because that was like, no, not.

432
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:49,380
But you're right. Now, I feel confident that high schools are going to be able to carry out this place.

433
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:57,700
All right, Engineering, try to convince me that it is parents are doing everything right.

434
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:12,760
So we'll be like, what's it like to be together?

435
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:37,180
Is it going to be like this moment that he was like, okay, I think maybe we should do this.

436
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:44,710
We finally. Have you got your thoughts?

437
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:54,540
Yes. Let's try to actually do something about this.

438
00:52:55,510 --> 00:53:10,580
I think it's goes on this morning. I think it was because it's like, you know, protect us, like the roads, like the highway, you know?

439
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:15,190
Yeah. Yeah.

440
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:32,080
I like to do like even just like the fact that, like, highways or something is like I think it's like today it was like a like that.

441
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:38,080
You had to go back like area Michigan, London, England.

442
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:55,300
Students don't want to be older. Like 30 years ago I was like, I had to go to school.

443
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:09,430
He always got a little article about Statistics Department wedding planner who started an entertainment agency.

444
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:23,920
Yeah, I mean, like a student athlete, you know, apparently other states do.

445
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:29,260
But now that they did, I don't have any time.

446
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:34,860
I say take a Michigan's after looks a little understatement.

447
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:40,000
Sometimes things are really dangerous, but people are afraid of losing.

448
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:45,730
Yeah, exactly.

449
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:49,719
The. Yeah, yeah.

450
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,790
The woman has a stoplight right outside.

451
00:54:53,200 --> 00:55:00,969
The one on the other side of. Oh, yeah, that one. People like that.

452
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:08,320
They should just puts out announcements like that. But people are really associated with where.

453
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:16,049
On a about the other night, there was so much talk, I was like with my dad, I think it's like having a prostitute.

454
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:22,230
It's like, all right, let's go ahead and re going to be all around engineering control to support things.

455
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:28,310
And I actually wanted to take a step back, actually provide a little bit of context, right?

456
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:33,600
So we started last week talking about opportunities for control within a workplace setting.

457
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:39,840
If you you know, if you Google exposure control or something like that or hierarchy of control,

458
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:44,040
it is absolutely formalized within that workplace setting.

459
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:51,210
It's been something that's recognized for for decades. And this kind of classifications gain from exposure assessment perspective.

460
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:58,140
In this class, we're learning about exposure science as it applies to all of these things, right?

461
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:03,570
Not just in workplace settings, but also in broader communities.

462
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:12,569
And so as a way to to discuss this material, I've chosen to basically take that hierarchy of controls,

463
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:23,309
which is very much a fixture of the occupational environment community and and apply it to this community environmental setting.

464
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:33,030
Because I think it's a it's a pretty feasible way to think through things and how we might classify them and how we might prioritize as we talk about,

465
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:37,230
you know, in community settings, how we can reduce exposures.

466
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:47,969
And it often lands at how individuals can change their behavior, which if you try to fit it into those options,

467
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:51,880
into a hierarchy kind of points that being down at the bottom right,

468
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:58,590
that someone got a personal protective action or something that might be individual level.

469
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:03,450
You can really the most effective and there are other opportunities further up that hierarchy.

470
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:10,680
So there are going to be considerations that we come up with or even examples that don't fit very well into this classification system.

471
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:18,180
And it's because it was it was designed for or it was articulated within within a workplace environment.

472
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:25,950
And we're trying to kind of, you know, discuss opportunities for control within a community environment, but looking at it through the same way.

473
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:31,680
So anyway, hopefully that kind of helps to understand some of the background around it.

474
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:37,290
So that said, what are some examples that folks came up with that might fit into that category

475
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:43,260
of engineering controls within the communities that protected bike lanes,

476
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:47,670
active bike? Yeah, absolutely not a great example.

477
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:53,489
And and sticking locally here in Arbor has whether you bike or not you you've probably

478
00:57:53,490 --> 00:58:00,900
seen that as a way to improve safety for not just people in place but for others as well.

479
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:09,240
Great example. Yes. We said like the sound barriers or just like walls on a highway that are using some barriers.

480
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:16,380
Yeah, for sure. So a large roadway that goes through a residential area.

481
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:22,210
Right. And lots of sound, lots of noise related to that.

482
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:29,040
And, you know, some of them actually go kind of go down like a like subterranean right there.

483
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:34,950
They're below ground level. And that helps itself just having a natural barrier.

484
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:41,879
But even in cases where that's where it's not actually constructing barriers

485
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:46,830
that can help contain sound or for residents that are nearby that roadway,

486
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,499
great example of engineering control.

487
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:57,960
From a sound exposure perspective, you're getting good ventilation in like school buildings or other community buildings,

488
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,940
especially with COVID and like temperature control.

489
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,800
Your AC based on the weather. Sure. Yeah. Great.

490
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:12,450
Great example. And that one that one translates pretty easily, right, from that workplace setting to more of a community setting.

491
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:20,129
So in the case of like an internal building, it's a manufacturer setting and a workplace setting, right?

492
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:24,140
You can buy improving ventilation, you can reduce exposures.

493
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:29,640
All you need to do is then just go to a more public building, right, where community members spend their time.

494
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:34,010
And it's the same type of approach can be can be implemented moving.

495
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:42,640
With, like scrubbers and smokestacks for coal plants.

496
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:48,080
Absolutely. Yeah. And odds are actually helpful, right?

497
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:54,420
You know, it's a great example and I think I actually have an example slide that talks about that at the moment here.

498
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:58,469
But Kate was talking about like scrubbers, right?

499
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:06,570
Things that are put onto smokestacks to help remove pollutants right before they can actually be emitted out of the smokestacks.

500
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:13,020
So this is something that whether it be implemented at an individual sites.

501
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:19,290
Right, perhaps not even that many of them. But by containing that potential emission in the first place,

502
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:27,270
it's reducing what would what would down downwind be a very large scale exposure to many people.

503
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:37,640
Good example, many others. All right.

504
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,640
What do I have here for? Yes, of course I did.

505
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:52,850
I'm using air pollution control as an example, but actually I chose to go ahead and put in all of our many of our hierarchy considerations here.

506
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,380
So if we're trying to control air pollution and.

507
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:04,040
Very generally speaking, this might be and again, kind of ranked in terms of desirability.

508
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:08,180
If we can eliminate the source, that would be ideal, right?

509
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:17,380
Whether it's shutting down the facility, I guess the substitution could be we talked about relocating people near a bridge.

510
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:20,480
It's going to be built. But another option might be to relocate the bridge.

511
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:29,910
Right. I mean, maybe there's another location where that bridge could be placed and would have less of an impact on potential exposures.

512
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:37,910
Uh, so, yeah. So, uh, pollution prevention, alternative technologies, we might substitute the fuel.

513
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:44,600
Right. There's been a shift of of burning coal to an interim of still burning fossil fuels.

514
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:51,980
The burning natural gas. It tends to be a little bit better from an air pollution perspective compared to burning coal,

515
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:58,670
improve process controls the pollution control technology itself.

516
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:07,549
Right. So Cade's example of instituting a scrubber, implementing a scrubber on a smokestack, uh, for cars, right?

517
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:19,100
We have catalytic converters that help to control and, and limit much of the potential emission from actually exiting the tailpipe from an automobile,

518
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:29,480
uh, relocation of the source or, or in other words, creating barriers to isolated from potential receptors or people.

519
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:44,270
You know, one of the, the very longstanding responses, okay, we know that if we burn coal, this is going back to London in the 1950s,

520
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:49,579
coal being used for residential heating, not real tall buildings,

521
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:56,030
maybe a couple of stories and chimneys that are emitting the coal basically at ground level.

522
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:01,970
So it's resulting in a ton of air pollution and exposure in a very near field environment.

523
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:11,550
And so as an engineering control option, uh, there were the implementation of increasing stock heights, right?

524
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:14,420
So you have many of you kind of get the view as you walk out of the building

525
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:17,749
here or even on the other side of the dorms headed towards central campus.

526
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:22,160
The university has a power plant. Right? And there's this large smokestack there.

527
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:30,049
And the goal is pretty simple. The emission doesn't change the amount of potential contaminant coming out.

528
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:35,030
It's still there. It's just that by releasing it at a height, at a higher height,

529
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:41,840
its ability to impact the local environment and the local receptors is reduced considerably.

530
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:46,880
The downside is that that emission still goes somewhere, right? So it's going further downwind.

531
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:53,870
As it travels downwind, it's dispersing its concentration, its magnitude is becoming lower.

532
01:03:54,290 --> 01:04:03,230
So the potential downwind exposure on a concentration basis would actually be lower, which is an improvement, but it's certainly not eliminating it.

533
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:06,079
And then, yes, in practice, you know,

534
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:15,800
it's a combination of of many of these approaches that would be implemented to try to control air pollution and reduce air pollution exposures.

535
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:22,489
Uh, yeah. And then just, you know, a shout out back to we have had, you know,

536
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:33,709
since 1970 this says policy in place legislation through the Clean Air Act that is regulating how not only how much can be emitted,

537
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:43,820
but what the resulting concentrations are allowed to exist in ambient air, which is absolutely, you know, impacting communities or on community scale.

538
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:51,330
And then you might ask yourself, this is actually pretty small white, isn't it, to enlarge that image?

539
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:57,690
But if you're asking yourself, you know, do we really need to have all of this kind of stuff in place?

540
01:04:57,690 --> 01:05:03,660
Like, can't we rely on industries to just make like wise decisions?

541
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:09,750
This is an example for why not only needs to be in place of the standard, but needs to be enforced.

542
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:13,500
Is this is going back not that long ago.

543
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:27,720
She did uh model years um of diesel vehicles produced by Volkswagen from 2009 to 2016.

544
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:39,360
Were discovered to have a defeat device purposely installed on their vehicles as part of production.

545
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:48,870
So in not just in for vehicle testing for to document emissions for like the sale of a vehicle.

546
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:54,750
So there are regulations in place for the production and sale of a vehicle.

547
01:05:55,260 --> 01:06:00,690
The manufacturer has to disclose how much pollution the car emits.

548
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:04,410
Right? Things like what's its fuel efficiency and so forth.

549
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:10,320
So that's one aspect. But another aspect in practice is in many locations.

550
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:14,140
So that informs a buyers decision making, right?

551
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,010
They might choose to buy a car based on these aspects,

552
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:29,340
but then after the that the owner is using the vehicle in many locations in order to continue to have it registered and continue to operate it,

553
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:33,580
the owner has to have emissions testing take place.

554
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:38,580
It needs to be able to pass the emissions test in order for them to even be able to

555
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:48,300
receive a registration to keep the vehicle in operating a legal operating practice.

556
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:54,540
And so what was found was that as Volkswagen was manufacturing these vehicles,

557
01:06:55,170 --> 01:07:00,899
they were installing a defeat device that basically detected when one of the

558
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:05,880
emissions control monitors was attached to the vehicle to test for emissions.

559
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:13,050
And as soon as it detected that, it switched the engine operation into a completely different mode.

560
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,080
It was low polluting and low emitting.

561
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:23,430
And then as soon as that monitored, that pollution detection monitor was was removed and the person started driving the car,

562
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:29,100
it went back into like high pollution mode, which is also equivalent to like high-performance mode.

563
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:35,970
Right. And it like it drives that, you know, handled well all the things that drivers would otherwise be interested in knowing.

564
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:41,310
And yeah, so this went through an entire process.

565
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:45,320
It was in violation of the Clean Air Act here in the US.

566
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:51,870
Of course it's not Volkswagen. It doesn't just sell cars in the U.S. So it was had a larger impact a couple of years later.

567
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:59,549
This is a headline from 2017 about federal judges requiring them to pay.

568
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:12,209
You know, at the time, the price tag was up to 30 billion, $30 billion in fines because of this scandalous activity.

569
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:17,130
And then, yeah, the whole thing has played out within European courts as well.

570
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:23,280
So anyway, if you ever wondered, you know, or thought to yourself, we really need to have these regulations in place.

571
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:27,690
This is Exhibit A for. Absolutely. Yes, this is just an anecdote.

572
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:36,630
My parents had a diesel car back then that was made in 2012 and my dad held out with the dealers because they had to buy the car back to destroy it.

573
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,860
And he held out for like five years before that.

574
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:49,600
So we weren't allowed to drive it, I think. But yeah, it was interesting.

575
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:55,390
He just like immediately had her car, but though she had nothing, it's like also.

576
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:59,429
Yeah. Anybody else? I don't know either.

577
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:06,209
Grew up in a family that had a motorway wagon, or maybe personally, I have not either.

578
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:13,170
But, you know, and I again, I don't think it's if things are investigated enough.

579
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:19,560
Right. It's it's likely not just, you know, for you that's trying to cut corners in a way with things here.

580
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:21,299
And this is the challenge, right?

581
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:28,709
We have we have these regulations in place and it kind of gets back to the allocation of resources for enforcing regulations.

582
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:39,210
Right. I this went on for several years before anyone even was able to go to learn about what was actually going.

583
01:09:42,030 --> 01:09:49,530
All right. Moving down our list now, we're to warnings and a kind of education.

584
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:57,209
Right. So in that and that workplace setting, it's, you know, yeah, there's warnings, but we talked about kind of trainings and procedures.

585
01:09:57,210 --> 01:10:03,180
Right. The community setting, we're not so much training people, but we can definitely be educating them.

586
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:10,610
So we think about this as warnings and your education opportunities to control exposures.

587
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:17,530
Go ahead and take a couple of minutes and see what examples you might get. Exactly like us.

588
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:22,540
It's not something that boil water.

589
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:30,700
Right. I mean, there's nothing absolute favorite out there.

590
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:40,990
It's precautionary. I'd like to be sure.

591
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:54,100
Yeah. No, it's funny. I went canoeing on the Internet, and I had no idea of the Mudhoney for me.

592
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:01,350
Oh, really? Just checking the quality of their places, like.

593
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:05,590
And I was like, I told you in person restaurant it.

594
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:10,450
I guess just advisories. Yeah. Mexico City always says.

595
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:18,970
Anyways, I don't know about you guys, but when I was like with my baby last night,

596
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:36,220
they told me I was like, I do because I heard stuff that I don't really to run.

597
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:43,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Gotcha.

598
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:47,740
It was a great experience.

599
01:11:49,720 --> 01:12:01,600
Was like I was I think there was some like working at the chicken, like I never did.

600
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:06,650
So I would transition somewhere else. I'm like, You know what I mean?

601
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:13,990
I was like, if I was like to sacrifice because I was.

602
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:19,780
I'm more or less.

603
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:33,490
Yeah. And every time I was like, I don't like I shouldn't that.

604
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:43,390
And it also meant something to me that I really want to know, like what you heard.

605
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:56,080
There's a lot of people, you know. But I was supposed to meet your family.

606
01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:04,600
I'm sorry to disappoint you together.

607
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:24,790
Oh, sure. Yeah. I mean, I don't think it's necessary outside to be safe, so I'm going to tell you something.

608
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:28,170
And poison water.

609
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:35,290
You're going to boil it. And I think she would kill me.

610
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:43,900
Sounds like you're always stuck or have always been so like the pandemic.

611
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:51,430
It is a virus. She has to deal with people like you.

612
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:59,110
All I'm saying is I have enough.

613
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:04,870
All I want to talk about, and I will promise you.

614
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:10,629
I suppose I. This wiping on the soymilk.

615
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:21,110
I was my. All right. I was just I was like, I've been wanting to bring this case and he's having three days earlier.

616
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:30,090
This is actually a point which food recalls count, like peanut butter food.

617
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:37,420
Uh, let's see. So the recall, it's so probably not.

618
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:40,650
But the how the recall is implemented, right.

619
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:46,020
Comes out with a warning that says if you have this or purchased this, don't consume it.

620
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:49,480
Right. So, yeah, in that case, absolutely. There was a warning was put out.

621
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:53,550
Good example. What else?

622
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:59,319
Just ways of preventing people from being exposed in the first place.

623
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:05,490
So I don't know what trigger it was or body of water, but people are really going to be on it in August.

624
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:12,370
And then there was like, I don't know, an announcement or whatever it is that there were high levels of chemicals in it.

625
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:17,030
So just like letting people know that information so that they don't engage in behaviors like that.

626
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:28,150
Sure. Yeah. So so alerts that are put out right. In response to some some known risk or hazard that's new would be present for sure.

627
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:32,370
Absolutely. Good example. What else?

628
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:40,960
Yeah. And, um, we talked about like slippery when what signs are like caution hot or not reaching children.

629
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:48,610
Or even if you go to like the park and there's water, there will be signs and say like, stay away from the phone because there's bacteria.

630
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:52,130
Yes. Now there's actually a lot. Right. So this one you are.

631
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:56,100
And you could get on a roll and come with a lot of examples of the caution.

632
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:00,819
Hot. Right. I'm reminded of the this is several years ago.

633
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:05,469
Now time goes by quickly up into McDonald's coffee.

634
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:12,580
Right. And because someone was like scolded by, you know, the hotness of it and and litigation and some lawsuits.

635
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:19,269
And now, I guess when you buy a coffee at McDonald's, it says like caution contents are hot on it for that exact reason.

636
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:27,760
I saw him up over here. Yeah. I was like weather warnings, like tornado sirens, fire alarms, stuff like that.

637
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:34,990
Absolutely. Yep. There's another hurricane bearing down on the state of Florida, supposed to make landfall like tomorrow evening.

638
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:39,780
Warnings about the kind of weather related threats.

639
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:43,570
Yeah, hand-washing instructions during the pandemic, for sure.

640
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:46,389
Yes, actually, I think they're still there, right.

641
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:54,490
If you won't go into any of the restrooms here in the school, you know, something up on the wall encouraging you wash,

642
01:16:54,520 --> 01:17:03,090
I think even how to wash, you know, hot, soapy water this many seconds and so forth, it's definitely an up.

643
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:09,830
An action to educate folks and reduce their potential exposures.

644
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:18,770
And the others. Yes. Rebecca mentioned the heat index index for when you check the weather.

645
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:24,140
Yeah. What's the other one? Pollution. So the air quality index.

646
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:26,480
Will you check one for sure? Yeah. Yeah. So.

647
01:17:26,590 --> 01:17:34,580
So kind of continuing on with, like, weather related extreme heat events for sure, and alerting the public right.

648
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:38,450
More broadly of what communities are expected to be affected.

649
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:43,250
And in a best case scenario, that's something like the forecast. Right.

650
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:47,260
So it's not things are hot, you know, be aware.

651
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:55,820
It's it's being able to issue a warning in advance before before that extreme heat is in place and similarly for for air pollution as well.

652
01:17:56,930 --> 01:18:00,050
And again, with a similar goal to your forecast in advance,

653
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:11,090
when air quality is expected to be particularly or as as both a warning and an education and mindful of the time,

654
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:17,900
I want it to take some time to talk about the proposal at the beginning so we won't get through all the material today.

655
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:22,430
I'll stop here a moment. It's not a big deal. I'll pick that up.

656
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:26,150
I will finish this material at the start of the class period on Thursday.

657
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:31,910
Let's see. Yeah. So it was already just mentioned about extreme heat.

658
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:39,290
It's an issue everywhere. It's especially an issue for urban communities for a number of reasons,

659
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:47,209
with changing climates and what used to be relatively temperate areas that don't

660
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:51,470
have the infrastructure of air conditioning and especially public housing,

661
01:18:52,010 --> 01:19:01,250
large apartment buildings that are the risk of potential exposure to extreme heat is is greater.

662
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:06,770
On top of that, urban areas actually have something called a heat island.

663
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:12,799
So it kind of goes back to those impervious surfaces that we were talking about that absorb a lot more of

664
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:21,050
the sun's energy and emitted locally as infrared radiation that actually heats up the local environment.

665
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:31,880
And so if you go out and make temperature measurements like morning like today and you kind of start on the outskirts and maybe a more rural area,

666
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:40,400
and then you drive across the city and come out the other side with with a thermometer giving you a real time measurements,

667
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:46,850
you will actually see this structure where the temperature increases as you pass through the city,

668
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:50,690
and then it increases as you come back and out of the city.

669
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:55,820
And that's an impact from urban heat island that's in place.

670
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:10,100
So go ahead and stop because we're going to get into, you know, what we do about that to help reduce further another reminder about Election Day.

671
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:15,920
If you haven't voted yet and have the opportunity to we go through that today, reach out.

672
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:19,640
Any more questions on the proposal otherwise? Have a good one.

673
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:25,600
Yes.
