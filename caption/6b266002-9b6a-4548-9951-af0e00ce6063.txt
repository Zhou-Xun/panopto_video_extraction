1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:15,470
Not. Things like grass roots breeding all time and.

2
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,900
I just get out of here. Oh, I know.

3
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, it's like.

4
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:37,420
Yeah. I tell you the truth. She didn't either.

5
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:44,610
And now I think, guys, we'll get things started in a moment and.

6
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,860
I hope everybody had a nice break.

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,910
Smooth travels if you travel. Beautiful weather here like California is very happy.

8
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,910
Smooth family interactions if you had them.

9
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,220
Makes giving can be a tricky time for that, I realize.

10
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,640
So welcome back. We only have a few classes left,

11
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:42,820
which is just always a little wild because it's like we just run at full speed for so long and then it's like all of a sudden sort of end, but.

12
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,680
So I wanted to say, I've fielded a number of questions about papers.

13
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,220
So if, you know, just keep asking if they come up.

14
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,360
I do. Have I had to schedule a meeting during some office hours on Thursday,

15
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:08,250
so just let me know if you want to check in and you can check in either around that or at other times.

16
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:18,800
The other thing that I would start doing at this time of year is that, of course, evaluations are up and so you guys, I think,

17
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:28,590
get a link to course emails and so I'll just kind of keep checking in and posting, but it's always super helpful to get those completed.

18
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:38,960
And I would put in a plea for like any kind of like we did with the mid mid-semester feedback, any additional feedback, you know,

19
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:46,620
just so also that you guys know it's really important to do those panels for especially

20
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,830
more junior faculty because it is an evaluation like of us that's weighed in our,

21
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,589
you know, promotions and all that kind of thing.

22
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:04,020
So I just always encourage people to, you know, go ahead and fill those out because as you guys may be aware,

23
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,409
there are sort of biases in these evaluations.

24
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:15,780
And it tends to be sometimes people who are like really, really, really fired up and don't like the class, who are like most likely to fill them out.

25
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:24,960
And so even if, you know, we want to hear the range, but I have seen cases where especially than like younger junior faculty,

26
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:34,080
you know, either have like a lot of, I would say like aggravated people on their evaluations and you just feel bad because of that.

27
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:40,950
If the level of completeness is low, then it just sort of unfairly weighs those, those kind of cabals.

28
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,639
So I'm just it's just a general plea, you know, it's kind of a pain.

29
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,120
But try to complete the balance for your for all your class. Yeah.

30
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,810
About that. Yeah. That's more for sure. Came up as a concern. Oh yeah.

31
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,790
But not in the School of Public Health. But you guys see it like our names.

32
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,280
No, no, no, no. Oh, my God. They're totally in it.

33
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,660
And then, like, you're not supposed to, like, share people's responses, right?

34
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,540
No. Well, that's an interesting comment. So you can't I mean, so here's the thing.

35
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,709
I don't know if you guys notice,

36
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:18,840
just I'm always kind of in favor of like being transparent about how especially like people get evaluated because it's very it's very important.

37
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:26,040
So sometimes on course evaluation, like free, free, free range free response comments,

38
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:35,610
people will like be able to download like so for example, somebody who's an assistant professor and they're going to get their ten year review.

39
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,100
People can see some of the comments on those evaluations in there,

40
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,580
like overall packet of like research materials, teaching materials and service materials.

41
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,390
So I have seen in some cases and again, if it's, it's,

42
00:04:53,700 --> 00:05:00,480
it's also really important just for feedback to like weigh in honestly about what could be improved was,

43
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,520
you know, people's experience and that type of thing.

44
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:10,379
So I think if there are poor reviews, it's important to know and sometimes I have seen some scathing ones.

45
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:19,620
So it's just that's tough, you know, and you want to kind of know the story behind that so they can come to light, but they are anonymous.

46
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,139
Got it. It obviously won't be anonymous if there is like some whole incident that happened.

47
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,820
And it's very identifiable, which of course, you know, limits the transfer.

48
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,410
Yeah, yeah.

49
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:41,280
But yeah, in general, they're not hugely public, though I would say they're only like public at those sort of review times, if that makes sense.

50
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,040
And they're public to the professor, you know, to the instructor.

51
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:55,139
And I will also say it's just one of those things like no matter how wonderful reviews can be, you always remember the bad ones.

52
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:00,420
I think that's true. Like for all humans. Like we're always like, Oh yeah, yeah, that was great.

53
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,660
But like, oh my gosh, can you believe this person? But it. And so there's always that.

54
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:12,740
So, you know, just this that happens in all reviews of every type of course evaluations, applications, paper submissions.

55
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,470
It's kind of the nature of the business. But. But. Yeah, so go ahead and complete them when you have a moment.

56
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:33,070
Yeah, I did have a question on paper. Yeah. So I'm canvas that says it's due December nine on Friday but down on the and on December 12 on Monday.

57
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,650
Let's make it Monday. Okay. Let's make it Monday.

58
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,559
Sorry about that. I think you that that's I'm so paranoid about that.

59
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,790
So it canvas. That's so funny. I always look at like my paper.

60
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,600
Okay let me do that and make an announcement in case people miss that.

61
00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:04,690
Thank you. Is it like, oh, let me just see today.

62
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:12,680
Let me just see for a little quick. So I'm here so I can correct it.

63
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:25,310
I'm sorry. I just want to see where it is and try to do like a canvas audit every summer.

64
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,080
And there's always some something true.

65
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:37,630
Something slipped through the cracks. Okay.

66
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:46,750
I wonder sometimes. I've also tried to take all the dates out of, like, the assignments.

67
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:55,860
You know I think in the city during know the and like in this 000.

68
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,370
But look here, it's this night. I think this is the. Okay, this is like the thing.

69
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,910
I was like this that thing I was struggling with. I don't know why.

70
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:10,090
Maybe even assignments. I'm sorry. You guys get that behind the scenes view here.

71
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,350
Class participation on paper. December 12th.

72
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,500
December 9th. Interesting.

73
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,320
Okay. Let me see if I can also just switch it, kind of watch my, like situation.

74
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,540
See you can switch to.

75
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,130
Oh, I can't change it. But let me see if I can change the due date.

76
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:45,660
That may have switched. Let's see.

77
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,510
Did it switch it? Yeah. And what you guys can see. Yeah. Okay.

78
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,760
There we go. Done? Sure.

79
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,059
Yeah. No, thank you for bringing that up.

80
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:03,690
I know this works pretty well, but there's always there's like, this feedback things which can be helpful, but if you like,

81
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,870
put too much information in multiple places, benefit number searches and of course, every year the date switches.

82
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,610
So. Awesome. Thank you. Okay.

83
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,360
So let's see,

84
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:23,429
today is one of those days like there's a lot of topics kind of clustered on today because of just various ways I've moved things around.

85
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,930
But of course there's also cross-cutting issues.

86
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,000
So I wanted to just go through a few,

87
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:38,310
a few kind of key populations of kids that we've touched on maybe a little bit and just dive into some sort of special topics.

88
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:47,549
So today what I wanted to go through was talk about just sort of considerations and background and things to think about for kids in these different

89
00:09:47,550 --> 00:10:00,300
populations and give some readings on those materials as well as some resources that I think would be helpful to have your have your tips on.

90
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:09,450
So. So just starting with immigration, we know lots and lots of kids are growing up in families who immigrated to this country.

91
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:15,629
This is not a hugely changing statistic year by year,

92
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:24,870
but we do sort of monitor changes year by year and we are below like in the US, the historic high for this number.

93
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:35,819
But we have a lot of kids who are for sure growing up in immigrant families and of course we have issues of documentation,

94
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:43,710
status, etc. that really can impact some but not obviously all families who immigrated and their kids.

95
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,629
Another thing that's important to remember is that a lot of these kids are young.

96
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:54,600
And so we know that just sort of shifting dynamics and demographics in the country,

97
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,930
well, I think lead to some interesting change in future, which I think is pretty cool.

98
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:09,330
Those of you who are interested in stats on immigration, migration, that migration policy, that data hub,

99
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:19,889
that Migration Policy Institute has a lot of really it's kind of like our world in data like for migration and there's some,

100
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,550
there's some good information there. So I just sort of put that up as a resource as well.

101
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,029
This is sort of an interesting one.

102
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:33,420
So again, I know last time we talked a lot about like social media and when people want what generation people are in,

103
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,590
but just sort of thinking like demographically and like social,

104
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:48,989
cultural shift wise, this is not a huge amount of time, 30 years, but it's a big demographic shift in that amount of time.

105
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:57,450
And so when we think about kind of the share of kids who are growing up in immigrant families or with one immigrant parent,

106
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:04,170
um, in 1990, it's starting to look really different as of 2021.

107
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,180
And this will only kind of keep increasing.

108
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:13,589
And so I think it's just important to kind of keep in mind that these ships are happening rather quickly demographically.

109
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:26,250
And so, you know, there's a lot to sort of consider in terms of, you know, challenges facing this population,

110
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:31,410
opportunities for this population, opportunities because of this growing population.

111
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:39,960
And I think it's always really good to consider kind of how our systems respond to these sort of rapid demographic changes.

112
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:51,480
Sometimes it's really crappy, not so good, and sometimes there are important and good changes that come.

113
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,500
And so what we want to know is, okay,

114
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:02,489
so how are children growing up in immigrant families doing and what are the kind of kind of considerations for these kids?

115
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:10,470
And so this is sort of just an overarching list like based on various and assorted studies.

116
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,770
And again, this is sort of an over generalization, of course, because this is a pretty heterogeneous group.

117
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:24,420
But in general, we talk about strengths being that there are close family ties and intergenerational connections.

118
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:30,260
And I would say, like, it's important to remember too that some of these intergenerational connections are, of course, across countries, right?

119
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:38,610
So if people have immigrated but they have grandparents or other relatives in the home country, that intergenerational,

120
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,980
intergenerational support may not be physically present, but it can still be close family ties.

121
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:50,970
When you consider things like wars taking place in the home country and reasons for immigration,

122
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:57,299
having driven people to this country then thinking about those intergenerational ties I think is particularly important

123
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:05,460
because people really can take in the stress of what's happening with relatives and loved ones who are in the home country,

124
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:14,400
even if they're sitting here in this country, this idea of sort of more cohesive communities, education, work ethic,

125
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:25,140
achievement of kids historically and families with immigrant parents are often higher than kids from native born parents.

126
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:36,839
But we also know there's this paradox. I would say these examples, which we know that as people spend more time in the US to remember,

127
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:42,030
we've talked so much about getting the generational transmission and prenatal stress and all kinds of things that can happen.

128
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:51,780
Intergenerational health is sort of getting gets poorer the more generations that stay in the US and.

129
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,090
I mean, I mentioned sort of prenatal stress,

130
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:04,700
but what can other reasons for that be in terms of anybody who's thought about this or pondered that immigrant paradox?

131
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:13,850
Yeah, food, diet, ingredients like what my parents say overseas.

132
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,330
Like anyone eating that amount would probably be obese here.

133
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,719
But over there, like in terms of the contents. Yeah.

134
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,680
In terms of that. Like they're they're much like healthier. They don't get as much fat.

135
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:35,020
And so like here you could be doing the same type of stuff, but like, you know, considering ingredients and like tamales and all those things.

136
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:43,490
But there's a huge difference between people there and here, even with the same diet, which is so fascinating.

137
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:47,349
Yeah, I'm thinking about like the processing level.

138
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,540
Remember back to like the baby food article? Like, when does that sort of kick in?

139
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:58,300
Right. And what options are kind of available here versus elsewhere?

140
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,370
That's. Definitely something to consider other things.

141
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:14,180
Yeah, I can see. Were not able to access health care or they could be here temporarily in opportunity.

142
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:27,910
Right. So access to services for people who don't have documentation are limited, to say the least, often for sure.

143
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,379
And stress with that stress level certainly can rise.

144
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,520
And we know how that interfaces with health and diet and all those things.

145
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:46,060
So that's that's certainly something that, you know, has been out in the literature for a long time.

146
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,590
I think the factors that may kind of be shaping that could also be changing over time.

147
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,489
And so that's important to kind of keep in mind and not take as a whole.

148
00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:05,170
This is just what happens kind of thing. Yeah, I think it was the economic status of the immigrants and also the insurance and the challenge.

149
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,200
It's like if they're being challenged, if they come, you know, they immigrate for an entire economic opportunity,

150
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,930
something that they're not the best friend that they've already had,

151
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:23,080
like a strong economic background coming married, best for family or even higher paying jobs and stuff like that.

152
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,470
So it can also be a strength or a challenge, right?

153
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,240
So what you kind of what opportunities you're faced with certainly here.

154
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:41,390
And that can change based on what your why you came, what resources you had, what your profession was, etc. in the home country.

155
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,780
I think we also are certainly aware that things like documentation status can make

156
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:53,060
it hard to carry over home country status that is positive and official sometimes.

157
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,160
So that's important to define.

158
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:05,090
Definitely what we do know about kids and this is like I think we talk early on about like language learning and bilingualism and that kind of thing.

159
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:15,049
Kids who are growing up often kind of navigating two cultures like there can be challenges there, but overall it's, you know, a bonus.

160
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:22,220
And certainly learning a second language is beneficial for for brain, for life, lots of things.

161
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,160
So that's something to keep an eye on.

162
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:32,840
Some specific challenges facing kids in this situation are, you know, sometimes can cross over a lot that are from different populations.

163
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:41,120
One of the things that we think about is that sometimes kids are the ones who are sort of like managing burden.

164
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,739
And thinking back to this, like, well, this is two cultures that's sort of two languages.

165
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:55,280
Example, kids may be the ones who are learning a language most quickly if they're in school and if they're sort of interacting with people who are,

166
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,140
you know, English speaking and parents are.

167
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:09,530
So kids may be managing some of the burden for family adjustment considerations for the parents.

168
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,890
Certainly things like stigma, racial bias, discrimination, those crossover, lots of different populations.

169
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:30,349
I've talked about language a few times, so if anybody has, you know, been in places where they don't speak the language, you know,

170
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:40,759
that there are lots of different challenges there in terms of structural barriers because of these sort of bigger factors,

171
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,990
families who are immigrant families are often facing structural barriers.

172
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:50,750
But again, it's pretty heterogeneous. So it's not always the case, but that's common.

173
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,799
And then, like Nicole noted, and limited access to services subsets.

174
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,700
And we'll talk more about that.

175
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:05,990
And then the other thing here is that I think, you know, this is, again, not completely unique, but fairly unique to families who are immigrants.

176
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:10,999
The regulations around this status can change constantly.

177
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,809
And so I think, like on one of the days that we were in this class would be there was like a doctor

178
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:19,310
ruling that came through and that something in particular that changes a lot.

179
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,480
And so when you sort of layer all of these other things on to this fact,

180
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:32,420
that was just a want to kind of keep managing to keep up a lot of, you know, balls in the air to juggle.

181
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,690
We know also that because of, again,

182
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,700
lots of these other factors that are higher poverty rates and then there's just sort of this idea of like uncertainty,

183
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:50,450
where if you're if you have no documentation, then there's deportation fears and lots of that comes with that.

184
00:20:52,520 --> 00:21:04,099
So I think that just this sort of big political space relates in my mind pretty clearly to a lot of these demographic shifts,

185
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:17,810
you know, that we're seeing. And so I think as in the next ten or 20 years, we're going to see change in this space and.

186
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:27,150
My my hope is that because of this, it will it will be in a more like welcoming a positive direction.

187
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:32,670
And we will see what happens. But what's going on in this space?

188
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:46,739
Okay. So thinking about what we want to do to sort of support kids in this situation, which again, is heterogeneous,

189
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:54,299
but there are certainly some considerations that are specific to kids whose families have emigrated,

190
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,820
and especially for kids whose papers parents are not documented.

191
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,840
So I wanted to. Sorry. Let me get this. Why not put the link in?

192
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:15,580
I guess one thing for you guys to consider while I pull this up, this question of, you know,

193
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:25,379
what could public health professionals can do to support kids in this space so that AP Pediatrics has put together this toolkit that I mean,

194
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:31,290
these are kind of some summary points, but so it's basically around advising caregivers of kids,

195
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:38,790
you know, how to prepare basically for, you know, unexpected deportation.

196
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:47,530
So a four point power of attorney, find the records, make copies, give them to other people and have backup plans in case you're deported.

197
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:51,209
So remember we talked about incarceration. Same idea, right?

198
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:57,490
Your parent is taken away from you and you're separated from your parent in this situation is uncertain and possibly for a long time.

199
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:06,900
So all of those things around incarceration and separation can be certainly invoked in terms of the child's experience of a parent being deported.

200
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:17,580
Any ideas of what we can do in public health, in the public health space to support families?

201
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:27,640
Super broadly. And I see if I can pull off this tool kit.

202
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:44,259
What do you guys think? I wanted to just click through this and yeah, just thinking about just like maybe when mothers are giving birth,

203
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,110
like kind of describing a lot of the layout of like what to expect after cause.

204
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:52,810
I think, um, thinking about like people that, like immigrant people from high school,

205
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:56,139
a lot of that like stuff that comes on is usually written in, in the home.

206
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:05,290
And like we all talk about those things about like when Patrick visits very frequently and like he was like, yeah, you should be worried about.

207
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,830
And I think because I talk to my mom too, and she was like, when my oldest brother was born,

208
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,010
she was like, I didn't really know a lot about like, think like I should be talking to him.

209
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:20,110
So like his language development. But when my youngest brother was born, she said, like in the hospital,

210
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,680
they kind of like helped her with a lot of those things that she didn't know beforehand.

211
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:29,130
And so she thinks like that's why, like my older brother had trouble with his language development versus my older brother.

212
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:33,700
She kind of knew what to expect at that point because when she gave birth, they kind of gave her that advice about like,

213
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:37,000
you should be one of your nutrition and the things you should be looking out for.

214
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,780
I think like cultural aspect could be really helpful.

215
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:46,930
Like when they're, if they're giving birth in a hospital, kind of laying out for them so they're like can make that plan moving forward.

216
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,610
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Right.

217
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:56,589
So for kind of early on, giving resources and giving like we talked about that reach out and read program could be for all kids,

218
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:00,520
for all families, but that might be particularly helpful. Definitely.

219
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:10,030
I was going to pull up this with just sort of this is more pediatric focused,

220
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:15,790
but we've talked a lot about pediatric clinics and what we can kind of think about doing.

221
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:19,240
And so lots we can consider for screening.

222
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:26,859
So we're talking about like, you know, there's at birth, but then as kids come in, so kids may experience, you know,

223
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:33,280
might might have medical records with them very well, might not may have had a different vaccine history, etc.

224
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,919
So there's a lot of sort of like what I think of as like sort of basic medical kind of screening and needs to be met.

225
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:45,040
But also, as general is noting, the sort of cultural expectations like you going to the pediatrician, is that a resource for you?

226
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:52,870
We also talked with CPS reporting and like maybe that's not a resource for you or maybe in your community it's not a trusted resource.

227
00:25:54,130 --> 00:26:02,020
So I would say that where there was something, okay, so this is just this is like pretty medical, but where's the.

228
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:10,409
Oh. One point I wanted to make, and I'm just focusing in on this kind of pediatric clinical setting,

229
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:17,489
because this is something we've talked about before, but this is a big issue as well, the sort of language and interpreter factor.

230
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:23,850
So most hospitals or hopefully many clinics will have interpreters services, but definitely not always.

231
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:32,069
And so that's just sort of important to think about. And again, from a public health perspective, what can we do to sort of promote that?

232
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:37,950
And sure, that's in place, you know, advocate for policies that would allow, you know,

233
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:45,900
and encourage or require interpreters who are hopefully not only linguistically but also culturally competent for the family.

234
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,860
And I think. This was this medical screening piece.

235
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:00,510
So just to sort of go through, like if you're a pediatrician and you're kind of looking, you know,

236
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:06,870
at receiving families who are, you know, maybe in a big group of families to your practice, you know, who might be coming in.

237
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,760
These are the kinds of screenings you might consider doing.

238
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:17,780
So, again, sort of basic medical stuff. But also what was the situation, you know, why, what happened in your home country?

239
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:21,900
And I think, again, that may be really obvious, but just to point it out,

240
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:28,379
because that really varies for a lot of people who are coming in and for kids who are coming in,

241
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,840
we don't you know, as we've talked about before in this class, like, you know, they're unreliable reporters.

242
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,240
Right. So it's like hard to get that information. So you really want to do sort of this complete developmental history idea.

243
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,340
And then sorry, there was one other thing I was going to say.

244
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:48,510
This is a medical, medical, medical, but also here.

245
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:55,739
So this health insurance options, I just provide this as sort of a resource because I think this is helpful for people in public health to know,

246
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,930
especially those of us who might interface with medical system and pediatric populations.

247
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,079
And so there are sort of options.

248
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,540
And there recently I was just hearing in the news there's like now some coverage

249
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:14,369
for doula services for pregnant moms that'll be coming online in Michigan.

250
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:22,739
So just kind of having a I would say passing familiarity with some of these resources that are

251
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:28,979
available for families as kind of a public health person who may interact with these populations.

252
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:36,600
Because depending on kind of where located and I mean like in what kind of sector you're located as a public health professional,

253
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,200
like is it the health department as a community based organization?

254
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:48,720
Is it a hospital? Is it a school? Is it, you know, a wide variety of places that especially our students tend to go?

255
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:57,780
You may be a trusted resource. You may be a trusted carrier of information in a way that maybe a pediatrician is not.

256
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:05,070
And so just sort of being, you know, familiarizing yourself with sort of resources like this and kind of putting a public health,

257
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:10,770
you know, brain onto it in terms of why is this useful for me to know?

258
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,600
So I just wanted to kind of click through that a little bit.

259
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:24,389
I think that was the other kinds of things that we've talked about to our are our social determinants,

260
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:28,140
right, that we that we know and love, but that we kind of know and hate, right?

261
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:33,240
So like housing, education benefits, food benefits, etc.

262
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:39,660
And so eligibility for these benefits varies, depends on people can depend on people's documentation status.

263
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:47,640
And then again, this is kind of just helpful info to know we're thinking about kids.

264
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,570
Okay? I think those are the ones I wanted to go through.

265
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:03,059
You guys should all be able to answer this question, like with a lot of good detail and examples because we talked about that kind of thing a lot.

266
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:10,469
But this is the kind of like big you know, these are pediatricians who are the audience of this and they're still kind of writing this down for them.

267
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:15,720
So I just wanted to highlight like this is the kind of information that's really helpful to have

268
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:21,090
kind of at your fingertips as you go out to be hopefully an advocate for kids and families.

269
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:28,240
Okay. So helpful document. Potentially for some of us.

270
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,050
Okay. Uh, okay.

271
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:39,070
So I just wanted to tick through a few of these again, like recent thinking, recent child arrivals.

272
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,399
So there have been, you know,

273
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:51,490
a lot of there are always a lot of different news stories about kids kind of making dangerous crossings to this country in every single news cycle.

274
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:59,740
And we see a lot of this and certainly in recent years, here are some sort of medical considerations and health general health considerations.

275
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:03,790
Infectious disease limited and mutations or different sets of immunizations.

276
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,640
Different timing of immunizations.

277
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,059
I think I might have used the example when you talked about immunizations earlier that my daughter was born in Rhode

278
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:19,090
Island and they had like different timing because Rhode Island is like a little strange small state and like,

279
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,170
we do it our own way.

280
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,889
So I came here and they kept like for the first two years of her life, they were like, she never had this immunizations like she did.

281
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:34,900
It was on a different time scale. Like, I don't know what to do. And so that was like a many, many, many, many, many example of what, you know,

282
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,299
a family, if you're coming from another country, you may not have records,

283
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:45,280
you may not have gotten immunizations, may not have may not have had options to the to get the same immunizations that we get here.

284
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:51,909
So that's a huge issue. Nutritional insufficiencies and diet, that might have been better.

285
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:57,100
And then they take a big hit now toxic and have environmental exposures.

286
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:06,190
Those are important to just remember. And again, if someone's taking an account of what a kid may have experienced in their whole life,

287
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:11,740
this is important to consider because, of course, some of the impacts of this may not be seen till later on.

288
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:17,379
So this could be like in the home country, in the migration journey at any time, environmental exposures.

289
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,430
Certainly when people are here, as we've talked about before, developmental delays,

290
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:28,240
this can be really hard to determine, especially if the kid is not, you know, a fluent English speaker.

291
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,870
And if they're little, they're not. All right. Anybody can be a fluent English speaker.

292
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:37,659
Also, the assessing person needs to be aware of what the child can do in their home language.

293
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,500
So that's a big issue. And then mental health considerations.

294
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:52,059
So for the child, for the parents, and I can imagine lots of different ways that stress and trauma in like forced

295
00:32:52,060 --> 00:33:00,010
migration or forced separation condition can do or can do to kids and families.

296
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:11,980
I would say some of those unique barriers to treatment are we've just already touched on access experience that the

297
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:18,820
clinic might have in treating the child or meeting the needs of families in terms of language or other things.

298
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:27,640
Okay. So I wanted to touch also specifically on DOCA, so and citizenship status in general.

299
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,180
So the DOC programs, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

300
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:39,610
And for those of us who have been tracking this, it has been like going through so many,

301
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,140
I would say, high stress changes and it's like a political football.

302
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:52,639
So basically what. Starting starting over here with Dhaka.

303
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,110
So it started back in 2012. So the program itself is ten years old.

304
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:03,379
In 27, 2017, it was rescinded and then it was reinstated.

305
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:15,500
And so some of this was sort of like political shenanigans and people's status didn't change, but there were just different time points.

306
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,160
You can you can go deep into the policy. There's there's a lot of detail.

307
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:29,600
But basically the idea behind Dhaka is that kids who are under 16 years old, if they arrived in this country,

308
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:41,570
it had to be before 2007 and sort of maintain being in school, being the middle military and don't have a felony are eligible.

309
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,370
But Dhaka does not currently confers citizens citizenship.

310
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:54,590
And this is one of the things that people are talking about like couldn't do that as kids are hitting adulthood.

311
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:06,650
And this is just like an example of what is currently the case with Dhaka is that they tend to change

312
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:14,089
whether your renewal applications are accepted when those are accepted and when you can submit them.

313
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:19,309
And so if one is managing these kinds of applications,

314
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:24,710
there's just a lot again to keep up with in terms of this regulation and it is constantly changing.

315
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:32,389
So it's a good example of something that could be really an awesome,

316
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:41,090
great policy and is but it just sort of takes a lot to keep up with it and sort of it's constantly under attack.

317
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:52,640
So I think that it's like a, again, it's, it's, it's great, but it, it feels a little bit shaky.

318
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:59,500
So what that means to in general, in terms of just citizenship,

319
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:09,590
citizenship status is two words in a row is that what sometimes happens is that status can differ within families.

320
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:19,159
And some kids may not know their citizenship status until they hit certain milestones like those Milestone three talked about in terms of development,

321
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:27,379
like getting a driver's license is sort of a classic one, applying for, you know, financial aid for college.

322
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:36,920
There's another one. If kids experience forced deportation of parents to talk about, you know, that could be added trauma.

323
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:44,240
And the fact that like, for example, if a if a child doesn't have status to get a driver's license,

324
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:48,890
that places more construct more constraints on what that kid can do.

325
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:56,170
Right. That kid can, you know, take a job where they can take the bus but they can't drive, for example.

326
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:08,270
It's a very concrete example. So this is I think this is a space where these really important federal policies kind of

327
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:14,960
impinge in a very personal and real way on kids lives and differentially for different kids.

328
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:23,870
And so important to know about this is not an imperfect policy, as awful as these are.

329
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:33,950
And the the kind of constant change and implementation of DOCA can pose challenges to families.

330
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:39,440
So any thoughts, responses, ideas?

331
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,460
Yeah. In terms of citizenship, if you're born here, you're considered an American citizen.

332
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,810
So if you go first, how can you prove.

333
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,150
Like, for example, if your parents are going to.

334
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:11,060
Set. This process.

335
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:26,840
I don't know the details, but if you can prove that you were born in this country, you should be able to get a birth certificate.

336
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:35,429
But you're right in that a hospital is the. An easy place to do.

337
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:38,909
That is the easiest way to do that because of how birth happens.

338
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:43,320
But even people who do high risk just making it just make me think about people who do home birth.

339
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,010
I'm sorry. I'm just thinking through the details.

340
00:38:53,910 --> 00:39:05,760
You go through a registration process and I'm like, I don't know what level of proof of homebirth one needs to get to obtain a birth certificate.

341
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:14,850
I don't know if anybody knows. It's probably Google, but but yeah, I mean, it's a good question.

342
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:19,110
It's a question of documentation. Okay. And then if you were to.

343
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:28,120
I grew up here. What if you were taken?

344
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,780
If you were. If you emigrated when you were two? Yeah.

345
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:37,780
Correct. That's that. That would then fall into the patch.

346
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:45,420
Yeah. Yeah.

347
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:51,180
Yeah, well, and it's, um, and I think that's why it's a confusing space.

348
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:59,270
It's because the legislation is. Change, changing the legislation, I guess I should say that like that the policies.

349
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:09,740
That are part of the legislation. I guess they're just all in a very extensive long document, just legislation.

350
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:20,600
And I think that's what that's why I just wanted that's why I have to sort of go through all that specifically because.

351
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:29,220
There's so many implications of this on kids lives and opportunities.

352
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:38,159
And like this idea that if you're two and you came and then your sibling was born here,

353
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,010
you guys will have different like life opportunities potentially, right?

354
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,219
So that's what's challenging anything, you know,

355
00:40:44,220 --> 00:41:00,150
like within family dynamics around that and how that time can they not get in that just because you have to to get federal money for college,

356
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:03,360
you have to have that citizenship status. Okay.

357
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,960
So it's like a knapsack form. Okay.

358
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:13,770
Mm hmm. Right. And I think this is like it's like details that are, like,

359
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:20,280
super relevant at certain times of life and not always, like, present in the discussion necessarily.

360
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,210
So I think that's important to walk through. Yeah, I know.

361
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,520
Just reminded me because back on the Senate and the community college there though,

362
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,520
they offer like first year free for residents they don't necessarily have to it's

363
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:40,830
50% like immigrants there and but they don't have to like prove their citizenship.

364
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:47,520
And it's kind of purposely actually for that reason because it's rare to, like, sidestep that requirement.

365
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,110
It's so interesting because the free college, like I'm this is, I think,

366
00:41:52,830 --> 00:42:01,710
more common in California to have a few years at least free community college, like you said, for that exact reason because,

367
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:12,360
um, and I would, I would argue to like again from that sort of public health perspective or like big picture policy like that helps everybody,

368
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,049
you know, and regardless of your citizenship status.

369
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:21,870
And so if I were going to say like where I'd want to put free college,

370
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:32,580
if it were up to me like that would be a good place to sort of have more free educational opportunity so that.

371
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:46,430
These kids aren't excluded. And that kids who are in community college are not starting out layering on debt, but everybody could appreciate.

372
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:52,640
So yeah, like I've done some reading about that and I like that.

373
00:42:54,950 --> 00:43:01,249
Okay, uh, let me just say a few more things here.

374
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:07,240
If we're thinking about kids who are migrants, who have come, you know, with family,

375
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:17,870
who hopefully we know that there has been a lot of trauma invoked in terms of the separation of the border policies, family separation policies.

376
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:24,710
Another thing, you know, okay, so even if families are not separated at the border, usually if you're a kid,

377
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:31,400
if your family is, you know, migrating to another country, it's probably not your choice.

378
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:35,050
It's probably possibly not your family's choice. Right.

379
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:41,610
And so it's it's often, you know, not desired, right?

380
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:49,760
At least about a kid, to put it mildly. If people are in a situation where they're being transported by, you know, people who are taking advantage,

381
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,379
there's a lot of different risks that can be posed for kids and their families.

382
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:59,959
And so, again, this the Migration Policy Institute has a lot of data,

383
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:09,620
but looking at like the number of sort of unaccompanied children who have come over has been high in recent years.

384
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:14,690
And right now there are policies that are sort of stopping families from coming in.

385
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:27,020
There are just this is another space where there's a lot of policy shifting and ways that are that's I would say, is generally damaging to families.

386
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,640
And so we'll see what happens. But I think I've talked through some of these.

387
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:43,100
A little bit, but certainly developmentally relevant themes like relationship disruption, stress and trauma, stress on the parents.

388
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:52,339
You know, if you're thinking about even an older kid, like I'm obvious as you guys now I talk about little kids, but even an older kid,

389
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:58,129
like what if you're an adolescent and you're leaving your, you know, whole, you know,

390
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:03,830
language community, you know, maybe there's limited economic opportunity or maybe there's danger.

391
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:14,300
And that's why your family is emigrating. But if you're an adolescent, like an individual adolescent kid, just may not care.

392
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:21,020
You know what I mean? Like they might want to stay. And so I think that's a kind of a, you know, an individual factor.

393
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:26,780
But that's important to kind of keep in mind. So what age is the kid when they're going through this experience?

394
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:32,810
And of course, an adolescent would be a greater risk for, you know, these kind of stressful experiences.

395
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,660
Okay. That's romance. It's like a lot of heavy.

396
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,800
But so these are just sort of some things to think through.

397
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:51,049
Again, if people are especially interested and going and working with population with these populations specifically

398
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:57,980
and or you're going to most likely encounter families who have had some sort of migration experience,

399
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:04,549
if not the individual kid, maybe their parent. And so maybe their parents have these kinds of traumas when they immigrated,

400
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:09,500
and so they might be passing them on intergenerationally in some ways to their kid.

401
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:17,440
So all these different types of times that the child might have had trauma exposure.

402
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:21,770
So like at home, if there's violence, if there's limited opportunity, etc.,

403
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:26,209
during the migration experience and then in terms of arrival and acculturation.

404
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:34,460
So those kind of earlier stressors are talking about separation from caregivers, harsh physical conditions, stigma and bias, language barriers.

405
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:42,650
We've touched on the the time limited help basically means that there are, you know,

406
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:48,130
different types of sources of help that are available to families, but mostly they are time limited.

407
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:55,310
And so this you know, we know from what we know about child development, what we know about families, what we know about parenting,

408
00:46:55,310 --> 00:47:03,140
like a lot of these issues can go on for a longer time in terms of, you know, recovering from trauma, for example, to take one of those examples.

409
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:09,110
And so we need more that time limited help related to all of our discussions about mental health care.

410
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:15,470
And of course, this is a global crisis. Right. People are moving back and forth a lot.

411
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:27,589
Okay. Another just particular population to note are migrants and who are in farmworker communities.

412
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:35,210
And so this is again like an example, but of a particular population of whom we have a lot of people in this condition, in this situation in Michigan.

413
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:43,370
So we know that there are a lot of disruptions in housing and schooling for kids who are migrants in farmworker communities.

414
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:52,730
I think I talked before about Migrant Head Start, which does do a good job of providing more stability for kids,

415
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:01,620
especially obviously little kids, because it's Head Start. We know that a lot of these same sort of issues face kids and families in this population.

416
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:09,680
Certainly, I want to call out the toxic exposures because that's really common among some of the communities or working with lots of chemicals,

417
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:17,089
working long hours, growing, you know, food that everybody, you know, had Thanksgiving.

418
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:22,190
But there's limited food, access for farmworkers themselves, stigmatized language.

419
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:31,100
So I would just also like to highlight if people are interested in farmworker communities issues facing these communities.

420
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:37,459
There's a great project that happens here that's for public health around Michigan farmworkers.

421
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:45,680
And so, again, just trying to like plant some little seeds of ideas, of interest of people and have it in that area.

422
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:53,780
Okay. So let me switch gears a little bit, but related to housing.

423
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:04,670
I wanted to just kind of zoom in on housing because it does kind of cut across a lot of groups of kids who are,

424
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:11,090
you know, immigrant families, migrant families, poverty families like a lot of kids, a lot of kids.

425
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:20,550
And it's a very sort of set, particular set of ways that housing and housing instability can affect child development.

426
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:28,370
And so what is, again, good in terms of hopefully there will be impact of this increased attention,

427
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:32,779
but bad in terms of like housing has gotten to be such a massive, massive,

428
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:37,040
massive crisis in this country that there has needed to be more attention to it.

429
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:45,500
There is increased attention to housing and housing instability as sort of a source of pediatric health problems.

430
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:54,710
And my my hope, my academic hope, my research hope is that like similar to with ACS,

431
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:59,560
people are kind of realizing like, oh, wait, housing is really important.

432
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:04,760
And it can have, you know, lots of implications for child and family health.

433
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:11,059
So I think, again, like, this is one of those things where I'm like, no, duh people,

434
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:15,260
but it's really important that it's kind of getting increased attention.

435
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:22,880
And I think it's good because it's really starting to just squeeze everyone beyond even people who are just really struggling with housing.

436
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,700
Ten years ago, it's become more of a political issue.

437
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:33,530
So one thing to note here, so housing is an immediate and influential source of instability for kids.

438
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:37,740
We should all see that and be like, oh, instead. It is not good for kids. Kids need consistency.

439
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:41,700
Ideally right for development. We know that housing is high costs.

440
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:47,250
We know that evictions continue to rise, even post-pandemic. So during the pandemic, there are some policies, again,

441
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:53,040
that are stopping evictions from happening, and now those are sort of mostly being rolled back.

442
00:50:55,380 --> 00:51:01,110
Have people heard of the Housing First kind of approach movement policy idea?

443
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:12,689
So this is the idea that, for example, if someone has comes in and has substance abuse problems, then a housing first approach might say, well,

444
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:23,429
you know what, your substance abuse problems are here because you're unable to pay rent and have a stable place to live and get a stable job.

445
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:29,170
And so you're turning to substances and you're spending your days chasing substances to get a fix, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

446
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:35,309
A housing first approach might say, Well, let's get you housed and into a stable housing situation,

447
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:42,730
and then let's see if we can work on these other things, because if you're not stably housed, then, you know, the bottom kind of falls away.

448
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:50,700
It's a basic need. And so there's been some pediatric populations where they've tried.

449
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:56,040
That's the kind of housing first idea and had some positive results.

450
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:02,360
So I would say like this is a cool space for public health people to work in.

451
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:13,980
And again, like sort of that advocate for children and families where there's also like a brand new center here at your dorm from.

452
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:21,300
It's kind of an a combination with poverty solutions and some HBC faculty that's really focused on housing and health equity.

453
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:27,629
So again, if people are interested in housing, there's a lot of movement around this right now.

454
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:31,290
And again, I think from a child and family perspective, it's critically important.

455
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:40,350
So I call that out. If people are interested in connecting with that and also wanting to go through,

456
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:47,520
I think I have time a few key issues like if you again had to make an argument to somebody by about why,

457
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:54,929
you know, not being housed is bad for kids, which in my opinion like that should be kind of clear.

458
00:52:54,930 --> 00:53:01,620
But I like to present this stuff. So we know that this should be really familiar from like the poverty section.

459
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:08,069
We're talking about poverty. It's young families who are unhoused and are many, many more families.

460
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:11,070
And this is difficult to count on unstable housing.

461
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:18,570
So living in a motel, living in a car, kind of doubling up with friends and or family.

462
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:24,210
And so that unstable housing space is really significant.

463
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:34,500
We know that a lot of parents who are experiencing homelessness are often single moms.

464
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,929
We also know that shelters are not a great place for women and certainly not with women and kids.

465
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:44,250
So there's not a lot of kid friendly shelters.

466
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:50,190
I'll see if I can pull up our video that McKoy reading that I gave was just sort

467
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:55,420
of a summary of issues facing kids who don't have housing and early childhood.

468
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:01,530
So for your reference, and if people are interested in this space,

469
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:09,270
it's a good like set of here are some recommendations we can work on again from a public health sector perspective.

470
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:15,770
Okay. So let me see if I can pull up our little video. Do that.

471
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:19,019
Right. Okay.

472
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:27,210
So this is this is sort of a follow up video.

473
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:39,210
In the first video, they had sort of walked around with a with a mom and little kid kind of throughout the day and looked at kind of what they were

474
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:45,779
what they were finding or not finding during the day and through the mom was like taking the bus everywhere with the kid,

475
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:53,609
with the stroller and just sort of like didn't have a place to like, put her kid down for a nap, you know,

476
00:54:53,610 --> 00:55:01,169
was trying to go around and file applications for different housing eligible options that she might have been eligible for.

477
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:09,120
But she had, like, this kid with her and the stroller. And it was just, you know, kind of illustrated how difficult life can be.

478
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:14,760
And so here this video as they go back to the same kind of organization that

479
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:19,350
that mom was with and they're looking at early childhood preschool setting.

480
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:27,179
So we'll watch those kinds of things, see what you think may dress up that her new preschool friends that she flutters

481
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:31,230
around her classroom wearing pink butterfly wings and a purple princess dress.

482
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:37,740
Right. Colorful books draw her attention. All her new surroundings are huge.

483
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,490
There's so much to learn and explore. Oh, never mind.

484
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:47,880
The two and a half year old and the ten classmates attend the newly opened San Diego Rescue Mission Children's Center.

485
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:56,700
But I think we're all like most preschoolers there, mastering Play-Doh and learning their colors.

486
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,270
But these toddlers share something else in common. Yeah.

487
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:13,280
So they all come from homeless families. I'm amazed at the resiliency of these young children playing out here in the yard.

488
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:21,239
Johnson is the president and CEO of the Rescue Mission Urbanization run the downtown

489
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:25,860
transitional housing program and an emergency overnight shelter for women and children.

490
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:31,380
Every single night, we're housing someplace around 50 to 60 kids in this building.

491
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:38,760
But the overnight shelter is only licensed to be open from seven at night until seven the next morning for 12 hours during the day.

492
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:43,740
There's the mothers and babies were on the streets, their belongings stuffed in strollers.

493
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:50,370
Johnson says that's why they created the Children's Center to provide the little ones a safe and nurturing environment.

494
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:58,490
Okay. So just to give you guys a little flavor of that, so what do you guys think?

495
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,020
What would be some sort of, again, thematic intervention,

496
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:10,110
or is this where you would put your money in terms of address helping to address this this issue or this problem?

497
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:15,420
What would be some kind of things you'd need to think about for making a preschool in this setting?

498
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:22,560
Yeah, sure. Hmm. So I know that the toddlers are here, but like the parents were they during this time?

499
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:27,629
Because I feel like that could also I don't know, it just seems not like it's unfair,

500
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:32,390
but it's just like it's like the toddlers are one thing, but also, like, you're not addressing like,

501
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:39,420
the parents situation and like just in general and like if you wanted to just in general,

502
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:46,030
just create like positive outcomes for the child, you also have to work with the parents, too.

503
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:53,000
So yeah. So what are the parents getting from this?

504
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:58,280
Are they also getting help or even shelter during those hours or are they just.

505
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:10,310
Yeah. Yeah. So and and I would I would say, yeah, the parents are definitely getting some child care so that then they can go out and like that.

506
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:14,000
There's a little brief clip of her on the bus, but like by yourself,

507
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:17,900
to go and apply for lots of different things is different from doing it with your,

508
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:22,340
you know, infant in tow, although you might still have an infant who's not enrolled in the preschool.

509
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:31,670
Yeah. So should they could they also provide some, you know, classic thing would be like job training, you know, working on a GED.

510
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:35,990
Could they provide some parents services as well? Good question.

511
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:40,310
And what is it sort of what do you argue for the funding to do?

512
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:44,810
Is it the preschool? Is it the parent additional services?

513
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:51,750
Good question. Um. Yeah.

514
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:57,800
I was just thinking like this is already a very likable community that like stability.

515
00:58:57,810 --> 00:59:05,340
So like, how old are they? Like, if the child doesn't come for like a week or because it's such an unstable situation,

516
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:10,799
like, how do they manage that with it being like a school setting? Consistency is very helpful for them to like build on skills.

517
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:15,330
Like, I can't imagine like a regular preschooler. It's very hard to help with that.

518
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:16,709
But like with this community,

519
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:22,620
I feel like it's even harder because then you're like dealing with maybe issues of like they're hungry or like other issues that are,

520
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:26,640
like, impact their ability to perform in this interview. Mm hmm.

521
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:30,629
That's something I definitely so remember when I was talking about also with the parenting program,

522
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:34,170
with incarcerated moms, but like turnover and sort of attendance was hard.

523
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:41,430
So this is another, you know, extra challenge maybe for this population.

524
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:43,040
Like if you have, you know,

525
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:49,620
kids who are feeling disrupted or grumpy or didn't get enough sleep because they were sleeping on the floor there with everybody,

526
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:58,770
you know, how are they acting during the day in preschool? How how much, you know, quality preschool is happening.

527
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:06,690
And if there's a lot of turnover because of various different family situations, what's the experience of this preschool?

528
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:15,460
For sure. It's a great. There's.

529
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:21,100
Yeah, as you said, what other interventions can we add to the preschool like.

530
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,809
I know we've talked about when like doctors come in or dentists come in when the kids are there.

531
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:31,719
And I'm assuming that they probably have a lot of variability in their life and like where they're living and where they're staying.

532
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:37,210
And so like if they're there even for a few days or weeks, I can try and get that all in.

533
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:42,570
Yeah. Then and that's great because it doesn't have to coordinate trying to get them to the dentist.

534
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:52,270
They're already there. Absolutely. So right. If you were going to be designing a preschool kind of program or just for kids in this situation,

535
01:00:52,270 --> 01:01:00,520
could you put extra effort into having like someone you could pull in every week or something just to come in and do a little half day?

536
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:09,670
It's a great that's a great idea. And of course, you know, every suggestions, you know, you have to balance, right, the funding for everything.

537
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:14,409
And so I sort of show this and I like I don't know if you guys have the same response,

538
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:17,950
but and I and I like the who is he, the mayor or whoever it was.

539
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:22,060
That's right. And he seems to be, you know, behind this, which is great.

540
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:28,120
But at the same time, I think that there's a little bit of like, okay,

541
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:33,669
we'll put the preschool in and then like that can that can kind of solve the problem a little bit.

542
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:36,190
And it's like, Oh, they're so resilient and they're hanging out in the courtyard.

543
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:44,229
And um, I think I would be curious and again, it's like a news clip, so I don't know, I'm just, you know, it's like a point of conversation,

544
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:52,540
but there'd be a lot to think about right around serving this population and trying to figure out what's most highest, highest priority.

545
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:57,630
So it might not look like your average preschool curriculum, or it might, um,

546
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:03,070
and you might want to be able to put in extra parent wraparound supports if you could.

547
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:12,159
And certainly the idea of kind of having mental and mental health, dental health and medical care into that preschool,

548
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:21,490
that might be a that might float higher in the priority list than like learning ABCs or colors, for example.

549
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:26,379
Not definitively, but possibly so.

550
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:33,700
I just I think it's a it's an interesting idea, but it makes me wonder about like, you know,

551
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:40,299
and also sustainability and sort of what they thought about to put in place before they put this in here,

552
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:46,990
because it's a very appealing idea, like from a sort of political standpoint in terms of getting funding or whatever to do with this preschool.

553
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:52,280
But how does it work and what benefit is it having? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

554
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:58,640
Um, I kind of missed the timing of the mentioned, so I was like, well how long is the preschool for.

555
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:01,849
Mhm. And then I think they were talking about the shelter.

556
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:09,560
Was it like 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. then I was like how long is the preschool I was thinking about like coverage.

557
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:12,860
I don't know. Right. Like figuring out. Right.

558
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:16,700
So there's definitely times in the day that are still not covered from the parent's perspective.

559
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:24,890
And then yeah, they did mention so that 7 p.m. set a curfew to be in the in the center or in the shelter.

560
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:32,570
That's a pretty early curfew, especially if you're a parent who's looking for just jobs to make money, for example,

561
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:40,309
that you couldn't work after 7 p.m. That's a pretty tight schedule if you're not like food service jobs or other things that might be available.

562
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:52,850
So that sort of constraint on shelter timing is certainly an issue in all shelter contexts because it constrains,

563
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:56,630
you know, what people can do and what hours they can do it outside.

564
01:03:57,530 --> 01:04:09,499
Also, if you think about that image of like all the the kids on the floor and that one and just thinking about like trying to do,

565
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:13,399
you know, bedtime or bath time, you know, that little wrapped up.

566
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:20,030
Can you tell that everything? But like, again, better than sleeping on the street.

567
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:25,340
Probably better than sleeping in your car. But at least your car is like just you.

568
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:33,049
And this is a lot of different people. And so just, you know, again, one of many imperfect solutions.

569
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:40,520
But thinking through being a kid, being a family with a young kid in this kind of context is is definitely challenging.

570
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:46,340
And so that just doesn't seem like anybody's going to get a whole lot of sleep in that setting.

571
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:56,959
Okay. So I won't be myself, but I kind of like, again, not to bash them for like putting in preschool and just sort of using it to say there's a

572
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,830
lot of different things to consider as we're thinking about the needs of kids and families.

573
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:10,730
And just to kind of click through some developmental stages where you'd be thinking about how does homelessness not being housed,

574
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:17,240
being on the moving shelters, how is it impacting kids across these different developmental periods?

575
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:26,870
So, you know, we know a lot of reasons for a primary reason anyway, why women end up in shelters is through violence.

576
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:32,240
And so interpersonal violence is certainly a consideration for pregnant moms.

577
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:36,169
We've talked about immunizations, kids being not being up at night on immunizations.

578
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:41,989
And so they're also more susceptible to illnesses that could be in that shelter for toddler age,

579
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:47,059
kids, language learning, developmental delays that could be emerging.

580
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:53,540
And like communication disorders like autism spectrum disorders may not be caught if kids, you know,

581
01:05:53,630 --> 01:06:01,910
life is unstable and moving around in lots of different contexts and with lots of different like adults interacting with them.

582
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:08,599
Also safety risks. The prior video talked a little bit more about safety risks, but it's like located on a busy street.

583
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:13,910
And so, you know, toddlers are sort of notoriously, of course, hard to watch as they run out on the street.

584
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:18,090
Um, I think it needs to mention the attendance.

585
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:26,569
So limited attendance among school age kids is they're becoming more aware of their living situation in relation to other kids living situations,

586
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:31,700
maybe thinking about stigma and stuff that those kids are experiencing.

587
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:41,270
Um, and everyone many kids would experience just sort of general education disruptions as well.

588
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:50,180
So I wanted to also just call our attention to that's, that's very sort of little kid focus, but we also have teens.

589
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:58,670
And so what we know is that teens can often be out on their own without parents.

590
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:05,690
A primary reason for that, obviously not all, you know, all homeless teens,

591
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:13,489
but many teens are experiencing homelessness because they're they've left their families or their families kicked them out,

592
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:19,490
often because they're LGBTQ. And so that's a big population to be concerned about.

593
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:25,940
Um, if people don't know about the Rubella Center, that's a resource for kids.

594
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:28,190
For teens who are experiencing homelessness here.

595
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:39,139
LGBTQ teens are also often experienced physical and sexual abuse in the home and have like very valid reasons to not want to be in their home.

596
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:47,390
But then what are the options for them? And so that's a very specific population to think about tailoring, designing interventions for homelessness.

597
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:54,460
Another important thing for teens. Is that truancy and absences from school such as truancy.

598
01:07:55,330 --> 01:08:00,940
That can be kind of a key signal maybe for a teen experiencing unstable housing and just

599
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:06,160
thinking about I think we've talked in here before about like long bus rides to school.

600
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:11,860
If you're not located in the same place, that bus isn't going to be able to get you and bring you to school.

601
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:16,510
So that's something that's really a consideration for teens who are experiencing homelessness.

602
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:24,460
Teens are harder to count and track and they can be like if they can hide and not let the people,

603
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:32,200
the adults who are maybe seeking to help them, it can be hard to find them.

604
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:37,629
So this was a recent report, relatively recent.

605
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:42,970
I think it came out during COVID about unmet needs of kids and youth experiencing homelessness.

606
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:47,410
And just to point out, Internet access is like one of the number one things.

607
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:55,270
And certainly as we've talked about for if you just your during COVID ongoing issue just for life management,

608
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:59,950
everyone needs Internet access because it's again becoming as much of a basic need as housing.

609
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:08,800
And so that's a way that kids who are not getting regular access are, again, losing opportunities.

610
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:18,489
I wanted to just have a few more things to show, but this is a really important one.

611
01:09:18,490 --> 01:09:27,010
So the McKinney Vento Act is basically to make sure or to put in place an entitlement

612
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:31,800
that kids who are experiencing homelessness are entitled to school attendance.

613
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:41,230
So like if a child is living at a shelter and that and it's that's known to the school or to the McKinney Vento liaison of the school,

614
01:09:41,230 --> 01:09:45,220
that bus needs to come and get the kid at the shelter and bring them to school.

615
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:49,209
And so that's a really important protection that we do have in place.

616
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:53,890
We don't have that many, but that's a really big one for kids who are experiencing homelessness.

617
01:09:53,890 --> 01:10:01,810
So that's something that's important to know about. As with so many of these things, we have limited capacity to provide those services.

618
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:06,760
But bless you. But everybody has an entitlement for it.

619
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:11,110
Yeah. Is that a federal policy or like state level?

620
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,839
Okay, that's federal. Yeah. Yeah.

621
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:21,729
So it's I think I mentioned the other day, there's like The New York Times has just done a really good series on rural homelessness and youth.

622
01:10:21,730 --> 01:10:29,379
And so they talk to some of the liaisons and the kid making events over years runs in the school because they basically are the people

623
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:38,110
who are setting up like snack pantries and care closets and things like at the school site to help kids and give access to a shower.

624
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:45,159
And again, thinking about teens, you know, you want to shower, you want to do your hair, you want to have clothing.

625
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:50,350
You know, it's a very different set of considerations than for toddlers.

626
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:55,960
But, yes, so this is a big one. Little kids were just included in it.

627
01:10:56,380 --> 01:11:00,850
2017 preschoolers also have a McKinney Vento.

628
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,790
They fall under that legislation. And again, local resources people are interested.

629
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:13,120
If people don't know Alpha House is a place where kids and families can go and then Ozone House is focused on teens.

630
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:25,450
And this is just a different report that counted, again, students who are experiencing homelessness.

631
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:30,910
And again, this doesn't necessarily get kids who are kind of in an unstable housing situation,

632
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:36,040
but those numbers are high and these are numbers from 2015.

633
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:41,950
So they have most assuredly increased. But there hasn't been a new report specifically about that.

634
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:50,020
And speaking of kind of rural populations of kids experiencing, you know, having more limited access, as we talked about before,

635
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:59,709
the highest percentage even back in 2015 of of kids experiencing homelessness was in northern and central Michigan, which are more rural.

636
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:02,830
So that's certainly a big issue in the state.

637
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:10,999
And okay, I will just kind of end thinking about these intervention considerations.

638
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:17,090
So this idea of like, okay, if you you're working with this population of, you know,

639
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:21,159
kids from farmworker migrant families who are kids who are experiencing homelessness,

640
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:25,420
like what are we going to do to put in place possibly interventions to help these kids?

641
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:33,010
What can we do as public health people? So I would say we want to reduce their barriers to services like barriers to eligibility.

642
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:37,840
So McKinney, Vento, everybody's eligible, but what are they access?

643
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:45,129
You know, what what are the sort of capacities of the schools to provide those services that support timely screening

644
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:49,990
and coordination of care so that McClure reading is like that early childhood ones thinking about.

645
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:57,760
Actually the Clinton one to the AP reading is about like medical screening, developmental screening, vaccinations.

646
01:12:58,150 --> 01:13:07,420
So just sort of like those are also kind of like basic kid needs, but also providing space for kids to be kids is what that preschool is trying to do.

647
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:18,220
And in all of these situations, I hope we would all recommend that if we can, that care needs to be trauma informed,

648
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:20,920
because if kids are in any of these situations we've talked about today,

649
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:25,960
there's probably been some sort of stress or severe trauma that they've faced.

650
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:32,020
And so thinking about what might trigger these kids in terms of their behavioral reactions.

651
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:39,040
And then the other thing was that driven by reading about what are the parents going through?

652
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:46,089
Right? So that idea of helping both generations and sort of being mindful of what the parents have may maybe

653
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:50,710
currently experiencing how what their capacity is to kind of help the top with what the child's experiencing.

654
01:13:51,190 --> 01:14:00,160
So very similar themes as we've covered in prior classes, but a good sort of like summarize how to think about them.

655
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:12,760
Um, and those would be kind of my recommendations if anybody's got their papers and next class,

656
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:19,690
I'll cover a few similar themes, but we'll really talk about gender identity development, LGBTQ youth.

657
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:25,720
And then some readings and a video for you guys to peruse.

658
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:30,910
And I can pause there. And then if anybody has paper questions, I'll stick around for a few minutes.

659
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:58,240
But thank you for good question. Yeah.

660
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:04,300
Yeah, yeah. I think we're getting there.

661
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:18,020
They wanted to know what was in the background.

662
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,450
I didn't know that. Know?

663
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:27,750
I'm not sure.

664
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:31,060
Yes, ma'am. I know you want to.

665
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:35,980
Yes, I do want to do that. Let me just.

666
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,930
Do you think you could do. Oh, yeah. Yes.

667
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:46,240
And then what time works for you?

668
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,810
Yes, exactly. I just said. Tuesday.

669
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:57,520
On Tuesday? Yeah. That was perfect. Yes. I'm just saying.

670
01:15:58,190 --> 01:16:02,230
Yeah, maybe we could always just walk back. Oh, here. Thank you so much.

671
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:05,830
Oh, the other. Cool. Thank you.

672
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:09,930
God bless you.

673
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:18,440
And. So I make sure I get that right.

674
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:23,980
Yeah, I had a question about the paper, so I went by the intervention.

675
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:28,190
I'm looking at ABC and it was like massive attachment over here.

676
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:32,750
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, okay. Okay. Yeah. Like a ton of research.

677
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:40,950
And so I wrote everything in there and especially I kind of followed the same, um, like formatting sections that I had in my first paper.

678
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:48,800
Uh huh. And I realize I'm going to go over the page like, so when describing like the research studies,

679
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:57,450
since a lot of them use like the same methods and some of them can I just like summarize that and then like in one paragraph and then yes.

680
01:16:57,470 --> 01:17:00,740
Okay. So that way I think that's a good place to summarize.

681
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:09,080
Like you don't need to go exhaustively through all different evaluations and it's nice that you're focused in on that intervention.

682
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:14,540
It's good to hear. I mean, yeah, it's good to hear that. There's a lot on it.

683
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:19,219
It's it's still it's not new, but it's not been around forever.

684
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:23,270
So there's a lot on it, but it's also all seems like the same.

685
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:29,000
The same the team who developed it. Yeah, yeah. So it's like, there's like gaps and stuff that it's not including.

686
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:35,270
Um, but it is quite interesting. They didn't dive into like, uh, like measuring cortisol.

687
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:43,160
Yeah, actual stress responses and then like doing brain like scan stuff like in middle, like childhood.

688
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:50,780
Yeah. Um, yeah. So it covers like a bunch of different categories and I don't even include like all the research that is on there.

689
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:54,230
But I was like, I was like, I have way too much information now.

690
01:17:54,630 --> 01:18:00,260
Yeah. I think for this paper, it's, it's about like, right, here's how the intervention works.

691
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:06,620
Here's sort of some data show that does work and here's the gaps and here's like how I'd improve it.

692
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:15,230
Okay. And awesome. Yeah. Yeah, that's an interesting one because it's it's so like based on just like, good theory.

693
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:20,570
And they've done a very methodical, like, way to show.

694
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:24,400
Yeah. An impact. And like Mary Dozier who invented it.

695
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:27,450
Yeah. Oh, yeah. There's like, she's she's awesome.

696
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:31,010
She's on a lot of the articles. Yeah, yeah. It's her.

697
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:34,700
It's her baby. It's her baby. Yeah. So yeah.

698
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:40,790
But it's but I think that, you know, unlike I think sometimes you see some of these papers that it's,

699
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:45,259
you know, it's somebody just like baby intervention and it's evaluated,

700
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:49,790
but it's like really, you know, it's, it's not quite rigorous or like they don't have the,

701
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:53,540
you know, I love that that one is one of the few that does show a biology impact.

702
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:57,650
So yeah, some of them too, like they have a different like publication reports, right.

703
01:18:57,770 --> 01:19:02,750
And then when I read the detail, they're, I'm like, so is this technically the same study?

704
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:07,940
And I can't really tell, but they'll be like they'll be like minor differences though.

705
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:20,300
So like, it will be like super closed and instead of like 98 will be like 96 and I'm just like, can't use this for like everything is like so similar.

706
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:27,290
So it's kind of hard to tell. But like there's the they did schedule like there's like specific follow up ones like during preschool.

707
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:33,750
And then, um, I was like an adolescent and those lines I think are right.

708
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,830
Those are, they've got to be the same sample. Yeah. That over time. Yeah.

709
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:41,479
And then those people are like dropped. Yeah. So that's probably the number is different.

710
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:49,040
But some of them. Yeah, I can't really tell someone could also be like again, like you could really deeply obsess, but you don't need to do that.

711
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:53,809
But those are the places I would maybe look would be like, is the recruitment the same?

712
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:58,160
Like, is it is it these people like that? Because I have so many papers on like this one.
