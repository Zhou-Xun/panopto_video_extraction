1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:08,310
Great to see you. But now they.

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,980
So much. I felt that when.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,430
Yeah. It's just like by the time I was in and out of here in the framework.

4
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,000
Right? I think you're right.

5
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:47,270
Yeah, I must say, and I think you look at things like that, I don't quite understand.

6
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,780
I mean, I don't know.

7
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:03,620
I think you can.

8
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:17,660
To go back and forth about what does that mean?

9
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:28,270
Well, I think that if you're like, I don't really change anything about it.

10
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:40,310
I kept everything. Yeah, that's exactly what that gets.

11
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:49,340
That is what I was thinking about.

12
00:01:50,090 --> 00:02:15,510
Well, they're thinking it's not happening. It's it's not like I was saying something like that.

13
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,700
I think you should be ready to do whatever.

14
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:39,860
But like you said, you just out of school, I thought that you had like, you know, what do they get that I like?

15
00:02:40,090 --> 00:03:10,830
I think I find it like, just, like, needs to happen to be something I don't really like, you know, like, I think, like, did you see the once?

16
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:24,220
Well, I thought I was going to write.

17
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:35,480
Oh, you can actually say that like a.
