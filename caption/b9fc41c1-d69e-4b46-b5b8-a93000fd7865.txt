1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:10,173
In science, in public health, and in
medicine, most of the communications that

2
00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:13,290
we do are what we might call
didactic communications.

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,540
They're intended to teach.

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,890
They're usually a bunch of facts, or
observations, or theories that have been

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:26,580
organized in various structured ways
to communicate the facts in organized,

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,135
didactic, boring way.

7
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:34,440
Yet, honestly, throughout history,

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,510
remember there's another way that
we communicate with each other,

9
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,750
a way that's particularly good at
helping people remember things.

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,030
What is it?

11
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,116
Stories.

12
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:49,800
Stories have existed for
as long as humans have had language.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,480
We use oral history to pass down
the stories of our families or

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,910
our communities from one
generation to the next.

15
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:04,770
We've had fables and myths that have
been told for centuries, for millenia.

16
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:08,890
I mean, Aesop's fables have been
around for thousands of years, and

17
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,560
similar kinds of fables and

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,550
myths are present in most other cultures
and traditions around the globe.

19
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,580
The faith traditions of the world
have been passed down orally and

20
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,570
in written form in stories.

21
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,850
Why, why is it that we talk
in story form so much?

22
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,680
Well, it turns out that there's growing
scientific evidence that human beings

23
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:44,300
brains have actually evolved to process
story, particularly easy and well.

24
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,500
We actually think in story terms.

25
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,980
There's some books,
some of the ones that I've run across,

26
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,440
Lisa Kronn wrote a book called Wired for
Story.

27
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,049
Jonathan Gotchell wrote a book
called The Storytelling Animal.

28
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,760
There's many others.

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,030
The list goes on and on.

30
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,310
The evidence is accumulating that,
it's not just we like stories but

31
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,510
our brains think in story form.

32
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,380
So we see this pattern in
the way in which we teach.

33
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:20,820
I mean if you really reflect on it,
how do we teach young kids, like toddlers?

34
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,870
You tell them stories.

35
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,570
Here, sit down, let's have story
time we read books to you.

36
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,890
We tell stories about
stuff that's going on.

37
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:36,510
We tell stories about animals, or
about other little kids and what they do.

38
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,610
That's how young kids learn.

39
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,200
How do we share knowledge
among professional colleagues?

40
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,380
Around the water cooler.

41
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,300
This is what happened to me, and, let me
tell you about those classes that I just

42
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,266
finished, or, let me tell you about what
happened when I went to this meeting.

43
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:53,412
My gosh.

44
00:02:53,412 --> 00:02:55,620
We tell stories.

45
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,390
We want to tell and
share information using a narrative form.

46
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,360
This is why, if you look carefully,
you actually do see stories in

47
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,220
health decision making, and
health communication everywhere.

48
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,370
Patients and
doctors make medical decisions,

49
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,800
not just based upon facts and
evidence, but

50
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,530
also to some degree based upon the stories
of what happened to earlier patients.

51
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,060
Well, this turned out really well for
her, so I wanna do that.

52
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,960
This is how she felt when
she did this treatment.

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,304
You might wanna think about that.

54
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:32,565
Let me tell you the story about how I
went figuring out what I wanted to do in

55
00:03:32,565 --> 00:03:34,480
this case.

56
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,570
Again, narrative structures,
omnipresent in health communication.

57
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,625
There's also another literature on
the use of stories in policy debates.

58
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:51,090
Sometimes, in fact, policy debates
are framed as stories versus facts.

59
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,830
Now, I have a little problem with that.

60
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,230
Because that implies that stories
are fundamentally non-factual,

61
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,000
that they don't include facts.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,740
But that's not true.

63
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,950
Stories are a method by
which we communicate.

64
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,570
And sometimes facts can be
embedded within those stories.

65
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:13,820
The problems are, however, is that stories
of individuals can be problematic.

66
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,840
And the reason they can be problematic
is that what happens to one person

67
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,660
doesn't often represent
what happens to everybody.

68
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,420
And so you have a generalization problem.

69
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,830
Even if it's true, this happened to me,

70
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:32,000
that doesn't necessarily mean it's
gonna happen to everyone, but

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,310
we can use storytelling
techniques to make the facts

72
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,900
that we need to communicate to people more
intuitive, more memorable, more useful.

73
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,280
That's the goal of this
part of this course,

74
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,810
to train you into how to use
storytelling principles.

75
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,050
To turn the science or

76
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:56,663
facts that you wanna communicate into
something that somebody wants to remember.
