1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,000
So what do I want you to
take away from this lecture?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,680
The bottom line here, or the most basic
message I want you to take away from this

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,990
lecture, is that those of us interested
in improving the public's health

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:22,640
must grapple with health behaviors,
or the behavioral causes of disease.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,350
Because of the scale and the broad
scope of the problem, and because so

6
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,070
few financial resources
are directed at tackling it.

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,110
Public health efforts to improve health
behavior must be well coordinated and

8
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,880
collaborative.

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,950
We need to target the behaviors linked
to the greatest disease burden and

10
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,380
to focus on intervention strategies
that will have the greatest influence.

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,090
This is no small task.

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,500
In fact,
this is an enormous challenge, why?

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,442
Well, for many of the intractable reasons
we already discussed today, but also

14
00:00:56,442 --> 00:01:01,840
because for many people, health behaviors
are still looked at as individual choices.

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,060
And choices whose consequences
are largely felt by individuals.

16
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,380
You know, because you've
learned the ecological model,

17
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,030
that those choices aren't
only at the individual level.

18
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,250
And that in fact,
maybe in some circumstances,

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,380
the word choice isn't even accurate.

20
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,730
But by and large, the American public
looks at behaviors, like whether or

21
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,930
not you smoke, how much you drink,
what you eat, and

22
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,900
how little you move,
as individual choices.

23
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,950
And so, there are barriers to how and
how much,

24
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,410
we as a society,
can affect those behaviors.

25
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,840
There are barriers at the political level.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,200
Ethically and philosophically,
there are many things we just won't do as

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,480
a society to require or
compel behavior change.

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,565
Certainly, there are also legal and
economic barriers.

29
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:59,795
And the importance of the problem, coupled
with all of the factors that make change

30
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:07,456
difficult, are what makes public health
such an interesting and challenging field.

31
00:02:07,456 --> 00:02:10,890
So how do we start to move
the dial on behavior change?

32
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,160
What works?

33
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,610
I'm going to talk about three different
broad strategies, and I'm going to talk

34
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,590
about them from least to most coercive,
reading from left to right on your slide.

35
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,460
First, we could target the individual
level and seek to educate or

36
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,210
improve people's knowledge about
the risks of unhealthy behaviors.

37
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,380
Education is a classic
intervention strategy.

38
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,630
We see it in programs
like the DARE program, or

39
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,460
in sexual education programs in schools.

40
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,040
These types of programs are efficacious.

41
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,990
They work well under ideal circumstances,

42
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,260
when offered by educated
trained individuals,

43
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,810
in well resourced settings, and when there
are boosters or good follow up sessions.

44
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,420
But we also know that they
aren't very effective

45
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,140
in changing the way people behave because
these ideal conditions often aren't met.

46
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,070
Education strategies, but also include
public service announcements or

47
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:13,320
PSAs, mass media campaigns,
and food labeling.

48
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,340
Next we have financial incentives.

49
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,250
Often these are negative incentives,

50
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,430
such as higher taxes on things
like cigarettes or alcohol.

51
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,560
We also see negative incentives like
differential life insurance rates for

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,360
people who smoke.

53
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,690
We've seen significant reductions in
smoking behavior due to the heavy taxes

54
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:37,940
that have been levied on cigarettes
over the past two or three decades.

55
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,744
And finally, the most coercive strategy,
changes to laws and

56
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:45,220
policy to change behavior.

57
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,180
Laws that address health
behaviors are most acceptable

58
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,760
when they're designed to protect children,
like car seat laws.

59
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,860
Or to protect people from the consequences
of other people's behaviors,

60
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,090
like second hand smoke policies or
drunk driving laws.

61
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,770
Laws regulating behavior are least
acceptable when they're seen as

62
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,030
paternalistic, like motorcycle helmet
laws, or when they challenge people's

63
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,880
sense of morality, like mandatory
sexual education or HPV vaccination.

64
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,480
This is the end of the lecture.

65
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,067
Thank you for listening.
