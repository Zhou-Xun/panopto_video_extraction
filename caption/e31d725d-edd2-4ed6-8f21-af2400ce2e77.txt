1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,960
We won't have time to watch it in class today because we're watching another video today.

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:18,920
But I did put a YouTube link to and explained video in the announcements and they do a really good job at explaining like the racial wealth gap.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,760
If you're interested in watching. Oh, okay.

4
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:36,100
As long as a dollar a month. All right.

5
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:45,720
Hello, everybody. Hello. I will say I did make your midterm this weekend.

6
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:54,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Did you say, uh, you know, I won't necessarily make a study guide,

7
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,360
but I think on a Thursday, we'll have some extra time, so we'll, like, review some stuff.

8
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,120
Your midterm is in until week eight, so it is fall break is Tuesday.

9
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:15,450
And then on Thursday, you'll have your midterm. But the midterm will only cover materials from weeks one through six.

10
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:30,030
Okay. So it's it's like matching true false, multiple choice, short answer 30 questions and you have an hour and 20 minutes.

11
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,499
I think it's doable. Anything.

12
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,260
I feel like it's too easy. But whatever. Is it in class or is it like on canvas in class?

13
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,090
In class, closed note, closed book, closed resource.

14
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:59,160
So it's using your in your old noodle, you know, the old old school midterm and then upgrade it and you will get it back the paper papers.

15
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,400
But yeah, we'll have some time this Thursday so we can we can do a little like recap session.

16
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:17,880
Um, I want to put back in the forefront of your mind that the committee cumulative assignment for this class is the commentary paper.

17
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:26,610
So to start thinking about what topic you might want, this class is a little bit different than my online class.

18
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:35,219
My online class finishes tonight, actually, so they've blown through a semester's worth the material in six weeks,

19
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:42,390
and they had to write the same common type. Every paper you did in six weeks, plus doing all the same homeworks and quizzes and stuff.

20
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:52,050
But there's classes a little different just because it's a different demographic of students where they did peer reviews for each other.

21
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,070
You won't be doing peer reviews for each other.

22
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:01,950
I will be the one looking at whether or not your topic is appropriate and then

23
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,540
how far you're coming along on your outline and giving you feedback like that.

24
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,370
You know, each milestone is low stakes. It's worth like five points.

25
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:21,749
But if you don't turn anything in and you just keep barreling down the wrong road, it's going to be more difficult for you to fix it later.

26
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:32,040
So that's what those check points are kind of for. So in that last week when the commentary paper is due, there's a couple of examples I put for you,

27
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,769
but just kind of start thinking now about, you know, what topic you might want to cover.

28
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:49,770
So like for example, some example commentaries I've had is like the impact of climate change on urban flooding in Detroit.

29
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,870
Another person talked about a specific infectious disease outbreak on like a naval base.

30
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:05,520
Another person talks about infectious disease and emergency response in tribal lands in Colorado.

31
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,479
So, you know, it just has to it can be infectious disease, emergency response and or both.

32
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:22,650
But you have to be able to talk about at least recommendations for three levels of government and talk about how you would make,

33
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:29,700
you know, changes to make it more equitable, whether that be like racial, ethnic or socioeconomic.

34
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,770
So just getting you to think about that now, no, it does not have to be United States focus.

35
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:40,440
Right. But you have to have enough peer reviewed literature to support your argument.

36
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:47,880
Okay. All right. So today we're going to recap the social determinants of health,

37
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,090
understand how structural racism can cause or contribute infectious disease outbreaks in communities.

38
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:01,620
And then later on Thursday, we'll talk about the environmental justice movement, what it is,

39
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:08,310
and then how infectious disease emergency response is affected by a lack of environmental justice.

40
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:21,569
Okay. All right. So just as a recap, the social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live,

41
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:28,740
work and age, as well as the complex, interrelated structures and economic systems that shape these conditions.

42
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,210
So people's health outcomes are generally linked to the average.

43
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:38,360
Canadian resources or lack thereof to protect, improve and maintain their health.

44
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:46,700
You know, for all of us in public health, we've heard about the social determinants of health, basically, probably since your first semester here.

45
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:56,390
But you'll be surprised. Outside of the realm of public health, this is still a difficult concept for like the layperson to grapple with,

46
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:03,530
and you'll probably have to explain it to them at some point or another in your career.

47
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:14,360
So, you know, the CDC generally has it boiled down to these five categories of education, access and quality health care and quality,

48
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,180
neighborhood and built environment, social and community contacts and economic stability.

49
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:29,600
To get more into detail, this is an expanded SDH from the Kaiser Family Foundation.

50
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:37,910
Under economic stability, they have employment, income expenses, debt, medical bills and support.

51
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:48,559
Under neighborhood and physical environment, they have housing, transportation, safety, parks, playgrounds, walkability, zip code education.

52
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,969
They have literacy language, early childhood education, vocational training, higher ed food.

53
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,680
They have hunger and access to healthy options, community and social contacts.

54
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:07,530
They talk about integration, social support systems, social capital, community engagement, discrimination and stress.

55
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,950
And then for the health care system, they have coverage, provider availability, linguistic and cultural competency and the quality of care.

56
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:27,140
And all of these, in turn, affect morbidity, mortality, life expectancy, health care expenditures, status and functional limitations.

57
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,690
So from this let me let me let me go back.

58
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,910
We're going to do breakout groups of let's.

59
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:47,480
Three. This room, is it super conducive to, you know, so looking back at this and I'll put it back on.

60
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,400
Is there anything from the social determinants of health list that you feel is missing?

61
00:07:53,180 --> 00:08:02,750
And then talking specifically, maybe give one example of how the SDH has impacted your life, for better or for worse, from one of these categories.

62
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:08,030
So I do want to just group yourselves or like, you want me to group you.

63
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,810
Okay, I'll let you group yourselves. So let's do groups of three.

64
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:24,860
And so from this list, I want you to please brainstorm what you think is explicitly missing from the social determinants of health list.

65
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:30,440
And then one example of how one of these from one of these categories has impacted your life.

66
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:41,520
Okay. And go. I like it just for fun.

67
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:51,680
Yeah, just this giant group. Oh, yeah.

68
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,800
Yeah. Oh, I like that.

69
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:20,040
Oh, yeah, yeah. You know, I haven't heard anything that could adversely affect women in higher education.

70
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:29,730
That's what I believe. Access to these doctors is very instrumental.

71
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,010
Yeah, like that. Yeah, I think.

72
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:42,470
I guess I don't believe that.

73
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:49,350
It's not animals that on the Internet.

74
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:55,790
I'm just. I really think it's of your health.

75
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:02,600
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it was through college for the most part.

76
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,120
I like. I mean, like.

77
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:16,850
Yeah, like, if you're doing something right, I think it needs to be, like, so expensive, right?

78
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,520
It's not these things that make a difference to me.

79
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,950
For instance, is it because they can? Yeah. Health care costs.

80
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,870
Isn't that right? And usually.

81
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:41,030
Is that true? It's not one.

82
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,209
I like it. It's not even an interruption story.

83
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:52,530
Just kind of like social media is another list of write a.

84
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:17,879
Okay. Maybe I haven't been able to get to the subject of this issue yet and which I wouldn't do.

85
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:28,410
So I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

86
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,590
That's right. Yeah, that's true.

87
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:44,030
It makes sense to us because a lot of what they say, they're just not.

88
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:54,210
And I feel that if you're really to know, especially something that would be probably like yeah,

89
00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:01,100
it's a really good yeah there's not like there are a lot of times like if you live in an

90
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:16,110
area that can influence your stories and that's why that's why I can to get up to seven,

91
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,969
I feel like 34 this time of year.

92
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:24,930
It's like you don't know how to dress. Yeah, yeah, I know what you're talking about.

93
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:33,930
Guess so. I'm sure it was some initial thing, but then it was like a cold.

94
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:43,470
But then my the after the have to, like, carry the coat and everything and I don't really know what it is.

95
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:50,190
It's, it's I don't like, you know, I, I like fall a lot more, but it's that time where it's like you're,

96
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:54,480
it's like when you're done walking or going anywhere, you're like, oh, cold sweat.

97
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:09,420
I don't like that feeling because it's like m I said, I'm not saying, you know, like, all right, everybody, let's wrap up.

98
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:18,299
But, you know, this is just I've heard lots of good chatter, so we broke ourselves up.

99
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:24,330
It's a lot of stuff for. That's cool. How about Lexi in Burnley?

100
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:29,129
Do you have any contributions here? Um, yeah.

101
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:36,690
We talked about a few things that we don't know if it's not in the list because it feeds into other okay.

102
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:45,780
For instance, like races missing or perhaps races influencing a lot of like the income that's influencing zip code.

103
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,960
It's because of our our system.

104
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,690
Yes. And how we discriminated against people. Sure.

105
00:13:52,110 --> 00:14:01,439
I mean, intentionally not unless, you know, they didn't include any other demographics like age, gender, race, ethnicity.

106
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,110
But we could put it as like a like an overarching thing if you'd like.

107
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:15,990
Um, my suggestion is to change it to, like racism because your race is not.

108
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,680
Yes. Yeah, great. Thank you.

109
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:27,000
Okay, she just jump in, right? In reality, a lot of people do that and I'm like, but that's not actually the problem.

110
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,770
Thank you. Oh, I can I can edit this directly.

111
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:42,149
Okay. I didn't I did not make these slides. You're like, I think I told you like a, uh, I have an instructional designer for the online class.

112
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:49,560
And so a lot of these slides are spread out and I make, like, this ugly thing, and then she makes it beautiful.

113
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,840
So, like, this, for example, did not look like this when I conceptualized it.

114
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,820
So. Okay, so anything else to add to this, to this from this group?

115
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:10,200
Um, we also like, just like on the same line, like generally you inherit a lot of these, like it's a generational poverty or generational hunger.

116
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,430
Like, I don't know if that's maybe a modifier on some of these, but it feels like that should be a no.

117
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:21,209
And we talk a lot about like generational trauma and how that can affect sure, sure, mirror also genetics and stuff.

118
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:24,390
Those big influence like if you are predisposed to certain health conditions.

119
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,280
Yeah. We can maybe put that, you know, kind of here.

120
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:39,780
What about this group in the back in school? And so we had to though we felt that climate change was an issue here,

121
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:48,560
like that's going to impact health as a whole or kind of defile them their physical environment to an extent, maybe.

122
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:54,080
Okay. Um, we also talked about the larger interests.

123
00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:04,320
And one thing that I think is important to point out is like food and access to healthy options is there's this big time variable because

124
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:11,460
if you don't have time to like make a healthy meal because you have to work or you have to take care of children and that sort of thing,

125
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,960
then you're going to have worse health outcomes related to person.

126
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,410
Okay. Okay. Great point. Anything else you group talked about?

127
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,890
Okay. How about this front group? I heard some stuff.

128
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:36,060
Yeah. So I think we talked about outside of the U.S. perhaps, but like the effective caste systems or the social hierarchy.

129
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:44,930
Okay. Okay. And then another thing was like, there's there's a section for food, but nothing really mentioned about water specifically.

130
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:50,370
It's like access to clean water and also like exposure to pollution,

131
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:57,810
which I guess kind of falls under some of the things mentioned in like the neighborhood physical environment, but it's not specifically mentioned.

132
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,560
Sure, sure. Create that group.

133
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:11,850
We'd also like the first I heard my daughter mention racism being the major one that we didn't see on there.

134
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:15,720
That obviously plays into everything that's listed. Sure.

135
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:24,090
Anyone have an example about how the social determinants like specific social determinants help has impacted your life?

136
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:32,530
Some conversation. Go back. Yeah, I had an example.

137
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:38,290
It wasn't me directly, but okay. I was saying that the city of my high school was in was really small.

138
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:44,260
It was literally like one road and there was like a dollar store connected to like a kind of market.

139
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:49,240
But a lot of like the elderly individuals in the community had a really hard time getting up trees because they didn't

140
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:55,570
have like the transportation to drive like 20 minutes to the next city to go only minor one or something like that.

141
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,090
Okay. Thank you. So, food, desert? More or less.

142
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:07,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Kind of live in a food desert now, but I have a car.

143
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:15,870
I have a benefit of having a being able to afford a car. But I live in an area of town where there's no bus that goes remotely anywhere close to it.

144
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:25,530
And like, I could go to a farmstand, but they mostly carry like animal feed and supply and those kinds of things.

145
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,700
So. Yeah. Yeah. We also kind of talked about how there are,

146
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:36,569
there's like a bus that we can take to go to like Maya or something to get better food options that we only have so much time.

147
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:40,980
So it's like if we don't have a car, it's so much more difficult for us to get out of the car.

148
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,470
Who doesn't even when there is public transport available? Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

149
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:51,360
And especially if somebody is working like a packed schedule or they have two jobs, for example.

150
00:18:52,050 --> 00:19:01,470
And then in a lot of these neighborhoods, like what I've started doing now for myself is I get hellofresh because I don't like to go to the

151
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:07,799
grocery store and I also want to spend like the least amount of time feeding myself as possible.

152
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:14,430
But, you know, growing up as a kid, I used to have to eat those like banquet 99 cent meals would be when they were $0.99.

153
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:18,659
Right. So I know like that's not the best option for me,

154
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:24,750
but a lot of these like meal kit delivery things don't even deliver to certain like zip codes

155
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:30,210
or neighborhoods or states they might be outside of like the delivery service zone area.

156
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,190
So. Yeah, great point. Mm. Yes, Your Honor.

157
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:40,049
Yes. Like something else like that, like, ties into this conversation that we have.

158
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:47,770
Is that like, yes, there are resources on campus, like for, you know, there's the financial kind of aspect of eating healthier.

159
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:54,930
And yes, we have of these. But if for example, like last semester I was living on north campus but the food.

160
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:03,689
Years on TheStreet until it appears that times but that does not allow you to go out of your way to get those healthier options.

161
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,810
But you know. It's not like he's old.

162
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,490
Yeah, cause normally campus is, like, panda express and, like, there's, like, not much.

163
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. But even on Stage Street, like, some of the places are pretty pricey.

164
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,580
So, like, I saw that I think they're building like a either tender green or sweet green.

165
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:26,410
Those are like $15 salads, you know, or, you know,

166
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:34,090
just the cost of like fruits and vegetables or like it's like a like a juice, like a fresh pressed juice is so expensive.

167
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:41,739
So now, you know, they're trying to make healthy food more affordable through, like, urban farming.

168
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:50,950
And like they've done a ton of that in Detroit. But thinking about again addressing like the structural or systemic issues that have led to like,

169
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:55,299
you know, like a McDonald's being on every corner, like a liquor station.

170
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,400
So. Okay, great. Yes. Let's see.

171
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:07,410
Um, I just think that it goes under the transportation thing, but, um, when I worked under, when I worked at the hospital, um,

172
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,030
there was a lot of people that really had to be careful about,

173
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:18,220
like scheduling their appointments and things because public transportation area doesn't cross the county lines.

174
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,450
And so like they would need to go to a specialist,

175
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,389
but like they live in different counties and so they had to make sure they had support to take them and stuff.

176
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,900
A lot of people didn't have support. Some people.

177
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:37,810
Yeah, it was just kind of. Like what? People didn't have the support to take it.

178
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:46,969
Yeah. Yeah. And now they're trying to expand like broadband connection in these more rural areas so people can like engage in telemedicine.

179
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:54,630
But it's a question of whether the insurance company will bill it the same and what the cost is and all those kinds of things.

180
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:58,100
So thank you. All right, great.

181
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:07,280
So you all have heard about healthy people, 20, 21 healthy people, 2013, how we just got to keep going.

182
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:16,070
Right. So every decade they do update the priorities to try to increase, you know, public health efforts in this country,

183
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,010
specifically looking at determinants of health, disease,

184
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:25,340
disability opportunities aims to provide measurable goals at local, state and national levels.

185
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,880
You know, like I was very familiar with healthy people 2020 and now 2030.

186
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:39,499
So it's interesting to see what stays the same and what issues are now,

187
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:46,880
issues that weren't issues before and what issues are still unresolved into a satisfactory manner.

188
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,940
So if you look at healthy people 2030, they have a vast array of categories.

189
00:22:53,330 --> 00:23:00,890
But under reducing disparities, they do mention reducing disparities broadly,

190
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,089
but none are focused under anything within the realm of preparedness, immunization and infectious diseases.

191
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:13,580
So preparedness is its own category, and then they've lumped together immunization and infectious diseases.

192
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:21,889
So what might be the reason for this potentially other objectives are taking priority.

193
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,430
So, you know, I'd number one, in fact,

194
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:33,260
immunization and infectious disease goal one is to reduce or eliminate or maintain cases of vaccine preventable diseases,

195
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,670
because this has become a reemerging issue here in the United States.

196
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:46,610
Racism in infectious disease, preparedness, in emergency response, honestly might not be on your radar at all.

197
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:55,760
So healthy people 2030 comes from the Office of the Disease Prevention and Health Promotion,

198
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,580
which is under the Department of Health and Human Services.

199
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:08,929
So racism might not be on their radar at all like they might not even be at the point of trying to address disparities as a national goal.

200
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:16,430
Yet when it's like they can't even get people to baseline, get vaccinated, but that feeds that all feeds into each other, right?

201
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:22,819
So this is definitely an emerging topic that necessitates more research and momentum.

202
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:35,059
I cannot tell you how how much of a challenge it was for me creating this class and curating this class to find enough reading material from you,

203
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:42,860
from scholars and particularly scholars of color who address this area because it very much still is emerging.

204
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:53,030
You know, there are some things out there that, you know, say very basic things, but it's now coming more into the forefront since COVID.

205
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:57,860
But this is still definitely an under under-researched, under highlighted area.

206
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,810
So in infectious disease outbreaks, you know,

207
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:09,530
the through lines of infectious disease outbreaks and outcomes are all affected by social determinants of health,

208
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,120
racism, environmental justice policy, social justice and environmental factors.

209
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:20,210
So on Thursday, we'll talk more about E.J. and then in future classes, social justice.

210
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:28,850
But for now, how many of you have watched anything from the Unnatural Causes video series?

211
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:33,210
No. Okay. You might have, maybe.

212
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:38,120
Okay. This it looks super old, but it's from 2008.

213
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:47,689
But I feel like this is such a great series talking about social determinants of health and they have an episode on each.

214
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:55,040
So there's one really interesting one that I showed clips of my other class talking about Native American

215
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:00,260
and American Indians and how they've ended up in the health situation they have now in terms of like high,

216
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:07,810
high levels of type two, high prevalence of Type two diabetes and lack of proper nutrition.

217
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,330
So this one in particular is called Place Matters.

218
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:20,930
And this morning at 745, I thought they took it off and I just had a little like mini meltdown because I was like, this is like 30 minutes.

219
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,760
But thankfully the librarian answered me right away. It's like the video is still here.

220
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:33,710
It's just a different linking as I was like, Oh, okay, so yeah, it is 30 minutes and we will watch it at a normal pace.

221
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:42,430
Because I think 1.5 is too fast. I'll see about dimming the lights, but I'm worried that you might fall asleep, so we'll see.

222
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:48,250
Okay. Here we go. All right. The volume.

223
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,310
Louder and louder.

224
00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:02,670
If you lived here, you'd be 30% more likely to live in to old age than if you lived here.

225
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:16,070
If you lived in this neighborhood, your child would be six times more likely to be hospitalized for asthma than if you lived in this neighborhood.

226
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:29,000
Why is your street address and the place you live such a good predictor of your health place matters.

227
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,020
That's where someone works, where they go to school or where they live.

228
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:40,250
Because place determines what someone's exposed to in terms of a whole host of factors that can affect their health.

229
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:46,130
So place matters because it determines what kind of physical or chemical agents you might be exposed to.

230
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:53,330
It matters what kind of social environment you're exposed to. It matters if there's a lot of violence or crime in your neighborhood,

231
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:59,180
because it matters if it's easy to go for a walk in your neighborhood or find healthy foods for.

232
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,340
Who your neighbors are in the way you interact with your neighbors can also affect your health.

233
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,330
To replace ultimately as a critical determinants of health.

234
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:19,580
When we think about health, we usually think about health care and access to care and the quality of care.

235
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:27,410
But what research clearly shows is that health is embedded in the larger conditions in which we live and work.

236
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:33,620
So the quality of housing and the quality of neighborhood have dramatic effects on health.

237
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,760
How do we make an unhealthy neighborhood healthy?

238
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:53,020
Here are two neighborhoods working to find answers. One in Richmond, in Northern California, and another in Seattle, Washington.

239
00:29:53,740 --> 00:30:04,840
Two neighborhoods with similar problems. Today in High Point in West Seattle, there is quality low cost housing, clean parks,

240
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:12,670
safe streets, access to good food choices and sidewalks that allow lots of social interaction.

241
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:21,180
These features promote health in High Point, but they are not found in many low income neighborhoods.

242
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:35,050
There's a way of whaling in. McGuire, born at age 49, a refugee from Laos.

243
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:41,210
He moved to Richmond, California, in 1980. He works as a school janitor towards me.

244
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,370
But the ceremony for the Academy Awards will continue for the.

245
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:52,830
The, um. The heart is still weak. And I would find it hard to believe that you would be able to go back to work and work a full day right now.

246
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,640
So each time the heart beats, 15 or 20% of the blood is leaving the heart.

247
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,250
Normal is 60%. 60%. Yeah. So it's working about a third of a normal heart.

248
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,780
Um, two weeks ago, I suffered a major heart attack.

249
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,560
So it's a this is his first checkup since emergency surgery.

250
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,170
How long will it take? His cardiologist doesn't pull punches.

251
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:21,330
That's a really good question. I don't know. I mean, you had essentially almost died once.

252
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:27,510
A lot of it depends on how much stronger the heart gets over the next 3 to 6 months if it doesn't get stronger,

253
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,720
unfortunately, at risk of suddenly dropping.

254
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:38,970
Did you talk about heart stress matters, including the worry and were excited and honest that all those things can play a role.

255
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,170
Oh, okay.

256
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:49,200
The question is why would a young man like this present with such severe heart disease, weakened heart and a heart attack at such a young age?

257
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:55,920
Basic causes of this sort of disease that we. We ask questions about our smoking history.

258
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:02,820
He's not as tobacco user history of diabetes. He doesn't know history of diabetes, family history of heart problems at a young age.

259
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:08,160
No family history. And one has to wonder whether environmental factors play a role.

260
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,980
And Guy's environment.

261
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:21,990
Petrochemical companies released tons of pollutants each year, but these toxins may not be the worst environmental health threat here.

262
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,440
Tobacco, liquor and fast food are easy to find.

263
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,450
Fresh produce isn't, nor is quality housing.

264
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:40,700
Many public places are unsafe. It's a community that has an enormous number of problems.

265
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,930
So we see much higher rates of asthma, hospitalization.

266
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,490
We see much higher rates of diabetes or a lower life expectancy.

267
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,000
When most people think of the causes of chronic disease, for example, cardiovascular disease,

268
00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:02,670
they think of individual level risk factors, which we know about diet, physical activity, smoking.

269
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:06,180
However, it's also true that they are socially patterned.

270
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,290
And one of the dimensions across which it's patterned is by neighborhoods.

271
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:19,099
If we look at a map of almost any geographic area, but I'll just use the example of Richmond,

272
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:24,470
California, and you map up rates of obesity, for example.

273
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,400
Or of hypertension or of low birth weight.

274
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,560
We'll see that these things overlap almost exactly.

275
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:43,190
And if we overlay a map of environmental hazards, it fits in as well.

276
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,820
And it's very common to see all these dimensions cluster.

277
00:33:51,500 --> 00:34:00,020
And the cluster in Richmond. The city has higher rates of death from heart disease and cancer than most surrounding communities.

278
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,980
Children are hospitalized for asthma at twice the rate of other county neighborhoods.

279
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:12,360
And the risk of dying of diabetes is almost twice as high.

280
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:20,870
Sometimes we naively think of improving health by simply changing behaviors.

281
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:27,930
But the choices of individuals are often limited by the environments in which they live.

282
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:39,440
A friend of mine who worked in Richmond said that she's seen ten or 12 teenage girls now who have had gallbladder, their gallbladder removed.

283
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,790
If you eat a lot of fat in your diet, you can get gallbladder disease.

284
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:49,460
And it turned out they're eating virtually breakfast, lunch and dinner in fast food outlets.

285
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:53,420
And there were no farmer's markets. There were no greengrocers.

286
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,530
There was no Safeway or supermarket that was reachable by these kids.

287
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:04,400
And fast food is a bargain. You can get 1500 calories for a couple of bucks.

288
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:09,890
It's not a long term bargain, but it's a short term bargain. And people make that trade.

289
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,120
Even short term bargains can be few and far between.

290
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:23,889
So there are a lot of low skilled labor around here. Those hot men right here, over 50%.

291
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:28,990
People pay more than 30% of their income toward housing costs.

292
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:33,970
So if you pay more than 30% of your income and you are not in a good situation.

293
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,940
And it's not just housing.

294
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:48,260
According to a Brookings Institution report, buying a car in a low income neighborhood costs as much as $500 more than in an affluent community.

295
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,370
Cashing a check add up to 10% more.

296
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,320
Furniture, appliances and even groceries are more expensive.

297
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:04,670
Researchers call this the poverty tax. Until last year, I worked two jobs.

298
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:10,460
I went to a doctor before. My daughter used to say, like, Mom, stop.

299
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:15,050
She says she doesn't want to see her mom or dad like that.

300
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,880
Now I practice. We have patients like Y who come in very sick.

301
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,170
We patch them up, we save their lives and send them out back to the same environment.

302
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,430
Calcium. Potassium. I could take it for.

303
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,319
I think we sometimes forget that people who live in more well-off communities have

304
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,890
a lot of advantages because they do have a lot of the environmental support.

305
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:46,210
But. Well, why are these neighborhoods so different?

306
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:51,000
And of course, these differences are not a natural thing.

307
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:57,569
They arise as a result of policies or the absence of policies that create these

308
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:01,500
enormous spatial inequalities in resources and in the environments that people live.

309
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:15,330
60 years ago, Richmond was a boomtown. Here was assembled one of the nation's largest industrial army.

310
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:20,880
During World War two, the Kaiser Shipyards in Richmond ran 24 hours a day.

311
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:27,480
The war effort drew workers of all ethnicities to Richmond.

312
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:36,920
When the war ended, new governmental policies brought sweeping changes to communities like Richmond.

313
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:41,450
As the shipyards closed, thousands of jobs left.

314
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:50,210
So did anyone who could. But only white families could get the new government backed mortgages to buy homes in the new suburbs.

315
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:59,770
Richmond's population fell by a third. We had vast public investments in building the suburbs of America.

316
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:04,680
Federally supported loans, FHA loans went to people who were moving to the suburbs.

317
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:10,710
And for many years, up until the sixties, those loans were available in a racially restricted basis.

318
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,570
African-Americans and other people of color didn't have access to them.

319
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:29,880
Until 1962, out of $120 billion in government backed home loans, less than 2% went to nonwhite households in Northern California.

320
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:39,270
Between the war in 1960 of 350,000 federally guaranteed new home loans, less than 100 went to black families.

321
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:47,540
In cities like Richmond, African-Americans were left behind in increasingly neglected neighborhoods.

322
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:57,210
In the 1980s, poor Latino and Southeast Asian immigrants began joining them in these same neighborhoods.

323
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,459
Once the community starts to go downhill, nobody wants to actually invest in the community.

324
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,520
So the banks don't want to come in and the shops don't want to come in.

325
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,530
Then you don't have a commercial base, you don't have the community taxes that can then feed back into the schools.

326
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:15,599
Now you don't have good schools, so families don't want to move into the community if they don't have to because you don't have

327
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:20,550
good schools and you get a sort of vicious cycle of everybody who can will leave the community.

328
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,730
This isn't something that happens overnight and it isn't the fault of the people who live there.

329
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:32,970
The people who live in low income disinvested communities did not do this to themselves.

330
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:44,000
20 years before his heart attack, I tried to move his family out of Richmond, but 11 months later they had to move back.

331
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,450
I can't find my cab up there and she can't find her job up there and move back.

332
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:57,220
My older son, you know, hang around with the wrong group and use some kind of drug.

333
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,700
I just don't know what to do. I tried to help him.

334
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,120
I tried to straight him out, spend a lot of money on people.

335
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,419
A lot of money. That's what in my mind all the time.

336
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:14,360
Such worry, his worry, worry when I'm here, when I'm going to pay up all of this and how I'm going to do it.

337
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,240
No, no, no, no. Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

338
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:30,860
And they get dispirited to him. No matter if you think about when you're worried here, you're always a little bit more activated.

339
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:34,430
There's a little bit more vigilance. You're sort of checking things out a little bit more carefully.

340
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:41,060
And if you can imagine that happening day after day, all day, every day, it's exhausting.

341
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,520
And it wears on the body system.

342
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:55,010
When stress is chronic, when we're endlessly worried about our bills, our job, our children's safety, the body pumps out cortisol and adrenaline.

343
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:04,730
But too much of these stress hormones over time can increase arterial plaque, raise blood pressure,

344
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:12,440
and weaken our immune system, increasing our risk for almost every chronic disease, including heart disease.

345
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:21,629
The leading killer in America. We've done studies that have shown that living in disadvantaged neighborhoods is related to

346
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:26,790
an increased risk because about 50 to 80% increase in risk of developing heart disease.

347
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:31,390
And this has been replicated in other studies. Right.

348
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:35,250
In our society today, everybody experiences stress.

349
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:44,820
However, in many disadvantaged communities, what we have is the accumulation of multiple negative stressors.

350
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:49,620
And it's so many of them. It's as if someone has been hit from every single side.

351
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:52,860
And it's not only that they're dealing with a lot of stress.

352
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:59,320
They have few resources to cope. You know, our strategy is work together.

353
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,650
Where we live is like you as leader.

354
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:11,420
The health challenges of low income Laotians, Vietnamese and Cambodians are often masked when they're lumped together as Asian Americans.

355
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,790
We are talking about justice white guys.

356
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:21,360
Cousin Tom Norm Pursuit organizes his community to address local health and environmental problems.

357
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:28,230
Joining forces with other activists in Richmond and Richmond is a very diverse community,

358
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:35,820
and there is a very rich and historical network of community agencies and community organizations.

359
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,220
That's been enhanced by the new waves of immigrants who brought and developed their own community agencies to address health problems.

360
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:51,930
One of the greatest health challenges to the community and its children is exposure to violence.

361
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,170
In 2005, Richmond had one of the highest murder rates in the United States.

362
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:05,880
Somebody just came in, knock at the door. She came out. She said, Host Dad, Dad.

363
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,370
I said, I don't know. Just don't open the door. And then I heard you sound like the knock again.

364
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:16,110
And I ran back. It wasn't. It was a nap. They already sued her.

365
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:22,620
Then we're not the nanny.

366
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:29,110
Look, Uncle, you're not very good contender.

367
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:38,110
Yeah. Yeah. Gua and no one's daughter.

368
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:44,230
Chan was a successful student who became the mistaken target of a Southeast Asian drug gang.

369
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:50,990
The specter of community violence has completely transformed the way that people live in certain neighborhoods.

370
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:56,780
So it's a public health issue, not only for the prevention of a premature death through homicide,

371
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:01,610
but for the ripple effects it has on the other things that contribute to people's poor health,

372
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:05,510
the ability of people to go out, to go shopping, to live a normal life.

373
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:15,380
In fact, research now suggests that some adult health problems may be traced to living with violence as a child.

374
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,659
The impact of that stress,

375
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:27,380
the impact of that exposure to violence triggers physiological responses in a child and can actually be disruptive to the developing brain and

376
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:35,870
developing immune system such that you are primed then could be more vulnerable to physical and mental health problems all through your life.

377
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:43,740
When I'm outside, I hear gunshots and they're by the school and I also hear some gunshot to death.

378
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:49,820
We work with the kids in Richmond, and many of those kids didn't think they would live beyond the age of 20.

379
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,120
So we proposed to do a study on hope,

380
00:44:53,210 --> 00:45:02,660
trying to show kids that they can work their life around so that they do have a future and take a photo to write about the program that resulted.

381
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:11,960
Youth Empowerment Strategies or yes helps youth develop a sense of hope by showing them at an early age how by their actions,

382
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:16,190
they can work together to create positive change in their community.

383
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:22,759
This program is five and we came up with the project Hope it impacts health because then you don't

384
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:28,100
internalize a lot of the behaviors about feeling hopeless and feeling alienated from society.

385
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:33,860
What it is that you do is you feel proactive and you realize that that you have a say in how things can be,

386
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:36,560
and so you engage in making things be that way.

387
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:44,450
It's why control over our environment gives us reason to be hopeful, and hope is an often overlooked factor for good health.

388
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:48,860
But how might a neighborhood's residents gain that control?

389
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:54,540
800 miles north in Seattle, Washington, at High Point.

390
00:45:54,990 --> 00:46:00,690
Public health and housing agencies and developers took a radical approach to give

391
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:05,300
one neighborhood some of the health advantages found in wealthier communities.

392
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:10,240
60 years ago. High Point was a lot like Richmond.

393
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,890
It began in the forties as housing for temporary defense workers.

394
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,600
By the 1990s, high point housing had deteriorated.

395
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:30,630
These are built for temporary housing. We told the neighborhood they only be here a few years and they're still here.

396
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:40,230
60 years later, I moved an apartment here on the end, and Graham here is right there behind that little tree.

397
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:47,909
I felt anxious, you know, because bullets were flying and, you know,

398
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:57,390
you did not know when that was going to happen or what the consequences would be if it was unsafe outside.

399
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:02,070
It was unhealthy inside. Asthma was endemic.

400
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:08,219
This is one of the old units. It's a pretty nasty looking one.

401
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,900
The family has just moved out of here, though, into one of the new units.

402
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:23,340
There's the leaking off the windows that over the years lets the plaster board smoke and mold will form all along there, as you can see here.

403
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:27,000
They didn't just have a mold problem, but with the moisture,

404
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:36,960
you get more dust mites that are common and asthma trigger a lot of mold growth under there and nice places for the roaches to live and thrive.

405
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:43,170
Not a healthy home in the old high point.

406
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:47,250
One out of nine. One out of ten households were affected by asthma.

407
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:52,000
Pretty much everybody knew somebody who had asthma in the community. So almost like it was normal asthma.

408
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:01,400
It was so commonplace. It was normal. By 1997, it was clear to the city and residents that it was time to make a change.

409
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:06,979
There was a community here, even though this was a rough, dangerous neighborhood,

410
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:12,470
there was still a community here and people living in communities actually know what they want.

411
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:19,490
They wanted the kind of healthy living conditions that wealthier neighborhoods usually take for granted.

412
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:30,800
Working with Seattle Housing Authority and the Public Health Department, the community won federal grants to rebuild High Point.

413
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:42,770
Seattle Housing Authority worked really hard to invite communities to the table and share in the design and access to power and low income people.

414
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:47,690
They're used to not having power so they don't know they even can have power.

415
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:58,280
What emerged from the design process was a new mixed income community with health as its focus, plastic and crime.

416
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,950
We sold nine of them on Saturday. Oh, that's amazing.

417
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,570
Our hope is that the high point community now be integrated with the rest of the surrounding

418
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:12,680
neighborhood and making use of people to walk to stores or parks in the neighborhood as a whole.

419
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:18,550
There is a new clinic that's been built here, a new public library that's been built here.

420
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:22,300
So those services will be available right on site to residents as well.

421
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:29,620
And then there'll be a community center that will have all sorts of other services, such as employment services and child care and the like.

422
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:37,270
The new High Point has community gardens where gardeners can sell their organic produce to neighbors.

423
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:43,780
Another factor that we know promotes health is for people to be socially connected and

424
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:48,670
having a lot of spaces that promote social interaction was a conscious design element here.

425
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:59,260
One health problem community developers were determined to take on was asthma nationwide.

426
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:06,730
The cost of asthma in health care and lost school and work days is staggering $20 billion every year.

427
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:16,260
Low income neighborhoods are the most affected. Four year old Stephen Truong has asthma.

428
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:22,670
At nighttime, he sleep and then throwing up and then to heart for him.

429
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,910
Bridge. Yeah.

430
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:36,130
I just bringing go to Children's Hospital in the middle of the night that time I cannot go to and stay on to take care of him over a year's time.

431
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:44,070
We found our children were spending up to 3000 to $5000 on repeated emergency room visits.

432
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,770
That's emergency room treatment each year for just one child.

433
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:51,630
Doing different now.

434
00:50:51,870 --> 00:51:01,320
Benita Blake, a high point activist who came up with the idea to build some of the new homes with a range of special features for people with asthma.

435
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:11,040
The ventilation system is meant to bring in fresh air from the outside, even small particles that might be bad for your health,

436
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:16,600
such as diesel particulate it pollens in the case of an asthmatic will be filtered out.

437
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:20,850
So the air inside the home is actually healthier than the air outside.

438
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:26,130
Stevens family moved into a breathe easy unit five months ago.

439
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:30,270
Yeah, we are healthy.

440
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:35,030
I am now but one grandma. And now?

441
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,060
Enough. Now, without enough I am.

442
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:42,880
I know. Looking at the outcome, but nothing of note.

443
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:46,590
All right. Breathe easy.

444
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:49,770
Homes cost about $6,000 extra to build.

445
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:55,950
That's less than two years of emergency room services for a child like Stephen.

446
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:02,700
But these kinds of health innovations rarely come from private developers working alone.

447
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:10,830
We get it. And the Federal Hope six program that provided financing to build the new high point is being phased out.

448
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:19,270
Market driven forces are not going to build healthy homes for low income communities.

449
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:29,620
That's only going to come from policymakers who recognize the societal benefits to having healthy communities like this one.

450
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:40,090
But not everyone benefited. Some residents who were supposed to be temporarily displaced to build this mixed income community never came back.

451
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:46,600
And rebuilding a neighborhood from the bottom up isn't possible or desirable everywhere.

452
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,260
The real issue is who gets to make these decisions?

453
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:58,020
The major health problems in a community like Richmond are extremely complicated and they're screamingly deep.

454
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,410
And it requires a whole spectrum of strategies,

455
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:12,390
everything from educating individuals to mobilizing communities and neighborhoods to building coalitions or to changing public policy.

456
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:21,540
The first thing we need to do is acknowledge that where you live impacts your health and that the environment in the community,

457
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:23,310
the social environment,

458
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:29,820
the physical environment and the economic environment together determine whether or not we're going to have a healthy existence.

459
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,950
What that means is the housing policies, health policy.

460
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:41,430
Educational policy is health policy. Anti-Violence policy is health policy.

461
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:45,000
Neighborhood improvement policies are health policies.

462
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:55,610
Everything that we can do to improve the quality of life of individuals in our society has an impact on their health and is a health policy.

463
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:10,170
I found a way to see.

464
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:19,360
All right. Okay, great.

465
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:35,550
So just a reflection maybe either jot down or like typed out really just 1 to 2 reactions or thoughts you have based on that video.

466
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:26,410
Would anyone like to share? I call on people who think this is actually a hard hitting reality of how

467
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:34,000
things that are not even in your control does have a huge impact in your life.

468
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:38,330
Yeah. Was it disheartening?

469
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:43,790
Very. Okay. Okay. And I thought her reactions.

470
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:50,920
I mean, I just thought it was, you know, when they showed the clip of the, um,

471
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:57,980
how cheap fast food is and how the cash used to get like a cash loan, you have to pay so much more.

472
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:01,920
The card is like $500 more in the low income neighborhood.

473
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:08,040
I feel like there's so many ways we, like, exploit the poor, like the poor, like, you know, totally burdened.

474
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:15,700
But you also like there's so many systems set up to exploit people and and the fact that people are making money off of that, right.

475
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:23,850
Yeah. That's I just wonder like. Yeah, it feels like there's it's just like an economic issue.

476
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,840
How do you how do you create these? Yeah, I don't just.

477
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:33,499
You bring me incomplete thought? No, no, no. The money could be read a very.

478
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:38,500
I think of you who is making that money, you know. Oh, someone's thinking that somebody is right.

479
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:46,730
And like, if that money went into, like, a public health department to, I don't know, fund a bunch of projects like this.

480
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:51,260
Yeah. The person making that money probably doesn't want to use it for that cause.

481
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:55,190
So there have to be some, like, policies or, like,

482
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:04,970
laws or restrictions in place that do not allow this kind of like poverty, tax or gouging, so to speak, to be implemented.

483
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:18,110
Right. I think that's reactions. Ian, I saw you get out your pad.

484
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:27,380
Well, I think we were like, how? How do we change the policies that are in place?

485
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:31,370
Because it just feels like we just constantly hear, Oh, you got to get out and vote.

486
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:36,710
And then it feels like nothing changes and it just continues the cycle.

487
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:42,220
Mm hmm. Um, mira, I feel like it's difficult.

488
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:47,950
It's a little bit disheartening with. With voting stuff, even, you know, they make it so difficult to vote.

489
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,370
There's all that disenfranchisement.

490
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:57,140
And so, like, you know, voting people in that will protect your rights is the best way, the most the biggest way you can make a significant impact.

491
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:02,270
But, you know, like with all the elections and stuff, your vote is sometimes doesn't even actually matter.

492
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,589
So I feel like that's difficult.

493
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:08,030
And also like when they're talking about like, oh, we're going to actually phase out these programs that are helping the gays.

494
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:12,950
And, you know, that I think is very frustrating. So I would like to hear about, like, what they're doing instead.

495
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:17,180
Hmm. Abby.

496
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:21,310
I saw you reading something. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I.

497
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:30,850
I got the concept that they were trying to emphasize, like, health policy and all kind of decision making.

498
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:37,969
It's something that, like, I feel like even just coming into the program, reading about that, the fact that they're like, you know,

499
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:46,760
kind of thinking about this in terms of like everything is a health policy issue is kind of was kind of shocking because I had no idea that like,

500
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:53,059
oh, it's like I'm like, oh, this is new and recent. And it wasn't because smart people are thinking about it.

501
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:58,220
And, you know, then, um, which doesn't seem that long ago, but also trying to do something.

502
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:04,249
Yeah. Yeah. But yeah. So it's just kind of like this idea of like, oh, like about health policy.

503
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:08,570
You know, decision making is kind of an interesting concept.

504
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:15,469
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. I will say that in this school in particular,

505
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:23,480
the health policy department is mostly focused on health care policy like in-hospital administration and those kinds of things,

506
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,730
rather than, I would say, greater federal policy.

507
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:39,500
You might take a class at CS related to like environmental policy and things like that, but it is it is a difficult, you know, huge thing to tackle.

508
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:43,370
And like I said, I only started this class like you will learn things in this class,

509
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:49,280
but you'll probably walk away with some more questions than you actually had answers to.

510
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:56,390
And it is super disheartening, like with the disenfranchisement, the gerrymandering, and sometimes depending on where you live,

511
00:59:56,390 --> 01:00:00,080
if you feel like your vote may not count in a state like Michigan,

512
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:07,099
your vote absolutely does matter of in in what we call like a swing state like Michigan.

513
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:13,430
I, I just got my absentee ballot on Saturday and I filled it out immediately and put it back in the mail.

514
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:23,209
Right. I think one thing in particular that feels disheartening, though, like like in the video, they said that, you know, these communities,

515
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:31,820
often they're surprised when they get a chance to participate or they get to have a chance to have a voice, because that doesn't happen very often.

516
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:39,020
And so I think one of the things I know this sounds like kind of dull, but it's like people oftentimes want change,

517
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:44,299
but they're not willing to put themselves out there into the community organizing or to

518
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:54,570
get involved or even like inject their voice or practice how your your right to vote,

519
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:58,129
not civics is the right word, but, you know, the right to vote.

520
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:04,940
The right is your citizen. And a lot of times a lot of people like to complain more than they do.

521
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:11,900
But some people in these situations, they may not even fully understand like what their full capacity is to do that.

522
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:17,990
So, yeah, just some some food for thought. This is a, I think a great video series.

523
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:24,320
For some reason they took that down the entire series. But there's a, there's a, um, because they have to pay subscriptions to it.

524
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:30,800
So there's one that's really good. Like I said, it's called. Bad sugar.

525
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:35,959
And the American Indians and Native Americans reservations.

526
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,530
And then the run on maternal child health and so on. A couple other things.

527
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:44,430
I'm surprised most of your second year and you've never been shown this video series before.

528
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:49,840
Okay. That's kind of class early.

529
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:54,979
That's kind of all that I had for today because I want to pick up on E!

530
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:58,340
J for next week before we leave.

531
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:04,310
Adjourn. Do I have any questions or concerns or comments?

532
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:14,250
Okay. I know it's still it's still pretty early in the semester and you haven't turned in that many things yet.

533
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:18,030
So if you're looking at your grade and you're like, Oh, I'm worried about my grade,

534
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:23,309
there's still lots of points up for grabs and your assignments are weighted.

535
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:28,230
So I will see that. Okay. I will see you all on Thursday.

536
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:31,800
And then when we finish early, we'll do a little mid-term review.

537
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:32,760
All right.
