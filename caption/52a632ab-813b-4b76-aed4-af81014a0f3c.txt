1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,260
You take what I wanted to hundred singles?

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,020
I was like, Oh, like right there.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:21,600
You know, everybody grab your stuff.

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,200
Welcome to genealogy. 516.

5
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,460
No, it's not the genealogy, but we're in the right place at the time.

6
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,910
I'm Scott. I'm going to be in February this semester.

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:49,320
I've been working in Jen Smith, Dr. Jen Smith and Sharon Cardenas Genetics Lab for probably six or so years now.

8
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,540
And I talked with Dr. Smith last few years.

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,960
He's not medical now, son. Taken over for the semester.

10
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,310
Um, I think we'll have a good semester.

11
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:15,600
So basically the idea here is to learn genetics as it's related to epidemiology.

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,680
We're going to cover a broad range of topics, including, you know, the biology,

13
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:31,890
as well as things like language, disequilibrium, gene by gene interactions, you might environment interaction.

14
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,380
We are going to have an emphasis to some extent on analysis as well.

15
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:48,790
So there's going to be a lab portion of the course. So if you go to the campus page, you'll find the syllabus here.

16
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:58,600
I'd like to go over that a little bit first. So obviously we're meeting from 3 to 5 on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

17
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:09,670
We'll be in this room 12 days. You can find my office if you need to find me on the second floor of this building.

18
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,630
Just upstairs through the glass doors in the C-suite.

19
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:23,170
That's where I. I'm going to just have office hours by appointment, so please feel free to reach out.

20
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,860
If you want to see me, I'm usually available whenever we can.

21
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,880
Also probably do Zoom calls if you want as well,

22
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:40,310
but I'll probably be here all day Tuesdays and Thursdays so you can drop in if you want or just let me know when you want to meet.

23
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:46,480
Good. Yeah.

24
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,350
So we're going to cover quite a lot in this course, as I mentioned already.

25
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,040
There's not really a specific book or anything for the course.

26
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:11,230
There is some kind of a modified textbook. Now we have chapters for and will be posted on campus that are posted on campus.

27
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,550
So those are going to kind of be your primary reading material.

28
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,010
There's also going to be some some other articles and things that are assigned as well.

29
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,240
But for the most part, everything's going to be on campus. You. Because of that lab portion.

30
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,910
There is also going to be some software that you may want to use yet.

31
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:44,750
We are generally going to use virtual slides, however, for that all the programs that we use are on virtual sites.

32
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:53,120
Anybody familiar with virtual sites? We all used to be for some of you have somebody on set.

33
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:05,870
It's fine. It's just kind of a way to basically remote desktop into a campus computer and you can use any of the programs that are on there.

34
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,360
So it's nice and convenient. They've changed it a little bit recently.

35
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:19,220
So hopefully it will still work as we intended to, but it looks like it's maybe even easier than it has been previously.

36
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:30,260
You can just you can download a remote desktop app basically on your on your laptops and log in through that.

37
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,580
And from there it'll open up a window with all the available software that you can use.

38
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:40,160
You can actually run it straight from that window as if it were on your your local machine.

39
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,800
It's pretty, pretty convincing. I mean,

40
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:53,750
in a nice we're going to use primarily plink which is an open source told you know my analysis tools that there is a website there

41
00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:03,230
you can check out which will get a lot of instruction and and some of the some of the functions that you can use for that software.

42
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,600
We'll also use happily Vue,

43
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:16,070
which it does integrate with Blink and we'll do kind of a lot of the at least language and disequilibrium analysis that we'll do.

44
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:27,620
We'll use genome wide, complex trade analysis or GK, and we'll probably use a little bit of our as well.

45
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:39,110
So all these softwares are free for you if you want to try to download them, but they'll always be on virtual sites as well.

46
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:45,740
We'll talk about that more as we get closer to the lab times.

47
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,810
You are supposed to be prerequisites for this course,

48
00:05:52,250 --> 00:06:01,550
but generally hopefully you have some background in genetics, preferably some college level course in genetics.

49
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,370
If not, you may have had other biology that relates to genetics and so on.

50
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,970
So that might be sufficient. If you have any questions about that.

51
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,700
You can let me know and I'll try to help you out and see if it's right for you.

52
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:27,350
But for the most part, if you've had some genetics, you'll be okay. It would also be nice if you had a little, little bit of background epidemiology,

53
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,330
but you won't need anything more than anything more than basic stuff.

54
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:47,690
Some of the course goals really develop familiar science, familiarize you with the vocabulary, some of the analog methods,

55
00:06:48,860 --> 00:07:03,379
some of the challenges of of epidemiology and kind of trying to get you to understand those methods that are used in

56
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:15,110
the analysis of genetic data as well as interactions and Mendelian randomization and various other omics analysis.

57
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:34,650
Yeah. So we'll get on here to the the grading portion is going to be 500 total points in the course, 300 of which are exams 100 points each.

58
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:43,920
The first two will be in class exams and the third one will be a take home those in-class exams.

59
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,330
You'll be allowed like a sheet of notes.

60
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:54,630
Next sheet of notes if you want, and you should always bring your calculator and things like that to the class.

61
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,150
There's also going to be problem sets. These are just homework problems.

62
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:09,990
Six of those or 20 points each. And there's also going to be seven labs as well where ten points each.

63
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:21,150
These are graded in a way that are meant to be a little lenient and nicer for both you and me.

64
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:31,860
Grading them, basically, if you do it all and you get most of it right with only minor errors, you're going to get all the points.

65
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:39,190
And if you complete it but have lots of errors, you're like 80% still.

66
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:50,820
Okay. So it's it's graded a lot on completion, but also basically tiers of how well you've you've done there.

67
00:08:51,900 --> 00:09:00,299
And it's going to spread both the problem sets and the labs and make sense of these problems.

68
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,320
That's in labs I will encourage you to work together on.

69
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,390
You're welcome to do those in groups of up to three students.

70
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,689
It is, I think,

71
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:23,760
better to at least have one other person that you're working with so you can bounce ideas off them and it just makes it simpler for everybody.

72
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:29,130
And I think it's helps improve your skills at working together as well.

73
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:42,419
I'm going to encourage that. Those will be turned in on campus as well.

74
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,559
So they'll be posted on there. There'll be word documents.

75
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,660
You can type right into them and upload them to come to campus as an assignment.

76
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,360
All right, uh, let's see.

77
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:04,170
I mentioned the assigned readings. This is kind of a modified textbook.

78
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:18,090
I come from, um. Burns advisor at is a is an emeritus instructor here at UVM.

79
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,270
And together they, they developed this textbook. It hasn't really been published yet.

80
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,300
They're still working on that, I guess, but we have permission from them to use it for this course.

81
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:44,680
All the PowerPoints and handouts will be on canvas. Attendance is certainly going to be highly encourage,

82
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:53,200
especially since I will give you time in class to work on the labs and and as much as I can for the problem settings as well.

83
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,730
So you should show up here every day. Just be here for labs.

84
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:09,340
You should bring your computers. You have them, your laptops to class with you, especially on those labs.

85
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:20,560
And yes, since we are going to be using all that software, it's going to be important to have some some way to use them.

86
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,350
Is there anybody who doesn't have a laptop or can bring one to class?

87
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:37,060
Everybody has some some way to do that. That's great for us to be working together, too.

88
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:44,060
So if one of one of you forget it, you can always work together with another person who has has a laptop with them that day.

89
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:53,470
Right. And as can I say here.

90
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:02,760
You certainly take academic integrity and student wellness and diversity and equity inclusion.

91
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:10,140
We take all these things seriously. And once you understand that and if you have any concerns, please let me know.

92
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:19,800
Read through that on your own. At the end of the syllabus here, we had the course schedule, at least the tentative course schedule.

93
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:31,560
And in this kind of table here, we'll have the dates of each class, the topics that day, and any assignments that are going to be due at that time.

94
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:39,360
So you will see here there's some some articles that you could optionally read.

95
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,880
Some of these grayed out ones are optional, your extra material for you if you want to look through those.

96
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:58,560
We'll also have readings like this is that brings in Pizer text and I'm sure earlier I want to read chapters one and two of that for next class.

97
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:10,060
That makes sense. You can see also when assignments will be posted and when you do all these folding once there are due dates.

98
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:26,320
Okay, so next time I'll post next Tuesday I'll post from set one, which will be due here Thursday 19th at the beginning of class.

99
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:39,920
Is it clear this whole table is also on the front page of a canvas activity here?

100
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:51,370
It's down here and in a similar format. And on canvas you'll have links to all the PowerPoints and the actual articles and the problem sets and so on.

101
00:13:53,450 --> 00:14:05,080
Okay. As you can see from this, it's pretty busy at the beginning of the course.

102
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,560
There's a lot of stuff to kind of give you the background for at the beginning.

103
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:19,600
So so that's just kind of the way it has to be worked out of necessity.

104
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,000
But we'll get through it and then it'll kind of slow down a little bit towards the end.

105
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,620
Yeah. Well, I have various guest lectures throughout the course as well, so you'll see those on here.

106
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:48,180
The first one is on the 24th when, uh, Jessica fall from, from the Institute for Social Research.

107
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,379
She's an expert on genetic data collection.

108
00:14:52,380 --> 00:15:06,090
She's one of the one of the people who runs the Health and Retirement Study, which is a very large, excellent, excellent study run out of I'm sorry.

109
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,650
So we'll have various ones of those. And you can see the labs are also posted on there and so on.

110
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:20,050
So the first lab will do is on the 19th. Okay.

111
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:25,210
We'll talk a little bit more about virtual sites next time to make sure you can get on there.

112
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,380
Any questions for me right now? Yes.

113
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,750
Yeah. I have a question of what is the lab about?

114
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,840
Like just using software. Yeah.

115
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,920
Yeah, it's going to be using software related to genetic analysis.

116
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,490
Oh, God. It's exactly right.

117
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:58,920
Most of those were going to be using planes. So that's the main one that you'll want to to get that being said.

118
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:07,580
I encourage virtual sites because it's it's easy and I know how it works.

119
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:13,610
You can use. You're certainly welcome to try to download all those softwares on your own laptop.

120
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:21,140
Most people are able to get that to work. But the issue is that sometimes if you do have an issue,

121
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:29,540
every computer is different and it can be hard for me to troubleshoot sometimes, especially you Mac users.

122
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:38,420
I'm not as familiar with that. So if you have a mac, that might be trickier for me, but certainly you can you can give that a go.

123
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:47,390
You're savvy with your own computer. You should be able to figure it out. I think we have two questions.

124
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:59,720
All right. A couple other points here on the campus site.

125
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,760
You'll find all the assignments and the assignments. Damn, you won't be available until a certain time.

126
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:17,630
And you when they are available, you'll notice that there's solutions on there.

127
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,620
But those won't be available for you until after the due date.

128
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:31,400
So you're aware of that as well. As I mentioned, I'm going to encourage you to work in groups in the People tab.

129
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:40,550
If you go to the private groups here, you should be able to go in there and assign yourself to a group.

130
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,079
Okay. I think it's hard for me to tell exactly what you can see,

131
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,909
but I think you should be able to see something like this where you'll you can

132
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,870
find your name over here and then you can drag yourself into a group like so.

133
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:06,440
Okay. So feel free to do that. I'd like you to do that at some point before you start working on the first assignment together.

134
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:18,890
Okay. Probably if you can check that out and try to do that next Tuesday or something and we can work it up to three.

135
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,430
If you do want to work by yourself, that's okay. And I encourage you to work with others.

136
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:28,560
But if you want to work by yourself, still put yourself into a group, just a singular group by yourself.

137
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,280
The way the assignments work is they're going to be created by group.

138
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,250
So that means when you're working together, only one of you has to turn it in.

139
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:47,440
And when I grade it you'll get the same grade for that. And what you need to be put into one of these groups that you work towards.

140
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,000
And so at some point put yourself in a group here.

141
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:02,220
Right. There's also a forgot to mention.

142
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,140
There is an integrity affidavit.

143
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,610
So this actually is worth like ten points of your your grade.

144
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,980
So I'd like you to do that sometime before the first assignment as well. Just go in here.

145
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:26,970
It's going to look like a quiz, but it's essentially just kind of outlines expectations and it's about integrity.

146
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,560
So you can just click through and submit. You get some points there for that.

147
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,390
Okay. That's something else I'd like you to do before next class.

148
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:45,930
Again, I'm good, right?

149
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,750
Yes. Going back a little bit, you said something about what the problems are going to look like.

150
00:19:53,490 --> 00:20:04,650
Yes. The problems that will be essentially related to the lectures and the readings.

151
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:18,120
And they'll just be kind of short answer questions about the material and they'll all be in a word, document that you can upload and type right into.

152
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,080
Okay. And then that first one will be released on Tuesday.

153
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:34,080
But I guess I could. Sure you kind of preview year.

154
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:43,690
You know, it'll just be a word document you'll have, you know, basically word problems, workout sense.

155
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,990
All right. Anything else?

156
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:04,520
Well, in that case, we'll probably start more material here.

157
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:30,090
The other thing I guess that I'd like to mention is it is kind of a long class and I will make sure we take a break some point in the middle.

158
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:37,800
So I'll do a little bit of lecture and and we'll take a break and we'll finish up some good.

159
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,610
Please feel free to stop me at any time you have some question about about the material.

160
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:54,090
All right. So first, when we're talking about epidemiology,

161
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:02,250
really referring to the pattern of disease or the how they relate to health and human

162
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:10,590
populations and the determinants that go along with those patterns of disease,

163
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:18,300
which are really just risk factors, which could include physical measures or biological measures, including genetics.

164
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:24,390
It could be social, cultural or behavioral or any combination of those.

165
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:34,800
And the really the main goal there is to look for associations between these risk factors and disease.

166
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:47,520
When we're talking about genetic epidemiology, we're focused more on those genetic determinants and not just the genetics,

167
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,450
but also how they interact with the environment.

168
00:22:54,330 --> 00:23:00,330
And so this underlies the differences in disease, acceptability, physiology,

169
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:07,080
and also how how it responds to our response and how it responds to drug treatments.

170
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:15,540
So we're really focused not just on genetics, but also that interface between genetics and the environment.

171
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,290
And the ultimate goal here is, is disease prevention.

172
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:33,210
But certainly there's other goals like early detection and, you know, kind of quantifying risk as well.

173
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:42,630
The actual field. The genetic epidemiology has really grown tremendously in recent times.

174
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:54,990
It's really a pretty new field. Probably 70 years is all it's been around and last ten or 20 years have really been very expansive.

175
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,610
So really due to a lot of things,

176
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:10,139
but mostly computing power from the biotechnology that's that's involved with it as well as some of the data set structures.

177
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:23,580
So we have a lot of new biobanks, which are huge datasets which combine genetic information with another phenotypes or other characteristics.

178
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:32,550
I mentioned that that term phenotype, this is something that's going to come up a lot in this class.

179
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:40,200
And it's really just any observed characteristic that's not genetic in nature, really.

180
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:48,390
So we in in this field, we have genotypes which are the genetic characteristics and basically anything else you phenotype.

181
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:57,720
And that could be, you know, it could be a measurable thing like height, weight.

182
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,230
It could be a behavior like smoking.

183
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:05,000
Could be really anything. And.

184
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:14,700
If you're interested in an actual definition? Well, it's a science which deals with the ideology,

185
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,230
distribution and control of disease related phenotypes in groups of relatives

186
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,730
and with inherited causes of disease related phenotypes in human populations.

187
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:29,760
When we refer to populations, it's a pretty loose term in this context.

188
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:37,300
And we we generally just mean any group of people that are reading together.

189
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:48,060
So this might be the entire human population, but it could also mean, you know, people in the United States.

190
00:25:49,150 --> 00:26:04,140
And there's definitely a focus on family for obvious reasons, mainly that, you know,

191
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,430
genetics is your molecules that are actually passed down from parents offspring.

192
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,360
So obviously, family is going to be very important in this field.

193
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,450
When we talk about familial traits,

194
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:30,390
those are just traits that are more common in relatives of an infected individual and those in the general population.

195
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:35,040
So this isn't necessarily due to genetics.

196
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,270
It just means that they're they tend to run in families.

197
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,970
And there could be environmental factors involved that as well.

198
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,680
Obviously, families share a lot of environment as well. And.

199
00:26:52,870 --> 00:27:00,670
And then we can tie that in to the epidemiology and talking about incidence which are new cases.

200
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:13,299
And this can really be used for for the ideologic investigation or kind of investigating those as root causes of the disease as well as prevalence,

201
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:18,160
which is all existing cases which can be more useful for health planning.

202
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:39,680
Any question about of this so far. So these are the real kind of reasons we we do all this stuff, the primary objectives here.

203
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:47,180
So you want to localize. The main objective here is localize the genes limiting disease.

204
00:27:48,350 --> 00:28:00,200
You do this to identify genetic variants that are responsible for for that disease risk to determine physiologic and biochemical mechanisms.

205
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,660
So, you know, which proteins and so on that contribute to the disease.

206
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,610
Another big part is identifying any modifiable and modifiable environmental factors.

207
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:20,929
So genes are static, right? Your genes don't really change, but your environment does.

208
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:27,270
And you can actually affect some of the functioning by changing the environment.

209
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:45,520
It's also going to be important to identify high risk individuals or facilitate early detection and and design preventive and intervention strategies.

210
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:56,140
Some other term, your genetic susceptibility is important to understand as well, and this is really talking about an inherited predisposition.

211
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:00,190
Now, it doesn't mean that you have a gene that causes disease.

212
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,820
It's not usually that direct, although sometimes it is.

213
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:18,130
Most of the time you have some gene or some some variant of a of a locus and that just increases your risk.

214
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,060
Right. So that's what we mean by genetic susceptibility.

215
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,550
Certainly this field ties in a lot with the idea of precision health in medicine.

216
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:38,180
A lot of the goals are are the same. In particular,

217
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:49,160
genetic genetics are a key component to improving those predictions of individuals at risk or designing targeted biological interventions,

218
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:54,770
as well as providing deeper insights into the etiology of the disease.

219
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:01,599
Okay. And of course, these combine to improve prevention,

220
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:11,620
intervention and intervention strategies so we can help guide policy and we can help tailor drug interventions as well.

221
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:21,130
Let's see. That's a whole field of pharmacogenomics. All right.

222
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:33,160
So now that kind of outlines some of the basic ideas of why it's important and what it is.

223
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:39,340
Now, we'll talk a little bit about the actual history of genetic epidemiology.

224
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:55,240
So in the early stages, we had Watson and Crick who, you know, they discovered the the actual structure of DNA in 1953 as a double helix.

225
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:05,400
But in this era, 50, 6070s, genetics was really still just an idea, really.

226
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:11,590
They couldn't actually measure any genetic markers in any way.

227
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:26,020
So, I mean, they couldn't identify any causal variance or get any real meaning behind bi biochemical underlying.

228
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,520
And they couldn't develop DNA based screening tests.

229
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:40,090
So it was really focused mainly on Mendelian disease, which are these diseases which are very direct.

230
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:50,780
So you have some mutation and it causes disease. These are generally pretty rare, but together they did constitute a fairly major public health.

231
00:31:54,430 --> 00:32:03,580
The major accomplishments in this era where kind of these surveillance systems for Mendelian disease.

232
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:15,040
So while they couldn't measure any actual genetic variants, they could measure some of the things upstream from that.

233
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:25,090
So to say some gene is causing you to be missing an enzyme, right?

234
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:31,840
Well, that could cause some disease. And they could measure that an enzyme with a blood test, for example.

235
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,180
So that's kind of what it was was left at and during this era.

236
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:42,250
And the theoretical principles of linkage analysis, which we'll talk about more,

237
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:47,260
but it didn't really begin yet because they couldn't measure anything.

238
00:32:49,060 --> 00:33:00,760
And the population concept of linkage, disequilibrium as well, which would become important later in the next era, the genome era.

239
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:16,660
We did start to develop some DNA marker panels in particular for these kind of repeated areas of the DNA, things like RF LPs, which are these?

240
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,560
They're there restriction, fragment length, polymorphisms and stars.

241
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:34,300
Which are those shortening repeats. But really, they're just kind of these repetitive portions of the DNA which are easier to find.

242
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:40,270
So that's what they started with. They're kind of interspersed throughout your chromosomes,

243
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:54,970
so they kind of create these little mile markers along your chromosomes where you can then look at how disease segregates in these in families

244
00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:08,740
and kind of map where the family members had the same disease and where they had the same DNA based on these these little road map road markers.

245
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:18,010
Right. So in that way, they can kind of narrow down a location for the causal variance of these diseases.

246
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:25,780
And that's the whole idea behind linkage analysis. Okay.

247
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:44,000
Um. Also during this era, the field started to wasn't quite there, but it started to shift towards single nucleotide polymorphisms.

248
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:51,680
We heard of this before. Most economists snips this is really just a single base change.

249
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:58,310
So a single base on your DNA, you might have an alien or you might have a male, for example.

250
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:09,380
That would be a snip. Right now, the major accomplishments here were that development of linkage analysis,

251
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:20,780
which was helpful for identifying genes for many or most of the Mendelian diseases and some more complex diseases as well.

252
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:29,360
So it did find things like the bracket genes, which are crucial in breast cancer.

253
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:37,640
The genetic discoveries here also led to better,

254
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:47,780
effective screening and intervention strategies and made it easier to identify those high risk populations.

255
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:59,490
Okay, that makes sense. Right.

256
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:06,610
In this next era, the post genome era, we might call it,

257
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:19,840
we actually add the human genome sequenced F and G thousand one and the snip marker panels where we're developed as well.

258
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:29,290
So now we have are able to measure snips, individual snips and annotate those with the lower frequencies and languages disequilibrium.

259
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:36,280
So during this era, a lot of g studies were done, genome wide association studies.

260
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:51,700
These this is where you measure a whole bunch of snips and look for conversations within those snips and your diseases of interest.

261
00:36:53,740 --> 00:37:01,180
What's interesting about them is it's really the same idea is linkage, but it has denser markers.

262
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:11,740
So there's a whole bunch of snips that you measure and it relies on linkage, disequilibrium, which is this this correlation between snips.

263
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:21,950
Yes. Silly question, how large were or you could also say are these snip marker panels like how many are you able to look at one.

264
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:29,140
Yeah. So they've gotten bigger and bigger over time, but they're in the millions of snips.

265
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:36,890
Which of course, isn't all the steps. It's very still a small fraction of them.

266
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,890
But we can use l.D to infer many of the others.

267
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:48,320
So the idea here is you can measure a bunch of tagged snips and these tags snips.

268
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,700
We know the correlation of those tags steps with other things.

269
00:37:53,640 --> 00:38:00,230
So we have kind of four unmeasured steps from the tags steps.

270
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,860
So that's really the whole idea behind these panels.

271
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:19,050
During this era. There was also a lot of summary measures that were developed, so things like polygenic or genetic risk scores.

272
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:29,400
So the idea here is you might do a geewax and you might find, say, 20 snips that are related to diabetes, let's say.

273
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:39,420
And you can look at how strong the effect is for each of those snaps and kind of weight them and

274
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:51,030
make them so that you have kind of an overall risk score for for an individual and make sense.

275
00:38:54,100 --> 00:39:03,940
We are also starting to be able to measure rare variance. These are steps, but the minor deal for them is very rare.

276
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:19,300
Usually, usually we say something is a rare variant of it had less than 1% or so on the minor alone as well as copy number variance.

277
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:26,680
And these are kind of these little duplicated sequence variants that occur across the genome.

278
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:42,790
The major accomplishments in this era included the development of many, many consortia, which are kind of these massive collaborations.

279
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:55,900
So is recognized early, early in this era that, um, that the effects that were being measured here were very small.

280
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:06,970
And in order to really detect many of them, you had to have a whole lot of people to increase your power to detect them.

281
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:14,240
So it became this huge, massive collaboration project for any particular study.

282
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:18,850
So you get, you know, many, many cohorts,

283
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:29,590
all of whom had their own data and they would bring them all together and usually materialize the results from all of them to get a better,

284
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:38,850
better sample. A more powerful sample. And also during this era, because of all the glass,

285
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:47,970
there were thousands of robust snips that we found that were associated with common diseases, which help broaden biological understanding.

286
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:56,730
It's helped with possible clinical utility of summary measures,

287
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:04,440
although it was also discovered that these summary measures weren't well associated with disease.

288
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:18,420
We're not always really very predictive. Sometimes it would require looking at a more specific population for them to apply to.

289
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:28,950
For example, maybe you have some genetic risk or a myocardial infarction, and if you apply that,

290
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:34,050
the risk score to the entire population might not be all that predictive.

291
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:46,620
But if you apply it to older adults that may have had heart troubles in the past, well, then it might be very predictive sense.

292
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:58,610
So we had an improved risk prediction based on those. As well as helping with diagnostic classification and drug development.

293
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:08,810
It was a pretty productive era there. And by the way, these these massive collaborations are still kind of the norm today.

294
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:23,030
They're still ongoing. Now, kind of the present era is the multi omics area where you have next generation sequencing.

295
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:29,780
So you measure even more snips and you kind of look at all these levels of omics.

296
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:36,390
So out there you have genomics, which is your, you know, your actual genetic DNA.

297
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,150
And under that, you have the epigenomics.

298
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:48,709
So these are kind of factors that influence how the genes are turned on and

299
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:53,360
off or how much they're turned on and so on may influence that kind of stuff.

300
00:42:54,380 --> 00:43:11,450
Then you've got your transcriptomics, which is the actual, um, the actual RNA that codes for the proteins get your proteome revealed, which is,

301
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:20,120
you know, all the proteins in your body and the metabolome is all the metabolites from all the food that you're consuming and so on.

302
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:31,590
You've got the genome, which is kind of your set of all your phenotypes, the environment, which is kind of a similar idea of the environment.

303
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:44,780
So there's, there's lots of layers and it really kind of brings brings you back to the the epidemiological roots of all this really as well.

304
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:51,980
The genetics don't change and all these other layers of only you change the kanji.

305
00:43:55,410 --> 00:44:03,790
Be you can you can change your environment and affect the genome and the transcriptome.

306
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:13,560
So. So that makes that means it's really important to go back and have to think about, you know, reverse causation,

307
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:24,240
the timing of the actual susceptibility, the timing of your measurements, you know, what happened first and make sense.

308
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:35,770
Questions. I mean, you know. All right.

309
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:39,640
I think this might be a good spot. Here to take a break.

310
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:49,300
So let's do that and make room for a plaque and finish up some good.

311
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,288
She is.

312
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:11,500
So. Yes.

313
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:17,350
The next year we're going to talk about kind of the steps, the genetic epidemiologic investigation.

314
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:23,020
Now, this isn't something you have to do for every study,

315
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:30,250
but it gives you a pretty good framework to think about your study and kind of the steps to go along.

316
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:41,830
So if you're interested in some disease or trait, the first thing you're going to want to ask yourself is, does it run families?

317
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,740
Is there some kind of familial aggregation?

318
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:54,610
Again, this just means that there's a tendency for the disease to occur in multiple family members more often than you would expect by chance.

319
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:03,610
And it doesn't really establish any genetic cause necessarily, but it just is a good first step here.

320
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:15,520
And what's interesting about these kind of steps is they tend to mirror how history of the genetic female algae has, has, has gone.

321
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,370
So, you know, we started not being able to measure things.

322
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:25,540
So we thought about aggregation and they're other nonmedical things.

323
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,940
And then we work our way up from there and the same ideas are here.

324
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:41,260
Once you establish some kind of familial aggregation. Then you can ask yourself, Well, is it actually due to genetics?

325
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:56,139
Is inherited heritability is really this idea of trying to parse out what portion of the

326
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:00,820
variance in that trait is due to the actual genetics and which part is due to the environment.

327
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:12,580
And when we actually say heritability as the portion of total variance that is due to the genetic change.

328
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:18,610
There's a whole analysis that can be done for that.

329
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:25,870
Then what we sell is there's some genetic influence.

330
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,040
We might move on to something like a segregation analysis.

331
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:45,670
And this is this is kind of an analysis where you analyze the pedigree and try to kind of find the patterns of

332
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:55,990
the error in there to try to parse out if there is any what the genetic causes or environmental causes are.

333
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:03,600
So it's really looking at the pattern within the pedigree for the for the individual.

334
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:19,590
Then you want to try to narrow down the actual location of the causal variance for that disease.

335
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:24,570
So you might do this with a linkage analysis. We talked a little bit already.

336
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:33,089
Again, it's just the process of approximating the chromosomal location for a gene by looking at

337
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:40,440
the full segregation that happens with some other gene that you know the location for.

338
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:49,509
You might you might skip that step and go straight to an association analysis where you're looking

339
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:54,910
at the actual specific slip variance and how they're associated with your trade of interest.

340
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:01,390
Now, I want you to establish that you have some some kind of effects.

341
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,620
You want to try to estimate the actual risk.

342
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:16,270
How large is the increase in the risk associated with those genetic variants or how much variation in the trade is explained by those variants?

343
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:32,170
And then it really wouldn't be complete without investigating kind of the functional roles of those those locations or the snips or,

344
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:36,130
or genes that you're you that you found.

345
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:53,830
So if you find a bunch of snippets saying your guys don't necessarily mean much unless you can kind of show that they have some functional relevance.

346
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:11,050
Right. So the idea is you want to establish that those markers are maybe in a gene that are known to influence your disease in some way.

347
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:27,549
So this might be let's say you're interested in diabetes, for example, if you find a snip that's in a gene that's known to be related to,

348
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:37,180
say, glucose, glucose metabolism, I would establish a functional relevance for that that make sense.

349
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:46,330
And if you can do that, then you've really accomplished the goal here and it makes sense.

350
00:50:50,060 --> 00:51:04,080
All right. Now there is kind of approaches to studying the genetic architecture of complex traits, complex traits or diseases.

351
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:15,390
Are these ones that are not Mendelian? So in other words, the very influenced by multiple genetic factors as well as environmental factors.

352
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:19,550
When we talk about genetic architecture,

353
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,810
it's really just the description of all those genetic and environmental factors that are affecting those complex traits.

354
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:43,910
And there's this other term end of phenotype. Well, we know if phenotypes are just observed characteristics and a phenotype is one that's kind

355
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:51,410
of a little lower level trait that might be on a pathway to some more complex trait.

356
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,810
So for example, we look at obesity.

357
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,490
Obesity is a very well-studied disease.

358
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:07,970
It's it's all intensive purposes, just a disease of energy imbalance.

359
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:12,710
You take in more energy than you expend. Right.

360
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:23,240
And this has all kinds of consequences. It increases your risk of many things like diabetes, cancer, stroke, among many others.

361
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:31,010
We generally measure this with BMI.

362
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:39,410
You may just the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared.

363
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:45,590
Well, it does correlate very well with with measures of body fat.

364
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:55,010
It's not an exact measurement, because when we're thinking about obesity, really, we're talking about body fat measures directly.

365
00:52:56,090 --> 00:53:03,920
This is kind of an indirect way to measure that. But we do it because it's really easy to perform and it's cheap.

366
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:08,060
All you have to do is have a tape measure of something, right? Measuring their height weight.

367
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:17,450
But again, it's not perfect. Women and older adults tend to have more body fat at the same BMI.

368
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:24,620
And athletes tend to have higher BMI, even though their fat is less.

369
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:31,389
You just have a lot of muscle. So the idea is it's kind of like this.

370
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:40,960
You have this this hierarchy and up here at the top, it has something like obesity.

371
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:48,640
Right? And down at the bottom, you have your jeans, your actual jeans.

372
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:58,300
An idea here is jeans code for proteins.

373
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:03,850
And these proteins might influence some lower level traits.

374
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:13,350
And then those lower level traits might influence some intermediate level and are not from there until you finally get to obesity.

375
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:21,580
And so you might have you know, you might have a lower level trait like visceral fat.

376
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:25,660
So this is like fat that's surrounding your organs and things like that.

377
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:33,280
So that might be a lower level. And then you'd have an intermediate level, which might be something like waist circumference.

378
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:39,160
Right. And then you your higher level might be your actual BMI.

379
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:42,550
And then and then you get to see the actual disease.

380
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:54,940
Right. So the idea here is so that the lower the level, the less influence environment has on that trait.

381
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:07,260
And the closer you can get to the gene level, the better chance you have of of identifying these variants.

382
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:14,980
And because there's less environmental influence. That makes sense.

383
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:25,170
Okay. So yeah, so this is pretty much what I just said.

384
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,020
So at a higher level, high level, you might have a BMI, your median might be waist circumference.

385
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:40,500
A lower level trait might be something like visceral adipose tissue or subcutaneous adipose tissue.

386
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:52,110
And then the closest close, closer even yet. And that to the to the genes are the proteins and which are the actual gene products.

387
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:04,490
In particular, there is there is a protein alpha chiodo glutamate dependent deoxygenated fto protein,

388
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:10,160
which is an enzyme that's involved in energy and weight regulation.

389
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:18,860
This is something that pops up on us all the time for obesity.

390
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:26,210
AFTRA tends to be the strongest, strongest hit that you get when running some kind of dubious analysis.

391
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:35,290
And in particular, it's it's associated with these subcutaneous adipose tissue ones around here.

392
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:40,520
Your midsection, abdominal fat, which makes sense.

393
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:53,260
So the idea here, though, really is it might be better to study one of those lower level traits.

394
00:56:55,890 --> 00:57:01,590
And it would be to study one of the higher level ones. You're you're closer to that gene level.

395
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:14,040
And so you'll get less influenced by environment and you might be more inclined to to find the actual genetic variants that are causing that disease.

396
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:25,270
And. That's very much related to the natural history of disease as well.

397
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:35,980
So if you've kind of been in a in any kind of clinical context, you'll know that you've got kind of this preclinical stage.

398
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:40,180
So I have a really good question kind of going back to your idea of a complex disease.

399
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:44,739
So what like I think three slides back where you mentioned there are a number of traits.

400
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:51,700
And although for obesity, I was kind of curious because Omaha has always been like we are like the Mendelian

401
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:57,790
type of traits which theoretically corresponds to one step for the trait.

402
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,220
So I was just wondering why obesity would be like like why is there this disagreement?

403
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:14,920
Yeah. So this this is really a database that is talking about and catalogs, markers for many, many diseases.

404
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:19,660
So it's not just in the daily lives. Oh, it's in the name.

405
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:23,160
So it's not like the same as like cystic fibrosis or something. Right.

406
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:29,800
Okay. So I'm getting like you. I mean, I'm sure it's cystic fibrosis is also in that catalog, but it has many, many things in it.

407
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:34,870
Okay. Thank you. The questions.

408
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:48,880
Right. So we're talking about the natural history of disease, which is very similar to this hierarchical idea.

409
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:58,600
So you've got a pre-clinical stage where you where you really don't have disease yet,

410
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:06,910
but it might reside, you know, kind of at a molecular level or some cellular level.

411
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:17,860
So in our in our obesity example, this might be an increase in the number and size of the adipocytes, which are the cells that compose adipose tissue.

412
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:29,650
And then you've got the subclinical clinical stage where you still don't have recognized clinical signs of the disease,

413
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:36,190
but you do have some biochemical or cellular or physiological changes that are happening in the body.

414
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:46,690
So in the same example as could be accumulate accumulation of the Octavius adipose tissue in the abdomen,

415
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:56,289
which is then going to start to actually cause physiological changes in your body and

416
00:59:56,290 --> 01:00:01,540
it's going to start to make excessive amounts of hormones and inflammatory substances.

417
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:11,080
And then finally you get to a clinical stage where you actually have the disease.

418
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:20,030
So this is the measured disease. So if you're in a clinic, you might say, oh, now your BMI is over 30 and I are obese.

419
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:24,320
Right. So this is the actual observed disease.

420
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:36,550
But the idea is kind of the same as that hierarchical idea where it might be better for genetics

421
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:47,030
and in particular to look at those subclinical traits before it becomes an actual disease.

422
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:54,020
You have a larger population in a study, right, as well that all people are going to progressed to that disease.

423
01:00:55,510 --> 01:01:09,740
But but certainly those subclinical stages, those subclinical traits will have genetic influences that are essentially the same as the disease states.

424
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:15,470
So it's almost like looking at those lower level traits again, as opposed to the higher level traits.

425
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:28,320
Same idea. Of course, you've got this analogy of the iceberg, which is which is along the same idea.

426
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:34,679
So, you know, when you go to a clinic and you have a disease, that's the part that you see.

427
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:38,360
It's the top, right? But that's only a very small portion of the people.

428
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:48,200
And, you know, all these other biological influences that are underneath the surface, which are not really seen directly.

429
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:53,900
And so those are going to be important to study.

430
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:09,799
And it's making sense. These classification?

431
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:16,070
Well, our case definition is really just the definition of opinion type of interest,

432
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,710
but it's important to recognize that this may be different than the clinical classification.

433
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:27,890
So while the clinical classification of obesity might be, you know, a BMI of 30 or more,

434
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:34,610
your case definition might be here if you're looking at some lower level trait,

435
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:47,240
maybe, you know, some measure of liver fat and let's say visceral adipose tissue.

436
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:53,510
And if you meet some threshold of that and it's your case definition.

437
01:02:56,190 --> 01:03:05,220
And of course, her case definition is going to dictate what you're affected in on affected groups are, which is your cases in your control.

438
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:23,160
Okay. So in this next section here, we're kind of talking about the relevant study designs for genetic epidemiological investigations.

439
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:29,130
And these are really the same as the what you would have for any epidemiologic study.

440
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:37,410
You've got your case control studies where you're comparing those with disease to those, to some other group without disease.

441
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:54,810
We've got cohort studies which are either just looking at a group of individuals over time or at some time point.

442
01:03:55,080 --> 01:04:00,000
In particular, you've also got descriptive inverse analytic.

443
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:11,340
And this is really kind of depending on how deep into the analysis you're getting, you know, descriptive things are are, you know.

444
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:16,270
How are things distributed in populations? What are the means?

445
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:24,250
What are the variances of those things? So we're analytic would be more like getting models and stuff like that.

446
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:38,110
Get quantitative versus qualitative on data being actual numerical traits in qualitative would be categorical ones.

447
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:45,280
And you can do these studies in unrelated or related individuals.

448
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:52,870
Let's talk a little bit about we'll talk a little bit about each in each of these things.

449
01:04:55,450 --> 01:05:04,090
So starting with unrelated individuals. This is generally going to be some random sample from from the population.

450
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:15,380
And if me just if you're just looking at descriptive stats, you could look at genotype specific means.

451
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:30,140
So maybe you might look at how your proportions of disease are different between people with one level versus another level, right?

452
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:41,810
Or your genotype specific variances. You can also look at illegal and genotype frequencies and how those are distributed throughout populations.

453
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:48,320
And there's this idea of of admixture.

454
01:05:50,810 --> 01:06:10,160
This little graph appear little chart actually shows the actual portion of African ancestry for those who identify themselves as African American.

455
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:23,240
What you can see here is that those in the in the U.S. south area here tend to have more African ancestry than those in the north.

456
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:37,340
The idea of admixture is just the kind of intermingling of subpopulations.

457
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:44,200
Okay. So this. This could be do.

458
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,280
Simply just like cultural.

459
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:57,860
I'm sure that certainly there's a lot of historical influence on this as well in how race relations occurred in the South and so on.

460
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:01,940
So there's a lot of historical issues and reasons for this.

461
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:06,230
That's something we're that's going to be very important for us,

462
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:12,350
because different ancestries tend to have different distributions of genetic qualities.

463
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:22,610
And most of the time, for our analyzes, we actually stratify by ethnicity.

464
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:29,300
But if we don't, we certainly want to control for it in some way.

465
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:32,570
One of those ways is with principal component analysis.

466
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:48,800
So this is a statistical technique that is used in genetics to control for that that genetic ethnicity or then genetic ancestry.

467
01:07:52,010 --> 01:08:02,650
Okay. Another interesting thing here is that your phenotypic outliers may actually be the ones that are most interesting.

468
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:09,190
So, you know, you might have someone if you're studying glucose or something,

469
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:17,200
if you have someone with extremely high glucose or extremely low glucose, we would generally consider them outliers.

470
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:22,480
Some analysis we might be tempted to throw the way.

471
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:30,159
They're just too far out there. Those might actually be the most interesting ones for genetic studies is if there

472
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:37,510
is some some genetic influence or genetic factors influencing that disease,

473
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:45,070
that trait, it may affect that person to an extreme.

474
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:49,270
So these may actually be the most interesting people for those studies.

475
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:57,650
We can also do descriptive studies for unrelated individuals,

476
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:07,380
and things like the estimation of mutation rates, for example, is a good example of contemplation.

477
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:16,430
This is actually a disease as caused by a single base change.

478
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:31,490
It's generally a de novo mutation so that it's kind of not necessarily familial, but there is a single base change that can happen.

479
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:38,420
And so it's it's a little easier to try to estimate mutation rates for something like that.

480
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:52,600
It's also interesting because it's actually related to fraternal age, which is not very common because of your neurons.

481
01:09:54,860 --> 01:10:02,450
For females, sex chromosomes are kind of you're born with and they're there and they stay there.

482
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:10,700
And for your for your whole life and for males, they're kind of replenished in a daily basis, really.

483
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:15,620
So it's kind of interesting that this is related to paternal age,

484
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:23,750
but it's because of this single base that actually is affected by the age of the father.

485
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:33,330
You can also do things like the estimation of the frequency of a trait or a disease.

486
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:36,930
So you could look at the prevalence of obesity, for example,

487
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:49,980
or you can look at how some traits is different in different populations or different geographic areas.

488
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:56,910
So you might look at the little frequencies and different geographic regions of the United States, for example.

489
01:10:58,470 --> 01:11:03,270
You'll find that, for example, blood type is quite different between regions.

490
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:19,500
And. Analytic studies of unrelated individuals are characterized by the determinants of the species of genetic traits.

491
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:28,470
They characterize risk factors, so it is associated with the frequency of genetic traits in some population.

492
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:33,960
And they also are important for the role of genetic factors in disease etiology,

493
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:50,340
and they can help contribute to looking at multiple genetic factors for the heritability.

494
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:58,680
That's really what we're talking about here and the association between measured genetic information variation as well as risk of disease.

495
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:16,679
So that's this has got to help you with prediction. Now we move on to quantitative traits in unrelated individuals because there's a good example.

496
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:20,700
This is in the the textbook readings that you'll do as well.

497
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:28,829
But there's a there's a snip in the FTO gene which is designated by this R.

498
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:34,950
S number here, which is associated with adiposity and or food intake in children.

499
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:52,590
So the research question is, is that snippets associated and this was done in 97 unrelated Scottish children and they did give us for this I'm sorry,

500
01:12:52,710 --> 01:13:03,180
they did a candidate association study for this I guess now candidate genes, there's two different types of candidate genes.

501
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:16,230
There's ones that we know might look at all the snips in a gene that we know to be associated with something that we think is related to that disease.

502
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:25,319
So it's a biological eye, but there also might be a location type.

503
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:29,250
So we might do a few us and find a bunch of snips in a particular area.

504
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:34,020
They might choose genes in that area as candidates as well.

505
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:44,190
But the idea here is they did this candidate gene study. They found that that fto snip if you had an alien,

506
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:52,890
it was associated with higher weight and BMI and increased energy intake independent of body weight,

507
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,140
but it was not associated with the weight of the food ingested.

508
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:11,880
So this kind of infers that it's playing some role in the control of food intake and food choices as well.

509
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:19,260
So you might have some preference for energy enriched foods, for example, or fairly fatty or sugary foods.

510
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:28,830
Now, another example is type two diabetes.

511
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:39,690
Here's another study. The research question was, are any steps across the genome associated with type two diabetes in this European ancestry cohort?

512
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:51,690
And what they found here is they did give us.

513
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:57,810
Of 2000 cases and 3000 controls.

514
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:11,460
And they found fact at the same exact snippet that was associated in that obesity study was also associated with type two diabetes.

515
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:21,570
They found three genes, in fact, that were significantly different between type two diabetes cases and controls.

516
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:27,060
The most significant one was that same exact arsenic was found in the obesity study

517
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:35,270
and it increased your risk of type two diabetes diabetes by a factor of 1.34.

518
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:43,000
So the odds ratio was 1.3 for. For Heterozygous versus Homo sapiens.

519
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:48,940
So if you had two copies of the animal, your risk was probably higher?

520
01:15:49,300 --> 01:16:02,150
Yes. Most likely anyways. So what this kind of implies, because you have to you have to be thinking in an epidemiologic way again.

521
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:16,100
So, you know, this the snip might actually be employing saying something related to adiposity or obesity, which then increases your risk of diabetes.

522
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:20,990
So there may be some causal pathway there that's occurring.

523
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:25,550
It's important to think about those kinds of things when you do these studies.

524
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:44,960
All right. Now we talk about unrelated, but there's also a lot of studies that are done in genetics with related individuals.

525
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:54,020
So we study familial aggregation a lot. There's a lot of studies that are done with twins.

526
01:16:55,550 --> 01:17:03,820
Names are very, very important to genetic studies for obvious reasons are very near genetically related.

527
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:08,690
Right. In particular, the models that you got in twins are genetically identical.

528
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,710
So they're actually derived from the same exact egg.

529
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:26,330
So they have the same genetic material if they're separated at birth or for some reason if they're adopted or what have you.

530
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:29,240
And they have the same genetics but different environments.

531
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:37,280
And so that can be really interesting to see what kind of differences they have just because of the environment difference.

532
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:41,030
We also look at siblings in general.

533
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:49,819
This could be models that are these iconic twins, which are are twins, but they're they come from two separate eggs.

534
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:54,380
So they're essentially the same as regular siblings. Things happen to be born in the same time.

535
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:04,190
I say that, but also they may share more environment and regular siblings.

536
01:18:04,190 --> 01:18:10,610
Right. They have a even intrauterine environment that they shared for the first.

537
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:17,330
You know, nine months after conception, let's say they're the same exact age.

538
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:29,090
So they tend to share environment and home in the same ways and at school and and wherever they live.

539
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:33,320
Right. So those those environments are are very similar.

540
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:41,360
So you do tend to see a little bit higher correlation of traits between these days.

541
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:45,050
I got a twins and you knew for regular siblings.

542
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:57,190
But we study regular siblings as well. So we study trios which are affected children and their parents generally like in nuclear families,

543
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:01,870
which are the parental bear and all children that they have.

544
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:09,720
And we also look at both the general categories. Okay.

545
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,640
Pedigree nomenklatura. So there's a lot. There's a nice key here.

546
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:19,480
You can look through. Some of you might be familiar with this already.

547
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:26,549
This kind of stuff. Some of these are fairly complicated and then you never really see them.

548
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:33,300
But for the most part, you should know that you know, names are squares, females are circles.

549
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:38,040
You got these lines between people to indicate marriages or unions.

550
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:43,200
You've got vertical lines that go down to children and so on.

551
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:54,210
So that's something you can look at. One thing that might not be counted is this idea of a full band.

552
01:19:54,900 --> 01:20:00,510
So a lot of times in in a pedigree, you've got a a person of interest.

553
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:06,780
And so you build the pedigree around that person and that that is your program and person of interest.

554
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:12,830
You really use these pedigrees to examine those patterns of transmission?

555
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:23,450
That's important for that. It's also important to note that we like to indicate affected individuals by like colors or shading the men.

556
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:30,710
But that won't always be in the pedigree. You might not know, as in season doesn't or might just not be indicated.

557
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:38,750
So you shouldn't count on that polarization there. Here's an example of a pedigree.

558
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:45,830
So that person in the very middle, female middle with the arrow.

559
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:59,890
That's your pro band. You've got to first degree relatives, which are anybody who's really only one step away.

560
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:03,560
So that would be siblings, would be parents, would be children.

561
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:12,890
Second degree relatives, which are two steps away.

562
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:19,220
So that would be like grandparents and grandchildren and so on.

563
01:21:19,730 --> 01:21:23,240
Or uncles and aunts. I'd be a second degree relative.

564
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:33,200
Now, this is interesting because first degree relatives share half or about half of their genetic material with each other.

565
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:42,170
Second degree relatives share a quarter, third degree, an eighth, and so on over here.

566
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:47,209
It's also interesting to note here that they're usually labeled in this way.

567
01:21:47,210 --> 01:21:56,090
So you have kind of these Roman numerals, four levels, vertical levels, and you have Arabic numerals for these horizontal levels.

568
01:21:57,110 --> 01:22:03,530
Right. So we would refer to this person here as person three to.

569
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:11,360
Which is a cousin of the probation, third degree relative.

570
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:19,140
Okay. Now, what's going on over here?

571
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:26,940
With a four, seven and for eight point.

572
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:44,700
Well, this one's interesting because these two kids here, these two kids are well, they're a nephew and a niece.

573
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:49,950
Right. Of of the pro. And so they're children of their brother.

574
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:57,960
Right. But they're also children of their cousin.

575
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:08,190
So this double line here indicates that can say witness, meaning church, which is just a meeting between people who are related to each other.

576
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:17,190
So that means that these two kids here are both second degree and fourth degree relatives of the probing.

577
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:29,810
Which actually makes them more related to the pro band and even to a regular second degree relative would be.

578
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:40,100
Yes. Yeah. Because I was kind of thinking about that too. Like, do they share 25% for like a second degree or is it more than.

579
01:23:40,130 --> 01:23:44,330
And if so, like, how would you like is that important to know exactly?

580
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:45,230
It is important.

581
01:23:48,080 --> 01:24:00,680
It's generally going to be more than the 25% at a normal second degree relative would be because the father of the child is also related.

582
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:10,640
And so this cousin actually would share an eighth of the genetic material with the pro band and the sibling, obviously a half.

583
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:14,810
So you kind of get some some average there between the two.

584
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:25,040
And so you generally have more and more of them in the quarter than you would expect.

585
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:29,600
Is that additive or multiplicative or is it the average?

586
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:37,230
Well, it wouldn't it would be additive. There'd be a quarter contribution from this father here.

587
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:44,060
It also be like 16th cut contribution, theoretically with the mother.

588
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:48,889
Some of that might be shared between these two as well. All right.

589
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:54,590
So some of that might overlap. Yeah, you've got a quarter and you've got a 16th.

590
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:58,640
They're additive, but some of it might overlap. Gotcha.

591
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:10,190
That makes sense. And right.

592
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:17,180
Actually think this might be a good place to hide screening.

593
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:29,800
We will call it, and we'll come back next time and finish this section up and also look at the next the next thing we should.

594
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:36,850
All right. Great weekend, everybody. Because.
