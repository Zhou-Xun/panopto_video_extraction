1
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:26,820
Hi, everybody. Good afternoon.

2
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:41,990
Good to see you all. Hi, everyone, good to see you all.

3
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:54,890
So I think we should get started. We'll do a check in, and then today we're going to talk about international comparisons continue a little bit.

4
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:05,250
Of course, we started that talking about how the US compares to other countries, other industrialized countries thinking about spending today.

5
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,400
We're going to look at some other factors related to that.

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:19,480
Oh, yeah. Questions about the quiz, I think I'm going to hold that until Thursday or.

7
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,350
So. Just check in.

8
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,840
We I was thinking we would have sort of questions and thinking about last week,

9
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:45,510
but some people might want to be just saying something about the weekend and the craziness and scariness of the threat and the.

10
00:01:45,510 --> 00:02:03,820
Just how you were feeling about all of that, very frightening to feel, you know, targeted our campus women from female students on students and.

11
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,410
And anyone walking around on the campus,

12
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:20,530
so I'm sure many of you were feeling like I was and many of us just feeling very nervous about coming to campus,

13
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:27,880
I don't know if people came yesterday or just how you're thinking about that.

14
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:40,660
But for me, it was a little I had actually been working and then took a break and went to a movie with my husband, had my phone off,

15
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:54,010
was sort of in that world of sitting at the state theater, but out of communication until sort of like the evening I turn my phone back on.

16
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:59,230
And it was like the the craziness of all of that.

17
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:12,460
But by that point, it had even been, you know, resolved to the extent that the FBI was saying, OK, we think we've identified this, but I can.

18
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:27,580
Only imagine if you were in that from the first notice and the how that would have just been so much more anxiety producing and frightening,

19
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:36,860
I feel fortunate that I was sort of. Didn't didn't have to go through all of that.

20
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:42,090
So. Moment for check in.

21
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,620
People to talk about what they're thinking about.

22
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,360
So you also don't have to talk about the weekend if you want to ask a question,

23
00:03:51,360 --> 00:04:02,010
you want to be thinking about some of the material we've been covering as our sort of our more standard checking.

24
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:18,540
That's OK to. This is a moment for us to kind of come into the room, recognize that people are in different places when we begin together.

25
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:37,320
Anyone want to share? Today.

26
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:47,210
Feel. I actually have a question more.

27
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,680
I guess it's more sort of about the readings for today,

28
00:04:51,680 --> 00:05:03,030
but like I understand why the book used Germany, the UK and Canada maybe missing more than the pan.

29
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:09,290
Yes, Japan as the cases. But it seems like a pretty.

30
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:17,690
Like, they are also high income developed countries, but they also don't share, like our history of slavery and apartheid.

31
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:24,200
So I just feel like there might be more to learn from a country that has a similar history,

32
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,870
even if it isn't at the same level of economic development.

33
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:37,770
Well, the primary reason to compare to industrialized countries is it's never surprising to

34
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:43,860
find out that we we spend more and we organize differently from developing countries.

35
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:54,580
But of course. Slavery originated, maybe not originated in Britain, but so so there's a history there, of course,

36
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:09,610
slavery ended in Britain before in the US and it didn't have the same history of chattel slavery, of indentured, lifelong generational slavery.

37
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,000
Canada has a similar.

38
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:25,060
History of treatment of indigenous peoples, so in many ways, I think there is some real similarity there to think about innovative health care.

39
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:34,240
Other countries we we can be looking at and I'll try to add some links, but certainly Cuba, Vietnam,

40
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:46,720
Singapore all have really very interesting and very different health care systems where they not only spend less,

41
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:55,450
of course, but they actually deliver care in many ways at a higher quality than in the US.

42
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:03,430
So, I mean, that's a variety. No country is really similar to another country in their health care system.

43
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:09,430
So I'll show you some of the others and why we generally look at Germany, the UK,

44
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:18,220
Canada, Japan, they're not only also industrialized countries, but they offer similar.

45
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:24,880
Structures in some ways to what we have and yet do things very differently.

46
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,710
So but I think there is no. Perfect.

47
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:43,380
You know, countries are directly comparable, that's part of the challenge of comparative analysis if we're both pros and cons.

48
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:56,280
So we can keep talking about that as we're looking at some of these cases.

49
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,080
I was talking to my friend last night who moved from Israel to Canada,

50
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,820
and she was talking about how much harder it is to get access to care in Canada than Israel.

51
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,230
And I was just thinking,

52
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:16,260
it's interesting how different two different universal health care systems can be and probably geography and population play a pretty big role.

53
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:24,120
But just an interesting anecdote that related to what we've been talking about. Yeah, interesting experience to see.

54
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:31,710
I'm sure there. You know, as we know, there will be variation in both of those countries, too,

55
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:41,380
in who has access to care, how quickly, how you know, at what cost, et cetera.

56
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:48,370
So as we look at these countries and we do comparisons on averages and things like that,

57
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:53,590
we all know, as we've been talking about in the U.S., there's a huge amount of variation.

58
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:59,380
And that is to some extent true in these other countries as well.

59
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,870
But that's sometimes if we take that into account,

60
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:09,880
how big are the gaps between those with access and those without or those with high quality care and those without?

61
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:25,570
And that some of what we compare then? It's not that other countries don't have gaps, but their gaps are not as big or small often.

62
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:47,480
And the other. Comments. In this week's Reading, we compared the health system, the in between the US and other developed countries,

63
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:56,600
and based on my understanding so far, yes, I want to use the ACA expansion to to improve this situation.

64
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:11,540
But according to a paper read this week, they compared the different states that the states that adopted ACA expansion into a before and after.

65
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:19,880
And they found they found there is no significant associated with the likelihood of improved,

66
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:33,530
like the chance in the likelihood to see the doctor visit or overnight hospital stays or the health status reported by those respondents.

67
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:45,020
And the other comparison is they compare the states that adopted the expansion and they and did not adopt ACA expansion.

68
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:59,990
And they fought the increase in the report of the access to the to the doctors because they there has a long waiting time.

69
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:05,990
So I think it is quite a complex set of questions about the ACA expansion.

70
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,970
And so I'm looking forward to more inside seeing this costs.

71
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:19,820
OK, so the ACA, as we've looked at a number of studies a couple of weeks ago, we compared the ACA.

72
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:29,990
There have been a number of studies comparing ACA expansion states and ACA, not expansion states or within expansion states over time.

73
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:37,260
And this that kind of ties into what is the role of health insurance.

74
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:48,660
On aspects of health care and health, right, so access to care, cost of care, access to quality care,

75
00:11:48,660 --> 00:12:01,650
affordability of that care, timeliness of care are all different dimensions that may or may not be changing as you deal with.

76
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:08,520
Expanding insurance access. So in some ways, that's partly what we're going to be looking at today,

77
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:21,690
although we're not going to continue talking about the ACA directly because that's expanding insurance access via Medicaid to particular groups.

78
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:33,720
Right. Remembering what the ACA is. But we are going to try to talk about a variety of those similar kinds of measures,

79
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:44,710
and we're going to recognize like Tricia's point about what's the right country to compare all of these different dimensions.

80
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:52,840
Are going to there's not a simple story, better or worse, more or less.

81
00:12:52,840 --> 00:13:01,570
And so we're trying to take into account lots of different dimensions and then evaluate that when we

82
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:12,400
think about characteristics of health care systems and how the US might compare and vary from them.

83
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:22,960
So last week, we looked specifically at spending expenditures on health and health care between the US and other countries.

84
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,090
All those graphs, of course, we've talked about in the beginning of the semester,

85
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:36,880
we've been talking about the financing of health care and health in the United States,

86
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,480
the accidental system, private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid, the ACA.

87
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:49,440
That's about financing. But we haven't really compared that to other countries.

88
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:59,550
So today we're going to talk a little bit and the readings you did are about financing in other countries, a few other countries.

89
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:10,230
And then we're going to look at some of the data that you also read about comparing quality health outcomes, system performance across systems.

90
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:21,450
Oh, and before we do that, just briefly, there were some questions after class last time about expenditures and just some.

91
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:30,720
Kind of confusion, and it's partly because we haven't really talked about health care delivery models and organization yet, that's coming up.

92
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:49,680
If you really are like I want to understand this more, what's the date of the there is a recorded lecture that you will have for coming up.

93
00:14:49,680 --> 00:15:00,450
Not till November. Sorry, November 16, but if you're dying to find out more and see more slides like this,

94
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:05,340
you can watch that recorded lecture, which is about the organization of delivery.

95
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:15,800
But just on this point, about what's in patient care and what's outpatient care since we were looking at those measures for spending.

96
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:28,370
So inpatient care is not only in the hospital, but it is care after an admission to the hospital.

97
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,820
So the question came up, what about E.R. care? So this is the hard thing.

98
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,930
So that's care that's in a hospital, it's delivered in a hospital,

99
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:47,980
but for people and care that is delivered in the E.R. for someone who never gets admitted to the hospital.

100
00:15:47,980 --> 00:16:07,350
That's ambulatory care, outpatient care, which is very confusing, but the key about inpatient care is it is an admittance to the hospital.

101
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:15,270
But then outpatient care, of course, includes everything else that happens outside of the hospital,

102
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:21,840
even somewhat specialized care that might occur in an ambulatory surgical center,

103
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:29,100
a day surgery center, an outpatient clinic, even when its specialty care,

104
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:37,430
when it is not for patients who have been admitted to a hospital, it is outpatient care.

105
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:45,250
So I know that can be a little confusing, but that's just to clarify that.

106
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:53,230
OK, so let's just briefly talk about financing of health systems,

107
00:16:53,230 --> 00:17:01,330
as you read about in the in the Bodenheimer and Grumbach book, and we'll look at a little bit today.

108
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,340
So first we can review.

109
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:15,700
So from the Bowdon, Heimer and Grumbach, like you'll see, I copy their nice little graphics on financing and payment in those different systems.

110
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:21,220
So I tried to make one that looked like the US because they don't have this model for the US.

111
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:29,980
But as you know, we've got these kind of insurance plans in the US, lots of private insurance.

112
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:36,380
We have government sponsored Medicare and government sponsored Medicaid.

113
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,640
They are financed in a variety of ways, right?

114
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,780
You already know this, employers are contributing to the premiums for private insurance.

115
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:54,810
Employees are contributing to the premiums for private.

116
00:17:54,810 --> 00:18:04,670
Insurance. Anybody who is working is paying payroll taxes, which are going to Medicare and Medicaid,

117
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:15,560
the states are individually financing their Medicaid programs from other tax bases, typically from their general funds, which are funded by taxes.

118
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:27,300
Actually, I didn't even put on here. Medicare, actually, the beneficiaries are also contributing to the premiums.

119
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:35,290
Lots of different plans, and then they're paying providers and hospitals.

120
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:45,460
Typically fee for service that has historically been the payment model, we're going to start talking about new payment bottles yet.

121
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:50,570
Next, we haven't really talked about those, but.

122
00:18:50,570 --> 00:19:00,210
As we've already seen and looked at the US spending on administrative costs.

123
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:12,070
To administer and manage this is not surprising that it is so expensive when you just see my little boxes and arrows, right?

124
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:19,380
Just imagine how complex and administratively expensive it is.

125
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:25,530
OK, so the US model is often called, as you know, an accidental model.

126
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:32,550
It's also called an entrepreneurial model or an entrepreneurial health system.

127
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:43,220
And you. Can already tell what we've studied about and what you already know about health care, why that is, but let's look at some others.

128
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:51,140
So Germany, for example, but some others, Japan that we'll see, which is on there twice,

129
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:59,450
not sure why, but is all follow what is called sort of the Bismarck model.

130
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:05,510
And Bismarck following the chancellor of Germany,

131
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:14,120
Auto von Bismarck and Germany actually essentially established its health system in

132
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:23,810
eighteen eighty three as part of what they called their citizen benefits package.

133
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:34,010
All citizens of Germany have a right to housing, health care pension.

134
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:44,210
Unemployment insurance, retirement. And that established the basis for the health system.

135
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,470
Think about that compared to our accidental system.

136
00:20:48,470 --> 00:21:05,260
So Germany, eighteen eighty three. Providers, physicians and hospitals are essentially private in Germany, just like in the US.

137
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:12,770
Payers are also private, just like private insurers in the US.

138
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:17,410
Just a little surprising, but they are not for profit.

139
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:31,470
There is no for profit private pay or insurer, so private insurance plans that are jointly financed also by employers and employees.

140
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:47,230
Some ways very similar. Universal coverage, non profit, and then sort of tight regulation through what are called regional health authorities.

141
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:55,180
So this is the the image from the Bodenheimer and Grumbach text, right.

142
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:05,350
So actually, they don't have on there the employer and employee contributions into what they call sickness funds.

143
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:10,530
The sickness funds are basically the private insurance plans.

144
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,520
But they are nonprofit.

145
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:28,110
They work with what are called regional health authorities, who then establish a fee system, what's called the regulated fees that go to hospitals.

146
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:34,990
For payments, so they all pay a similar fee to hospitals.

147
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:43,930
Because the regional health authority is the sort of who who negotiates and decides that not the individual

148
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:56,590
hospitals and then an expenditure cap with the physician associations to deliver physician care,

149
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:00,180
and that's like capitation.

150
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:12,010
An expenditure cap, it's not exactly capitation, but it is because it's applied to not just each individual patient, but to a patient population.

151
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:21,010
So capitation, a capitated payment we're going to see in a few minutes is different from fee for service.

152
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:29,300
So what's fee for service? Fee for service is the way we pay for everything else in the economy.

153
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:38,790
Right. I go to. Sorry.

154
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:51,360
Um. OK, so her giant mice under their.

155
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:59,700
So fee for service, right, there is a service like restaurant meal and there's a price associated with it,

156
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:07,140
and if you buy that meal, you pay that fee in order to get that service.

157
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:13,200
Health care in the US is very much like that, you don't always know what the posted price is,

158
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,120
which we're going to look at, but you will get the service.

159
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:25,080
You will then pay a fee or you and your insurer will pay that fee if you're lucky to be insured.

160
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:32,280
And expenditure cap is more like here is the most we will we're going to provide this for the care that you're

161
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:39,630
going to deliver to these patients over the next year and then you manage your budget and deliver care.

162
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,990
And if there's some left over, you get to keep that.

163
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:50,400
And if there's none left over and it costs more, you have to figure out how to how to provide that.

164
00:24:50,400 --> 00:25:01,320
So that's how an expenditure cap works. The Japanese health system is different, but similar.

165
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:11,460
So the Japanese system, employers and employees are paying into payroll taxes for insurance plans,

166
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,830
small businesses pay a little bit differently and to a different set of plans.

167
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:20,620
There's also government taxes.

168
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:28,960
But then how do we deal with people who are not employed or self-employed or retired taxes are going to help support those plans,

169
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:36,520
but then there's also some income based premiums that are paid just like in Medicare in some ways.

170
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:49,320
So lots of different insurance plans. In Japan, just like in the US, all not for profit.

171
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:57,380
All covering, so Germany, Japan, these are third party payer systems.

172
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:13,270
There are private insurers paying along with the individuals and funded by government and other sources paying for care.

173
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:20,890
So that is one sort of model that is out there in the world.

174
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:28,080
I think Germany has something like 500 or more insurance plans.

175
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,160
Right. So you think about the private insurance and how complicated ours is,

176
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:43,520
and yet they still have less than half the spending on administrative costs in their health care system than the US.

177
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:53,900
So it's not only that our system is complicated, somebody over here said fragmented last week we were talking about.

178
00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:07,280
Of our health care system, even in these fairly complicated financing and spending systems, they are spending less on administrative fees.

179
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:19,460
So Great Britain is the the sort of idea, the case for the Beveridge model, and it's referred to that because.

180
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:28,320
It's named after Neville Beveridge, who was the UK prime minister at the time they established the National Health Service.

181
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:39,170
Actually, I'm putting you don't have to know Bismark Beverage, that's just a way to to think about these different systems.

182
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:47,250
So but the US VA system is actually a beverage system.

183
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,540
There is no third party.

184
00:27:50,540 --> 00:28:04,770
This isn't a third party payer system, it is the government directly financing health insurance and are directly financing health care.

185
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:09,540
So there is no insurer. There is no third party.

186
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:20,820
It's the government itself as the insurer essentially of the country and the government is directly paying for health care.

187
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:29,970
So theoretically, there are no medical bills and there have been for most of the history of the National Health Service,

188
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:38,650
which was nineteen forty six, I believe. Yeah.

189
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:45,430
There were no medical bills because the government is just paying directly to the hospitals and the providers,

190
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:54,010
some of whom are directly employed by the government. Today, there is a little bit more private care,

191
00:28:54,010 --> 00:29:04,000
so individuals can actually pay out of pocket for some extra private services that

192
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:14,110
you get get on on top of what the the primary National Health Service is delivering.

193
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:22,900
This is the model for when you hear people call, say, socialized medicine, sometimes people just refer to everyone who has universal coverage.

194
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:31,730
But typically this is the model that people are referring to because it's government provided health.

195
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:40,030
Claire. So the British system, its taxes.

196
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:47,800
That fund, the National Health Service, which delivers care, they provide a global budget.

197
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:59,290
Here's your chunk of money to the hospital to deliver care in the hospital for the next year for the set of patients or this population.

198
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:12,760
Many physicians are salaried. And some have capitation, that lump sum per patient.

199
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:19,790
That is provided to ensure the care of that patient throughout the year.

200
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:30,010
So capitation, for example, is so for patients in your practice, we're going to pay you a thousand dollars per patient.

201
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:34,210
We're going to deliver that, we're going to distribute that the beginning of the year,

202
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:41,170
over the year, if that patient never comes into your office, you get a thousand dollars.

203
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:48,450
If that patient comes to your office one hundred times and requires.

204
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:57,210
Ten thousand dollars worth of care, you're getting a thousand dollars, so that's how capitation essentially works.

205
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:08,170
The idea of it anyway, it's not usually quite quite like that, Spencer.

206
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:18,150
One common area of. Like the.

207
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:27,630
So it is based on your patient population, so it's going to exactly take into account some characteristics of your patient population and

208
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:33,960
it's also going to take into account sort of the health care needs that they had last year,

209
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,010
for example, to this year. So that that is going to be built in.

210
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:51,340
So, yes, in the National Health Service, patients who are sicker, patients who are older pay doctors at a higher level.

211
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:58,380
Then the average healthy young patient.

212
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:06,740
Think about how different that is from what we know about Medicaid and Medicare in the US.

213
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:26,290
Higher fees, they're not fees, it's capitation, but higher levels for sicker and older patients.

214
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:33,660
We'll talk about the Indian Health Service a little bit later, which is.

215
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:42,900
Yeah, has some similarity, but we can well, we'll we'll talk about the Indian Health Service specifically a little bit later.

216
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:50,720
But you're right, it is it has similar financing model.

217
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:59,990
OK, and just one more. The National Health Insurance model, which is Canada, South Korea, Taiwan.

218
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:06,140
Here again, providers are private hospitals and doctors are private practice.

219
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:13,940
Private Lee organized and operated here.

220
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:21,750
It is an insurance program, but there is essentially one payer.

221
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:36,220
The provincial health authority, so each province is the payer for the health care in that province and there are, what, 13 provinces in Canada.

222
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:42,660
I thought they were I thought it wasn't is that.

223
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:49,680
Three territory, so they the territories, I believe, have their own provincial health or territorial health,

224
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:58,030
so there's 13 insurers, 10 provinces, three territories.

225
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:13,430
There are people pay premiums, there are sometimes some co-pays, but they are doing what's called a negotiated fee for service.

226
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:24,960
And then also a global budget. So taxes fund provincial or territorial health plans.

227
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,510
Who then pay providers one one insurer in each place,

228
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:41,920
in each sort of like comparable to a state paying for the health care of those the people who live in that?

229
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:55,940
Province. Negotiated fee for service here is the fees are negotiated between the providers and the provincial health authority.

230
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,490
So sort of like Germany.

231
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:10,230
In the negotiation with the regional health associations, that's how Canada works, but they're still paying a fee for service.

232
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:19,590
So it's not like an expenditure cap or capitation, even though a few might get paid capitation.

233
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:32,540
It is for each service delivered a fee gets paid a different administrative model than capitation or an expenditure cap.

234
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:43,390
Right. Because each service has to generate a bill that gets paid, so that's an administrative.

235
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:50,580
Cost. In the Canadian system.

236
00:35:50,580 --> 00:36:08,910
OK, so the people questions. OK.

237
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:18,680
The. OK, thank you. So payment is for the technical and professional component when it comes for hospitals.

238
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:25,160
So if a physician sees a patient in a hospital, they still get paid through the.

239
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,340
Um. The roots, not the corporation, right?

240
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:42,670
Similar to well, in Germany, this is sometimes specialists are actually salaried in hospitals in Germany.

241
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:53,450
But typically, like in the US, physicians are paid independently of payments to hospitals.

242
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:57,440
So when you are treated, is that clarify, is that the question?

243
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,160
Yes, I was and the physician in the hospital will get paid through the hospital's payment system, which is in this case,

244
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:12,380
the fee for service, not the competition like the physician association you're talking about for Germany.

245
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:20,050
Thank you. Yeah. So.

246
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:38,070
Typically, the physicians are still getting paid. Even when they're providing care in hospitals separately from the care paid to hospitals.

247
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:45,670
Well. One physician who sees outpatients is not allowed to see patients in Germany for.

248
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:56,150
There's this strict prohibition on, you know, yes, so hospitals, when they build, they bill for technical and professional.

249
00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:04,040
Services, so you use the MRI, you feel for the MRI and then the physician who had the results gets paid.

250
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,660
Oh, yes. Right.

251
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:17,960
So in hospitals and certainly like anesthesia will be billed all as part of the all of that will be billed as part of a hospital stay for surgery,

252
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:26,140
the anesthesia, et cetera. Yeah. And the question I want to ask is in Japan.

253
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:36,310
I know that the insurance comes through employers. And does that mean that they don't have insurance companies and so the employer just pulls money?

254
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:40,690
No, they haven't. They have insurers just like we do.

255
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:50,830
They have private health insurance. And it's funded similarly through employment.

256
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:59,920
Employers and employees are paying into insurance to buy insurance.

257
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:09,470
And the last thing I wanted to ask about was the virtue of prohibiting physicians from seeing their patients in a hospital if they saw them.

258
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:15,970
Yeah. So, I mean, we'll talk about this again a little bit when we talk about in the U.S. But

259
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:26,770
the the the pros and cons of when when your physician you is somebody who's

260
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:31,990
seeing you regularly and they follow you into the hospital and then they come

261
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:38,740
in to the hospital to also treat you there potentially versus a hospitalist,

262
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:53,210
somebody who is a physician who is employed by the hospital, which in the US is a relatively still small and newer practice.

263
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,930
Physicians coming in from the outside don't know the hospital as well.

264
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:03,080
They don't work with the systems there. They they.

265
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:13,640
So so the challenges of that versus I think what you're thinking of the downside is my doctor doesn't get to treat me when I'm in the hospital,

266
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:24,900
for example. Is that a potential risk, so highly specialized care that is only ever delivered in a hospital.

267
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:35,570
You know, you have very specialized physicians who will be seeing the patient primarily and billing the patient through the hospital in Germany.

268
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:40,460
That's going to be a private physician who's billed separately in the US.

269
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:46,880
So we'll look at we're going to look at some outcomes for surgery, for highly advanced care.

270
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:54,230
You can think about that. Your question, what are the pros and cons from an administrative cost perspective?

271
00:40:54,230 --> 00:41:03,530
What are the different challenges of having physicians who work for the hospital versus in the US?

272
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:07,940
Most physicians do not work for hospitals.

273
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:16,140
They work at hospitals. They are getting paid separately.

274
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:26,100
Through it all, insurers, Medicare is paying physicians separately, Part B versus part A, right?

275
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:31,150
And same with private insurers and Medicaid.

276
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:45,040
Versus the the the physician being at the hospital, employed by the hospital, trained to work with the staff and the systems in that hospital,

277
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:53,620
and there's lots of debate about the benefits of hospitalists versus not on the health side,

278
00:41:53,620 --> 00:42:04,460
on the outcomes side, on the sort of process, quality and administration side.

279
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:13,530
OK. So now let's look a little bit at how the US compares spending.

280
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:21,720
We know it's a different slide, but it's the same same slide, same information of what we know.

281
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:30,270
I'm going to use a lot of the some of the the data from the updated just twenty twenty one.

282
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:39,030
The new mirror mirror study came out. I think you might have read the twenty seventeen one that was assigned, but I did.

283
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:45,420
I provided the update to the twenty twenty one study that just came out.

284
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:52,280
So we spend more, we know that what about health care quality?

285
00:42:52,280 --> 00:43:00,940
Let's look at where the US is better. Then these other countries.

286
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:08,570
So hospital care for heart attacks, for strokes.

287
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:16,250
The US does better here, you can see a real difference here you want this is 30 day mortality.

288
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:26,690
We want mortality to be lower. So you have a stroke, you go to the hospital, you get high quality care, you have lower mortality.

289
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:34,670
The US and the green lower mortality than the other these other industrialized countries in the blue.

290
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:39,410
It's also true for the for a heart attack and hemorrhagic stroke.

291
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:49,840
But, you know. Not big differences.

292
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:57,130
Postoperative sepsis, infection after an operation in a hospital.

293
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:04,150
This is an important, preventable health consequence.

294
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:12,190
This is considered a preventable error. So high quality care should have low sepsis rates.

295
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:27,820
And the US here is one of the lowest. Along with Canada, that's a good certainly high quality evidence of high quality.

296
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:36,930
I think I mentioned this around breast cancer care, the US does very well.

297
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:43,570
Breast cancer screenings, the US.

298
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:55,390
Yeah, it's over here, high numbers of screening, also flu shots, immunizations were the second bar that's a little cut off.

299
00:44:55,390 --> 00:45:06,960
So high levels of. Flu immunization, breast cancer screening, all good signs of quality care.

300
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:15,960
Not doing so well on vaccines for covid over there compared to some of these countries.

301
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:26,490
OK, how about where the US is worse? Delays or errors?

302
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:35,180
Medication or lab errors? Not great.

303
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:49,520
But as you can see to the other countries are moving around to that's why it is you can't look at any one of these measures necessarily to say,

304
00:45:49,520 --> 00:46:07,700
is the system better or worse? We know pregnancy related maternal deaths is a huge area where the US does not have high quality care.

305
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:13,620
Well, above all of these other countries.

306
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:18,670
We're going to look at some other evidence similar to this.

307
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:23,920
OK, and then this is avoidable deaths.

308
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:36,580
So these are avoidable deaths, avoidable mortality, so preventable deaths is the other term, and I think that was talked about in the book,

309
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:49,880
the prevention book that you read about how many illnesses and diseases and accidents that lead to death.

310
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:58,190
Could be prevented in a variety of ways.

311
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:06,050
So the the top lighter orange is 29 compared to 10 years later.

312
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:13,060
So every country wants to reduce. Deaths that can be prevented.

313
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:18,970
And unfortunately, the US started out higher.

314
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:25,510
Then all the other countries and has not had as significant a shift.

315
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:41,950
In the last 10 years, even though we, like all these other countries, have been focused on preventable deaths.

316
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:49,290
Instead of looking at some of the the care, we could look at outcomes.

317
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:58,530
So outcomes where the US is better treatment of tumors, cancer, tumor,

318
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:08,300
cancerous tumors, neoplasms, the US is generally better at preventing mortality.

319
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:21,150
From cancer. Similarly, breast cancer and cervical cancer survival rates are much higher.

320
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:32,730
The US does very well. This is an important area when I think a lot of people say the US has the best quality health care in in the world.

321
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:43,600
They're thinking about cancer treatment where the US does do very well and has.

322
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:52,860
Lowest mortality for cervical cancer. Now, this is.

323
00:48:52,860 --> 00:49:04,190
Survival rates, actually. The US is not better. They're the best on breast cancer, they're the worst on cervical cancer.

324
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:14,000
So that's a little confusing. Diseases of the circulatory system.

325
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:24,600
Hypertension, stroke. We do pretty well.

326
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:42,500
But then we can also look at where the US is worse. We know we have the lowest life expectancy, just a, you know, kind of a crude measure.

327
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,040
You guys have probably seen this depending on which classes you're taking.

328
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:56,440
So a use of Dalys, disability adjusted life years for disease burden.

329
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:08,590
We looked at some of those last week. Obesity, diabetes rates, high levels of disease burden.

330
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:12,910
Here again, maternal mortality.

331
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:29,430
Clearly, the US is like on spending is sort of off the chart, we're not just slightly higher, we're in a whole different category than our peers.

332
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:34,980
And we know that a lot of this is based in racism.

333
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:47,860
Variation in race and ethnicity around the delivery of maternal and infant care, and that includes everything from.

334
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,720
Biases, discrimination,

335
00:50:49,720 --> 00:51:00,310
implicit bias that might operate at the individual level of care through the systemic factors that mean hospitals in certain places in the

336
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:13,780
country and certain kinds of communities that are indigenous or African-American and particularly are lower resourced with providers,

337
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:26,620
with other resources. Neonatal and postnatal mortality rates, a similar issue.

338
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:29,560
This is the infant side, and again,

339
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:52,130
we know that this varies by race and ethnicity is also based in the racism that is affecting the mothers giving birth as well.

340
00:51:52,130 --> 00:52:00,070
Age adjusted mortality for respiratory diseases, asthma, COPD.

341
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:05,960
Um, lung cancer, so.

342
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:16,060
Not doing as well, they're. And again, the looking at the preventable deaths over time.

343
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:22,630
Which we already saw. OK, so how about then health system performance,

344
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:30,370
different set of measures so we can think about quality of care, you could think about outcomes of care.

345
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:35,170
As measures in which way are we doing better, where are we doing worse?

346
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:42,330
What about affordability and equity?

347
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:52,120
We on affordability and this measure, this is in the twenty twenty one mirror mirror study.

348
00:52:52,120 --> 00:53:08,950
This is based on measures that include insurance being denied payment, difficulty paying bills, a variety of affordability measures,

349
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:27,000
not surprising to us is the worst on that, because think back to how we finance and deliver the health care that we've been talking about.

350
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:34,320
How about equity, this is based on equity related to income differentials only,

351
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:44,250
so we just looked at some of the variation around maternal and infant mortality based on race and ethnicity in the United States.

352
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:54,560
We know there is a relationship between race and ethnicity and socioeconomic status, but that's not a it's not a complete relationship.

353
00:53:54,560 --> 00:54:00,560
But to the extent that income differentials matter,

354
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:09,800
the this sort of summary slide is looking at those countries to look at the gap between the care delivered

355
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:19,760
along something like 11 measures to the highest income bracket compared to the lowest income bracket.

356
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:25,130
So how big is the gap? That's what this slide is summarizing in the report.

357
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:32,700
You can go and look at the individual measures. Let's see.

358
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:36,100
Yeah, 11.

359
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:52,360
The US consistently demonstrated the largest disparities between income groups except for measures related or the social good for preventive services.

360
00:54:52,360 --> 00:55:00,730
So there we are. We've been talking about how important prevention is.

361
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:16,150
So. Also related to sort of patient experiences of care, you know, surveys about how well you were treated or treated with respect to us.

362
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:24,900
And then also Canada has is pretty different from the other countries.

363
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:36,870
This is another measure to come after the affordability one sorry, but it's related to affordability, so it's basically how cost affects access.

364
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:41,990
So this is one of the measures in that affordability summary.

365
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:53,490
Slide. Earth's summary measure. Because you cannot see the difference between those colors very well, so the top one,

366
00:55:53,490 --> 00:56:04,110
the really light gray, is low income, lower income populations and the darker gray is higher income.

367
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:23,810
So not only is the US. Lie much higher, higher income US patients experience cost related access problems.

368
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:30,770
Almost more than. Anyone in any other country.

369
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:36,630
Low or high income? So that's pretty astounding when we think about that,

370
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:44,160
that fits with what we know about the US health care system, what we know when we look at expenditures,

371
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:53,640
that it's so costly for everyone, even higher income, even well insured patients, though we're not so worried about them.

372
00:56:53,640 --> 00:57:00,480
But you can see that in this. Grauwe.

373
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,890
So then this is the overall ranking.

374
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:13,420
Across these different measures.

375
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:29,850
So access to care for us is at the bottom of the there's only 11 countries study here care process this is that preventive care, coordinated care.

376
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:38,900
Engagement ring care. So the coordination across different kinds of providers.

377
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:54,730
We've already talked about a little bit about the fragmentation in the US system.

378
00:57:54,730 --> 00:58:06,970
Care process, though, we are at the top, so that's good care process matters a lot, that sepsis measure the lowest levels of post-operative sepsis.

379
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:14,040
That's about a process measure. That's where a better process in the health system.

380
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:22,290
In is going to make a big difference. So we've done we we know who we can deliver really high quality care,

381
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:33,120
some of the the cancer care and cancer care actually is a surprising one because it requires a lot of coordination and yet coordination of care.

382
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:46,860
We're actually not very good at it most for most health care outcomes or diseases.

383
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:59,140
All right, so. What do you think?

384
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:02,520
You like I'm just numb. How could I possibly think about this?

385
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:08,900
There's just too many issues, right? I know it's a lot.

386
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:18,890
But trying to actually keep some of these different things and think about starting to think about how do they relate to each other?

387
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:26,510
Talked about the financing of the system, the complicated employer sponsored health insurance, Medicare,

388
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:36,680
Medicaid in the US spending, how that contributes to what we spend now, just a little window in on.

389
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:47,830
What is that getting us? What are these different outcomes, what what are the different quality measures, what does that tell us?

390
00:59:47,830 --> 01:00:08,700
How do they connect to each other? What do you think?

391
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:34,260
Abby. Um.

392
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:42,420
It's counterintuitive, but again, equity issues explain a lot about the US health care system, right?

393
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:50,670
So sometimes students will say, well, yeah, but we can see some we do have the best health care because we can deliver it in this place,

394
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:57,020
in this place and this place or this system and this system.

395
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:10,160
Other countries can deliver it across the board, and so, OK, population size, country size, worldliness, morality, all of those things.

396
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:22,490
None of these. Oh, come on. Is it fair? Not sure what that means exactly to compare across the US,

397
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:32,120
but you can't call it the best if you can't produce it in all of the health care right across the country.

398
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:44,260
But you're right, that is a big challenge. It's not that we can't do it for care process in other ways when it's a real health care amenable.

399
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:50,610
Issue, we just can't seem to ensure that we're doing it everywhere.

400
01:01:50,610 --> 01:02:08,940
Evy. I want to speak out to.

401
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:22,320
So which is the best state?

402
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:34,530
Yeah, so and we know that that quality on a lot of measures will be better in Massachusetts than other states, but we typically find.

403
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:49,800
There as often as much variation within as we do across, because we are not for a variety of reasons, some of them about health care and process.

404
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:56,070
So Massachusetts has tried to change the way they pay for care and who gets access to care.

405
01:02:56,070 --> 01:03:03,400
Maryland is another one, right? The way they pay for care.

406
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:10,850
But there are issues that are outside of health care delivery that are also matter here.

407
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:19,600
Right. Yeah, I was going to give us strength because, I mean, we have very few, but we do have a strength.

408
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:25,060
I think the US has a very strong, like large, well-trained workforce.

409
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:29,980
Like we have a lot of like specialties. And clinics like Mayo Clinic has their own specialties.

410
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:36,580
So we have a lot of hospitals that specialize in specific things. And so it's good for very specific care.

411
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:41,470
And, of course, a weakness, I think, like our health expenditure is the worst overall.

412
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:46,580
So, I mean, there are a lot of weaknesses, but I think that's one predominantly really big one.

413
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:59,630
OK, so definitely we have some of the best care, maybe the best in a lot of ways and in different health systems or places, so we can do it.

414
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:03,230
We know we can do it. We have models for how to do it.

415
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:11,720
But we're we're clearly not doing it. And yet we're spending more than than all of these other countries.

416
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:22,700
So when we think about the value proposition of health care in the US, that's where we should all be concerned.

417
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:33,830
If we were spending the most and getting the best quality and outcomes, we might be we might be OK with that.

418
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:54,220
We might say it's worth 18 percent of our GDP. There's a there's another hand over here.

419
01:04:54,220 --> 01:05:05,440
And I guess I would not want to move on to the.

420
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:12,340
We have, as we have. Yes.

421
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:29,030
And. I wonder how long.

422
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:36,020
Facebook did not help, but it resulted in better health.

423
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:42,760
OK, so we have to try to think about it, it's either.

424
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:49,870
Reform the whole system. Throw it out and start over, right, or we have to think about individual kind of interventions.

425
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:54,430
Right. And that's the other way to try to make sense of all of these different things.

426
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:58,480
I can't do something about all of them, but maybe there are a few places. Right.

427
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:08,860
So that's the other way to try to think about this. OK, so Japan lots all of these systems have more primary care providers than the US.

428
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:13,150
Japan has a lot. They also have a lot of visits. Right.

429
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:17,960
But I think we mentioned the other day their visits are actually very short.

430
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:26,720
So it's not necessarily a model we want to emulate as providing better quality care.

431
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:34,840
Now, when we go to CBS, we're not going there for prescriptions, we're going there to pick up our medication.

432
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:39,470
So CBS is not actually able to deliver that.

433
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:45,110
We still need a physician or another provider who can prescribe.

434
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:49,370
Right to do that. So in Japan, they're physically going to the doctor.

435
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:55,630
There are now other ways that you can get that prescription in the US.

436
01:06:55,630 --> 01:07:05,850
Right. So some people are going to use a patient portal, for example, or there might be some other ways that you can do that over the phone.

437
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:12,890
The VA, which is sort of like that German or the U.K. model, the VA,

438
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:21,680
once you're an established patient and patients who go to the VA are not just veterans, they have an income.

439
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:31,580
There's an income threshold to their low income veterans, but they will get their medications sent directly to them right in the mail.

440
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,290
It will be set up like that.

441
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:43,400
So all of those kinds of mechanisms might be much better than having to go to the doctor in order to get that prescription.

442
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:50,840
But where we have some places where that's being done really well and using different kinds of technologies,

443
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:57,170
the issue in the US is you don't have insurance, you're not getting any prescription.

444
01:07:57,170 --> 01:08:08,460
Right. You're not going to be able to to get access typically to the provider or to pay out of pocket, depending on what it is.

445
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:13,200
But that's a way to think about what kind of an intervention and how that might compare

446
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:19,410
to another country that might be a place where the US might be doing some things better,

447
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:34,540
and how could we expand that kind of care more broadly?

448
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:46,840
Fadi. I was just thinking about, like, how the US does better with specialty care, specifically when we were talking about some specialty care.

449
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:52,000
Yeah, yeah. So like with breast cancer, you know, we're better in that way.

450
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,790
But then we were worse with disease burden and like respiratory disease burden, some other ones.

451
01:08:57,790 --> 01:09:09,180
But I'm just wondering, like in other countries, is breast cancer as common as it is here in the other countries that we're comparing to?

452
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:21,840
I don't have data on like rates we could get into a whole debate about breast cancer, about screening and are we over screening in the US.

453
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:28,790
And so some of that, you know, your cure rate is really high if you are identifying.

454
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:40,640
Not a problem. So so there is a there is a little bit of some variation in countries in screening levels that might be part of what's going on there.

455
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:45,530
I don't think I mean, there are environmental factors that affect breast cancer.

456
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:49,130
And some of you might know this literature better than I do,

457
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:57,080
but we shouldn't expect huge variation across these countries in, say, rates of breast cancer.

458
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:04,850
So I think cancer care is an area where we often have fairly good quality care.

459
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:10,910
In the US, the cervical cancer on the same slide was a little confusing.

460
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:17,690
But there cervical cancer is access to screening is really important.

461
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:23,370
I mean, similar to breast cancer. And if if women don't have.

462
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:30,760
Access to doctors to get screened, they have high rates of cervical cancer.

463
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:38,320
For the criteria question, I often see life expectancy as a as a function of how strong our health care system is,

464
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:45,100
but it seems to me that, like, it's not a great it's not a great measurement because a lot of life expectancy is based on health behavior.

465
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:53,380
So I feel like if the US has a year, then maybe maybe it's not going to judge our health care based on life expectancy.

466
01:10:53,380 --> 01:11:02,410
So maybe it's not a good criteria. So life expectancy is not a great measure if we're talking about health care only because you're right.

467
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:06,820
Think about the soccer match again, social determinants of health.

468
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:15,280
Right. So health behavior. Yes, but broader issues of social determinants of health, which we're going to we're going to be talking about next.

469
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:23,770
But remember when we looked at social expenditures across some of these countries,

470
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:34,540
last class when we were looking about what explains why we spend so much more and yet our health outcomes don't seem to be better.

471
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:43,570
So there's something about health care delivery, how it's financed, how much is spent, how it's organized.

472
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:49,090
But it's also something to do with the rest of the soccer team.

473
01:11:49,090 --> 01:12:01,330
What's happening in the country. About social spending that's affecting the social determinants of health.

474
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:07,870
And that we haven't looked at here, but that's exactly the difference between some of these countries.

475
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:19,870
That's the question to ask, what else is going on not just about health care, but about the rest of society that's influencing health.

476
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:30,200
It might even have something to do with these some of these health outcomes, because if people show up for care and they are sicker.

477
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:42,500
They are poorer. It's going to be much harder to to pay for the care alone to make a difference, right?

478
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:48,390
Recovery might be more challenging for people who have comorbidities.

479
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:57,370
Or or have obesity. Or some other challenge if they can't go home.

480
01:12:57,370 --> 01:13:04,920
Where they have. Adequate housing or food or someone to help support them.

481
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:10,410
Those things are going to matter, and that's definitely partly the story here.

482
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:21,230
When we look at some of these outcomes that isn't captured when we look only at health care delivery.

483
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:29,390
Yeah, I was going to say something similar to what you just touched on, but it seems like if we increase access, we found ways to increase access.

484
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:37,280
A lot of the other areas that were in the mirror mirror paper would also increase because as you just talked about,

485
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:44,090
like I think a lot of people and a lot of Americans don't get health care until they absolutely need to.

486
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:52,970
And so if we had higher access to health care, maybe we could catch a lot of these things earlier, which would then increase health outcomes.

487
01:13:52,970 --> 01:14:00,620
And I don't know if that's the same in other if other countries are better at that and have better preventative care and and higher access,

488
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:13,550
if that is why they have higher outcomes. So definitely higher access is a factor with other countries because nobody is waiting.

489
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:20,000
To have to go to the doctor because of cost, because you don't have you know,

490
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:28,570
you don't have access in some ways, all of these are universal access to care.

491
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:39,700
Through a variety of means, that means you're not going to wait as long as you're less likely to use an emergency room or some kind of location,

492
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:45,970
that is not the appropriate place for you to get care.

493
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:54,350
So that's going to be a big part of the story. But it isn't the only piece that's the connection.

494
01:14:54,350 --> 01:15:01,670
So access is a key thing that's missing and different about the US.

495
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:08,580
And some things about the way the social spending in other countries.

496
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:16,050
I think while we're on the topic of social determinants and this is kind of plays off of our book that we read in Book Club on preventative care,

497
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:17,310
but our whole infrastructure,

498
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:24,930
the United States is based around an infrastructure for the sick instead of health throughout the whole life course from birth to death.

499
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:29,130
And I think and I'm sure a humongous challenge at this point in our history.

500
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:36,390
But if we could try to change to get closer to a managed birth to death infrastructure,

501
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:41,010
then we'd start addressing at least some of the social determinants early on and

502
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:50,130
educating early on to help prevent some of these things related to obesity, food choices, environmental factors, living in housing.

503
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:54,060
But I know that's like a humungous job. And that so.

504
01:15:54,060 --> 01:16:03,330
So you're absolutely right. Right. Our health care system is a sickness care system that's been set up from the beginning.

505
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:08,400
The financing story tells us that we have a sickness care system.

506
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:20,150
Right. Health insurance came about because if you need to go to the hospital or see a doctor,

507
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:26,140
we're going to establish an insurance plan that's those early health insurance plans, right.

508
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:35,220
That helped spur the health care system. We know in 1883, Germany said.

509
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:40,750
We're going to ensure health of the people who live in Germany.

510
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:48,240
Right, we're going to ensure housing and other kinds of resources for people.

511
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:55,660
That's a very different way of thinking about it. Canada, the U.K., some of these other countries, it's not that old.

512
01:16:55,660 --> 01:17:01,080
It was mid 20th century. Think about what was happening in the US in nineteen forty seven.

513
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:10,080
Yes, this is post-World War Two for everybody. U.K., Canada, the US.

514
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:22,200
Remember, that's when the private insurance took off in the US, and that's at the moment when we really establish employer sponsored insurance.

515
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:30,260
The UK said, let's establish national health insurance or National Health Service.

516
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:39,450
So very different ways of thinking about it that have kids that continue to have exactly those implications.

517
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:52,490
And so we still have the sickness fund, the sickness. Care system, whereas other countries have established a health care system.

518
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:59,540
Which is why we talk about individual interventions and what they can do or do we say.

519
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:11,180
Scrap the system, start over, establish a national health insurance model, a staff established that's Medicare for all, establish something different.

520
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:16,780
Each state does something maybe that's more like the Canadian system.

521
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:28,700
I don't think anybody is proposing the National Health Service like the UK for the US, but that would be a different model.

522
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:36,710
So each of these things is pushing on and connected to the other, and that's part of the challenge then to.

523
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:44,040
To. Scrap it and start over when we've got this complex system is.

524
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:51,330
Is not something that would necessarily work or be simple to do.

525
01:18:51,330 --> 01:19:01,860
OK, so Thursday, we're going to come back to looking at prices a little bit more to be thinking about.

526
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:12,390
OK, now we have this sense of how much spending it is, what's going on in variation across the country to some extent, and what's driving that?

527
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:20,670
We're going to be talking this is Thursday. And next Tuesday, we're going to be talking about some of the alternative payment models that are

528
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:27,630
trying to that are that are trying to address some of the spending issues.

529
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:38,550
And then you're going to be thinking about for next weekend which country and why, if you had to pick one, which would it be?

530
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:46,550
What what is the international model that you'd want to be a patient in?

531
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:57,380
OK, see you on Thursday. Hi to all of them.

532
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:11,370
What's your name again, John. John. Like I said, oh, OK, so I saw your comment for this, but I didn't see any comments on paper.

533
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:23,890
OK, they're so hard on you.

534
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:30,988
So, yeah, I don't see any comments on that in the paper.
