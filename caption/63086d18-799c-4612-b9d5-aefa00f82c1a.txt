1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:13,390
Five 3705 That painting completely disappears after you.

2
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Recording in Congress. He.

3
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:35,750
Sure. But thank you. Okay.

4
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:50,670
Can on a 6 to 8.

5
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:17,880
See. Good morning, everybody. And for those of you just joining us, we have Kennedy in front of the room.

6
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,360
So you have it. You got it all and you won some candy, maybe some chocolate.

7
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:37,300
And those of you who are at home and decided not to come to class, you're lost.

8
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:52,810
Okay. Now, let's continue our discussion on the problem, what we are doing we were tackling last time.

9
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:59,590
And the question is, how do you remember there was an immigrant?

10
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:15,070
The question was about immigrants coming to the U.S. and they and India was there was a disease that the prevalence of that disease was 5%.

11
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:28,060
And we want and and so if we accept an immigrant with a disease, then it costs the economy $100,000.

12
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:38,620
If we accept an immigrant without a visa and the person who contributed to the economy $10,000,

13
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:47,830
and we have the option how to be more accepting or rejecting an immigrant.

14
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:59,050
We can perform a test that this is not perfect. I can decide based on the test whether or not a person has a disease, are not reading,

15
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,780
decide whether to reject or are made and the course of the past that.

16
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,870
But we don't have that. So we don't have the cost of the test yet.

17
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:22,130
Right. So but so what we are looking at is, you know, getting the decision tree first and.

18
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:32,330
Liam. He was your age to be near.

19
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:44,610
With results. You.

20
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:59,010
Okay. So well, let's it we're going to build a decision tree and figure out what's the optimal strategy

21
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:08,290
of the government and see how much the government's willing to pay for the debt.

22
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:18,540
Right. And so what? So the question is to you, you remember, do you have any idea that you finish that problem?

23
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,399
And then how much does the government we would pay for it?

24
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,830
Guess how much was what the government would need to or would be willing to pay for the things.

25
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,120
Just give me a number. 4500.

26
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,260
But if 500, then let's take a look.

27
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,880
We haven't finished. So remember that we decide.

28
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,440
So we build out of the tree first the over part of the tree.

29
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:57,120
And decided the over part of the tree is so these.

30
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,410
Let's say that we decide not to do the test.

31
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:10,170
And then there's the decision of being the immigrant, or we get the immigrant right without performing the test.

32
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:19,400
And if we admit they are the immigrant, then that person can have the disease or not with probability 5% and 95%.

33
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:31,410
No. Right. And therefore, the expected value of that immigrant, even if you are mean, is 40 $500.

34
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:40,070
If you expect that value, if you're a Yankee zero between zero and 40 $500 to American 4500.

35
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:53,130
So on average, for every immigrant that you accept, on average, you're going to get 4500 75% of them.

36
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:59,550
But on top of that, he's got 95% of them are not and will contribute to their nationality.

37
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:06,870
Right. So that was the the decision that we make if we don't perform the test.

38
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,230
But if we perform that test, what can happen?

39
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,340
Well, we have a chance.

40
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:20,160
No. Right. And so we do something that we don't know what's going to happen.

41
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:33,809
And they are. Two branches and the branches are going to be these branches are going to be that, you know, a positive test or in negative.

42
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:39,080
With this I saw the immigrant test positive for the immigrant tests negative.

43
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:53,810
Test positive. And this negative.

44
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:25,640
And then is the person what if that person is positive?

45
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:35,610
Then you need to make a decision over whether to renew or meet and you have regained or to meet that person.

46
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,860
If you you are being the person that can have the disease or not.

47
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,730
And we have a complete appreciation that they can.

48
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,430
Oh, okay. You know, use after class.

49
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:03,650
So I have someone that can do is coping that swiftly and be in place here.

50
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:12,220
So I base of training. They base a century.

51
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,860
And so I have now they complete three.

52
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,889
But what I don't have is a well, they're right.

53
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:38,990
Probably it is. And sell them though for free. So if I perform the test, that best is going to cost me something, right?

54
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,119
So this is going to be equal to they of the test.

55
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:57,370
So I'm going to put that negative whatever the cost of the test is the laser because of the effect that cost of that potential, the test here.

56
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:05,380
So that's going to be whenever I put the cause of the test is going to be so that point.

57
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:14,679
What else do we need to know? Well, those are posterior probabilities, right, that we would need to change.

58
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,169
So they the outcomes they pay so far are same, you know,

59
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:32,530
10,000 contribution to the national economy if that person is healthy and -100,000 if the person has a disease and if you reject, then nothing.

60
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:42,280
So we we know that the prior probabilities of this fatal nature are 5% and 95%.

61
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:47,379
But if you if that person tests positive, right.

62
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,700
What is the probability that that person has the disease?

63
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:54,070
That's what we we use pain theory to figure it out.

64
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:00,190
And if the person is positive, what is the probability that that person has the disease?

65
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,190
Hundred percent. And not having the disease is 0%.

66
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:13,480
So is going to be equal to the person test positive 200%.

67
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,870
And if that person test negative is.

68
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:33,770
0%. However, is that person test negative?

69
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:42,050
Yeah. There is still a small possibility that that person has the disease, but there's a decent number.

70
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,520
So is point 5% number here.

71
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:59,810
So I'm going to put blue or these one in the 80 to 99.5%.

72
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:12,100
Right. So we have two more probabilities to set here.

73
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:18,250
What is the probability that that person tested positive and the probability of detection test negative?

74
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,160
And we already calculated those at 4.5% and 95.5%.

75
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:38,170
That is, if if you take an immigrant and before administering the test, you want to figure it out, you know that you are monitoring the test,

76
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:49,030
that that person's 4.5 probability, percent probability of testing positive at 95.5% probability of testing negative.

77
00:12:49,210 --> 00:13:00,570
Does that mean that there's that that that if the person tests positive, actually, if the person tests positive, you know, that person have 56.

78
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,209
But but is the person test negative?

79
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,080
Right. You don't know exactly if that person will have the disease.

80
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:17,440
So is that person test negative? There is still, you know, any chance of that person has loses and.

81
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,760
Okay, so these probabilities will be.

82
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:31,740
9045. And.

83
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,400
Equal to. 95.5.

84
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,750
For. Right. And now we have our answer.

85
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,500
Right. So so what's the.

86
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:03,460
And so the answer is, you know, if I take the test, the cost of the test is zero.

87
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:11,410
Right? So the best decision would be to do the test.

88
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:20,290
Right. And even test a positive, then reject if the test is negative.

89
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:33,460
And I mean, so if you test negative, you have an expectation of $9,424 per meeting.

90
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:43,510
Right. If that test is positive and you're either going to reject, you know, that your expectation is zero.

91
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:56,400
Right. So you are not going to meet an immigrant with this so that you will make your expectation for in the run up to $9,000.

92
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,120
So from 4500 per immigrant.

93
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:09,000
Now you have in 9000 or 34% if the test is zero in the course of the ten year zero.

94
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:13,570
So how much would you be willing to pay for that test?

95
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,950
You should have which.

96
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,480
We're willing to pay for it. The same willingness.

97
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:41,460
To take me for the test.

98
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:51,640
So therefore we pulled out. Remember that the value of sample information.

99
00:15:53,470 --> 00:16:04,780
In this case, it's going to be $9,000 that you could do with an X -40 $500 and you can do without it.

100
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:10,570
So it's 40 $500. So you are right.

101
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:18,520
So it's a $2,000 minus for you.

102
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:35,490
So 20 $500. You're kidding me.

103
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,900
When you put in exactly 4500s, it's switches.

104
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,830
So if you pull it so that that's that we need to pay for that test.

105
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,260
Right. So if you you know,

106
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:15,180
if you put 40 $500 here instead of zero that you are you are in different right between either performing the test or at meeting, you know.

107
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:26,690
All right. So if you want example, if you put a little bit less than 4500 or it is a 44,

108
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:37,240
44, 99, right, then you feel at that point you will perform the test, right?

109
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,640
Because it's less than than your willingness to pay.

110
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:48,080
So in this case, is your your expectation will be 45 or one and then you perform the test.

111
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,690
But the at exactly 40 $500, then you breakeven.

112
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:01,210
And when you break even, you have 40 $500 here and 40 $500 here.

113
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,780
So it tells you, you know, I need everybody.

114
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:13,010
But just breaking the tie randomly, you show the bottom part of the century.

115
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:20,240
Sure. Because I got not 925, not just cash rate, 9000 against me.

116
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:32,950
This is the bottom. Yeah. Like this part right now, you see 4500 because the cost of the intensive 4500, right.

117
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,979
Yeah. I got like you got 9000 and I got 9000.

118
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,070
25. I don't know what I did wrong.

119
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,170
See if I want zero. So you can see all the numbers.

120
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:58,840
It could be a problem of rounding if you didn't click on the sale of Improbabilities.

121
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:05,420
Right. So I have 100%, 0% point 15 to 36%.

122
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,590
99.47%. Right.

123
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:17,959
And and, you know, -800,010 thousand.

124
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:28,700
-800,010 thousand. Right. And then here you have 49 and 24 and here -100.

125
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:38,660
You're saying you should have 4530, -45, which is the best two.

126
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:51,660
And here you should have 4924, which is the best we need at least 4500 to 0.

127
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,290
I put this zero in there in the wrong place.

128
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:01,580
So this is this is the range.

129
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,820
I was 43.

130
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:16,760
And the cost of it is what I wanted to. The root cause of the spread.

131
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:24,990
The cost of the test is zero. And, you know, this is this is how I got the 9000.

132
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:32,420
It. Right.

133
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,390
Okay. And these probabilities need to be changed.

134
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:47,660
So the probability of test positive probability of test negative and they can all be 5% and 95% anymore because they is not perfect.

135
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:53,410
The information is not for. Quite so.

136
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,720
So willingness to pay for the pass or the ACI is 40 $500.

137
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:14,280
And the question that she was killed would be, you know, how hard was your answer to the question in part, a change if X increases to 10%.

138
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,450
So let's see if the prevalence of the disease changes to 10%.

139
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:29,950
So we have here a 10% probability and then everything change.

140
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:39,790
And now what we have is that a patient for even the rent is $8,000.

141
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:47,500
Right. And they are the ultimate decision is inform the test.

142
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:56,590
If the test is positive, then is that this is positive, get if this is negative,

143
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:10,240
then I read right and but if you don't perform the test, the best decision for you would be to get a 10%.

144
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:20,920
You know, if you don't perform, if you perform the test, then you if the test is positive, test is negative and then you have me.

145
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,879
But if you don't perform that test,

146
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:38,080
the best decision will be reject everybody because the only speculation you'll be making is zero in the your your expectation will be well

147
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:46,870
actually but expectation you'll be losing $1,000 per immigrant then between this thousand dollars per 80 or zero you prefer to weeks you.

148
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,820
But of course, you have the test and that's why you do that.

149
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,830
Well, so let me you a cell phone to bring me, right.

150
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:15,980
She too. So what were they?

151
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:23,090
The question now here is how much would you be willing to pay for that?

152
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:29,110
At that point. Go to $8,000.

153
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:40,600
Right. So now if they you know, if if the prevalence of the disease is, you know, greater than 5%, that is 10%.

154
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:51,400
And so 5% now that this is more valuable to you, because you can go from 0 to $2000 will be anything you'll be willing to pay more for that this.

155
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:06,700
And. Is E.

156
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:20,690
So to he. For the past.

157
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:40,840
Is. Was it kept in the name of the.

158
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:54,140
And. Robert KRULWICH.

159
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:07,490
So question to you is, I don't have the part here and I erased the part or there was a question.

160
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:11,810
A Yeah, what was the question?

161
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:21,680
Central an x is five. What is the largest value of T at which the US government will choose to test potential immigrants from the disease?

162
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:28,370
What if 100 or so. So we knew that they have been.

163
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:42,409
So we know a, B and then follow C would be is X is equal to 5% and the is equal to 500 billion.

164
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:50,510
And what is the government optimal strategy is X is equal to five and B is equal to 500.

165
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:59,510
Well, we know that at X equal to five, these 40 $500 or $500 that the government will be willing to pay.

166
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:07,230
Right. So is nine going to run out of here and I change these 5%?

167
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,270
And the cost of repairs is $500.

168
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:31,660
If I get 30 $500 per immigrant, then the decision is passed right on and through the Senate is test positive of me.

169
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:36,190
I'm sorry, test positive. And he's test negative of me.

170
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,390
So that's your best strategy here?

171
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:47,500
And 500 or so, remember, we need to we need to get up to 40 $500 for that decision to change.

172
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:59,320
And if that decision changes at, you know, I'm putting 500 notices that say the cost of the test is $5,000,

173
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:04,450
then you decide to admit everybody don't do that.

174
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:10,540
That's just that means everybody right now, if the prevalence of that disease is 10%,

175
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:20,680
the other hand they're saying they put a zero figure for the prevalence of the disease is 10%.

176
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:33,520
Suppose are the broadening of the disease is 10% and they the cost of the test is 80 $500.

177
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:40,940
Well you. If the use of the cost of the tests is 80 $500.

178
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,830
Yeah. Just reject everybody creatively learning something too.

179
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:53,100
Because you know you'll be willing to pay way thousand dollars for the [INAUDIBLE] out of it.

180
00:27:53,450 --> 00:28:04,820
If the cost of the test is more than $8,000, then it's not worth it to you so that you just your best decision is not to perform the test.

181
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,709
And if you don't perform the test,

182
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:20,780
your best decision is we get the rebate because you're going to remember you are going to it's going to be a negative flow to the economy.

183
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:30,529
But I know low prevalence and I'm a reasonable person.

184
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:37,670
They pass the test and you don't test those programs.

185
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,440
You'll meet everybody. I'm Dr. Mendez.

186
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:57,170
Could you go to the bottom of the decision tree, please? Should you remember in this situation, I changed the prevalence of the disease to 10%.

187
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:02,630
Right? And I put the cost of equal to zero.

188
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:37,020
Thank you. Okay.

189
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,000
So, you know, you know, they think I'm sort of like that.

190
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:55,560
So you see. So you have the, you know, all dancers.

191
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:58,719
So you are on your own.

192
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:06,680
You're going to be next. Probably not able to do next week, but you have a good.

193
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:28,190
I hear. 959 4959 for you to do it as an ambulance.

194
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:37,160
The formula for all. But.

195
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,510
Yeah. Yeah. Let's go to.

196
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,270
It's November 3rd session.

197
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,790
Right. And I would like for you to download.

198
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:11,070
We already finished growing 9.3, but I want you to download these PowerPoint slides that are linear programing.

199
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:25,160
Something to download that had anything to. And we are going to start talking today about resource allocation.

200
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:30,049
In particular, we are going to talk about leading programing.

201
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:37,340
So it's optimization so that the idea of this part of the in the in class,

202
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:49,900
we are going to have a situation in which you can make decisions and the decisions we need to do so.

203
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,840
So our goal will be optimize certain objective function.

204
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:00,739
Maybe we are we're making decisions to maximize profit or maximize revenue or minimize

205
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:09,140
cost or maximize life or save so that we have a goal and we are trying to optimize.

206
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:17,540
Our goal is and optimization will be making that best of a constrained resource situation.

207
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:30,590
So there is there's going to be some decision problem in which you can have your view or be able to make many different decisions.

208
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:46,280
And true decisions will lead you to different outcomes, different and different outputs in terms of payoffs or costs or whatever.

209
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:50,000
And what you want to do is arrange, you know,

210
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:58,580
manage the use that resources in the best possible way so as to optimize something that you're looking for.

211
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:06,590
So let's let's start by looking at the a problem here.

212
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:18,370
And then it reads The administrator of the Surgical Specialty Deviation of North Park University Hospital Medical Center is studying the.

213
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:31,089
Is studying the potential impact of a planned marketing program on to high volume short stay inpatient procedures,

214
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:35,500
both produced by the division of Medicare Medicare patient population.

215
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:42,550
These procedure shot of the labeled the IQ one and two in the hospital's case based coding system.

216
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:50,470
The Divisions and Divisions Hospital Service Unit has excess capacity for additional inpatient,

217
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:59,590
with capacity expressed in terms of inpatient days, nursing servings and nursing service hours and diagnostic procedures payable per month.

218
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:06,610
But the unit, the administrator, knows the amount of reimbursement from the Medicare agency for each the key.

219
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:16,330
The hospital's accounting system provides the Medicare reimbursement amount as follows The new one is 21, 25 and 3220 500.

220
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:26,860
Northpark University Hospital Medical Center has developed a cost accounting information system that provides the following information on unit costs.

221
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:37,360
The inpatient days cost $600 per day, nursing services $40 per hour diagnostic procedure, $75 for proceeding.

222
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:47,350
The hospital management engineering staff has also carried out a cost finding study

223
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:52,960
on high volume drugs for use in the case mix analysis management information system.

224
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,940
The study provides information on resources consumed for each of the duty are used to

225
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:04,649
review the average length of stay one who are two and one based on the same thing.

226
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,420
Nursing hours of diagnostic procedure you have.

227
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:19,450
How how many of these resources you want and need to consume exist service capacity on the surgical special duty these as photo

228
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:30,880
inpatient bases 120 days prolonged nursing service hours nine going to promotions and diagnosing prosecuting under 60 per month.

229
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,840
So working with management in you need to improve the hospital.

230
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:40,389
The administrator wants to want to compute the optimal needs of into the ideas that will

231
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:46,060
maximize the net revenue within the excess capacity available on the nursing unit.

232
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,860
And to determine where to place emphasis on the marketing campaign,

233
00:35:50,890 --> 00:36:02,020
let's concentrate on number one on the question is so if you have an idea what what's that we are trying to do,

234
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:07,630
you need to decide how many of the ICU ones do you do?

235
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:14,860
You need to ask you. Right. In order to maximize net revenue for every drug you want and do,

236
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:21,670
you are going to use some excess resource capacity that you have a certain number of nursing hours

237
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:29,770
and number of patient days and number of diagnostic proceed procedure test right and they cost.

238
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:37,419
All right so that that take out of the Medicare reimbursement you have the Medicare reimbursement you

239
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:49,240
have to subtract the cost of of of of the elements of the idea in order to find out that it's heavy duty.

240
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:57,670
And then you have to decide how many of those you are going to ask you to maximize your revenue.

241
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:05,410
You have a certain amount of excess capacity that you can not exceed.

242
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:18,760
For example, you cannot exceed the number of innovation days, that extra inpatient days that you have, you have 120 extra patient days per month.

243
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:25,280
You cannot exceed that. So you get between the year you want number of the new ones and growing you do.

244
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:31,510
You cannot exceed the extra. I cannot exceed or exceed 120 per month.

245
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:38,250
The nursing service service hours. You cannot exceed more than 900 per month and the songs.

246
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:46,360
Okay, so what I want to do now is express is see if we can.

247
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,590
First. Now that we read this problem,

248
00:37:53,590 --> 00:38:06,160
let's see if we can create a shorthand and write these in some kind of algebraic or mathematical way that we can all understand.

249
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:12,730
So get the abstraction, get, get, get the we're not talking about impatient hours.

250
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:16,500
We end up looking about I don't see procedure. We're talking about do point.

251
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:24,280
It is that we need to manage in order to maximize dynamic revenue each and other quantity.

252
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,900
So let's put that in some sort of mathematical way that we can manipulate.

253
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:36,820
Okay. So keep any open excel in this case.

254
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:45,600
I'm going to open in you. Then you watch it.

255
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:58,940
And I'm going to write down first the information that I got from the.

256
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:12,469
Now. I have. Well, it's all accounting system.

257
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:17,330
So reimbursement is. So we have the only one and the only two.

258
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:37,920
I can't even. You are the key to.

259
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:49,670
And then here we have the reimbursement Medicare reimbursement rate.

260
00:39:52,400 --> 00:40:12,530
So pretty sure. And then the reimbursement for do you want to or are?

261
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:21,110
21, 25, 21, 25, ¥40 on YouTube.

262
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,530
2520 525.

263
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:31,530
Okay. So I'm going to to figure out a for each unit.

264
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:46,560
One and two, I'm going to figure out what is the net revenue for each one and the two that I that I am going to escape.

265
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,270
So this is the range. 21, 25, 2500.

266
00:40:51,750 --> 00:41:00,750
Now, I would like to I know that the cost.

267
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:15,500
So that's a reimbursement exceeding costs. The number of inpatient days.

268
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:22,370
The number of resources.

269
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:55,590
It was an inpatient day. The patient is nursing service hours.

270
00:41:55,590 --> 00:42:04,570
Something was interesting. And.

271
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:15,770
Nursing. I was.

272
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:26,830
Like most procedures. And for the DRC.

273
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:32,140
One of the key to going to the heart of.

274
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:42,990
Sure. 210 3134.

275
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:52,350
To and to be.

276
00:42:54,260 --> 00:43:02,470
So do we know one, one, three and four, three, four.

277
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:11,890
And then this is amount and the cost of those resources.

278
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:45,000
Because a unit. So we had kind of the invasion days that nothing more serious than what are some diagnostic procedures here.

279
00:43:51,150 --> 00:44:02,600
Swing to the. 640 and 75 600 4870.

280
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:29,210
Sue 600. 600.

281
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:43,190
They can. They can. They can put this. His cost, unit cost.

282
00:44:47,530 --> 00:45:01,100
640. 75, right in cost per unit.

283
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:07,220
The presumption is that the dead.

284
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:27,820
Ian and Ken, good to hear. Number one resource amount.

285
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:38,540
Needed. Cost.

286
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:47,040
Look the in here in.

287
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,810
The cost per unit of cost per unit of the idea.

288
00:45:55,050 --> 00:46:09,070
For the R&D, then that's going to be to increase in days a 642, $10 an hour.

289
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:14,040
That's 43. That was impressive years at 75.

290
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:24,030
So I can do that. Some of these amount needed and the cost, you know, the total cost for the key one and two.

291
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,680
Right. So, again, this is some product.

292
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:40,739
The amount needed and the force per unit of their resources.

293
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:52,350
And I'm anchored on that range and 1825 2100.

294
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,370
So net revenue per dinghy.

295
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:16,000
This is going to be when you want 25 -18, 25 here, 300 and.

296
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,140
All right.

297
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:34,239
So so for every unit of the Yankee one that I had scheduled, I'm going to get a net revenue of $300 for every unit that voted to the rescue.

298
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,200
I'm going to get the net revenue of $400.

299
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,549
So question is, you know, what's the big deal now?

300
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:56,800
Yes, they, you know, get you as many the 18 to know the right because you get more net revenue, you get a higher revenue per unit.

301
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:04,719
So what would be the policy? Where would be the counter argument?

302
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:12,190
So instead of saying forget about the new one and get your increase in all the other things too,

303
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:20,140
why would it would that necessarily means patients need to do one?

304
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:27,430
Well, that's one one way to see that.

305
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:30,129
Yet the patients will need you one.

306
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:40,600
But if you suppose that you want to maximize your profit, it could be that for every did you want the tool that you can use, right?

307
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,600
You're using 30 nursing now, so you will be able to use fewer, right?

308
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:55,500
Even though the net revenues higher, do you think you are going to exhaust the number of nursing hours that you have posture?

309
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:06,909
Right. So the fact that they needed revenue is higher doesn't mean that you necessarily have to ignore the

310
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:13,390
other one simply because the other one can use fewer resources and allow you to schedule more.

311
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:18,510
Right. So this is net revenue, but also money.

312
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:27,850
So what we want to do is express them or, you know,

313
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:39,130
what we're trying to do in some mathematical way so we can actually, you know, figure out what's what's going on.

314
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:45,160
So I know that.

315
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:58,120
So I'm going to I'm going to write in in the text first what I want to do.

316
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:08,430
I can. I mean, let me do this without without the textbooks first.

317
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:12,980
So I want to maximize.

318
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:27,260
Net revenue rate. And.

319
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:36,490
I am going to her. So I need to I mean, starting here.

320
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:43,980
So I, you know, I need to decide how many BYU new and how many I need to was capable.

321
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:47,240
So I, I'm doing that. Number two.

322
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:54,980
Number two is number. Than you.

323
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:08,670
Getting up here drinking one. Not nearly two.

324
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:21,520
So. And those numbers are going to be here. Right. And what is that I want to do?

325
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:27,550
I want to maximize the total profit, right.

326
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:35,740
So they net net revenue. So they I know that in the net revenue per digi.

327
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:49,080
Is 300. What do you want for 100?

328
00:51:49,980 --> 00:52:06,810
What do you mean? So if I decide. What if I decide, for example, I want to escape your a hundred piv once and lose my net.

329
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:11,280
My net revenue to total net revenue.

330
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:36,110
It's going to be. The total net revenue is simply going to be there's some problem.

331
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:53,340
Mine is Carnegie Hall and they need revenue for drinking.

332
00:52:53,470 --> 00:53:03,040
Right. So in this case, will we be $110,000?

333
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:24,080
So it's. But I know that I cannot I cannot decide on any number here.

334
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,299
Okay. This is what my decisions are going to be.

335
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:34,790
I cannot decide on any number here because I have limited resources.

336
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:43,840
So the longer. Here.

337
00:53:51,220 --> 00:54:03,440
The weight of food resources used. Use and available.

338
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,520
Use and available.

339
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:23,730
Yeah. And so those are resources. And then I know, for example, the three resources that that I know that are going to be the in-patient days.

340
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:43,740
And he now wears. And diagnosing procedures.

341
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:58,950
And then I know that for the amount needed per the IEEE,

342
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:06,090
the inpatient day nurses have what some diagnosing procedures are going to be two and three, one, three, four.

343
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,620
So they don't compete at end here.

344
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:19,810
So that should be the number that I require.

345
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:30,270
So if if I have if I ask you a hundred, you want some 200 to get in to.

346
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:37,809
Then I'll be using 200 plus 200, 400 information days.

347
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:49,540
Right. And so on. So I can if, if I see some problem in these numbers and these numbers, I'm going to be able to figure it out.

348
00:55:49,540 --> 00:56:01,060
How many of them, each one of the resources I'm using if I decide to go for the 801 and 282.

349
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:05,440
So the number that I'm using is going to be.

350
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:18,510
Did you want to go to the numbers?

351
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:28,490
So I'm going to look in the mirror multiple times, the unit number or think they have 400.

352
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:34,580
7000 1100.

353
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:42,200
And I know that those numbers must be less than or equal than what I have available.

354
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,670
So you cannot exceed the number that I have available.

355
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,950
And the number that I have available is the.

356
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:11,220
129 360. The one 2900 360.

357
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:19,219
Right? Right now, immediately I can see that I can not escape to a hundred degree ones.

358
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:28,610
And you can do anything you do, because I will be first I will be using more information based I what I have.

359
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:33,500
So I'll be using 400 and I just have WEDI,

360
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:45,370
I'll be using more nursing networks that I have of using 7013 hours and I just have 900 and I'll be using the raw diagnosing procedures that I have.

361
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:49,930
I have 1100, I'm using 1160.

362
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:57,260
So that is not going to be a feasible solution or feasible decision.

363
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:04,700
So I could die saying, well, what about if I go instead of 350 and 50, right?

364
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,980
Oh, now I have one. That's enough.

365
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,850
That's not feasible yet. This is not feasible yet.

366
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:19,640
This is feasible in this case. But let's see.

367
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:30,800
I can put a city here, and now we have this still too high.

368
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:38,989
Let's see if they can have 40 here and still do high seas.

369
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:49,940
And 24 and 20 still too high and five.

370
00:58:52,940 --> 00:59:01,190
Three. So now, I mean, save 25.

371
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:08,530
So so you can play with these numbers until you get a quantity.

372
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:16,270
So a number of resource use that is less than what you have available.

373
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:27,610
So this will be feasible and you'll be making $10,900 right at all and you'd schedule three new ones when you filed in two.

374
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:31,120
So it's possible. It's feasible, but is that optimal?

375
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:34,780
I don't know. Is that can you do better?

376
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:48,819
You know, possibly. And so we cannot. So this template will allow us to to to keep track and how to play with the numbers

377
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:55,780
that we need to make decisions which we need to make decisions and figure it out,

378
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:57,939
though, if we are on the right track.

379
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:07,450
But it doesn't tell me what the action should I go in order to get the best that I can without being, you know, infeasible, right.

380
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:15,460
Or or in order to maintain stability by not using more of what I have.

381
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:25,030
So this is a common these type of problems in which everything that you see here is linear.

382
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:28,540
So we have a linear what we call get this function.

383
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:50,299
So what we want, we want to maximize our right net revenue and subject to some constraints and the constraints are linear, linear constrained.

384
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:56,540
So that means that we are just multiplying at constant times and variables.

385
01:00:56,540 --> 01:01:01,129
So these are variables that I need to decide on and everything.

386
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:04,190
All the calculations are just taking these variables.

387
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:09,080
So multiply that those two times constant,

388
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:23,360
so makes everything linear and then creates a problem that is amenable to solve like easily with a given algorithm.

389
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:32,690
Is coding the simplex method for linear programing and we know about how large the program is is very efficient.

390
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:38,089
It will go and solve the problems and figure it out in an efficient way.

391
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:42,540
What the optimal solution is. You know the answer.

392
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:49,160
But before we going to let you know where the algorithm is and how to use it,

393
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:56,150
I think we we need to get some intuition about what is that we're trying to do.

394
01:01:56,810 --> 01:02:07,520
And let's say that I want to to write these in in some sort of mathematical way.

395
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:19,129
Right. So these two numbers that I need to decide on there are going to be we are going to call them the direction variables,

396
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:27,380
the variables over which I have control so I can decide the number of the only one that I didn't do.

397
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:38,120
So those are decision variables. And these what I want to do optimize this.

398
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:42,650
This one is called the objective function.

399
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:50,389
So I am going to have it function of a linear function of the the social variables.

400
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:57,110
That is going to give me my objective and I'm going to manipulate these two numbers in

401
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:06,709
order to make these number as small or as large as possible without exceeding my resources.

402
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:13,100
These these are here are my constraints, right?

403
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:16,879
So I cannot exceed what I have.

404
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,780
I cannot exceed the resources that I have.

405
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:29,780
I'm using certain amount of resources in those in order to fulfill my in in order to accommodate my decisions.

406
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:37,220
And then a number of resources, the amount of resources that I'm using, I cannot exceed what I have.

407
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:46,160
So those are constrained and figured out that these numbers are linear functions of my decision variables.

408
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:51,979
So I just need I'm here multiplying three times two and 25 times one.

409
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:56,180
So it's a linear function and I get it right. It uses 31, right?

410
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:02,450
So everything that I have here is a linear combination of the decision variables,

411
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:05,980
either the objective function or the number of resources that it needs.

412
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:21,679
So let's actually I'm going to write this in the same problem in a more abstract mathematical way, which is going to be the same.

413
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:26,210
But I'm going to do that in a dense box.

414
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:37,980
So. And these will end up being one to maximize.

415
01:04:47,850 --> 01:05:01,830
So I want to maximize. And the generic name, the generic variable name for the objective function is the Z see Z equal to.

416
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:07,590
And now I'm going to get a linear combination of the ratio variables.

417
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,280
So this issue variables, I'm going to call them X and Y.

418
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:16,950
X is going to be the number of the new ones and y the number of that too.

419
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:22,950
So it's going to be 300 X plus.

420
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:34,780
Or wondered why. Again, I'm going to write here two letters.

421
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:40,890
So get to the. If you want to put in it.

422
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:48,450
It does have dated acidity. And then I'm going to write the constraints sub two.

423
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:53,460
So I cannot put any number for X and overlooked any longer for the Y.

424
01:05:54,040 --> 01:06:06,840
I have to satisfy the following constraints and then the constraints will be two way x plus y is less than 122 x.

425
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:17,170
Why is 10 to 20?

426
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:36,370
And then it's both citywide and citywide, less than or equal to.

427
01:06:39,390 --> 01:06:49,210
Hundred. And City X laws.

428
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:57,910
Worldwide. Less than or equal to 360.

429
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,730
So this, you know, is an abstraction, right?

430
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:09,570
So you don't know what X and Y are. We know that they are 91 and 92.

431
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:17,060
You don't know what these represent. But, you know, from translating the program, these are the number of these.

432
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:21,690
And you'll say inpatient days must be less than or equal to 1.1.

433
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:29,370
120 days. The number of nursing hours that you use will be less than equal to the hundred,

434
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:33,990
and the number of diagnostic procedures must be less than or equal to 36.

435
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:37,770
This is what is formulation is saying, right.

436
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:45,420
But, you know, X and Y now can be anything. So is it just a mathematical abstraction?

437
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:57,990
And you also be a good idea to add at the end that X and Y will be greater than or equal to zero.

438
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:12,170
So we're dealing with physical quantities. We are not dealing with the variables that we cannot have negatively eyes.

439
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:17,400
Right. So we can say, oh, one minus three the sum.

440
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:24,030
You know, some cases you might end up with with a solution.

441
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:35,220
Let's say if you are minimizing something that the minimal cost would be a pain point negative and you will think negative values,

442
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:38,790
values, and you don't want that, that doesn't mean anything.

443
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:47,820
That doesn't make any sense. So we usually people are dealing with, you know, physical quantities that need to be negative.

444
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:53,459
We put that and these are called the non-negative construct non negativity constraints.

445
01:08:53,460 --> 01:09:02,590
So we call that the non. You need.

446
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:13,590
Those trains. And these are still the function.

447
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:31,840
And X and Y are. The eggs and.

448
01:09:36,150 --> 01:09:41,130
Why the decision that it was made.

449
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:06,290
Okay. So why do I soothe fears?

450
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:12,810
Because, you know, it doesn't matter how big the problem is.

451
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:20,840
Linear program, the linear programing problem, they're always going to have these this shape.

452
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:29,089
So you're going to have this issue variables. Maybe not two, maybe you have a 20 or 30 or a thousand decision variables.

453
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:35,389
Right? And then we can call them either name calling, swiping story three.

454
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:40,040
It's four of the workings 1000 we can name however we want.

455
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:46,459
We are always going to have a an objective function that we want to optimize.

456
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:49,610
In this case, we're maximizing what we can minimize.

457
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:54,709
Right. And that's going to be a linear combination of the this issue very low.

458
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:57,890
So as many decision variables that we have,

459
01:10:57,890 --> 01:11:05,240
we can have a a linear function that ties the decision variable to your to what you

460
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:10,970
want to do with the cost to what you want to measure costs or revenue or whatever.

461
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:18,830
And then we have the resources consume or the constraints that you have that may not be resources determine.

462
01:11:19,490 --> 01:11:26,620
You know, I maybe you want to satisfy the man and you need to produce more than 70, you know.

463
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:37,490
And so those are your constraints and the constraints you must express that as linear combination of the decision variables, right?

464
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:45,319
Then that means that whatever X or Y or x one, x two, three is for you.

465
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:52,459
Multiply that times constant and then that that should give you the amount of resources

466
01:11:52,460 --> 01:12:00,230
that you are using or day how close to satisfying certain requirement you are.

467
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:05,750
And then the requirement should be expressed as a number.

468
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:07,100
You know what?

469
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:20,180
We have to sell more than these amount of items or I cannot exceed that more than this amount of this, you know, this, this, this amount of labor.

470
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:23,180
It cannot exceed that amount. So something like that.

471
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:36,320
So all linear combinations. And if we have that, that, that structure, then we can use any type of program.

472
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:49,990
We can use Excel to do that. But there are industrial type or size problems that we we get.

473
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:58,610
We can have the same type of formulation and put that in specialized in the same algorithm,

474
01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:09,860
but we will get it with more capacity to handle these numbers and then you'll get the solution right.

475
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:19,700
So what I would like to do is to give you the equation of what you are doing and then actually use are very good to solve this problem, right?

476
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:34,250
So in order to get the intuition of what we are doing, what we're going to do, because we have two decision variables Species X and Y,

477
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:43,190
we can represent all these, these two decision variables in a plane drive in the graphical way.

478
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:57,169
So we can imagine that these x so we can use a plane with Cartesian coordinates and this is going to be the x

479
01:13:57,170 --> 01:14:07,520
axis of this is that y is going to be they embody the y axis of any intersection of the coordinates of X and y.

480
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:11,450
We have a point, right? And that point is a possible solution.

481
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:16,010
So 25 and 50 then is going to be a point.

482
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:28,140
It's going to be impossible. So because, you know, we could do that graph quite easily, but h you know,

483
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:38,900
in canvas I put a graphical link to a graphing calculator so we can use to make our lives easier.

484
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:46,430
It is called the graphing calculator here, decimals in canvas.

485
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:55,170
So it's like playing decimals on how this X and Y.

486
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:59,760
Right. So this is going to be the x axis.

487
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:13,180
This is the Y axis. And what what I want to do now is represent my problem, exactly how I wrote the problem in in this in this play.

488
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:19,290
Right. So let's say they start doing the constraints first.

489
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:26,969
So we go to the constraints of the first constraint.

490
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:30,990
We'd like to to harvest the impatient base.

491
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:36,750
Right. So two weeks plus weighs less than less than or equal to 120.

492
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:48,110
So. So suppose that I want to graph the extent of the inequality.

493
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:53,630
If I want to graph the equation two x plus y equal 120.

494
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:59,970
How does it look on the plane? The X, Y and z know?

495
01:16:03,610 --> 01:16:08,350
What kind of fear do I have to explode?

496
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:20,080
Why is equal to one point? If I plug all the points x and y in the plane that satisfied to explode flies equal to one point.

497
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:24,590
What kind of feel they passed along the line?

498
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:33,190
Straight line, right? It is the same thing as saying y is equal to one t minus two x exactly the same.

499
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:40,420
So a intercept 20 minus two x is the slope, right and minus two is a slope.

500
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:52,060
So this should be going down and the intercept is going to be the y axis is going to be a so.

501
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:57,490
So let's do that to it because y is equal to 20.

502
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:14,740
See how we saw this. I put here two, there's two lower in case two x through us is equal to one.

503
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:26,110
Then we'll see. So we're going to make.

504
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:38,250
So I'm using the mouse and rolling the mouse down just to get the eyes to to some out.

505
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:46,900
So you see this going down so that this slope is going to be laid to the right.

506
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:51,880
And then the intercept is 120 years down that line.

507
01:17:52,000 --> 01:18:03,580
Right. And so if you see that line, you divide the whole plane into two parts.

508
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:13,150
You know, these all say my plane is all the points where two X supply is greater than one point.

509
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:24,240
And these point here. Right. They say my plane is all this 0.12 X plus Y is less than one plane.

510
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:33,639
And this line is maybe all the points where two X plus weight or exactly 120.

511
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:48,850
But so if I want to figure it out, you know, graph the same plane here, I'm just instead of equal to less than or equal to right and that's it.

512
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:58,980
So you can see that two X plus Y, all these shaded region is these are all the points,

513
01:18:58,990 --> 01:19:12,100
any point that I get this shade of in each region, if I, if I get the coordinates, for example, zero or 50 zero, I will be here.

514
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:23,890
50 zero is that point 50 02x plus Y is equal to one point and you can say two times 50 is a hundred plus zero is 100 is less than one.

515
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:32,650
Right any point in shaded region is going to be it's going to be through that two x plus is equal to one.

516
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:38,050
So let's do another one. Right?

517
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:48,640
So now that we know how it works, the second one that I would like to have is an X plus three.

518
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:54,550
Y is equal to nine over three who is equal to me.

519
01:19:55,420 --> 01:20:06,150
And then I'm going back here. There's 2x2 things, right.

520
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:21,040
And. 30 years than or equal to 800.

521
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:30,800
So now we have an older shaded region.

522
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:41,000
And so all the points below that line, below that blue line, satisfy the constraint that thinks proceeding wise is less than or equal to nine.

523
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:53,480
So now you see that the intersection of these shaded regions and these shaded region one and the

524
01:20:53,510 --> 01:21:01,010
shaded region two are only at the points that at the same time satisfy these two constraints.

525
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:04,970
But we have another one, right? And the other one is.

526
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:21,460
38 plus point wise. Less than or equal to 363436 games the next.

527
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:39,690
It was quite literally a 60 and so 304.

528
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:44,270
Why is less than or equal to 316 is this okay or here.

529
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:54,310
Right so so now you know all the points below that means that these five, you know, all different things.

530
01:21:54,390 --> 01:22:02,520
So the intersection of these three shaded regions will be these these these area here.

531
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:11,879
So we have the and the non-negative constraint that makes, you know, to just see they're not negative numbers.

532
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:22,190
So it's going to be these area. We're and that is what we call the feasible review.

533
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:30,930
So when we make a decision, we can only pick points inside or in the border of that region.

534
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:38,790
Otherwise, we are not satisfying all in one or Jordan equals three.

535
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:43,140
Right? So this is the first part of the process identified.

536
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:48,840
What is the set of values that you can use for X or Y?

537
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:54,000
You know, that's it. And then after that is picking the best.

538
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:57,840
And that's the subject of next.

539
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:11,200
So I. Going to give you more meaning.

540
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:14,980
Some ideas for next week.

541
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:26,919
To both of them next week.

542
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:31,940
I will do that. This stuff. That's.

543
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:48,570
Yeah. More, you know, gotten me before, I think, you know, like, two years ago.

544
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:54,580
This is crazy. What? No, no, I doing this.

545
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:12,240
Try to enjoy it. So it works for you? Yeah, I, I wouldn't say competition, but it's a, it's a step in the same way.

546
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:24,510
Yeah. Yeah. My, my wife and I, we like this coffee, like value.

547
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:35,549
You mean, like, I think, like, you know, so much more value that smart is kind of like,

548
01:24:35,550 --> 01:24:48,680
you know, I guess, you know, I'm working on those last few days then look at.

549
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:53,280
Alright, I'll see you later. Do you have a long way to run?

550
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:57,120
Yeah, there have been some.

551
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,580
Some friends I haven't.
