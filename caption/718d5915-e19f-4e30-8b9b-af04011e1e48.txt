1
00:00:01,637 --> 00:00:13,847
Hello. Welcome, everybody. So thank you very much for attending today and and welcome a really warm hearted welcome from us to you for today's event.

2
00:00:14,327 --> 00:00:18,467
I wanted to give just a brief introduction of our speakers this morning and talk

3
00:00:18,467 --> 00:00:22,667
just a little bit about some of this symposium and where it where it came from.

4
00:00:22,997 --> 00:00:33,437
So Arnold and I started discussing this idea of having a symposium in 2019 with our goal of having it in the fall of 2020.

5
00:00:33,437 --> 00:00:41,596
And you all know the end of that story. So and, you know, so by having this symposium now, this many years later,

6
00:00:41,597 --> 00:00:47,566
we are able to do this in commemoration of three things one three kind of original ideas is well and

7
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:55,107
Cameron's it's it was recently the ten year anniversary of the high house phone court which is Ben Arnold's

8
00:00:55,337 --> 00:01:02,416
I would say pride and joy studies for a very long time and and really produced a lot of really great

9
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:08,777
findings within the flu vaccine field forward and then subsequently contributing to COVID vaccine research.

10
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:20,927
And the second event that we're going to be are going to be commemorating today, in addition, is Arnold Arnold's career in totality.

11
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:25,937
And with that, we've been able to invite some very good friends and colleagues,

12
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:34,037
but also world renowned experts in public health and vaccines and infectious diseases to be able to talk with us throughout the day today.

13
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:35,747
And so we're very lucky to have them join us.

14
00:01:36,437 --> 00:01:44,447
And then the third thing we're commemorating today is the Francis Lectureship, which Dr. Contaminants will be presenting at the end of the day.

15
00:01:45,287 --> 00:01:54,196
And it gives us an opportunity to commemorate all of the contributions that Dr. Francis made to the world of

16
00:01:54,197 --> 00:02:01,697
vaccine research and how that's really formed the basis and the focus at the school on public health for so long.

17
00:02:02,057 --> 00:02:06,567
So in our kind of, you know, longstanding interests and strengths in that area.

18
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:11,177
So with that, I'm going to kick off the first event of the symposium.

19
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:15,637
We are going to first have Dr. Musical speak.

20
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:23,206
I actually have known Dr. Neuzil since I was a trainee in Seattle, so and I know she has known Arnold for even longer.

21
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:25,057
So we're really lucky to have her here.

22
00:02:25,337 --> 00:02:31,877
She is the Myron Levine professor in vaccinology, the director for the Center of Vaccine Development and Global Health,

23
00:02:32,147 --> 00:02:36,917
the chief of the Division of Geographic Medicine in the Department of Medicine and of the University of Maryland.

24
00:02:37,817 --> 00:02:47,057
And she has really built her career around vaccines, vaccine studies, vaccine implementation in low resource areas,

25
00:02:47,057 --> 00:02:55,277
and has worked broadly across many trials, many different types of studies and many different vaccines and cells, tremendous populations.

26
00:02:55,667 --> 00:03:00,677
I think some of the defining hallmarks of Dr. Lewis's career has been her

27
00:03:00,677 --> 00:03:05,567
involvement on an international global scale and bringing vaccines into new areas,

28
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:09,197
but then also real close attention to policy.

29
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:16,846
So she has been on IP, she's been on the W.H.O. Strategic Advisory Group of Experts that advises on vaccines.

30
00:03:16,847 --> 00:03:20,597
And so she has a very brings a very policy lens to her work.

31
00:03:20,597 --> 00:03:25,137
And I appreciate it greatly. So our she'll be first up to speak.

32
00:03:25,157 --> 00:03:32,417
Our second speaker will be Dr. Hemsley, who's also a longtime collaborator of ours,

33
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:37,547
and that is a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania.

34
00:03:37,757 --> 00:03:46,217
He's also the director of the newly founded Pen Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response, which we collaborate very closely.

35
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:55,217
And Dr. Hensley is comes from a more basic science background with a biology of science

36
00:03:55,397 --> 00:03:59,596
in molecular biology and trainee experience of the National Institutes of Health.

37
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:07,156
And the really kind of overarching themes of his career has been around the immune system, vaccinology and the immune system,

38
00:04:07,157 --> 00:04:10,637
and how that the decisions that we make with when what vaccines we use,

39
00:04:10,637 --> 00:04:15,467
when we use them and how we use them impact our immune profiles in history going forward.

40
00:04:15,737 --> 00:04:18,017
And and I think he will reflect on this.

41
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:24,557
Some of the themes draw forward from some of the original flu vaccine research that happened many, many decades ago.

42
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:31,997
So. And then, of course, we will also have our own Dr. Monto, who I think needs no introduction,

43
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:41,447
but but just is a is a venerable and founding member of the Center for a better role, for sure.

44
00:04:43,277 --> 00:04:46,757
So with that, I think I'm going to pass it over to Kathy.

45
00:04:53,347 --> 00:04:57,577
Thanks. So. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.

46
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:03,456
It really is a privilege to be here to honor Dr. Monto.

47
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:07,387
As you've heard, I have known Dr. Monto for many years.

48
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:11,767
Certainly consider him a mentor, consider him a friend.

49
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:20,797
Sometimes when somebody is in your midst, you don't appreciate their stature and you don't appreciate their contributions.

50
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:32,436
And really, I would say that that there's nobody nobody living right now who has contributed more to the influenza field that than Arnold Monto.

51
00:05:32,437 --> 00:05:37,717
And I want to thank Maria and some of the staff.

52
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:41,466
I had to switch my flight three times for various reasons.

53
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:45,267
But Arnold, I was determined to get here. It means a lot to me.

54
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:50,857
Do you mean a lot to me? And Emily, thank you so much for inviting me.

55
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:58,927
And no surprise, we recognized Emily's superstardom as well when she was in Seattle.

56
00:05:58,927 --> 00:06:05,977
And I remember talking to Arnold about her. I mean, I think it's just a great fit and we're thrilled that she's here.

57
00:06:06,427 --> 00:06:15,307
So I'm going a little off theme, both for my own career in many ways and for this symposium in talking about a bacterial disease.

58
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:21,127
But I think it does illustrate some themes in the world right now.

59
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:30,967
One of these is health equity. You know, it's a big buzz word, but we've been using the term equity to apply to vaccines for many, many years.

60
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:35,017
There's nothing that levels the playing field as much as vaccines.

61
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:40,837
You know, I'm going to major university. You're at a major university if I need any care.

62
00:06:40,837 --> 00:06:45,876
It's literally right across the street. But but we can't build those structures around the world.

63
00:06:45,877 --> 00:06:49,417
So preventing disease is really what we want to do.

64
00:06:50,017 --> 00:07:02,797
And then, of course, these issues of increasing antimicrobial resistance, climate change that are really driving the need for prevention and vaccines.

65
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:11,527
So I'm going to start with just a couple slides on asthma, antimicrobial resistance before I jump into to typhoid.

66
00:07:11,947 --> 00:07:23,436
So this recent publication just in the past year really quantified for the first time the global burden of bacterial anti-microbial resistance.

67
00:07:23,437 --> 00:07:33,937
And they looked at at 2019 and they estimated deaths and DALYs attributable to an associated with bacterial AMR four for 23

68
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:45,457
pathogens and estimated almost 5 million deaths associated with AMR and over a million deaths attributable to bacterial AMR.

69
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:54,997
And not surprisingly, the all age death rate attributable to resistance was highest in in sub-Saharan Africa.

70
00:07:54,997 --> 00:08:06,547
So really a pattern that we see for many diseases with the highest death rate in Western and sub-Saharan Africa, which is is particularly poor.

71
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:19,157
And so the W.H.O. this year came out with this new initiative where they're looking at approaches to tackle antimicrobial resistance.

72
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:23,357
And we might do that in a number of ways with vaccines.

73
00:08:23,387 --> 00:08:26,257
I could not leave influenza out all together.

74
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:35,027
One way to tackle antimicrobial resistance with vaccines is to target common pathogens and disease syndromes, right?

75
00:08:35,037 --> 00:08:41,717
If if we're using vaccines for viruses where we don't need to use vaccines,

76
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:47,957
then by reducing that antibiotic consumption, we're going to reduce antimicrobial resistance.

77
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:52,486
And I think influenza is a great example here.

78
00:08:52,487 --> 00:09:00,436
And this is some work that I did about 20 years ago where we first looked at how

79
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:07,367
many excess outpatient visits and antibiotic prescriptions are given for influenza.

80
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:19,157
And these are really quite high. You know, anywhere from 8 to 14 per 100 children received an antibiotic prescription that they did not need.

81
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:23,656
So with new diagnostics, you know, we're doing a little bit better.

82
00:09:23,657 --> 00:09:28,817
I think we certainly maybe we could debate this later. I think we certainly did better during COVID.

83
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,476
You know, you didn't hear about antibiotics being given for COVID.

84
00:09:32,477 --> 00:09:39,137
We really educated people very well. And we had diagnostics to help us there.

85
00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:46,847
But certainly for nonspecific ever, all respiratory syndromes, you know, handing a child an antibiotic is still common.

86
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:53,477
And again, here's another study that looked at the impact of vaccination on antibiotic usage.

87
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:59,297
It's harder to prove, it's easy to show that we give too many antibiotics for flu.

88
00:09:59,297 --> 00:10:03,737
It's harder to show that vaccines can reduce that.

89
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:11,716
However, there are studies you can see here favors influenza vaccine studies in infants and children

90
00:10:11,717 --> 00:10:17,687
six months to 14 years of age have the strongest association with influenza vaccine,

91
00:10:17,837 --> 00:10:22,786
reducing antibiotic usage. And that's really the influence here.

92
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:30,677
Overall, older children with chronic bronchitis, really children are driving this effect of influenza vaccine,

93
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:34,367
positive effect on reducing antimicrobial resistance.

94
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:41,806
Another example is, is rotavirus the most common cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea throughout the world?

95
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:50,777
Pre rotavirus vaccine introduction. And if you look at antibiotic use for diarrhea in children under two in low resource settings,

96
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:59,387
you see that what what really drives in in antibiotic usage is shigella where it's appropriate

97
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:04,667
to use an antibiotic and rotavirus where it's not appropriate to use an antibiotic.

98
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:09,826
So by, you know, rolling out vaccines for flu, rolling out vaccines for rotavirus,

99
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:15,977
developing vaccines for for shigella, we can reduce overall antibiotic usage.

100
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:24,677
Now, the other way to tackle and more with vaccines is to specifically prevent a disease for

101
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:32,206
which the antimicrobial resistance is leading to increased morbidity and mortality.

102
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:40,367
So these diseases may not be as common and aren't going to overall have a great effect on reducing antibiotic usage.

103
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:44,987
But individually, they're becoming harder and harder to treat.

104
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:49,997
And and therefore, prevention is is the way to go.

105
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:57,467
So if we look at global deaths attributable and associated with bacterial AMR, not surprisingly,

106
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:06,047
lower respiratory infections is at the top of the list as a category bloodstream infections in predominantly infections, etc.

107
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:17,177
And when we look at specific bacteria for which we do have high rates or increasing rates of AMR and vaccines,

108
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:23,657
it's streptococcus pneumoniae, Hib Haemophilus influenza and typhoid.

109
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:33,647
So typhoid is an interesting one of course, because we don't see a lot of typhoid in the US as anyone here had a typhoid vaccine.

110
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:41,077
Okay. So I'm going to ask you that again. So look around. Maybe, I don't know, 15, 20% of people raise their hands.

111
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:46,107
So hold that thought and we'll go from there. So I'm from Baltimore.

112
00:12:46,117 --> 00:12:48,787
If I had this graph for Ann Arbor, I'd show it to you.

113
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:59,407
But, you know, typhoid deaths were a problem in in the early 20th century in the United States when we started having better water,

114
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:08,497
sanitation and hygiene measures and invested in water and sewage expenditures, which is shown here, you know, typhoid essentially disappeared.

115
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:12,547
We'll still see it in the US, will predominantly see it in travelers.

116
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:17,107
Every once in a while there might be an outbreak associated with a chronic carrier,

117
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:23,587
but for the most part, we haven't seen a lot of typhoid from from mid 20th century on.

118
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:32,197
So typhoid is no isn't a disease of the past, it is in the US but it's really become a disease of the poor.

119
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:36,637
And this is a common theme that you will hear over and over again.

120
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:45,817
The latest is monkey pox. You know, monkey pox has been increasing in West Africa and DRC and Nigeria for years and was completely ignored.

121
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:51,607
And until, you know, a few rich countries had monkeypox and then we all started paying attention,

122
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:56,947
we should have been paying attention to vaccination and vaccine supply and vaccine development.

123
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:07,687
And typhoid is similar when when typhoid essentially disappeared in these blue areas, you know, in Europe and in the US and South America,

124
00:14:08,197 --> 00:14:19,507
then it became, you know, not a problem anymore, even though, as you can see here, it really is still quite prevalent in in Africa and Southeast Asia.

125
00:14:20,797 --> 00:14:25,987
So where are we in 2022? Well, as I said, it's a substantial public health problem.

126
00:14:26,257 --> 00:14:31,657
Disproportionally impacts children disproportionately impacts marginalized populations.

127
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:38,717
The burden is likely underestimated because the gold standard is what culture and many of

128
00:14:38,717 --> 00:14:44,007
the places where you're going to have poor water and sanitation can't do a like culture.

129
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:52,427
You know, it's it's still it may not seem sophisticated to us, but really takes quite sophisticated equipment to be able to do a blood culture.

130
00:14:52,877 --> 00:15:00,047
So at the moment, there are we estimate there are about 11 million cases a year, about 116,000 deaths.

131
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:05,777
You know, the fatality rate with treatment is 1 to 4%, up to 20% without.

132
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:11,327
And this is one of the dreaded complications, which is typhoid perforation.

133
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:14,866
I'm actually heading to Niger tomorrow, we're learning.

134
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:16,337
And in West Africa,

135
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:27,047
we're learning that they have really a tremendously high rate of typhoid perforations and and if perforations are occurring in 10%,

136
00:15:27,347 --> 00:15:34,097
again, they don't have blood cultures there. This means that they have 10 to 100 times more typhoid cases than what we're

137
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:39,527
seeing in the children that make it to a medical center with a perforation.

138
00:15:41,217 --> 00:15:47,087
And drug resistant typhi has been a problem from early on.

139
00:15:47,097 --> 00:15:54,927
So here's 1945 actually. It was at the University of Maryland that it was shown that that chloramphenicol

140
00:15:55,107 --> 00:16:00,807
can treat typhoid didn't take long before chloramphenicol resistance is reported,

141
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:03,987
and this pattern has gone on for decades.

142
00:16:03,987 --> 00:16:14,817
We have ampicillin, we have sulfa drugs, then we have multi-drug resistance, which is is ampicillin, chloramphenicol and and sulfa drugs.

143
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:18,897
So again, now for better call, resistance is widespread.

144
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:25,377
We start using fluoroquinolones, we have large fluoroquinolone resistance outbreaks and it goes on and on.

145
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:30,717
So this again has been happening in low resource countries over decades.

146
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:36,387
So they have poor water and sanitation and they're running out of antibiotics to treat typhoid with.

147
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:45,447
Now, what happened in 2015 and 2016 was the final alarm bell that got people's attention,

148
00:16:45,747 --> 00:16:50,276
which is that more than 90% of Southeast Asian strains were non susceptible to

149
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:55,467
fluoroquinolones and there was a swift reaction resistant outbreak in Pakistan.

150
00:16:55,857 --> 00:17:01,347
So you can imagine you're in Pakistan and kids are coming in to the hospital and you have to use it.

151
00:17:01,357 --> 00:17:07,227
You can, you know, meropenem in the Pan Am these really expensive hard to get antibiotics.

152
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:13,856
We have oral is it through Amazon but again we're starting to see resistance to that.

153
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:20,727
Not a lot of resistance, but resistance. And so, you know, we start seeing these articles were out of options.

154
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:25,227
Drug resistant typhoid is untreatable typhoid on the way.

155
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:30,507
And and of course, in the U.S. and this may be the canary in the coal mine.

156
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:39,087
If you think that in these countries, in places I'm talking about, they don't have good blood culture capacity.

157
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:46,587
Where you start seeing this and this has been reported from the UK in the US is people coming back from those countries,

158
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:53,546
they're diagnosed with typhoid and they end up and you can see 50% of those with traveled

159
00:17:53,547 --> 00:18:00,687
to to Pakistan had had MDR typhoid at this point in time 80% had non susceptible.

160
00:18:00,987 --> 00:18:07,227
So we start noticing this problem when again we start seeing it in rich countries.

161
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:11,277
Now, using too much antibiotics is a problem.

162
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:18,087
On the flip side, when you need them, not having access to antibiotics is a problem.

163
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:24,146
And this just looks at global antibiotic consumption and usage.

164
00:18:24,147 --> 00:18:32,636
So it's sort of flipping the script and we see that if you look at large variations in antibiotic usage,

165
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:36,177
you have the lowest levels in sub-Saharan Africa.

166
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:42,027
So again, here are the places where resistance is likely coming from elsewhere.

167
00:18:42,357 --> 00:18:47,307
We don't have the antibiotics to treat these usually children.

168
00:18:47,787 --> 00:18:55,287
So really it's both inappropriate use of antibiotics and lack of access that have created a major problem here.

169
00:18:56,557 --> 00:19:03,397
So AMR is really driving typhoid vaccine introduction efforts,

170
00:19:03,397 --> 00:19:07,297
which is interesting and a little bit different than what we've seen with other diseases.

171
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:12,307
You know, it's usually a burden of illness, which is absolutely legitimate and could be for typhoid.

172
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:18,366
But again, we've had typhoid vaccines for decades and we haven't used them and we haven't

173
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:24,727
been motivated to use them until this AMA really put this problem on the map.

174
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:29,556
Now, the other problem was that the antibiotics that we all received,

175
00:19:29,557 --> 00:19:34,367
how many of you receive the oral antibiotic that you take every other day for three or four days?

176
00:19:34,777 --> 00:19:40,567
And how many received the shot you take to the vaccine, the typhoid vaccine you sent, I suppose.

177
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:43,687
Got both. Oh, yeah. So I've had both too.

178
00:19:43,837 --> 00:19:48,666
So that illustrates a few things. So you have to get it repeatedly right.

179
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:51,937
So. So you don't have high durability.

180
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:59,407
So if you're a traveler, that's not a big deal. If you travel a lot, you know, I get my typhoid vaccine booster every other year.

181
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:03,717
But if you're going to introduce this into an immunization program, you know,

182
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:10,687
at one year of age, we can't be doing mass campaigns, you know, every two years for for typhoid.

183
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:15,876
So what worked for pneumococcus? What works for Haemophilus conjugate vaccines?

184
00:20:15,877 --> 00:20:29,147
And we did have a very successful conjugate vaccine that was developed by the NIH that worked that never made it to market because of market forces.

185
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:33,067
Right. How are they going to sell this vaccine? Who is going to use this vaccine?

186
00:20:33,307 --> 00:20:43,117
So an effective vaccine that died in the pipeline because again, the demand in low resource countries wasn't seen as sufficient.

187
00:20:43,927 --> 00:20:55,166
So just in the last five years or so, there there's a new formulations of typhoid conjugate vaccine that, again,

188
00:20:55,167 --> 00:21:04,657
it should be able to be single dose suitable for children under the age of two who don't react well immunologically to polysaccharide vaccines,

189
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:10,447
which means you could include them in immunization programs and they would have longer lasting protection.

190
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:19,507
So suddenly typhoid vaccines, which weren't particularly feasible, we now have formulations that make them feasible.

191
00:21:20,837 --> 00:21:29,477
So in 2017, the Gates Foundation started a large effort.

192
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:33,947
We we called it the Typhoid Vaccine Acceleration Consortium.

193
00:21:34,187 --> 00:21:37,847
We at the University of Maryland lead that consortium.

194
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:41,597
We just were funded for a second round.

195
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:43,427
So we're about six years in.

196
00:21:43,757 --> 00:21:51,257
And the overall goal is to reduce the global burden of typhoid by accelerating the introduction of these new typhoid conjugate vaccines.

197
00:21:51,257 --> 00:21:53,927
So, again, let's not let these die in the pipeline.

198
00:21:53,927 --> 00:22:01,547
Again, let's generate the funding, the political will, the policies to make sure kids get these vaccines.

199
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:06,687
Now, as epidemiologists, you know, you need to think of of the challenges here.

200
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:11,197
You know, there's variability in disease burden, as I've already described to you.

201
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:15,467
There's variability by country. There's variability within country.

202
00:22:15,477 --> 00:22:20,237
Right. And every particular setting is not going to be the same.

203
00:22:20,237 --> 00:22:25,696
The capitals of many of these countries have good water and sanitation, and typhoid isn't a problem.

204
00:22:25,697 --> 00:22:27,347
And we have blood culture surveillance.

205
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:35,777
And and we know that there is the antimicrobial resistance, but the laboratory disease burden data is just not there.

206
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:43,037
So some people have said, well, if you don't have blood culture confirmed typhoid, we shouldn't be introducing the vaccine.

207
00:22:43,427 --> 00:22:45,937
To me, that's an equity issue from the start.

208
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:54,707
So if you're not capable of having blood culture and you're probably the most likely to need the vaccine and have kids that don't have access to care,

209
00:22:55,457 --> 00:23:00,437
we're not going to give you the vaccine so you can see some of the challenges here.

210
00:23:01,097 --> 00:23:02,597
We also, when we started,

211
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:13,297
had no field efficacy data for these typhoid conjugate vaccines and we had no population based impacts of what these vaccines might do.

212
00:23:14,277 --> 00:23:16,977
So again, what do you do when you start a big project?

213
00:23:17,067 --> 00:23:25,787
You try to learn from successful projects that that went before you in terms of and this is a message I send all the time.

214
00:23:25,797 --> 00:23:29,307
If I was giving a design lecture, we could talk about specifics.

215
00:23:29,997 --> 00:23:32,997
But the study design really has to align with your goals.

216
00:23:32,997 --> 00:23:40,406
And as Emily said, I've done a lot of studies to influence policy, so we can't let ourselves be taken down the path.

217
00:23:40,407 --> 00:23:48,116
If we're trying to influence policy and understand what impact of these vaccines is going to improve policymakers,

218
00:23:48,117 --> 00:23:55,227
then we may not be able to ask every scientific corollary question that we want to ask,

219
00:23:55,227 --> 00:24:01,377
and I think you just have to get comfortable with that when you're designing some of these studies.

220
00:24:02,127 --> 00:24:10,137
We also have to have general generalizability of of the populations where we do these studies.

221
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:14,306
But we also have to be sure they're done to a high standard.

222
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:18,657
And so in many of these places, that is a difficult balance.

223
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:24,087
You would love to go to the middle of nowhere with high rates of perforation and do this.

224
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:32,007
But if I can't have a good data quality and follow ethics procedures, then then I can't do that.

225
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:41,126
So we ended up designing a program where we would do three large randomized clinical trials in diverse settings,

226
00:24:41,127 --> 00:24:48,866
and these are the settings that we chose. There was about three years of epidemiologic data before we were to start the trial,

227
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:56,187
which was obviously helpful and looking at the baseline incidence of typhoid and being able to set power calculations.

228
00:24:56,667 --> 00:25:03,027
So we went to Nepal with an individually randomized trial in children 9 to 16 months of age.

229
00:25:03,357 --> 00:25:06,597
We our sample size was just over 20,000.

230
00:25:07,107 --> 00:25:11,457
We went to Blantyre, Malawi, another individual randomized trial.

231
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:18,267
We actually stopped at 12 years of age because this is a high HIV prevalence area, which we wanted.

232
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:23,697
We needed to show that these vaccines would work in areas of high HIV prevalence.

233
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:32,786
However, we didn't want to get into the messy business of having to prescreen and check throughout the study for HIV.

234
00:25:32,787 --> 00:25:36,567
And that's why we stopped it at 12 years of age.

235
00:25:37,227 --> 00:25:45,207
And then in in Mirpur, Dhaka, Bangladesh, very densely populated area, a lot of typhoid.

236
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:53,757
We did a cluster randomized trial to try to see if perhaps there would be indirect effects of these vaccines as well.

237
00:25:54,997 --> 00:26:00,097
So all of these studies have now been published in about the last year and a half.

238
00:26:00,427 --> 00:26:05,857
The Malawi trial is actually continuing, so we will have four years of data.

239
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:09,367
But we did stop and do an interim analysis.

240
00:26:09,697 --> 00:26:18,477
So, again, real kudos to the to the researchers and the teams on the ground that kept this going through COVID.

241
00:26:19,147 --> 00:26:20,616
And here are the results.

242
00:26:20,617 --> 00:26:30,247
And really what you want if you do three large trials in diverse populations is you'd like to see similar point estimates of efficacy.

243
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:32,577
And that's exactly what we saw.

244
00:26:32,587 --> 00:26:45,367
We had about an 80% efficacy for preventing blood culture, confirmed typhoid in in Nepal, about 84% in Malawi, about 85% in Bangladesh.

245
00:26:45,457 --> 00:26:52,087
Realizing Bangladesh is a total effectiveness because it wasn't an individually randomized trial, was a cluster randomized trial.

246
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:56,616
We didn't show statistically significant indirect protection.

247
00:26:56,617 --> 00:27:04,597
We saw about 20% indirect, which wasn't statistically significant and mainly in the age of the parents.

248
00:27:04,687 --> 00:27:12,577
So there is some suggestion. But again, if I could describe this trial more to you and I'll show you some of this.

249
00:27:12,577 --> 00:27:19,087
There's a lot of migration in this area. There's a lot we're doing some secondary analysis, you know,

250
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:27,157
fried egg analyzes looking at at the middle part of these clusters to see if we can tease out any any indirect effects.

251
00:27:27,517 --> 00:27:36,877
But overall, single dose single dose of this vaccine can prevent 80 to 85% of of typhoid.

252
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:42,907
And then we said, you know, every country in the world will do this, but will it work where I am?

253
00:27:43,357 --> 00:27:47,707
And so we did a couple additional immunogenicity trials, right?

254
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:51,816
We said, you just can't keep doing 30,000 person clinical trials.

255
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:55,657
Everywhere we saw comparable results.

256
00:27:55,717 --> 00:28:00,036
We went to Burkina Faso, which is a francophone country in West Africa,

257
00:28:00,037 --> 00:28:04,357
has a different immunization schedule or maybe you could argue with different population,

258
00:28:04,807 --> 00:28:11,917
did some immunogenicity studies and said, look, the immunogenicity looks similar to the places where this works.

259
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:16,897
I think we can assume this will work everywhere, almost everywhere.

260
00:28:18,117 --> 00:28:22,827
Now, what I wanted to show you in Bangladesh is something that was really interesting.

261
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:32,127
This first analysis and there are more analysis here is during an average of 17 months of follow up of the study population,

262
00:28:32,517 --> 00:28:42,807
they had 150,000 births in migrations, 72,000 out migrations, and 35 people that moved within the study area.

263
00:28:43,257 --> 00:28:48,267
So you can see this both as problematic when you're doing your cluster randomized trial,

264
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:58,157
but also problematic for what many people want to do is say, oh, well, Dhaka is high risk, but this suburb of Dhaka is not.

265
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:01,287
So we can save some money by just vaccinating these kids.

266
00:29:01,797 --> 00:29:07,737
That's not going to work because the kids that are in Dhaka at one year of age may or may

267
00:29:07,737 --> 00:29:14,217
not be the kids that are in Dhaka at three years of age when they're exposed to to typhoid.

268
00:29:14,817 --> 00:29:18,507
And while you can do catch up campaigns in six month intervals,

269
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:23,277
which we did as part of this trial, you can't really do that in public health practice.

270
00:29:23,307 --> 00:29:29,307
So so really, if you have a single dose vaccine that's very safe and works well,

271
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:36,327
then you should vaccinate as many children as you can when you can capture them.

272
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:42,937
So what has this looked like? You know, you have to have the global policy to move things forward,

273
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:48,097
that countries have to make a decision to move things forward, then you have to actually introduce.

274
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:52,657
So in 2017, the World Health Organization Sage Group,

275
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:58,417
that the vaccine policy data recommended a single dose of typhoid conjugate vaccine

276
00:29:58,657 --> 00:30:03,607
for every child in endemic areas from nine months to 15 years as a catch up.

277
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:09,607
And then routine immunization at nine months of age. So you get all the children in a mass campaign.

278
00:30:09,847 --> 00:30:19,747
Then you introduce it into routine programs. Importantly, GAVI approved 85 million U.S. dollars for typhoid conjugate introduction.

279
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:24,667
If you don't financially support this introduction, it's not going to happen.

280
00:30:25,027 --> 00:30:30,427
So to give you an example, with GAVI, a rotavirus vaccine costs $120.

281
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:38,557
In the US, we give two or three doses. These, the low resource countries pay $0.20 for a rotavirus vaccine.

282
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:44,776
GAVI negotiates a price. With the manufacture and pays the rest.

283
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:50,657
So they agreed to do that for typhoid vaccine. They said you will pay 20 to $0.30 a dose for typhoid vaccine.

284
00:30:50,777 --> 00:30:57,587
And if you do the campaign, we will pay the entire cost of the campaign because we want you to do catch up campaigns.

285
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:05,627
Then the vaccine has to be pre-qualified, which means W.H.O. has to give its quality stamp of approval.

286
00:31:06,857 --> 00:31:09,947
And then the country actually I'll show the rest of this.

287
00:31:09,947 --> 00:31:17,837
But the country actually has to apply to GAVI, explain actually how they're going to do this, that they can do this to get the vaccine.

288
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:26,717
But the first country to use this was was Pakistan in the outbreak response because they had that extremely drug resistant typhoid.

289
00:31:27,227 --> 00:31:36,107
So here are just some pictures of of the mass campaign in Pakistan, which was in response to this XDR outbreak.

290
00:31:36,617 --> 00:31:43,007
And then they also did some effectiveness studies to say, does this work in an outbreak situation?

291
00:31:43,097 --> 00:31:46,877
Does it work against drug resistant typhoid?

292
00:31:47,357 --> 00:31:55,397
And they showed that it didn't. So if you looked at all culture confirmed typhoid cases, it was about 95% efficacious.

293
00:31:55,697 --> 00:32:00,047
And for specifically, extremely drug resistant typhoid, about 95.

294
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:07,337
We can talk or you can think through and Emily can ask you later why these numbers might be higher than than ours.

295
00:32:08,357 --> 00:32:17,767
Anybody want to throw out a reason why these numbers might be higher? So in an outbreak, you're going to have a shorter duration of follow up, right?

296
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:23,017
So if there's some relationship, the other thing that that we've shown is,

297
00:32:23,017 --> 00:32:31,896
is misclassification of vaccination status is probably going to overestimate vaccine effectiveness in this type of study.

298
00:32:31,897 --> 00:32:33,397
So really,

299
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:43,717
I would consider an 85% in a clinical trial to be comparable to a 95% in an outbreak situation for what you're measuring and when you're measuring it.

300
00:32:45,057 --> 00:32:53,216
So if we look at this on a global scale, there are 73 countries who are eligible to go to GAVI and say, we want to take you up on this offer.

301
00:32:53,217 --> 00:32:58,017
We want to pay $0.20 and we want to introduce a typhoid vaccine.

302
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:01,407
You know, what would that do on a global scale?

303
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:11,307
So these researchers, led by Jenny Pitzer at Yale, said that know, we introduce routine immunization at nine months with a catch up campaign,

304
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:20,607
up to 15 years, we could avert 46 to 75% of all typhoid cases in these GAVI eligible countries.

305
00:33:21,117 --> 00:33:27,807
And we would reduce the relative prevalence of of antimicrobial resistance by 16%.

306
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:30,686
And then they just put some numbers on that.

307
00:33:30,687 --> 00:33:43,797
Over a ten year period of time, we avert 42 million cases, 500,000 deaths, a fluoroquinolone nonsense, heritable typhoid and 21 million cases.

308
00:33:43,797 --> 00:33:47,457
342,000 deaths from multi-drug resistant typhoid.

309
00:33:48,817 --> 00:33:52,687
So now we have to get these vaccines out there, which is not easy.

310
00:33:52,697 --> 00:34:00,517
So so what's happened since then? You know, we had Pakistan outbreak response and then country introduction.

311
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:06,577
We have prequalified a second vaccine which is going to help with with supply.

312
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:14,717
Liberia became the first country in Africa to introduce vaccine and Zimbabwe, which had done a limited outbreak response.

313
00:34:14,737 --> 00:34:23,257
They also have multi-drug resistant typhoid and Zimbabwe became the second country in Africa to introduce.

314
00:34:23,587 --> 00:34:31,267
And so here's the way it looked right now, actually, Nepal introduced about two months ago.

315
00:34:31,597 --> 00:34:39,636
And so we have about four countries that have introduced a number of countries Malawi will introduce early next

316
00:34:39,637 --> 00:34:47,617
year and a number of other countries shown in yellow and blue that are in very various stages of the GAVI process.

317
00:34:48,007 --> 00:34:53,767
So we were able to keep the trials going during COVID.

318
00:34:53,797 --> 00:35:01,626
You know, it was much harder for the countries to think about introduction of a new vaccine during COVID.

319
00:35:01,627 --> 00:35:08,497
Like the GAVI applications really fell off because obviously they were fighting COVID and then they were fighting polio.

320
00:35:08,527 --> 00:35:13,987
Right. There's there's wild polio now in in Malawi, where we work in some of the surrounding places.

321
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:23,617
There's measles. There were a lot of repercussions of of COVID that have really, unfortunately, delayed some of the introductions of new vaccines.

322
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:26,017
And this just shows the Nepal outbreak.

323
00:35:26,017 --> 00:35:33,877
I wasn't skilled enough to update my map for this talk, but there is the picture that it was introduced in in Nepal.

324
00:35:34,357 --> 00:35:39,307
So, you know, we can make typhoid a disease of the past in the same way we made it a disease

325
00:35:39,307 --> 00:35:44,196
of the past here and in the U.S. Certainly we can improve water and sanitation,

326
00:35:44,197 --> 00:35:50,467
but but we unfortunately may be waiting decades until that is done in many places in the world.

327
00:35:50,467 --> 00:35:56,887
But but this is a human restricted pathogen with vaccine, you know, with proper use of antibiotics.

328
00:35:56,887 --> 00:36:01,147
We can do this. It is a substantial public health problem.

329
00:36:01,147 --> 00:36:07,177
And and ironically, those of us raising our hands, you know, it makes no sense to me.

330
00:36:07,687 --> 00:36:14,227
Then I am told to get a typhoid vaccine because I'm visiting Niger tomorrow.

331
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:18,007
Right. I'm leaving tomorrow. And I have to have my typhoid vaccine update.

332
00:36:18,367 --> 00:36:21,927
But none of the children in that country have access to typhoid vaccine.

333
00:36:21,937 --> 00:36:26,257
So, again, that dichotomy and that inequity illustrated.

334
00:36:27,307 --> 00:36:32,077
I didn't show you data on this conjugate vaccines or say this vaccine is safe.

335
00:36:32,077 --> 00:36:35,707
It looks just like the control meningitis conjugate vaccine.

336
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:42,187
You know, there have been reviews of the millions in Pakistan who have have received this vaccine.

337
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:49,866
And I think now our big challenge is to make sure the most disadvantaged children have access to vaccine.

338
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:55,627
And we really believe strongly that you need to go broad and not narrow because,

339
00:36:55,627 --> 00:37:00,727
again, populations are more mobile in the world than they ever used to be.

340
00:37:00,727 --> 00:37:06,847
And you cannot predict a child's risk of typhoid throughout childhood at one year of age.

341
00:37:06,847 --> 00:37:10,777
Right. We need to broadly vaccinate. This is a safe vaccine.

342
00:37:11,107 --> 00:37:16,717
People move typhoid, epidemiology changes with with climate change we're seeing.

343
00:37:16,717 --> 00:37:22,777
So you can't be confident that you know a child's risk for the next next 15 years.

344
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:27,936
And, of course, you know, we're not going to give up on water, sanitation and hygiene.

345
00:37:27,937 --> 00:37:31,537
Obviously, this is a disease specific vaccine.

346
00:37:31,897 --> 00:37:36,567
Improvements in water, sanitation and hygiene will help with many, many diseases.

347
00:37:36,577 --> 00:37:43,927
You've probably seen cholera outbreaks in the news lately. And, you know, typhoid and cholera track together in many cases.

348
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:48,097
So so these are integrated and complementary effects.

349
00:37:48,097 --> 00:37:53,526
It's it's not one or the other. Since I'm a vaccine person, I emphasize the vaccine.

350
00:37:53,527 --> 00:37:56,797
I want to be sure you realize that. Absolutely.

351
00:37:57,067 --> 00:38:02,227
It's not undermining what we need to do for the water, sanitation and hygiene.

352
00:38:02,737 --> 00:38:07,717
So that's it, Arnold? Only a little bit of flu, but I love you for your attention.

353
00:38:14,077 --> 00:38:21,937
Is critical. And we've been trying to get flu vaccines using countries of the world, and that's been very successful.

354
00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:26,377
Yeah, flu has been disappointing. You know, we've done some large studies.

355
00:38:26,377 --> 00:38:30,456
Our Arnold was was involved. Flu vaccine is a tough one.

356
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:34,397
And until we have a formulation, I mean, that's what helped typhoid.

357
00:38:34,567 --> 00:38:37,417
Right. I think that's partly what's holding flu up.

358
00:38:37,657 --> 00:38:42,907
We can't have a formulation that changes every year, that you have to get mass vaccinations every year.

359
00:38:43,147 --> 00:38:50,227
That doesn't match the strains. Yeah, we need a good formulation of flu vaccine and then I think we can do it.

360
00:38:50,857 --> 00:38:52,357
That's an excellent Segway.

361
00:38:53,887 --> 00:39:02,347
So we're going to be doing questions that the speakers at the end all together, panel style, because I have seen this to answer questions before.

362
00:39:02,347 --> 00:39:07,987
And if you ask one question, you're going to get three different answers. So I want the opportunity to ask.

363
00:39:11,243 --> 00:39:15,453
Well, that was that was an excellent talk, Kathleen, that we're going to follow this up.

364
00:39:15,473 --> 00:39:19,552
Shift gears in a major way here and and talk about mouse immunology.

365
00:39:19,553 --> 00:39:29,062
Actually, not not so much mouse immunology, but you'll see a lot of sort of preclinical data, both in mice as well as ferrets in non-human primates.

366
00:39:29,063 --> 00:39:32,453
And Arnold, it is just such a pleasure to be here today.

367
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:40,013
I have admired you and throughout my career and very much feel like you are a mentor.

368
00:39:40,973 --> 00:39:48,682
Okay. Development of a multi-billion mornay flu vaccine to replace original antigenic sin with initial blessings of induced immunity.

369
00:39:48,683 --> 00:39:53,963
And hopefully this crowd here is familiar with some of these terms that are that are in the title.

370
00:39:54,443 --> 00:39:57,713
And, of course, we're here today to honor Arnold.

371
00:39:57,713 --> 00:40:01,943
And later on, we'll hear the Thomas Francis lecture.

372
00:40:03,053 --> 00:40:10,433
And I think most of you are familiar with this famous essay on the doctrine of original antigenic sin.

373
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:14,492
The only time I left for about ten, 11 years now.

374
00:40:14,493 --> 00:40:22,863
And I feel like everything that I have discovered is sort of rediscovering things that Thomas Francis figured out many years ago.

375
00:40:23,043 --> 00:40:27,543
And right here on campus, what were what were his tool sets back in the day?

376
00:40:27,723 --> 00:40:32,583
Red blood cells, blue grown and embryonic eggs.

377
00:40:32,883 --> 00:40:38,913
It's amazing as we move forward as a scientific community and sort of get washed away with technology.

378
00:40:40,653 --> 00:40:47,103
And sometimes the most elegant studies can be completed with really simple techniques.

379
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:52,993
Okay, so I introduce you to Tommy Francis. He needed no introduction at all.

380
00:40:53,043 --> 00:40:56,732
I will next introduce you to my children, I hope.

381
00:40:56,733 --> 00:40:59,823
And Tyler. And you can. You can read the title of that slide.

382
00:41:00,003 --> 00:41:03,063
There's something magical about childhood. I love this picture.

383
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:09,293
This is an outdated picture at this point. But but you can see that there's paint everywhere and these kids are just having a blast.

384
00:41:09,483 --> 00:41:14,163
So why do we let our kids just play with paint and just get it all over the place?

385
00:41:14,193 --> 00:41:18,543
Why do we read books to our kids when they're two years of age, three years of age?

386
00:41:19,173 --> 00:41:24,933
We do this because these early childhood activities impact how our children develop later in life.

387
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:29,343
You want your kid to be Picasso. You want your kid to. To be an artist.

388
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:34,233
Introduce paint very early in life when you're reading a book to a two year old.

389
00:41:34,253 --> 00:41:36,623
Okay, they'll follow it. They probably won't remember that book.

390
00:41:36,633 --> 00:41:43,473
But studies have shown that if you read to your children when they're one year of age, two years of age, they become better readers themselves.

391
00:41:43,893 --> 00:41:48,842
It's almost as if something happens in our brains that our brains are imprinted in a

392
00:41:48,843 --> 00:41:56,463
way to learn these early childhood activities and have them impact us as we develop.

393
00:41:57,273 --> 00:41:59,703
Same thing goes on with our immune systems.

394
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:08,853
Okay, so this is a slide I like to show, which is a study that was completed in the Netherlands where flu vaccination rates are not very high.

395
00:42:09,423 --> 00:42:16,413
And what you can see here, this is your prevalence, just looking at blood samples from different age individuals.

396
00:42:16,893 --> 00:42:20,493
When we are born, about 40% of us have flu antibodies.

397
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:24,213
Do you know where they come from? They come from our moms, right?

398
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:28,893
That's maternal antibodies. But maternal antibodies, while they're great, they decline over time.

399
00:42:29,103 --> 00:42:34,143
And then you can see seropositivity raises to about 80% by the time we're four or five years of age.

400
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:39,213
So we are exposed to flu in the context of infection.

401
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:41,582
By the time we're three or four years of age. Now,

402
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:48,303
what Tommy Francis showed many years ago is that those early childhood infections established lifelong

403
00:42:48,303 --> 00:42:54,993
immune memory that can be recalled as we experience energetically distinct flu strains later in our life.

404
00:42:55,773 --> 00:43:05,493
So just like when we're reading to our children these these immune insults that the kids experience early in life impact how they respond later.

405
00:43:05,943 --> 00:43:10,113
Now people call the original antigenic sand. You hear immune imprinting.

406
00:43:10,293 --> 00:43:15,303
There's a lot of different phrases for this. In my mind, this is old school immunology.

407
00:43:15,483 --> 00:43:22,293
Okay, now I know this is more of maybe an empty crowd, but this is my one sort of immunology 101 slide.

408
00:43:22,953 --> 00:43:26,143
We were born with naive B cells, T cells as well.

409
00:43:26,643 --> 00:43:29,823
And the beauty of our adaptive immune system is we have zillions of these.

410
00:43:29,943 --> 00:43:32,943
Okay, you could throw anything at me right now. You want to hit me with Ebola?

411
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:36,273
Guess what? I have a few B cells that will be able to recognize the Ebola virus.

412
00:43:36,873 --> 00:43:44,643
And so what happens is we have lots and lots of naive B cells, but upon our first antigen exposure, these guys divide like mad.

413
00:43:45,033 --> 00:43:48,333
They start proliferating. Two antigen specific ones will start proliferating.

414
00:43:48,663 --> 00:43:54,963
So in the case of flu, we are born with naive B cells. Upon our first exposure, we get a lot more of them.

415
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:58,082
Okay. And this is time on the x axis.

416
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:04,743
What you can see is that over time, yes, these numbers of B cells, in this case, flu specific memory B cells decline.

417
00:44:05,073 --> 00:44:09,033
But importantly, there's more of these B cells compared to before challenge.

418
00:44:09,393 --> 00:44:12,812
And maybe even more importantly, they're called memory B cells.

419
00:44:12,813 --> 00:44:17,643
At this point, not only are there more of these cells, but they have a low threshold of activation.

420
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:22,983
You just tickle a memory B cell a little bit and it'll start producing antibodies.

421
00:44:23,283 --> 00:44:26,793
Okay, now you've B cells are very much harder to get going.

422
00:44:27,513 --> 00:44:30,393
Memory B cells in the little antigen they take off.

423
00:44:31,143 --> 00:44:39,723
And it's these memory B cells that we develop when we're three or four years of age that get recruited upon different flu infections.

424
00:44:40,753 --> 00:44:49,183
Okay. So let's talk a little bit about flu. Of course, we worry about flu in a pandemic sense, but flu also causes seasonal infections.

425
00:44:49,513 --> 00:44:54,223
So here are the different flu subtypes flu viruses, natural reservoir or birds.

426
00:44:54,463 --> 00:44:57,733
Occasionally these jump into humans. They jump into pigs and other animals.

427
00:44:58,033 --> 00:45:01,963
But you can see there is quite a bit of different influenza subtypes.

428
00:45:02,173 --> 00:45:06,343
Now these ages refer to the major code protein on the virus called hemagglutinin.

429
00:45:06,763 --> 00:45:13,123
So there are 18 different influenza H subtypes and two influenza B subtypes.

430
00:45:13,843 --> 00:45:21,913
Now this color scheme will become important in a bit, but all of these different subtypes are very diverse.

431
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:27,643
But they can be generally grouped into what we call Group One and Blue and Group two and rare.

432
00:45:28,753 --> 00:45:31,453
We don't know which one of these is going to cause our next pandemic,

433
00:45:32,293 --> 00:45:37,243
but unfortunately we probably will have another flu pandemic sometime in our life.

434
00:45:38,203 --> 00:45:41,653
Now, there have been a number of flu pandemics over the last 100 years.

435
00:45:42,133 --> 00:45:47,502
You can see 1918, the Spanish flu that was caused by an H1N1 virus.

436
00:45:47,503 --> 00:45:50,323
What happens when these viruses cause a pandemic?

437
00:45:50,563 --> 00:45:57,463
We have a lot of death and disease and then what we get, these viruses don't just leave the human population, they stick around.

438
00:45:57,593 --> 00:46:02,563
That's what we're seeing with SARS-CoV-2. You have a pandemic and the virus eventually becomes endemic.

439
00:46:03,133 --> 00:46:08,683
Now, how can H1N1, for example, cause a pandemic in 1918 and then circulate for 40 years?

440
00:46:09,163 --> 00:46:12,913
Well, the virus changes in its major proteins hemagglutinin.

441
00:46:13,213 --> 00:46:16,573
And the second one is nerve and neuraminidase, which I haven't introduced yet today.

442
00:46:17,173 --> 00:46:20,742
Okay. Very much analogous to what we're seeing with SARS-CoV-2. We have a pandemic now.

443
00:46:20,743 --> 00:46:27,223
The virus is obviously diversified. Why is the virus doing it so it can reinfect the host over and over?

444
00:46:28,003 --> 00:46:33,583
You can see the timeline here. H3N2 caused a pandemic in 1957, H3N2 in 1968.

445
00:46:34,123 --> 00:46:40,093
And as of today, we have both H1N1 and H3N2 viruses circulating.

446
00:46:40,813 --> 00:46:45,283
Okay. So I walked you through the importance of our first infection.

447
00:46:45,943 --> 00:46:51,163
And if you look at this timeline, you can you can kind of see where your your burden is.

448
00:46:52,373 --> 00:47:01,073
Simply depending on your your birth, you have a different immune imprint or immune memory compared to the person sitting next to you.

449
00:47:01,943 --> 00:47:07,133
And I think that's remarkable. We have such diverse immunity in this room.

450
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:15,173
Just simply, depending on what year we we were introduced onto this planet.

451
00:47:16,423 --> 00:47:18,943
This is this is one of my favorite studies of all time.

452
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:28,723
This is a study from Kitty Gothic that showed that this early childhood imprinting is important for susceptibility to pandemic flu strains.

453
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:34,543
Now, I just showed you each one at age three and age two, because a lot of age is two to keep straight.

454
00:47:35,593 --> 00:47:44,082
They have caused pandemics and have circulated in humans with this study looked at was whether or not these novel viruses which have not yet

455
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:53,803
caused the pandemic age five viruses in age seven if they had different abilities to infect and cause disease in different aged individuals.

456
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:59,323
Let me let me let me unpack that. This is more or less of the slide that I just showed you.

457
00:48:00,283 --> 00:48:04,843
So you could see that the flu viruses circulated from 1918 to 1968.

458
00:48:05,293 --> 00:48:10,483
And after 1968, it has been mostly read viruses, H3N2.

459
00:48:10,963 --> 00:48:17,353
So the question simply is, if you're infected with one of these guys early in life compared to one of these guys,

460
00:48:17,653 --> 00:48:21,493
do you have different susceptibility to these newly emerging pandemic threats?

461
00:48:21,973 --> 00:48:30,163
And so this study simply looked at who was getting infected with H7N9 or H5N1, and the data are striking.

462
00:48:31,203 --> 00:48:38,533
Shown in these red bars are incidence and mortality of individuals who have been infected with H7.

463
00:48:39,223 --> 00:48:44,763
Again, this is a virus that hasn't yet caused a pandemic but has caused some local cases.

464
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:54,063
And you can see that most of these cases are primarily in and I don't want to call people old here, but primarily in people born before 1968.

465
00:48:55,163 --> 00:48:58,923
There you see very little case, few cases in individuals born after 68.

466
00:48:59,313 --> 00:49:03,123
Look who's been infected by H5N1. It is exactly the opposite.

467
00:49:03,603 --> 00:49:12,723
The old folks are seem to be protected, whereas the younger individuals have showed most of the case burden now.

468
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:17,733
Now, that is remarkable to me. Now, what is the antigenic explanation?

469
00:49:18,303 --> 00:49:25,922
Well, the explanation is that individuals who first saw these flu viruses in childhood have some protection against

470
00:49:25,923 --> 00:49:31,173
H5 because there's actually some epitopes on the hemagglutinin that are shared between these viruses,

471
00:49:31,443 --> 00:49:39,183
whereas individuals that were first infected with H3N2 in childhood have some protection against H7.

472
00:49:41,403 --> 00:49:48,783
That is remarkable to me because guess what? If you were born in this era, it is almost certain that you've been infected with H3N2.

473
00:49:49,173 --> 00:49:52,473
But it's the first infection that is the most important. Okay.

474
00:49:52,473 --> 00:49:57,453
That first infection seems to be the most important for establishing immune memory that can be recalled,

475
00:49:58,713 --> 00:50:01,653
both to protect against seasonal flu, but also pandemic flu.

476
00:50:02,913 --> 00:50:08,853
So Tommy Francis, he he he laid out this idea that these childhood infections were so important.

477
00:50:09,843 --> 00:50:15,693
And Francis being the guy he is, he didn't just end it. He didn't end his essay, just saying, well, we're all we're all doomed.

478
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:22,503
No, he offered hope at the end of this essay, and I'd like to read the last paragraph to you.

479
00:50:23,283 --> 00:50:30,843
Children represent the most susceptible members of the population and probably the most important material for the building of epidemics.

480
00:50:31,973 --> 00:50:40,943
The gaps in their immunity should be eliminated by providing early in life the antigenic stimuli to meet the known or anticipated recurrent strains.

481
00:50:42,343 --> 00:50:48,373
Natural exposures would then serve to enhance the broad immunity laid down by vaccination.

482
00:50:50,303 --> 00:50:52,613
This is the sentence that really, really gets to me.

483
00:50:52,643 --> 00:51:01,313
It is our hope that such vaccines can be made from pools of chemically purified antigens, or even with strains experimentally devised in this manner.

484
00:51:01,343 --> 00:51:06,533
The original sin of infection could be replaced by an initial blessing of induced immunity.

485
00:51:08,163 --> 00:51:12,563
You ask, you ask 20 immunologists what original energetics and means.

486
00:51:12,573 --> 00:51:16,173
You're going to get 20 different answers. But when you read this essay,

487
00:51:16,413 --> 00:51:25,593
it becomes clear that the real sin is that we're only infected once in childhood or with one particular strain in childhood.

488
00:51:26,743 --> 00:51:34,253
It's not it's not that that's a bad thing. The sin is that we have really super duper awesome immune memory against one strength.

489
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:42,612
And Francis. Francis envisioned a world where we would make vaccines three places in within it, within induce blessing immunity,

490
00:51:42,613 --> 00:51:48,733
which is a vaccine that would introduce the child's immune system to many different strains simultaneously.

491
00:51:51,193 --> 00:51:57,103
And so I wrote this essay with Stanley Bucket and Mike Warby, who is one of the authors on that caustic paper,

492
00:51:57,883 --> 00:52:02,352
which came out right about, I don't know, sometime in 2020, right around the beginning of the pandemic.

493
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:03,373
And the idea is simple.

494
00:52:03,793 --> 00:52:12,393
This is the situation that we have right now that by dumb luck of when you were born, you're either infected first with a red virus or blue virus.

495
00:52:12,403 --> 00:52:17,413
And so in this example, if you're infected first with the red bars and then come in with the blue virus.

496
00:52:18,463 --> 00:52:23,263
You have mostly a good immunity to read viruses, but not flu viruses.

497
00:52:24,283 --> 00:52:30,823
The converse is true. If you have blue first and then red, you have really good immunity to the blue viruses.

498
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:33,693
Now, this isn't rocket science here,

499
00:52:34,143 --> 00:52:44,432
but the idea is if we could introduce simultaneously viruses and in this paper we suggested live attenuated flu vaccines.

500
00:52:44,433 --> 00:52:48,213
If we get a group one and group two or red and blue at the same time, you have good immunity to off.

501
00:52:48,873 --> 00:52:52,743
And when Mike Warby Stanley block it and myself for writing this article,

502
00:52:53,643 --> 00:52:58,443
we had a little section on MRSA vaccines and we said, Oh, that's too fringe, that's too much on the fringe.

503
00:52:58,953 --> 00:53:02,493
No one's going to want to hear about that. That's too much of a conflict of interest since we worked on.

504
00:53:02,523 --> 00:53:08,943
So the data I'm going to show you today is, is on many vaccines because these many vaccines,

505
00:53:08,943 --> 00:53:13,803
new vaccines that can provide this initial blessing of induced immunity.

506
00:53:14,853 --> 00:53:18,713
And so I've been working on these vaccines with Drew Weissman for about five or six years.

507
00:53:18,723 --> 00:53:21,692
Of course, Drew has been working on these for his whole career,

508
00:53:21,693 --> 00:53:26,643
and him and Katie at the University of Pennsylvania made some of the key discoveries that

509
00:53:26,643 --> 00:53:32,163
have enabled these vaccines to be so useful in the context of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

510
00:53:32,573 --> 00:53:37,803
But but here's, here's, here's my slide that is, you know, five or six years old, and I'll stick to it.

511
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:43,893
The idea is to have an art in this case for flu encoding the hemagglutinin.

512
00:53:44,403 --> 00:53:48,213
And this is what Katie and Drew really worked out,

513
00:53:48,213 --> 00:53:54,453
is that these RNAs need to be modified in a way that they are not sensed by what we call the innate immune system.

514
00:53:54,843 --> 00:53:58,413
Okay, RNAs, if they are put into your cell in the wrong area of your cell,

515
00:53:58,623 --> 00:54:02,643
you have a very strong inflammatory response and it just shuts down protein synthesis.

516
00:54:03,213 --> 00:54:09,123
If you have an RNA or a nucleic acid based vaccine, you want that to get into your cells and start producing the antigen.

517
00:54:09,573 --> 00:54:19,533
So so the trick is to modify this RNA in a way to make essentially the vaccine not seen by the early phase of the immune response so that the vaccine,

518
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:23,343
so that vaccine antigen can be built up, an immune response can be elicited against it.

519
00:54:24,003 --> 00:54:27,393
Now, these things are encapsulated in something called a lipid nanoparticle.

520
00:54:27,783 --> 00:54:32,733
And I tell you, when all the Nobel Prizes and stuff take out from the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,

521
00:54:33,033 --> 00:54:38,043
I think what we'll see is that the lipid nanoparticle is probably just as important,

522
00:54:38,043 --> 00:54:46,983
and the formulations of these different living nanoparticles are just as important as the discoveries of of the RNA modification technology.

523
00:54:47,403 --> 00:54:54,243
Okay. So, so it's a fairly simple vaccine, an RNA encoding hemagglutinin encapsulated within the lipid nanoparticles.

524
00:54:54,513 --> 00:54:56,373
Now, here are some of the studies that we've done with Drew.

525
00:54:56,553 --> 00:55:03,452
You know, before the pandemic, I like this one slide here showing this is a mouse study where animals were immunized,

526
00:55:03,453 --> 00:55:06,963
either with an RNA expressing hemagglutinin or a conventional vaccine.

527
00:55:07,293 --> 00:55:12,603
And you can see just superior antibody responses that are very long lived in mice.

528
00:55:13,053 --> 00:55:18,962
So we've shown out in these papers that these vaccines elicit very strong germinal centers.

529
00:55:18,963 --> 00:55:21,063
That's a GM paper from 2018.

530
00:55:21,453 --> 00:55:27,753
And this has been shown in that's in an animal model, but that has been shown to prove true with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of humans.

531
00:55:28,143 --> 00:55:37,322
We showed in this 2018 paper in Nature Communications that we get both head and stalk antibodies to regions of the hemagglutinin with these vaccines.

532
00:55:37,323 --> 00:55:42,723
And then finally in this paper, I feel like any paper, non-covid paper that was published in 2020, it's like no one's read.

533
00:55:43,383 --> 00:55:46,803
But I think this is one of one of our best showing that these vaccines actually

534
00:55:46,803 --> 00:55:50,582
circumvent the inhibitory effects of maternal and child antibodies are very good,

535
00:55:50,583 --> 00:55:56,643
but they can actually bind to vaccine antigens and inhibit the de novo response listed by those vaccines.

536
00:55:56,643 --> 00:56:02,223
And in that study, we used the mouse model to show that the many vaccines can can inhibit or overcome this division,

537
00:56:02,493 --> 00:56:07,323
something that we've now repeated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, getting ready to submit that paper.

538
00:56:07,873 --> 00:56:18,313
Okay, so what antigens should be included in a vaccine to induce, you know, Thomas Francis's dream of an initial blessing of induced immunity?

539
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:26,643
Everything that I've pointed out in that previous slide was was completed with a single hemagglutinin RNA strategy.

540
00:56:26,643 --> 00:56:31,292
One How about find antigens that are conserved among many different subtypes?

541
00:56:31,293 --> 00:56:35,313
So in this example, maybe we could take one blue antigen and one red antigen.

542
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:37,413
We Whitfield loves this, okay?

543
00:56:37,503 --> 00:56:44,163
They love these conserved epitopes, in particular against the hemagglutinin stalk, which tends to be more conserved among different subtypes.

544
00:56:45,003 --> 00:56:51,633
But we took the second strategy. We the second strategy is, look, you have a flexible platform like RNA.

545
00:56:51,633 --> 00:56:55,053
Why not just have lots of different antigens from many different subtypes?

546
00:56:55,833 --> 00:57:02,133
And it's funny because sometimes I give talks to local schools in Philadelphia, I do some community college lectures.

547
00:57:02,493 --> 00:57:06,063
I always get this comment when I describe energetic drift in how it's a problem.

548
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:11,283
People raise their hand, say, Well, why don't you put all the strains in once she's put all the strains in the vaccine?

549
00:57:12,093 --> 00:57:15,933
And, you know, I would get kind of like twitchy and say, well, we just don't do that.

550
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:27,063
Right? But it's actually a good idea if you have a platform like Ana Amada to be able to actually pull that off from a manufacturing standpoint.

551
00:57:27,453 --> 00:57:32,913
Okay. So here is the 20:08 a.m. RNA vaccine that I would like to introduce to you today.

552
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:42,513
It just is the vaccine, the lipid nanoparticle vaccine that has one hemagglutinin from each subtype that we know about,

553
00:57:42,603 --> 00:57:49,592
the case of 18 influenza A subtypes in the two influenza B lineages and this is probably hard to see.

554
00:57:49,593 --> 00:57:50,252
It sure is.

555
00:57:50,253 --> 00:58:00,843
But it basically this just shows the phylogenetic trees of all the different subtypes and in X or the actual specific hemagglutinin that we chose.

556
00:58:00,843 --> 00:58:09,073
And we can talk more about that later. Okay. So what we first did and I will just say that this paper is under review, has been under review for ever.

557
00:58:09,573 --> 00:58:14,123
So I keep on checking my phone, getting ready, hope.

558
00:58:14,303 --> 00:58:18,423
They would be accepted one day, but we took individual RNA vaccines.

559
00:58:18,493 --> 00:58:21,923
Okay. So we first want to just make sure that they were all immunogenic.

560
00:58:21,923 --> 00:58:24,983
So we took single RNA vaccines, immunized a few mice,

561
00:58:25,223 --> 00:58:33,083
and then we completed a lysis to see how well the antibodies elicit by these vaccines can bind to each of the hemagglutinin.

562
00:58:33,533 --> 00:58:41,062
Okay, so vaccines sort of on the x axis, on the Y axis, these are Eliza plates coated with different recombinant hemagglutinin proteins.

563
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:46,463
And you see what you would expect. There's mostly, at these low doses, a subtype specific response.

564
00:58:46,463 --> 00:58:56,693
There is some cross-reactivity. But this this assures that these are all immunogenic when given or delivered singly.

565
00:58:58,053 --> 00:59:01,292
But but so the next step was now just to simply combine them.

566
00:59:01,293 --> 00:59:13,203
All right. And so. So here are the groups are 20 age group where in these experiments everyone gets everyone every mouse gets the same vaccine dose.

567
00:59:13,533 --> 00:59:17,162
So 50 micrograms across the board. So here's a mixture of all of them.

568
00:59:17,163 --> 00:59:21,812
So we have 2.5 micrograms of each of the tomatoes here.

569
00:59:21,813 --> 00:59:31,793
We have a high 50 microgram of just the H1, which you can think of as a blue guy, 50 micrograms of H three, which is a red guy, Influenza B and PBS.

570
00:59:31,803 --> 00:59:37,843
Okay, so the experiment, I'll show you a few experiments from this, but more or less, we vaccinate in mice, just a single vaccination.

571
00:59:37,863 --> 00:59:40,953
We bleed a different time points, and then we've done some challenge experiments.

572
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:47,073
Okay, so here are some of the control groups and you'll see data like this as we as I kind of go through.

573
00:59:48,213 --> 00:59:51,693
So in this case, these are animals that got the influenza B vaccine.

574
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:57,483
This is area under the curve, which is just antibodies. So as you go up here, there's more antibodies.

575
00:59:57,813 --> 01:00:01,863
And here we're measuring antibodies against all those antigens that are in the vaccine.

576
01:00:02,253 --> 01:00:09,812
So when you give animals influenza B money, you can see that they have antibodies against the influenza B antigens,

577
01:00:09,813 --> 01:00:18,483
but not against either the group one or group two or you know, these are essentially the blue and the red influenza viruses.

578
01:00:18,483 --> 01:00:28,053
PBS mice look as they should. They don't have antibodies at all. Now, when we give the animals a high dose of one of these blue guys, h one,

579
01:00:28,293 --> 01:00:32,763
they have the highest antibodies against H1 and there are some cross-reactivity to some of the other

580
01:00:33,003 --> 01:00:38,613
group one subtypes because there are some epitopes conserved but no reactivity to two these guys.

581
01:00:38,853 --> 01:00:42,033
And the converse is true with one of these red vaccines.

582
01:00:42,393 --> 01:00:48,783
And so here is the biggie. What happens now when we give the mice the 2080 vaccine?

583
01:00:49,963 --> 01:00:50,893
Look at this. It's amazing.

584
01:00:50,903 --> 01:00:56,623
We didn't know that this is how it was going to shake out because there's something called, um, you know, dominance problems with your immune system.

585
01:00:56,623 --> 01:00:59,803
If you give multivalent vaccines or just an infection,

586
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:05,983
our immune system tends to hone in on particular epitopes at the expense of generating responses against another.

587
01:01:06,383 --> 01:01:11,983
Doesn't seem to be the case here. Here we have antibodies against every subtype elicited simultaneously.

588
01:01:12,163 --> 01:01:15,913
And keep in mind, these are very low doses of the individual ages.

589
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:24,342
Now, this is a very long lived response. This is now looking at day one, 18 in gray compared to day 28 in black.

590
01:01:24,343 --> 01:01:28,183
And you can see that these antibody responses stay around for quite some time now.

591
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:32,293
Maybe I should had this slide a little earlier since this might not be such a flu crowd.

592
01:01:32,293 --> 01:01:36,343
But I talked about hemagglutinin, which is the crystal structure shown here.

593
01:01:36,663 --> 01:01:42,492
Hemagglutinin is a trimer of three identical monomers and the money end of hemagglutinin is sort of on the top.

594
01:01:42,493 --> 01:01:49,633
That's where hemagglutinin will attach a flu variant onto a host cell by interacting with something called sialic acid.

595
01:01:49,843 --> 01:01:56,713
Now the head antibodies, which this is an antibody here, actually bind to the top of H,

596
01:01:56,893 --> 01:02:00,042
which we call the head and prevent hemagglutinin from actually attaching,

597
01:02:00,043 --> 01:02:05,652
whereas some of these antibodies target this more conserved epitope called the Scott and they prevent other

598
01:02:05,653 --> 01:02:12,433
parts of the viral cycle and can operate through other mechanisms that I think I might mention anyway.

599
01:02:12,443 --> 01:02:17,262
So we looked at the different types of antibodies and I'm probably short on time or getting short on time.

600
01:02:17,263 --> 01:02:21,732
And this vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibodies as well as the stalk antibodies.

601
01:02:21,733 --> 01:02:26,863
So this is looking at neutralizing antibodies which are primarily antibodies targeting the head.

602
01:02:27,523 --> 01:02:32,083
Okay. I walk through some of these panels. So here's H1N1 neutralizing antibodies.

603
01:02:32,263 --> 01:02:36,763
Sure. If you're given a high dose of H one, only you have very high levels.

604
01:02:36,913 --> 01:02:44,263
But now here's 1/20 dose of H one. You're still getting decent levels with the 28 vaccine and you can walk through it.

605
01:02:44,263 --> 01:02:49,273
It's pretty much in this case of H seven that you can see why you need all eight,

606
01:02:49,273 --> 01:02:55,033
all 20 ages in their H one at age three don't get the job done, but the 20 does.

607
01:02:55,993 --> 01:03:04,993
Here are the stock antibodies. Same thing. Keep in mind, you know, you see when you have this blue group, which is H one, this is a group one virus.

608
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:12,703
So you have high group one stocks. If you have the H three vaccine, this is a group to have high antibody levels against group group two.

609
01:03:12,913 --> 01:03:16,453
But now in purple is R 20 HD vaccine, you have decent levels against both,

610
01:03:16,843 --> 01:03:22,483
keeping in mind that only 50% of the antigen is against group one or two in that multivalent vaccine.

611
01:03:23,973 --> 01:03:27,422
Now this this slide I have a hard time talking about in front of you.

612
01:03:27,423 --> 01:03:36,662
No virologist. So I maybe I'll. Maybe I'll skip over it, but but suffice to say, you know, there could be one of two things going on.

613
01:03:36,663 --> 01:03:40,803
One could be is that we have antibodies against all these different epitopes, as I'm proposing.

614
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:46,413
The other is the other possibility is that we're actually just having antibodies against super conserved epitopes.

615
01:03:46,743 --> 01:03:51,753
You know, you have a lot of different antigens. There's very rare epitopes are conserved. Are we having a focusing on the response?

616
01:03:51,753 --> 01:03:59,463
And that is not the case. These are absorption assays that actually were first, I don't know, first described by Thomas Francis,

617
01:03:59,463 --> 01:04:05,463
but certainly used by Thomas Francis back in the day in this case, we used fancier molecular biology to do it.

618
01:04:05,463 --> 01:04:08,463
But essentially when we I'll just take you right over here.

619
01:04:08,463 --> 01:04:16,863
If we have beads that are coated with either H1 or H3 and we pre incubate serum from vaccinated mice with these beads,

620
01:04:17,043 --> 01:04:21,242
you can see that H1 beads will actually deplete H1 reactive antibodies,

621
01:04:21,243 --> 01:04:25,503
but they will have no effect on the other antibodies reacting to the other antigens.

622
01:04:25,503 --> 01:04:34,713
Same thing with H3. It's okay if if we don't understand this slide, but we're going to try and make some concessions so we can go back to it.

623
01:04:35,943 --> 01:04:41,973
But it is actually a very important sector. Okay. So we we challenged mice now with matched mismatch strains.

624
01:04:41,973 --> 01:04:45,782
So here is here's a bodyweight.

625
01:04:45,783 --> 01:04:51,182
Okay. So when you these mice were either vaccinated with what you're seeing here in this case, we use a control.

626
01:04:51,183 --> 01:04:55,953
This is an mRNA expressing luciferase, which is it should not protect you against flu.

627
01:04:56,193 --> 01:05:02,732
And sure enough, those mice that got the irrelevant vaccine after challenge with what is pretty fairly well-matched to the vaccine,

628
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:09,243
they always wait and die. Now, if they get it in H three vaccine, they'll die of influenza B vaccine, they all die.

629
01:05:09,423 --> 01:05:15,062
Now here's an H1 vaccine, complete protection and here's our 20 take vaccine list a little bit away.

630
01:05:15,063 --> 01:05:16,383
But but are fully protected.

631
01:05:17,193 --> 01:05:26,733
Keep in mind 1/20 of the dose dose is important vaccines we look at clinical score and of course those mice that lost a lot of weight and die,

632
01:05:26,743 --> 01:05:36,723
they have more clinical signs. You can see that 2080 vaccinated mice show just a few days of symptoms, but they are okay and again, they all survive.

633
01:05:37,203 --> 01:05:40,623
Now, what happens with a mismatch strain? Oh, lung titers.

634
01:05:40,653 --> 01:05:44,343
I will just. I forgot that was here. So lung titers, it's more or less.

635
01:05:44,343 --> 01:05:47,973
You can't detect fires in the lungs of these mice two and five days after infection.

636
01:05:48,793 --> 01:05:50,263
Now what happens with the mismatch?

637
01:05:51,433 --> 01:05:58,123
Because, you know, our idea here is to guess what each seven particular like virus is going to cause a pandemic in a few years.

638
01:05:58,393 --> 01:06:03,522
It's to lay down that that immune memory. And so here's a mismatch.

639
01:06:03,523 --> 01:06:07,273
One, what you can see is both in the blue and the purple group, you do get weight loss,

640
01:06:07,273 --> 01:06:11,593
but recovery in the other groups, you have rapid weight loss and death.

641
01:06:12,013 --> 01:06:17,133
Now, if you look at clinical signs here, you see the groups that you sort of get the relevant vaccines.

642
01:06:17,143 --> 01:06:19,153
They have high clinical signs, they all die.

643
01:06:19,423 --> 01:06:30,673
But now the animals that either get the H1 only or the 20 days together are have many fewer clinical scores and survive.

644
01:06:31,393 --> 01:06:34,453
And here's something interesting if you look at lung titers.

645
01:06:35,943 --> 01:06:39,123
There's not a whole lot of difference. This isn't sterilizing immunity.

646
01:06:40,393 --> 01:06:43,733
This is not this is what's happening with honor crime. Okay.

647
01:06:44,053 --> 01:06:47,053
It's similar that match, but go back for a second.

648
01:06:47,053 --> 01:06:50,983
This is like a max strain. Man, you. Everyone knows how many vaccines first came out.

649
01:06:51,343 --> 01:06:55,573
Let's go to Vegas, right? It was.

650
01:06:55,993 --> 01:07:00,853
It was. You really just were protected against PCR confirmed infection.

651
01:07:01,723 --> 01:07:07,512
But but in this case now with when you see this match, we have protection against severe disease.

652
01:07:07,513 --> 01:07:10,662
We're not in the hospital, but we're still getting PCR confirmed infection.

653
01:07:10,663 --> 01:07:13,903
We'll see how it works out with the Bible and a vaccine.

654
01:07:15,343 --> 01:07:18,793
Already. How am I doing? Time. You got time? I got time.

655
01:07:18,883 --> 01:07:24,973
Okay, so we. We, as immunologists tried to figure out mechanistically what's going on.

656
01:07:25,063 --> 01:07:29,593
So this is still a mouse where we did things like deplete t cells.

657
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:37,783
Does everyone here know what T cells are? T cells recognize conserved epitopes that are sort of presented by virally infected cells.

658
01:07:38,923 --> 01:07:42,253
And so we depleted T cells and it did nothing.

659
01:07:42,553 --> 01:07:47,352
This is a homologous challenge, so it doesn't really look like the protection is fully t cell dependent.

660
01:07:47,353 --> 01:07:50,233
But then we did these other studies where we passively transferred antibodies.

661
01:07:50,713 --> 01:07:55,932
So in this experiment, we took antibodies from mice that got the vaccine, put it into naive mice.

662
01:07:55,933 --> 01:07:57,703
And the challenge, you can see they're all protected.

663
01:07:58,213 --> 01:08:04,153
So at least for that homologous challenge, it looks like antibodies are sufficient for mediating protection.

664
01:08:04,963 --> 01:08:09,012
But what about the mismatch challenge? And so here's the mismatch challenge.

665
01:08:09,013 --> 01:08:16,233
So here is a virus that here's a virus that is very much not like the vaccine strain.

666
01:08:16,303 --> 01:08:19,093
Again, the T cells don't seem to be important for protection.

667
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:24,553
Now, when we passively transfer serum from vaccinated mice into naive mice and challenged with the mismatch strain,

668
01:08:24,853 --> 01:08:28,453
you can see that we delay death, but it's not 100% protection.

669
01:08:29,113 --> 01:08:32,203
And I don't know if I put it in here.

670
01:08:32,203 --> 01:08:32,772
No, I did it.

671
01:08:32,773 --> 01:08:42,133
So there are processes called ADC antibody and cellular cytotoxicity where antibodies can actually bind to antigens from early infected cells,

672
01:08:42,133 --> 01:08:47,503
immediate killing of the cells. And we show that these vaccines elicit very strong atcc responses.

673
01:08:47,893 --> 01:08:51,463
So we're not sure quite what the mechanism is in protection.

674
01:08:51,973 --> 01:08:54,853
But again, it may be analogous to what's happening with armored prod.

675
01:08:54,913 --> 01:09:00,583
Why, when you're vaccinated with the original Washington or ruminant SARS-CoV-2 strain, do you have protecting against severe disease?

676
01:09:00,793 --> 01:09:07,963
It could be through non neutralizing antibodies that bind immediate processes like Atcc could also be that you have memory B cells around.

677
01:09:08,503 --> 01:09:12,943
You've got that illogical imprint. Those B cells can undergo something cosmetic,

678
01:09:12,943 --> 01:09:19,603
like a mutation where they can actually modify themselves in a way to be able to recognize energetically, distinguish distinct strains better.

679
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:29,923
Okay, Arnold, I'm glad you're back, because I have a year coming up in the experimental design in two slides, maybe three slides.

680
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:36,282
So we have now tested this in ferrets. And in this case, we did a prime boost, followed by a challenge.

681
01:09:36,283 --> 01:09:44,023
And in this case, this is a challenge that with the mismatch strain and these studies were done by SEMA like Iguala is now was at pit.

682
01:09:44,073 --> 01:09:47,982
Now it's moving her left Emory the they look great here's a prime and a boost

683
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:52,993
and you can see antibodies elicited in these ferrets against all subtypes.

684
01:09:53,413 --> 01:09:55,383
Now we challenge with the mismatch strain.

685
01:09:55,663 --> 01:10:03,133
You can see in the vaccinated group you have weight loss, as you would expect because of the mismatch nature of the challenged virus.

686
01:10:03,373 --> 01:10:08,063
But not as much weight loss as the unvaccinated. You can see this is only about a four.

687
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:14,623
So take take what you want from it. But all the vaccinated animals survived, whereas two out of the four unvaccinated died.

688
01:10:14,983 --> 01:10:20,443
And you can see here that clinical signs of the you feel a lot better if you're fair and you're vaccinated.

689
01:10:21,313 --> 01:10:23,983
Here's a nice thing with the nasal wash titers,

690
01:10:24,283 --> 01:10:29,703
which kind of look like the mouse data that I showed you that there's no difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated.

691
01:10:29,713 --> 01:10:34,733
I think this is remarkable. There's no difference at all. Again, this is a mismatch, a very mismatched challenge strain.

692
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:38,653
But look, look what happens at later time. Points of infection. There's faster clearance.

693
01:10:39,613 --> 01:10:43,303
So you get those memory B cells that are that are getting recruited and evolving.

694
01:10:43,303 --> 01:10:47,383
You also have these non neutralizing antibody responses that only work after infection.

695
01:10:47,533 --> 01:10:53,233
Okay. So okay, so influenza that so this is this was the dream.

696
01:10:53,383 --> 01:11:01,483
Can we make a multivalent vaccine to, you know, to essentially provide immune memory,

697
01:11:02,113 --> 01:11:05,743
you know, introduce this to to kids so that they have immune memory later in life.

698
01:11:06,253 --> 01:11:12,403
But what about adults? I'm looking around the room and I only see like two, two or three, like under five year olds.

699
01:11:13,423 --> 01:11:20,983
Is there any hope for the over five year olds? Okay. So can the 28 vaccine elicit balanced responses in animals who've already encountered flu?

700
01:11:21,313 --> 01:11:24,673
And so here, here's our system. So we just took mice.

701
01:11:25,483 --> 01:11:30,483
And I just everything I showed you were naive mice, right? So now we're first infected with H1 and then vaccinating.

702
01:11:30,493 --> 01:11:35,473
The question is, if you have H1 has an infection first and then get vaccinated with this multivalent vaccine,

703
01:11:35,473 --> 01:11:41,203
are you just going to have tons of H1 responses or are you able to mount de novo responses against the other things in the vaccine?

704
01:11:41,863 --> 01:11:48,192
And so we did this. Here is what it looks like after infection, but before vaccination.

705
01:11:48,193 --> 01:11:54,223
And so your animals that didn't have any prior exposure and I've already showed you this is before vaccination.

706
01:11:54,223 --> 01:12:02,713
I already showed you that these these guys go on to develop a very good response after vaccination here animals with California 2009 prior exposure.

707
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:10,603
So that is very well-matched to the vaccine. And you can see that these animals already have a very high H1 response in people with vaccine,

708
01:12:10,903 --> 01:12:13,993
and here are animals that are first infected with an unrelated H1.

709
01:12:15,303 --> 01:12:20,793
And so this is this is trying to you know, I've told you before all the press right now.

710
01:12:21,153 --> 01:12:24,183
And Arnold. Arnold. So this is a much more recent virus.

711
01:12:24,183 --> 01:12:29,973
I don't think Adam's here, but Adam Laurie, young faculty member, who's your colleague?

712
01:12:30,483 --> 01:12:39,543
His immune response might look something like this. Arnold, who was was was not born in the 1970s, has a different type immune response.

713
01:12:39,543 --> 01:12:42,932
And this is my son Tyler, who by now he has immunity.

714
01:12:42,933 --> 01:12:46,863
But you get the idea. So what happens? This is what happened.

715
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:51,813
So I've already shown you that mice that look like Tyler go on to develop very good immunity against all strains.

716
01:12:52,173 --> 01:12:53,703
Look at this, adam.

717
01:12:53,703 --> 01:13:00,783
Laurie, like mice have antibodies against h1 before the vaccine, they get boosted, but not at the expense of generating other responses.

718
01:13:01,173 --> 01:13:05,853
And if within energetically distinct H1 prior exposure, we see the same thing.

719
01:13:06,723 --> 01:13:10,683
We did this now with nonhuman primates, this experiment you would never try to do.

720
01:13:11,013 --> 01:13:19,863
But this is an experiment, Tony Moody at Duke, where they infected animals with H1N1 and then they infected with H3N2 and then COVID happened.

721
01:13:20,373 --> 01:13:27,452
And these animals just sat for a year. And it was great for us because that's right around the time we started working with this group.

722
01:13:27,453 --> 01:13:32,703
So we sent them vaccine and then we did a prime boost in these animals that were prior prior exposure with prior exposure.

723
01:13:32,703 --> 01:13:38,643
And then we also did it with animals without prior exposure. You could just see first the antibody responses against the H1.

724
01:13:38,643 --> 01:13:43,382
It is three component. So you can you can see here in blue and red that the animals get infected,

725
01:13:43,383 --> 01:13:49,292
they get the response and the vaccine itself actually boosts antibodies against these earlier strains.

726
01:13:49,293 --> 01:13:53,643
But the question is, what does that come at the expense of generating de novo responses?

727
01:13:54,933 --> 01:13:58,503
This can be hard to see secure animals that had no prior exposure.

728
01:13:59,373 --> 01:14:05,072
This is day zero. They have no antibodies. Here's Prime Day 14, prime day 28.

729
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:10,293
Stuff starting to light up. Now you boost day 41 post prime day 56 post prime.

730
01:14:10,293 --> 01:14:13,983
So this is like 14 and 28 days. You could see antibodies against everything.

731
01:14:14,433 --> 01:14:18,933
And what about the animals with prior exposure here? The animals with prior exposure?

732
01:14:18,993 --> 01:14:22,233
These are nonhuman primates, I think three per group, four per group, three per group.

733
01:14:22,623 --> 01:14:26,493
And they have antibodies before vaccination. Look at this.

734
01:14:26,793 --> 01:14:31,263
Everything lights up after a primary and then by a boost, it's even higher.

735
01:14:31,503 --> 01:14:32,553
Here's the amazing thing.

736
01:14:32,553 --> 01:14:39,573
This to me, because these are just all the different allies antigens like we've been looking at throughout this to me, looks a whole lot like this.

737
01:14:40,633 --> 01:14:48,403
So if you have prior exposure, you actually it's almost like you have a recall response upon your first dose of this vaccine.

738
01:14:49,063 --> 01:14:52,843
Again, thinking about parallels to COVID. What do we learn early in the COVID pandemic?

739
01:14:52,843 --> 01:14:56,863
You got infected in that first wave of the pandemic and then you got your first vaccine.

740
01:14:56,863 --> 01:15:00,373
It almost looked like your immune system, your immune response was already primed.

741
01:15:00,373 --> 01:15:08,193
And that's what it's looking like here. Okay. So I'm going to wrap up with a summary here.

742
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:14,683
So the 20:08 a.m. RNA vaccine, I've shown you, it elicits good responses in mice, ferrets, non-human primates.

743
01:15:15,493 --> 01:15:19,833
The vaccines can protect mice and ferrets against a mismatch virus challenge.

744
01:15:20,233 --> 01:15:22,453
And we're still trying to do mechanistic studies.

745
01:15:22,453 --> 01:15:30,493
But the NIH is interested in this, and we are starting to plan to make clinical grade vaccine for a Phase one study, hopefully next year.

746
01:15:31,383 --> 01:15:33,363
So I'll leave you with this idea.

747
01:15:33,393 --> 01:15:40,682
I think that this vaccine might be useful to provide an initial blessing of immunity in children in the children very early in life,

748
01:15:40,683 --> 01:15:45,333
so that they have the immune memory, the memory B cells to draw on for the rest of their life.

749
01:15:45,663 --> 01:15:48,813
But absolution of original antigenic sin in adults.

750
01:15:49,233 --> 01:15:52,593
And I'm not a religious scholar, but I Googled it, and I think that's the right word.

751
01:15:54,063 --> 01:15:59,403
So I think it's interesting to think, you know, what would Thomas Francis think if he again,

752
01:15:59,403 --> 01:16:05,673
I started today's talk by talking about how to use red blood cells and crude and perhaps a virus to make so many important discoveries.

753
01:16:05,673 --> 01:16:12,273
What would he think today if he were alive with the technologies that we have, such as RNA vaccines?

754
01:16:12,843 --> 01:16:16,173
And finally, I found this picture on the Internet.

755
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:22,053
I am so grateful to be here today, Arnold, and I wish you the best for whatever comes next.

756
01:16:22,653 --> 01:16:29,073
Okay, acknowledgments. Here's here's the lab. And Claudia in my lab is a Ph.D. student.

757
01:16:29,073 --> 01:16:33,903
She did most of this work, and she is now working. Advisor without a postdoc, just straight advisor.

758
01:16:35,013 --> 01:16:46,213
If anyone here is a trainee interested in this work, I'm always looking to hire a postdoc, so please contact me and you can use your real name.

759
01:16:47,013 --> 01:16:50,123
Always Sunny in Philadelphia. It's a beautiful place.

760
01:16:50,703 --> 01:16:58,480
Okay, thank you very much. I mean.

761
01:17:00,381 --> 01:17:04,371
Oh, I know. We have more time for running around.

762
01:17:04,521 --> 01:17:07,791
I know we're running early, but. Okay. I'll take my rail trail.

763
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:14,181
And I will. I will to knows how many PowerPoints I have.

764
01:17:14,191 --> 01:17:29,631
That's why she's giving me a report. And what I'm going to try to do here is return more to Cassie's to the theme of Cassie's presentation,

765
01:17:29,631 --> 01:17:37,941
which is basically how do you get a vaccine, which you have shown is surfactant to be properly used?

766
01:17:38,921 --> 01:17:45,851
And. And I'm not just going to focus on vaccines here because I'm going to be going over the

767
01:17:45,851 --> 01:17:58,361
whole field and then prevention and using it as my way of introducing the various topics.

768
01:17:58,571 --> 01:18:03,731
The history of damage control and the 21st century.

769
01:18:04,661 --> 01:18:12,171
Which means we have to start with the notable year of 2005.

770
01:18:12,601 --> 01:18:21,101
That was a very notable year for all of us who were working at that point, because the first thing that happened was the original summit,

771
01:18:22,691 --> 01:18:31,781
and I remember saying very publicly that the genie was out of the bottle and we were not

772
01:18:31,781 --> 01:18:37,541
going to be able to put the genie back into the bottle because transmission was occurring.

773
01:18:37,571 --> 01:18:48,431
It was occurring in various cities in the world. It was causing disruption there and nothing was going to be able to stop it.

774
01:18:48,551 --> 01:18:56,041
We had no vaccines. We had a virus. We even said you shouldn't be using steroids and treatment,

775
01:18:56,381 --> 01:19:04,631
which I come back to when we discovered that maybe, maybe there is an effect of steroids in treatment.

776
01:19:05,261 --> 01:19:11,831
So and it all ended in 2003, around the middle of the year,

777
01:19:12,191 --> 01:19:20,981
when the genie was put back in the bottle or put itself back in the bottle, likely through non-pharmaceutical interventions.

778
01:19:21,281 --> 01:19:27,641
So we had that experience and it was really a unique phenomenon.

779
01:19:28,861 --> 01:19:41,431
What people forget is that at the end of the year, there are there was a sharp outbreak in Beijing, and it was from a nosocomial.

780
01:19:42,301 --> 01:19:45,541
I mean, it was a laboratory based outbreak.

781
01:19:46,261 --> 01:19:59,371
And it resulted in the Chinese CDC being given better facilities for you to be and so of three.

782
01:20:01,411 --> 01:20:07,740
Facilities. When it they it was too beforehand.

783
01:20:07,741 --> 01:20:15,091
So this was a a situation where there was a little bit a surprise afterwards.

784
01:20:15,091 --> 01:20:18,481
It scared everybody because we thought that things had started up.

785
01:20:19,201 --> 01:20:25,141
But what happened at the end of the year was H5N1 started spreading.

786
01:20:26,791 --> 01:20:38,010
It was at the tail end of 2000, 2003 and got in the literature only in 2004.

787
01:20:38,011 --> 01:20:50,401
And it was a infrequent but lethal infection was clearly spread from backyard flocks and other chickens to humans.

788
01:20:50,911 --> 01:20:54,151
And at that point.

789
01:20:55,191 --> 01:21:01,861
Since it was spreading throughout Europe. Did not come to the Americans.

790
01:21:03,001 --> 01:21:09,151
It created a an alarm about this being the next pandemic virus.

791
01:21:09,871 --> 01:21:16,170
Remember, we hadn't had a flu pandemic since 1968, before this.

792
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:25,441
And everybody was saying, we're ready for a food bank. So we developed the three pillars of endemic control.

793
01:21:26,191 --> 01:21:30,490
And this is what we were looking at and the vaccines.

794
01:21:30,491 --> 01:21:41,070
And we knew it would be like even if we didn't have universal vaccines, we're working with A and B with flu vaccines,

795
01:21:41,071 --> 01:21:49,081
which were not really much advanced over the ones that have been used for the last 20 or 30 years.

796
01:21:49,081 --> 01:21:54,731
Before this time, we knew that there were going to have to be work together,

797
01:21:54,751 --> 01:22:02,341
and I'll show you the work that was done to get these flu vaccines ready to produce antibodies

798
01:22:02,341 --> 01:22:08,881
against a virus that was very distant from the ones that we hadn't been experiencing.

799
01:22:08,881 --> 01:22:13,261
So there was no way to. Antivirals.

800
01:22:14,491 --> 01:22:24,211
And we knew that we did have antivirals that were stockpiling, and we also had non-pharmaceutical interventions.

801
01:22:24,901 --> 01:22:32,071
And basically, one of the first things we did was to go back as I'll show you the our point list to some of the

802
01:22:32,071 --> 01:22:40,771
ancient history to try to figure out how to handle this with non-pharmaceutical interventions.

803
01:22:41,131 --> 01:22:49,740
And this is shows how the antibody and antiviral worked and it did work if it was given early enough.

804
01:22:49,741 --> 01:22:57,331
And this is another mantra from the story of the antivirals you have to give them early in order to get them to work.

805
01:22:57,721 --> 01:23:03,241
But you had significant antiviral resistance, which wasn't as greatly.

806
01:23:04,851 --> 01:23:09,051
And the interesting thing about this was that the.

807
01:23:11,991 --> 01:23:18,581
The approach of not only. Meditating through treatment but also contain.

808
01:23:18,591 --> 01:23:24,141
You came along and you'll see the first author here being Neil Ferguson,

809
01:23:24,561 --> 01:23:34,431
who developed the idea that you could bottle up the infection as the source by use of antivirals.

810
01:23:34,431 --> 01:23:39,410
And the idea was, since most of the cases were occurring in Southeast Asia,

811
01:23:39,411 --> 01:23:47,301
that this could be done in Thailand or Vietnam or someplace like that if the virus was emerging.

812
01:23:49,721 --> 01:23:54,771
And that's very interesting, given the fact that the SARS-COV2 was not followed up.

813
01:23:55,431 --> 01:23:58,361
And one of the things that I always think about is.

814
01:23:59,431 --> 01:24:07,890
Was it possible if there had been early recognition of what's going on to bottle of this infection before the middle of January,

815
01:24:07,891 --> 01:24:12,331
where it was transmitting already outside of China?

816
01:24:14,041 --> 01:24:17,361
And a lot of work was being done on vaccines.

817
01:24:17,371 --> 01:24:22,721
And this is switching to the next pillar. And what was experienced?

818
01:24:22,861 --> 01:24:36,781
This is some this is from the group that Jonathan knows very well where they actually show that with adjuvants you got a decent response to the H5N1.

819
01:24:36,781 --> 01:24:44,911
This is one of the adjuvants which is now in our in the vaccine that we use for older individuals in the United States.

820
01:24:45,301 --> 01:24:50,461
And this is another, more powerful and also more reactogenicity adjuvant,

821
01:24:50,671 --> 01:24:57,451
which allows you to get a response with two doses or broad response with two doses,

822
01:24:57,871 --> 01:25:10,001
which actually drove the way Europe responded to the 2009 pandemic, because this was expected to be a need for pandemic response.

823
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:18,111
But that's another story which will take me a long time if I was going to handle that.

824
01:25:18,121 --> 01:25:21,421
But these kinds of things were developed during this period.

825
01:25:22,201 --> 01:25:32,161
And the reason? One of the reasons we had as much work done and usually there's an intersection between politics, science policy and politics.

826
01:25:32,701 --> 01:25:43,861
Was that 2005, when this was really on the front burner of people's worry, was the year of Hurricane Katrina.

827
01:25:45,041 --> 01:25:51,591
And Hurricane Katrina was a political disaster for the administration at that time.

828
01:25:51,611 --> 01:26:04,301
They didn't handle it well, and therefore they felt they had to make up by handling the threat of an avian influenza pandemic better.

829
01:26:05,221 --> 01:26:09,281
And there is a lot of funding that helps the government forces.

830
01:26:09,691 --> 01:26:23,541
And this was a pre-pandemic planning guidance, which unfortunately was forgotten in 2008 and 2023,

831
01:26:24,901 --> 01:26:31,201
2020, when we were trying to respond to the to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

832
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:36,991
But you can look and see all of the federal agencies that signed up on it.

833
01:26:37,261 --> 01:26:43,890
And one of the things that was done with development of Non-Pharmaceutical

834
01:26:43,891 --> 01:26:49,291
interventions was looking back at history to see what worked and what didn't work.

835
01:26:49,771 --> 01:26:57,121
And there were there was a realization that the pandemic response had to be.

836
01:26:58,661 --> 01:27:03,851
Titers to the amount of disease that was seen.

837
01:27:05,591 --> 01:27:06,791
And the disease.

838
01:27:07,821 --> 01:27:18,491
And what was important was going to be case fatality, not necessarily the number of infections and categories of severity we developed,

839
01:27:18,491 --> 01:27:23,951
which is always a difficult thing to do and difficult things to do during a pandemic.

840
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:28,851
And there were five.

841
01:27:29,831 --> 01:27:32,831
Levels created. Why five?

842
01:27:33,521 --> 01:27:44,701
Well, there are five hurricane. And therefore, that's why the number five this year probably would have been better if it had been three,

843
01:27:45,151 --> 01:27:47,701
a mild, moderate and severe, but it was five.

844
01:27:48,421 --> 01:28:02,821
And the community strategies for social distancing and all the rest were developed along with severity did more if it was severe.

845
01:28:03,781 --> 01:28:11,881
And this this is one of the reasons why in an earlier meeting at the White House and Chuck,

846
01:28:11,881 --> 01:28:19,531
it says dust said dust off your old pandemic planning documents, which everybody had forgotten about.

847
01:28:20,161 --> 01:28:24,151
And then she was fired after that report.

848
01:28:25,051 --> 01:28:29,641
Okay. This is what was going to be done. Flattening the curve.

849
01:28:31,521 --> 01:28:34,641
So it was all developed during that period of time.

850
01:28:35,031 --> 01:28:44,031
And so part of this was we thought that it couldn't be done and it wouldn't last for very long.

851
01:28:44,721 --> 01:28:55,221
And what followed was and this was partially because of all this development now trying to speed up a little bit here so I can

852
01:28:55,221 --> 01:29:04,971
spend some time on the politics of how we got into the vaccine situation that we're in right now with the current pandemic.

853
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:10,670
This is that the international health regulations are very important because it's a treaty

854
01:29:10,671 --> 01:29:20,991
obligation of the member states to report all public health threats to the to the W.H.O.

855
01:29:21,561 --> 01:29:27,681
And this was a revised phase for the pandemic, for an influenza pandemic.

856
01:29:27,681 --> 01:29:31,071
And we got a milder pandemic in 2009.

857
01:29:31,971 --> 01:29:35,661
And these were the stages of the pandemic.

858
01:29:35,721 --> 01:29:39,141
And I happened to be on the emergency.

859
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:46,520
W.H.O. was first emergency committee. And what's curious here to show the intersection of policy,

860
01:29:46,521 --> 01:29:57,501
politics and vaccine development and vaccine purchase is the gap between phase five and 56, which was delayed.

861
01:29:59,151 --> 01:30:09,411
So that all of the influenza vaccine contracts that could be put in place because things happen when you delay.

862
01:30:10,481 --> 01:30:14,711
But I couldn't possibly comment. I know you couldn't possibly comment.

863
01:30:15,161 --> 01:30:23,211
And since we don't have reporters in the room, I could comment on this phase, phase, phase.

864
01:30:23,661 --> 01:30:34,221
We should have been in phase six, probably in in early May, to which phase six was spread in two W.H.O. regions.

865
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:40,831
And this is what we've experienced about the pandemic. And here were two ways.

866
01:30:40,861 --> 01:30:45,631
First, it was in the spring, which was what when we got to Ann Arbor.

867
01:30:45,631 --> 01:30:53,211
And here's where the South and some of the peripheral areas of Michigan got the second wave in the fall.

868
01:30:53,221 --> 01:31:01,960
And then. It was over and Epic was over and declaring the end of the pandemic was something else.

869
01:31:01,961 --> 01:31:09,280
But this is this is what was traditional and not traditional in terms of the severity,

870
01:31:09,281 --> 01:31:19,510
which was fairly mild because this was a ramp up, as you saw before from Scott's talk, a a variant of the H1N1.

871
01:31:19,511 --> 01:31:22,991
So there was a lot of experience in the population.

872
01:31:23,231 --> 01:31:31,931
And remember, what we've got now with SARS-CoV-2 is a population which has no experience with this with this virus.

873
01:31:32,291 --> 01:31:39,340
So now we're moving to COVID control with non-pharmaceutical interventions being at

874
01:31:39,341 --> 01:31:44,591
the top and still being practice is the major approach in some countries in Asia,

875
01:31:45,251 --> 01:31:49,111
antivirals and therapeutics, which has been the major gap.

876
01:31:52,481 --> 01:31:56,161
And partially related disease characteristics.

877
01:31:56,171 --> 01:32:03,401
And we really have antivirals which are modestly effective.

878
01:32:04,961 --> 01:32:20,621
And vaccines, which for most of the world have been the the major way we control the pandemic and have been much better in terms of their.

879
01:32:21,881 --> 01:32:25,281
Efficacy that we anticipated.

880
01:32:26,811 --> 01:32:30,411
And this is again the surprise, I promise you.

881
01:32:31,011 --> 01:32:44,991
We were wrong in 2003 saying don't give steroids in treatment because this was the first clear benefit in treatment when we had nothing available.

882
01:32:45,831 --> 01:32:51,861
Okay. And this, I believe I got from you, Cathy, that we were lucky.

883
01:32:52,611 --> 01:32:57,231
We were lucky because there one component of the virus, the spike,

884
01:32:58,281 --> 01:33:08,031
was the component that produced the it's not yet the correlative protection antibody to this, but it's pretty close.

885
01:33:08,751 --> 01:33:16,070
And this is the three kinds of vaccines that we're working with.

886
01:33:16,071 --> 01:33:20,001
And we've worked with the MMR and a vaccine against. Great surprise.

887
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:26,251
It's. And it worked as well as it did with viral vectors.

888
01:33:26,971 --> 01:33:30,541
You've had some experience in the UK with viral vectors we've had.

889
01:33:31,141 --> 01:33:39,841
We'll talk about the viral vector vaccine and how it got approved in the US a little bit and the protein based which is now for us Novavax,

890
01:33:39,841 --> 01:33:47,881
which is coming along much more slowly than we thought it would be because it's based on existing technology.

891
01:33:48,311 --> 01:33:52,801
It's going to be a little slower than the MMR vaccine, but not that slow.

892
01:33:53,131 --> 01:33:57,451
And I am not going to spend time on this PowerPoint.

893
01:33:57,511 --> 01:34:04,261
I use it mainly. I use it mainly early to show people that this was not rushed.

894
01:34:04,981 --> 01:34:08,821
It was not. It was subject to the same standards.

895
01:34:08,821 --> 01:34:19,711
The vaccine development was subject to the same standards that we were used to for developing other things, developing other vaccines.

896
01:34:20,011 --> 01:34:25,321
What was different was the organization, the fact that industry was part of it.

897
01:34:27,191 --> 01:34:35,231
And the government had invested in a great deal of money so that the risks that industry would ordinarily

898
01:34:36,611 --> 01:34:45,010
be able to take and enlist in parallel development and getting things ready to go at the minute,

899
01:34:45,011 --> 01:34:52,990
you know, that they are approved and and effective are possible dramatic and typically

900
01:34:52,991 --> 01:34:58,511
what not does not happen with the with the vaccine that we will spend five,

901
01:34:58,511 --> 01:35:06,851
ten, 15 years developing because it takes a long time to muster all of the support that you need.

902
01:35:07,941 --> 01:35:17,000
And I'll leave from now. What I'm going to do now is spend most of my time talking about vaccine approvals.

903
01:35:17,001 --> 01:35:24,501
Since I was I have been involved in this for the last couple of years.

904
01:35:25,101 --> 01:35:30,321
And just to remind you, as we saw in the last week or so,

905
01:35:30,531 --> 01:35:45,921
when there was some approval from India of of the vaccine to boost the booster vaccines, first from FDA and then from CDC that there are to.

906
01:35:47,271 --> 01:35:54,531
Agencies involved and FDA says, yes, these are effective.

907
01:35:54,711 --> 01:36:02,451
Yes, they are safe. And CDC typically decides how the vaccine is going to be used.

908
01:36:03,111 --> 01:36:12,891
It's been a little different this time because FDA has basically in many ways assumed the usual role of of

909
01:36:12,931 --> 01:36:22,401
of CDC or the agency created by approving for certain segments of the population and for recommending.

910
01:36:23,951 --> 01:36:37,901
The detail, which is usually the approach seems to say, now I'm just going to go through some of the issues about vaccine approvals now.

911
01:36:38,831 --> 01:36:43,421
Efficacy is necessary, but not sufficient for licensure.

912
01:36:44,421 --> 01:36:48,650
And there's a question of why do we need emergency use authorization?

913
01:36:48,651 --> 01:36:54,291
Because more than efficacy and safety are required for licensure.

914
01:36:54,771 --> 01:37:07,041
And that's why we really have the vaccine approaches and vaccines available for you and age groups eligible for vaccines now

915
01:37:07,041 --> 01:37:18,081
that are still emergency use because the data have been insufficient to get them licensed and emergency use authorization.

916
01:37:19,281 --> 01:37:21,081
First you have to have an emergency.

917
01:37:21,531 --> 01:37:27,801
And that's a very interesting point, because if we decide in the next few months that we don't have an emergency anymore,

918
01:37:28,191 --> 01:37:32,571
everything is just approved under emergency use. Authorization goes away.

919
01:37:33,261 --> 01:37:39,351
So we were but the standard is may be effective.

920
01:37:40,461 --> 01:37:46,400
They don't have to be affected. There must be some indication that they are effective.

921
01:37:46,401 --> 01:37:52,251
And that's how hydroxychloroquine and things like that got approved for a small.

922
01:37:53,331 --> 01:38:02,181
During. So the first meeting, which I was the chair of, of the verb pack,

923
01:38:02,181 --> 01:38:10,041
which is the vaccines related Biologics Product Advisory Committee, occurred on the 20th of October.

924
01:38:10,251 --> 01:38:23,271
And I'll take you through this because I didn't realize at the time exactly how much drama was going on in the back at the time of the meeting.

925
01:38:23,271 --> 01:38:28,911
Not only that, there was some dissension among the leadership and at FDA,

926
01:38:29,331 --> 01:38:39,831
which I directly experienced later on in another meeting, but also between between FDA and the White House.

927
01:38:42,311 --> 01:38:42,841
Okay.

928
01:38:42,851 --> 01:38:52,811
So then this meeting, like all the windows open meeting, these are all open meetings going on all day and with a webcast available to the public.

929
01:38:54,031 --> 01:38:57,271
And again, license you're using.

930
01:38:57,691 --> 01:39:10,171
And with what we were asked to decide to do to to say was whether we were comfortable with the idea that we any way would be issued if they.

931
01:39:11,621 --> 01:39:16,430
Vaccine efficacy was greater than 50% at one time.

932
01:39:16,431 --> 01:39:25,051
Where the background here is flu vaccines and a good 50 to 60% of them.

933
01:39:25,311 --> 01:39:35,021
So this was the approach and the. The lower bound of the confidence interval would be 30% or more.

934
01:39:36,151 --> 01:39:42,081
And there wasn't even a requirement to show prevention of severe disease.

935
01:39:42,091 --> 01:39:54,991
This is what FDA recommended to our committee as the standard for issuing a need for an EU also and.

936
01:39:57,171 --> 01:40:03,981
The important part of this is the safety would be two months or more of follow.

937
01:40:07,331 --> 01:40:12,161
Rather than a year or two years or the rest, which is usually the case.

938
01:40:13,231 --> 01:40:19,591
For follow up. And this was what we were asked to look at.

939
01:40:20,551 --> 01:40:23,221
And there will be continued evaluation,

940
01:40:23,221 --> 01:40:31,051
obviously when you got a larger population because there was recognition that even with six months or 12 months follow up,

941
01:40:31,591 --> 01:40:40,111
if you didn't have widespread use of the vaccine, you wouldn't detect the infrequent side effects.

942
01:40:40,801 --> 01:40:45,121
So the verb pack discussion was broad agreement.

943
01:40:47,881 --> 01:40:51,431
And there were concerns. About.

944
01:40:52,451 --> 01:40:58,990
And when you bring 20 people together, many of whom do not have public health experience,

945
01:40:58,991 --> 01:41:07,331
you get a lot of different opinions, especially immunologists and other people who don't have the public health experience.

946
01:41:07,841 --> 01:41:11,381
And two months was there was a problem.

947
01:41:13,481 --> 01:41:24,611
And this PowerPoint was also shown and this was really I did understand it at the time was a slap at the.

948
01:41:26,371 --> 01:41:33,690
And people downtown, as they would say in Washington, who wanted to get things licensed immediately, immediately.

949
01:41:33,691 --> 01:41:40,471
Remember, this is October. Something was going to happen in early November at the time.

950
01:41:41,371 --> 01:41:50,281
And this is the what FDA is saying, that if we lie if we had emergency use authorization of a weekly.

951
01:41:52,451 --> 01:41:58,901
Effective vaccine. We would set everything back. So at the end of the meeting,

952
01:41:59,981 --> 01:42:10,501
I was asked to summarize and I felt very comfortable in summarizing when there was a good deal of division and we didn't even a vote.

953
01:42:10,531 --> 01:42:19,781
This was a discussion. And I didn't realize why I was asked to please raise your hand to say that you agreed.

954
01:42:20,911 --> 01:42:25,711
And this. So I was learning on the job about what was required.

955
01:42:25,981 --> 01:42:34,231
Things became simpler, actually, because when we got through this crisis from December, the change and our move very quickly changed in strength.

956
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:37,621
And so we have enough time for general discussion.

957
01:42:37,621 --> 01:42:41,231
And this is the December 10th meeting, and this was the Pfizer meeting.

958
01:42:41,251 --> 01:42:46,201
Now, we were we're we're dealing with specifics.

959
01:42:47,011 --> 01:42:50,401
And this is where this is the way you can watch it.

960
01:42:50,791 --> 01:42:55,981
Watch all the proceedings which I chaired from my dining room, living room.

961
01:42:56,221 --> 01:42:59,611
It's not too far away from here.

962
01:43:00,331 --> 01:43:06,181
And this was the agenda, which is a standard with the topic of the meeting.

963
01:43:06,841 --> 01:43:17,331
And there was a very kind of a rigid structure with an open public discussion and all the rest, all done openly.

964
01:43:17,941 --> 01:43:26,461
And that was a key thing, very different from what goes on in some other countries where where some of these things are done rather quietly.

965
01:43:27,181 --> 01:43:32,411
And the big news was enormous efficacy against.

966
01:43:34,321 --> 01:43:38,791
Against infection. Asymptomatic infection.

967
01:43:40,021 --> 01:43:48,001
Not to good efficacy? No. No data on efficacy or just a hint of efficacy against severe disease.

968
01:43:48,301 --> 01:43:54,151
And we had a vote, which was 17 to 4 with two stage.

969
01:43:55,091 --> 01:43:59,141
Why did people vote no or abstained?

970
01:44:00,011 --> 01:44:05,801
Two reasons. The pediatricians didn't like the fact we were going down to 16 rather than 18,

971
01:44:05,801 --> 01:44:17,530
even though we pointed out that there were not too many numbers in that group, but certainly more numbers ones than we had in the 18 to 20 year olds.

972
01:44:17,531 --> 01:44:21,201
And that was okay because of this artificial cut.

973
01:44:21,491 --> 01:44:24,911
And also, some people felt uncomfortable with the two months.

974
01:44:27,211 --> 01:44:31,560
Two months say so. People voted no for those reasons.

975
01:44:31,561 --> 01:44:36,421
And then as I go through this is quickly out.

976
01:44:36,421 --> 01:44:42,361
I'll point out how voted how the votes don't really mean very much in terms of the day.

977
01:44:42,931 --> 01:44:47,461
And next week we had the maddern virus and here was a.

978
01:44:48,001 --> 01:44:51,691
It's always good when you have two different vaccines and everything looks alike.

979
01:44:52,831 --> 01:45:08,911
And this was this was the the plot for the cumulative event rates for against a symptomatic laboratory confirmed symptomatic disease.

980
01:45:09,901 --> 01:45:19,061
And in addition, we had data as small numbers, but still statistically significant for prevention of severe infections.

981
01:45:19,171 --> 01:45:22,381
This really puts the icing on the cake.

982
01:45:22,981 --> 01:45:33,331
And we convinced everybody in the one person to vote yes for this because we'd already started rolling out the Pfizer vaccine.

983
01:45:34,351 --> 01:45:37,961
This person still had the tumor problems.

984
01:45:38,521 --> 01:45:48,331
He wanted more data on safety. And then a few weeks, a couple of months later, came our only vector, the vaccine.

985
01:45:49,431 --> 01:45:59,241
And it was sold as single dose, even though everybody knew that if they gave if you gave a second dose, you get more protection.

986
01:46:00,111 --> 01:46:05,541
And here was the vaccine of efficacy with a single dose of 66%.

987
01:46:06,011 --> 01:46:10,641
We are already seeing variants at this point. And.

988
01:46:14,101 --> 01:46:17,221
But this was above the 50%.

989
01:46:18,181 --> 01:46:25,231
Guideline that we had is that if they had established so there is no way not to vaccinate but not to approve this vaccine,

990
01:46:25,471 --> 01:46:28,531
even though we had great hesitations.

991
01:46:29,221 --> 01:46:40,471
And what was interesting, it was a unanimous vote. And this is much more problematic than some of the other questions that had arisen earlier.

992
01:46:41,661 --> 01:46:48,921
So this is just a summary of everything that happened and what I would as the first phase.

993
01:46:50,611 --> 01:46:56,281
And then over the summer, FDA approved the COVID vaccines.

994
01:46:56,281 --> 01:47:00,241
And this was this. This was this was the licensure.

995
01:47:01,061 --> 01:47:07,301
And we didn't meet. And some people complained that we had an event because we're advisory, we don't have to meet,

996
01:47:08,051 --> 01:47:16,611
but there's nothing but manufacturing protocols and side to side variation and all the rest that FDA does.

997
01:47:16,641 --> 01:47:23,381
So that was the reason I had no problems with not having to chair an eight hour meeting.

998
01:47:24,531 --> 01:47:31,510
Uh, and then, but, and this is the thing to watch.

999
01:47:31,511 --> 01:47:35,831
You're not going to see meetings of the verb pack for everything that needs to be done.

1000
01:47:36,701 --> 01:47:41,891
So phase two come along. Pediatric studies and boosters.

1001
01:47:42,671 --> 01:47:53,691
And I'll just show. Uh, the, uh, the, the, the booster and this was the meeting.

1002
01:47:53,691 --> 01:47:57,831
The boosters just said we needed to set the.

1003
01:47:58,891 --> 01:48:09,991
Guidance for the booster vaccines. And again, this is a the headlines were where FDA panel turns down.

1004
01:48:11,931 --> 01:48:20,421
Application for boosters. And the reason we turned it down was we didn't think it was necessary down to 16 months.

1005
01:48:21,691 --> 01:48:27,321
16 years of age. And then you see here we had a unanimous vote that followed.

1006
01:48:28,251 --> 01:48:41,001
So a lot of it. And you should realize that an open meeting where you may have open back discussion is very difficult when it's virtual.

1007
01:48:42,751 --> 01:48:50,341
You really don't have the ability for me to talk to your leadership about what they find acceptable or not.

1008
01:48:50,551 --> 01:48:59,010
But with newspaper headlines here were that that that that had been turned down by the committee but they

1009
01:48:59,011 --> 01:49:06,991
didn't pay attention to is that it was unanimous when we restricted to 6565 years of age and older.

1010
01:49:07,411 --> 01:49:17,481
And and this is the business that's that in ordinary situations, the AC, AC, you should be carrying notes.

1011
01:49:18,271 --> 01:49:24,091
Okay. This is the most recent group of recommendations.

1012
01:49:24,241 --> 01:49:27,601
And as you can see, was a very busy month.

1013
01:49:28,201 --> 01:49:38,521
We had four days of meetings, first approving the NOVAVAX, then recommending.

1014
01:49:40,761 --> 01:49:49,101
Going down to six months of age. I think we may be just about the only country that has a vaccine prove to six months of age.

1015
01:49:50,491 --> 01:49:53,191
And on the 28th, most recently,

1016
01:49:53,761 --> 01:50:07,291
the discussion of boosters and containing Omicron and the vote here was simply that there be an olecranon included in the backswing.

1017
01:50:07,531 --> 01:50:19,170
And we gave that and we gave FDA an open, open, free hand to do bivalent, which was the consensus from the committee.

1018
01:50:19,171 --> 01:50:30,931
We had a discussion, and also the consensus was that we treated it for being for five and the rest of the world is going would be a one,

1019
01:50:31,111 --> 01:50:34,681
which was the W.H.O. recommendation.

1020
01:50:34,951 --> 01:50:41,461
And so they're long stories about that one, which we don't have time to get into now.

1021
01:50:41,461 --> 01:50:47,301
Where do we go in the future? And being a flute guy.

1022
01:50:49,611 --> 01:50:54,001
I went last year, about a year ago.

1023
01:50:54,021 --> 01:51:02,091
I put together perspective for the New England Journal, which says this is getting to look a lot like flute guys.

1024
01:51:02,991 --> 01:51:11,331
And the press didn't pay very much attention to this and they were like, there's a lot of dissension about it.

1025
01:51:11,901 --> 01:51:15,981
Well, if we have three, we should really be able to have long term protection.

1026
01:51:16,641 --> 01:51:21,441
So I said we'd be looking at a year.

1027
01:51:21,711 --> 01:51:27,711
There is a possibility we'll be looking at a yearly booster and here we are.

1028
01:51:28,101 --> 01:51:32,681
So looking forward. Effectiveness. Determination will roll out.

1029
01:51:32,831 --> 01:51:36,201
Bivalent Omicron contains vaccines we need.

1030
01:51:36,801 --> 01:51:47,570
There's a lot of noise in the press about not having specific human studies with av5 containing vaccine.

1031
01:51:47,571 --> 01:51:51,681
We have b A1 and there's very little difference.

1032
01:51:53,661 --> 01:51:57,411
Jonathan knew the UK would be a one.

1033
01:51:57,951 --> 01:52:08,501
So the it's it's, it's been extrapolated and has the we need more mix, mix and match studies because this is one of the things that we do better.

1034
01:52:08,511 --> 01:52:11,741
Do we have longer duration for a mix and match?

1035
01:52:12,561 --> 01:52:19,431
Starting the September 19 through adding this to the mix and match the bivalent with the right.

1036
01:52:20,731 --> 01:52:25,081
And more analysis of data from vaccines not approved in the US.

1037
01:52:25,111 --> 01:52:33,871
We heard last week from Ben Cowling, who presented some data about the fact that some of the hold inactivated vaccines

1038
01:52:34,381 --> 01:52:40,890
are behaving better after boosters than the rest that one would expect.

1039
01:52:40,891 --> 01:52:44,281
And we have very little, very, very little data.

1040
01:52:44,491 --> 01:52:53,731
And one of the problems is it's going to journals and not not meeting the requirements of the analysis for publication.

1041
01:52:54,001 --> 01:53:01,441
It isn't that the analysis has not been done, that analysis have been done, but they've not been done to the same standard.

1042
01:53:02,601 --> 01:53:07,121
As are Russian ones for the vaccines that we're using in the developed world.

1043
01:53:07,131 --> 01:53:10,791
And that's something new and viral prophylaxis and therapy.

1044
01:53:12,171 --> 01:53:21,621
We need better data. We need better real world data about how well things like xolo slow that are working.

1045
01:53:22,491 --> 01:53:26,601
That's in the headlines when Tony Fauci takes it and has a rebound.

1046
01:53:27,351 --> 01:53:33,381
And not to forget flus there and that mix are still there.

1047
01:53:34,311 --> 01:53:42,051
And just as a final, we didn't have we simply don't understand.

1048
01:53:43,401 --> 01:53:50,101
What has happened with Flint going away. During the pandemic.

1049
01:53:51,091 --> 01:53:55,951
And just about the only virus that we are seeing.

1050
01:53:57,451 --> 01:54:05,071
I can't resist not bringing in my favorite population based study.

1051
01:54:07,011 --> 01:54:17,621
And one of the things that happened is that one of the first viruses besides rhinoviruses which are coming back for season term democracies,

1052
01:54:18,031 --> 01:54:25,791
why should these mitigation strategies be working against SARS-CoV-2 and not against the seasonal flu for long?

1053
01:54:27,041 --> 01:54:35,491
So that's a. View of pandemics of the last 20 years or so.

1054
01:54:36,751 --> 01:54:40,831
And let's hope we have a little rest before the next.

1055
01:54:41,911 --> 01:54:42,421
Thank you.

1056
01:54:50,541 --> 01:55:01,731
So now I think I'll have the yes speakers kind of swing around at the end of the table for the microphone just to promote health issues again.

1057
01:55:03,411 --> 01:55:11,001
Sir Jonathan, you can answer questions or you can ask questions, if I could.

1058
01:55:25,741 --> 01:55:28,841
All right. All right.

1059
01:55:28,981 --> 01:55:37,461
So I'm going to ask a first question to get us started. I got questions I can do the whole time, but hopefully other people step in.

1060
01:55:37,731 --> 01:55:48,560
So one of the things that struck me about your Talk Express is you're talking about the typhoid vaccine and availability is, you know,

1061
01:55:48,561 --> 01:55:51,921
despite the best of the best vaccine,

1062
01:55:51,921 --> 01:55:59,301
we might think if nobody is going to resource it and policy makers are going to be behind it and it doesn't get deployed.

1063
01:56:00,021 --> 01:56:02,651
How do you see the role of vaccine cities?

1064
01:56:02,821 --> 01:56:12,581
Is the big question evolving for all three of you as our politics evolve and polarization of our political stakeholders evolve?

1065
01:56:12,621 --> 01:56:21,561
Do we have to think differently about how we set up our studies and our trials that we can try?

1066
01:56:28,441 --> 01:56:32,151
Yeah, it's a good question. And I have to say, you know,

1067
01:56:32,161 --> 01:56:43,740
I like the world where where we didn't have all these politics and in vaccines and there was such a world just to make that point.

1068
01:56:43,741 --> 01:56:55,341
And it wasn't that long ago where, you know, we had both sides of the political spectrum who would come together for public health purposes.

1069
01:56:55,351 --> 01:56:55,590
I mean,

1070
01:56:55,591 --> 01:57:03,446
you're always going to have you're always going to have a small percentage of people that you can't convince right now how much effort you put.
