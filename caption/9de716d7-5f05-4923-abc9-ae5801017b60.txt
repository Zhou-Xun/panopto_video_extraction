00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,270
Welcome to 634 as module on modeling delay processes in this module.

2
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:21,290
I will describe how to model delay processes to using ordinary differential equations.

3
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:27,360
The learning objectives others module are to one identify delay process to to define it distributed

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:36,220
delay process and three to compare and contrast an exponential and gamma distributed delay process.

5
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:44,050
What our delay processes, they are processes that model the time it takes to move from one state to another.

6
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:50,830
So, for example, once exposed to a pathogen, an individual is not infectious or symptomatic immediately.

7
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:56,570
It takes time for the pathogen to multiply and become established in a person's body.

8
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,210
So the incubation period is a delay process that reflects the time between exposure when

9
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:07,690
the individual exhibits symptoms that the latency period is another delay process,

10
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:14,170
capturing the delay between the time of exposure and the time when an individual is infectious.

11
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,920
Distinguishing these two processes are important for some pathogens.

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,960
People are infectious prior to exhibiting symptoms. For other pathogens, people are infectious.

13
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:33,180
At the same time, they exhibited symptoms. Other delay processes are symptomatic, period, and the period someone is immune.

14
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:41,370
Here is a plot of the distribution of incubation periods and a population for a specific pathogen.

15
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:52,470
Notice how variable the incubation period is. It ranges from one to seven days, but most people seem to exhibit symptoms in a day or two.

16
00:01:52,470 --> 00:02:00,590
This and many distributions for incubation or latency fit well to a gamma distribution.

17
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:06,530
What about infection? Is that a delay process? The answer is no.

18
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,190
This is because someone can remain susceptible forever and never become exposed.

19
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:20,180
Infections depend on whether or not the Incap is susceptible. Encounter's and infective contact.

20
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:29,780
As mentioned earlier in the SBIR module, there are many ways to model a delay product delay processes,

21
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,690
we can use one or more ordinary differential equation compartments laid out in a series.

22
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:44,690
So a person must enter and exit each compartment sequentially. Since that person resides in a state or a compartment for a period of time,

23
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:50,240
having one or more ordinary differential equation compartments results in a delay process.

24
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:58,310
Turns out that using one Odei or differential equation represents an exponential distributed delay process.

25
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:06,080
Using two or more bodies' or differential equations represents a gamma distributed delay process.

26
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,530
These delay processes have two parameters and the number of compartments and k.

27
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,080
The rate of leaving a compartment.

28
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:25,070
These two parameters define the mean delay time and the variance in over K is to mean delay time and and over K squared.

29
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:37,120
Is the variance of that mean time. Using partial differential equations is another approach and a more rigorous approach to modeling delays.

30
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,520
You will find people using PD, PDX to model delays in literature.

31
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:49,660
But this approach is complex and beyond the scope of this class. And also these models are often intractable.

32
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:55,750
Finally, there is the pure delay modeling approach as illustrated in the model equation.

33
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:03,930
Here we assume that everyone takes on the same delay to how these models are also often intractable.

34
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:13,630
But Matlab does have an easy way to code these pure delays. The Odey approach, often called a distributed delay,

35
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:20,860
turns out to be the most biologically plausible it is as it accounts for the fact that not everyone has the same delay.

36
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:27,130
So in this class, we will be focusing on the Odey options.

37
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:36,580
So let's look more closely at the only option. This diagram shows a generic model for distributed delay process.

38
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:44,110
An individual enters X one and exit at a rate or at a rate K.

39
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:50,790
This means that the average time spent in X one is one overcame.

40
00:04:50,790 --> 00:05:01,630
The individual moves through each successive compartment with the same rate K after leaving compartment X and the individual leaves the process.

41
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:11,180
Again, each compartment represents a differential equation and the rate leaving that compartment is governed by an exponential process.

42
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:21,410
It turns out that if you analyze this model, the overall mean delay for the entire process is and overcame the variance is an over case squared.

43
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,300
These equations turn out to model a gamma process in statistics.

44
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:37,650
You may have learned that a series of X mental processes like shown in this diagram is mathematically equivalent to a gamma distribution.

45
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:45,930
So let's look at an example. Let's say we want to model a delay of 10 days using four compartments.

46
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:52,400
Therefore, the mean delay equals 10 days, which is an over.

47
00:05:52,400 --> 00:06:05,140
And K, therefore, must be point for. The variance, therefore, is an over K squared or twenty five.

48
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:12,790
Here is the plot of the delay of this delay process. The proportion moving through the process four different times.

49
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:20,680
I would like to point out three features here. First, the probability of moving through the process in zero days is zero.

50
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,980
Second, the mode of the distribution is less than 10 days. Approximately seven point five, eight days.

51
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:32,380
And third, then people take more than twenty five days to move through the process.

52
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:39,130
There's only a very small percentage of people that take more than one twenty five days.

53
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:47,160
What if we wanted to model delay process with a smaller spread? The only way to do this is to increase the number of compartments.

54
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:55,200
Let's say we want the variance to be one rather than twenty five to keep our mean delay at 10 days.

55
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:03,630
Turns out we need 100 compartments. And this and their.

56
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:15,680
And here is the plot. Now the mode is closer to 10 days and almost no one has a delay of 13 days due to the decrease in spread.

57
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,410
In general, as we increase the number of compartments, we get closer and closer to a pure delay.

58
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:31,930
That is, everyone has the same delay. Let's look at another example where we want to model a delay of 10 days, but only want to see.

59
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:40,290
Well, we want to use one compartment. This means that Kay is equal to point one and the variance is much larger.

60
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:46,080
It's equal to 100. And here's the plot of the delayed distribution.

61
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:56,170
The main feature of this plot to note is that there is a non-zero probability that people will move through the process instantaneously with no delay.

62
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:04,720
This is the property of an exponential process. And the reason why when we model delays, where no one moves through the delay process instantaneously.

63
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:16,320
We need to include more than one compartment. In this last slide, let's look at the equations for the digits attributed to lay process,

64
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:28,020
the first equation describes the dynamics four x one people enter in at a rate I leave at the rate K times X, Y for all other compartments.

65
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,730
There are two terms the rate of entering and the rate of leaving.

66
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:40,340
The solution of this series of Odie's is the following.

67
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:47,940
We can see for N equals one, this equation simplifies to an exponential form our offense, exponential function.

68
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,110
And in general and for General N.

69
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:59,810
This turns out to be a gamma distribute gamma function where the solution always has a T term multiplying the exponential function.

70
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:05,100
Therefore, the probability of a zero delay is zero.

71
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:12,580
These distributed delay models are used extensively in the literature to model latency and disease duration.

72
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:19,570
And in this lab, we will use this delay process to model the fate and transport of pathogens in the environment.

73
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,800
For example, we can use a distributed delay.

74
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:31,670
Just to model, pathogen's being shed into a river and then moving down river the transport while continuously dying.

75
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,970
The fate.
