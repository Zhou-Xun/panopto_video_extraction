1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:07,740
Okay. So good to see everyone and welcome to the first presentations of 2023.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,630
And today we actually have two presenters, we have Trent and we have more than 25 incenting first.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,130
So thank you for doing that. And with that, we'll get started.

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:27,960
At the end of the presentation, I could think about asking questions, feel free, raise your hand and know that I will.

5
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:36,660
The presenters will get on to or have direct questions and I anticipate we will have about 20, 25 minutes for presentation.

6
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,530
We've got 5 to 10 minutes for the actual questions.

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,050
Okay. So this is a real advocacy set.

8
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:59,489
So you're talking about stress levels? Alex I would definitely say my stress levels are about like where do my 85, but we'll survive.

9
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,510
We just have to make it through what, like the next 25 minutes or something like that. All right.

10
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,549
So my name's Trevor Hannon. Does not know me.

11
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:16,800
I am a second year student here at the School of Public Health, and I do my undergrad at Utah State University in biochemistry and human biology.

12
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,100
The last year, I've been working in the Krisp lab with Michigan Medicine.

13
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,220
The Crisp is the Center for Research and Innovations in Special Populations.

14
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,750
And this is going to be a little bit of the research that I did in this last year.

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,049
So the title of my presentation, as you can see, is a really big mouthful.

16
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,379
It's called Functional Dependance as a contributing factor for patient home contamination

17
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,220
and multidrug resistant bi multi-drug resistant organisms in acute care settings.

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,270
We're going to talk about what that means because there's a lot of words right there. So first of all, what's functional dependance?

19
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,219
Functional dependance is the ability of a person to perform activities of daily living by themselves.

20
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,060
So if they're able to bathe themselves, dress themselves, feed themselves,

21
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,500
we would say that a person person is dependent if they're unable to do one of these things by themselves.

22
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,550
For instance, if they're not able to feed themselves, we'd say they have a functional dependency in feeding.

23
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,940
So this is assessed using the scale called the cat's HDL scale.

24
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,070
Basically, it's a yes or no binary variable whether or not this person can do this thing or not.

25
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,500
Cats ADL is one of the best established goes. There are several scopes to measure this,

26
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,230
but it's one of the best established ones for clinical research because of its simplicity and consistency in evaluations.

27
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,930
So the next thing in the title was Hanging Contamination by multi-drug resistant organisms.

28
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,280
Let's start with Imperial's first bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.

29
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,570
We're going to be focused on three main groups in this presentation methicillin resistant staph aureus,

30
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:42,180
MRSA, vancomycin resistant enterococci, or very and then resistant gram negative bacteria.

31
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,480
And the resistance is there to antibiotic ciprofloxacin and set tags that a mean.

32
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,840
So this is what we're going to meet the organisms we're going to be focusing on here.

33
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,840
But let's talk about how contamination, too, because there's a there's an important differentiation between contamination and colonization.

34
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,190
Colonization is when there's organisms, for instance, with the hands they're growing on your hands.

35
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,799
So you have a staph infection on your hands. It's going to be growing.

36
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,350
They're propagating there and it's going to be living there, whereas contamination means that the organism is just present on the hands.

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,820
And so in this study, because we're just looking at a single point in time, we're looking at contamination,

38
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,640
it could be that these patients are colonized, but because we're just looking at one point in time, we're looking at contamination here.

39
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,680
And then the last thing, the acute care settings, that's probably the easiest one to define is a hospital.

40
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,889
A lot of the work in this field has been done in long term care facilities.

41
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,290
So we're looking to close the research gap and look at acute care settings as well as hospitals.

42
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,229
So the question I had is,

43
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,810
do patients with higher levels of functional dependance have a higher burden of having contamination by multi-drug resistant organisms?

44
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,549
I hypothesize that functional dependance is associated with contamination by multi-drug

45
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,150
resistant organisms in acute care settings as it is in long term care facilities.

46
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:58,320
I probably should have mentioned that before, but it has been found that in long term care facilities like nursing homes or assisted living centers,

47
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,100
that functional dependance is associated with that contamination by drug resistant organisms.

48
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,200
But why is this important? We've known for a very long time since, like the 1800s, that hand hygiene is super important for human health.

49
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,340
If we go back to Semmelweis and his experiments and. And interventions with.

50
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,770
With. Pregnant mothers and.

51
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:25,139
And if we look at the research that's been done, we noticed that there's a lot of research around health care workers,

52
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,320
but there's very little research about patient hand hygiene and fact.

53
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,209
A lot of the work that's been done has been done in the last decade or so. But the results are promising.

54
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,110
Studies are finding that that patient hand hygiene initiatives can also play an important role.

55
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,000
And in infection prevention, more than just a health care worker hands.

56
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,510
So if we're able to identify targeted approaches for patient hand hygiene,

57
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,750
then hopefully we can decrease the burden of disease in health care facilities.

58
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:54,450
So we just have to decide what we want to target those approaches for. And this is this is where this comes into play, right?

59
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:02,790
Like, if we're able to identify certain functional dependencies or levels of functional dependencies that have higher levels of of contamination,

60
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:09,210
then we can put interventions in place to hopefully decrease those and improve health outcomes in hospitals.

61
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:16,500
So what I did was a the case control study, I used a dataset called the Patient and Hygiene Initiative Dataset.

62
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,780
This was a dataset collected by the Chris lab that I've been working with back in 2017.

63
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,409
Um, is surrounds two hospitals in Southeast Michigan.

64
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,690
There were 399 patients enrolled and the main outcome of this study they were looking for back in 2017 as whether or

65
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:36,479
not there was an association between or didn't stand on a patient's hands and orgasms found in the patients rooms.

66
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,660
And they did find there's a correlation between those things. And so.

67
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,559
My study is not surrounding this, but I just wanted to make that clear that while there's there's other research that's been

68
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,730
done with this dataset and this dataset wasn't necessarily created for this purpose,

69
00:05:51,180 --> 00:06:00,600
but we can still answer this question with it. So first of all, microbiology, you guys did a little bit of that with Alex last semester.

70
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,690
Super fun. I did a lot of microbiome.

71
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,479
And so obviously this study was done in 2017.

72
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,459
So I didn't do the exact microbiology for these, but this was but in the lab we do these the exact same thing.

73
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,790
We've been doing the same thing for four years and the same with the VA study.

74
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:23,100
So I can talk about it a little bit, kind of explain how we know which multi-drug resistant organisms are on the patient's hands.

75
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:30,210
So first of all, we when researchers went into hospital, into the hospital and they swabbed patient hands, um, groin,

76
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:36,990
different environmental sites in the hospital and they took the samples to the lab where they were incubated in the broth.

77
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,940
And then these, these samples were plated onto three different type of selective and differential plates,

78
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,640
metatarsal agar to hopefully identify staph species like agar to identify gram

79
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,530
negatives and then bile ESCO and agar infused vancomycin to identify the areas.

80
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:58,590
And then these plates are incubated overnight and this is what they were kind of kind of look like.

81
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:05,460
Let's see if I can grab the laser pointer. So up at the top here, we have an MSA plate and that's before it's been incubated.

82
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,930
And this is kind of what it's supposed to look like if you have a staff growth on it.

83
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:15,010
So if we found a plate that had yellow grass on it that we were pulled aside and we would set it, and similarly for these other organisms.

84
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,110
So this is McConkey Plate. This is what a gram negative sometimes looks like.

85
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,040
They can look like many different things. This is like it is probably a Klebsiella. They're really gross.

86
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,270
They're, you know, when you open the incubator and you just, like,

87
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,740
get hit by a wave of smells, like, you know, there's some ground now that's growing in there.

88
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,150
And then here at the bottom, this is what it very will look like on a violin school.

89
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,020
And so if we saw. GROSS That looks similar to these on these plates,

90
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,130
then we would pull them aside to test them to see if they're multi-drug resistant organisms that we were looking for.

91
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:49,540
Certainly didn't really that. All right.

92
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:56,920
So once we identified that these might be drug resistant arguments that we're looking for, we would do additional tests on them.

93
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,270
So for the yellow growths that we saw in the in the MSI plates, we had,

94
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:06,960
we had set those and we would grow them on Gladiator and then use a catalyst and coagulate taste test,

95
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:15,549
fabulous test to see if they were safe aureus and if they were staph aureus, then we would do resistance tests.

96
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:22,450
And that's there's an example of that right here. The closer the bacteria is growing to the disk and the more resistant is to the antibiotic.

97
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,830
So if it found that if we found Mersa using those techniques, we would set it aside and say, okay, we're going to put this into the study.

98
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:36,220
Something similar with the McConkey plates. We would identify what species it was is in an API kit, which is what this is right here.

99
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:42,160
You can tell what species it is by what, um, what reagents it reacts with overnight.

100
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,150
And then we would do something similar to by less going plates, identify the areas.

101
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,460
So that's how we would find these, these microorganisms that were antibiotic resistant.

102
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,820
So then we have the data, right? So I did a case control study design.

103
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:04,739
Um. So my cases were patients who when they went into the hospital on the first day of admission that they had their hand

104
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:11,520
swabbed and if their hand swab came back positive for any and zero some of the area and are resistant gram negative,

105
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,809
they would be considered a case in the study. And then the controls were everyone else.

106
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,450
So patients with the negative hand culture at admission.

107
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,860
Then for the exposure, we stratified that into three different levels based on functional dependencies.

108
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:29,920
So a person that was independent, which is also our reference group, we we said they have zero dependencies,

109
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,800
they're able to bathe, dress oil and transfer continence content and feed by themselves.

110
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:43,210
Um, if they had 1 to 3 in total dependency, so maybe they had struggle with bathing and feeding, they would say they were partially dependent.

111
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,560
And then if they had more than four dependencies, we would consider them to be a dependent patient.

112
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,930
And here's just kind of a flowchart kind of dividing that up are 399 patients

113
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,580
and the 40 cases and 359 controls and then the different levels of dependance.

114
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,480
Statistical analysis. Because we're doing a case control study, we're looking for odds ratios.

115
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,090
And one of the best ways to find odds ratios is with logistic regression.

116
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,330
First, you have to determine which covariates a new one included in the model.

117
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,469
So we did forward stepwise regression to find that and we did logistic regression

118
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,160
to find those relationships and contamination and level of functional dependance.

119
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,130
And all of that was done in SAS. So what we found.

120
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,510
So if you look at these this table, there's just a lot a lot here.

121
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,419
Just note that these are. So this is the number of of organisms in that category.

122
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,080
And then this here is the percent. And the percents are what are kind of really important in this table.

123
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:42,090
So we're comparing both of these groups are partially dependent and dependent to the independent group.

124
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:47,310
And you notice that these percentages for partially dependent to independent are they're approximately the same.

125
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:53,120
They're in the same ballpark. But if you look at the dependent to the independent groups, you'll notice that these percentages are quite different.

126
00:10:53,130 --> 00:11:01,080
So 19.6% of patients had contamination by any MDR and the dependent category compared to only 8.7% in the independent category.

127
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,630
And you'll see a similar trend going down. Um.

128
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:14,820
So then with that information, we. We took a look at the covariance and see what we should include into our model.

129
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:23,820
Um, and we, first of all, we had to determine the how each Koby was associated with our ah, outcomes and contamination.

130
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:29,700
And so covariance of p of less than 0.15 were included into our model or included

131
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,640
into our stepwise model to see if there should be input into our final model.

132
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:38,880
And so those are those covariance where sex, antibiotic use, history of embryos, hospital source and comorbidities.

133
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:45,659
And then we put it in stepwise regression. We found that history of empty arrows and this is in the last 90 days the hospital source because

134
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,040
remember there are two hospitals so hospital RB and then sex should be included in the model.

135
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,550
And then for consistency purposes, we also included race and age into this model.

136
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,770
And so these are the results of the models we had, the odds ratios and the 95% confidence intervals,

137
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,500
the ones with little stars next to them are significant.

138
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,080
So the dependent versus independent group for Mersa and independent versus independent for all India shows,

139
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:16,110
you know, that's significant if one is excluded from the from the odds ratio, from the confidence interval.

140
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,710
But you'll notice that all of them, except for a couple of gram negatives, um, they all trend upwards, right?

141
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:31,560
So as far as patients are, um, with more functional dependencies, they're more likely to have had contamination.

142
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,530
And you can kind of see this here as well. So this is a forest plot.

143
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:41,670
We have little marks down here, the odds ratios, and then you have the confidence intervals either side.

144
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:47,310
And you'll notice that the to the right of one is going to be increased odds.

145
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:57,800
And you'll notice that the majority of these are. They're more likely to have had contamination because with more functional dependencies.

146
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,240
I also did a quick analysis comparing each dependency to not having a dependency at all,

147
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:14,250
and we found that if a person has a feeding dependency, then that they're most likely to have additional hand contamination.

148
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,190
Also, what's interesting with this red trend line, it's actually not a trend line, although it kind of looks like one.

149
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:25,590
But this is actually how many additional dependencies a person has. So, for instance, with continence, it looks like it's about four.

150
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:31,260
So if a person on the continent dependency, they're on average had about four additional dependencies on top of that.

151
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,629
And you'll notice how as the odds increase, so does the number of additional dependency,

152
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:43,500
suggesting that as the number of dependencies increases, so does the odds of contamination and errors.

153
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,300
So let's dive a little bit into the discussion limitations really fast. But first we'll do a quick summary.

154
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,520
So the odds of patient harm contamination by any multi-drug resistant organism and then

155
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,330
by Mersa are significantly higher for dependent patients than for independent patients.

156
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:02,220
And then very trended towards the positive association with the resistant gram negative is trending towards negative,

157
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,840
but neither of those were actually significant.

158
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,840
And then patients with feeling dependencies had the highest odds of contamination, and they also had the highest number of additional dependencies.

159
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,630
So talking about those those independents isn't all that I found this super interesting.

160
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:24,210
So in 2013, I'm a researcher named Gerard categorized a hierarchy of of ADLs or activities of daily living.

161
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:31,680
And he, he, he went like, so the most difficult ideals to complete by yourself compared the easiest ones.

162
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,890
So he came up with a list and bathing. Bathing was the hardest thing for a patient to do by themselves while feeding.

163
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:43,770
It would be the easiest thing for a patient to do by themselves. And if you look at the order that he has here and then order down here at the bottom,

164
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,870
you'll notice they're not exactly the same, but they're very similar,

165
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:51,479
suggesting that dependency in hierarchically easier tasks or easier ADLs suggest higher

166
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,120
odds of hand contamination and thus a need for intervention with those easier tasks.

167
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,460
Or when you can identify that a patient has an idea on an easier task.

168
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:07,100
So what are the implications of this association? So just remember, this is assessed on the day of admission to the hospital.

169
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,940
So this could be, for instance, like if the nurse does the triage and notices,

170
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:16,370
for instance, that they have X, Y, Z dependency or so many number of else.

171
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,290
So this allows us to identify patients that are at higher risk for which hand hygiene,

172
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,710
important interventions could be implemented and and help these patients.

173
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:32,270
Interventions could prevent both disease and the patient, and then they could prevent both disease in the patient and spreading around the

174
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,770
facility and hopefully improving the health care outcomes in that facility.

175
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:44,330
We just have a couple of limitations, though. Another thing that I wanted to do in this study was determine the risk of acquiring and then the error.

176
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:50,330
However, in this dataset, we only had 13 patients that acquired in MDR during the course of their stay in the hospital.

177
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,330
And when I use that data, it just wasn't quite enough and all the results are super insignificant.

178
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,840
So there's a limitation right there. Other limitations, going back to the small sample size.

179
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,050
If you notice, the confidence intervals were super wide.

180
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,960
Um, love to have those to be a little bit more narrow, but you do need more patients to do that.

181
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:12,680
So we also can't determine term and causality just association because this is a case control study, not a cohort study.

182
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,370
And then we are limited to just the organisms that were tested for at the time.

183
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,150
So other important organisms such as were excluded from the study.

184
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,690
It would be interesting to see what those effects are as well.

185
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,480
So moving forward, there's a couple of things that can be done that I'd love to do.

186
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:37,190
You can further assess the strength of the trend with larger datasets to perform cohort studies to determine causality and risk of acquisition.

187
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,890
We could explore how functional dependance and hand contamination by other organisms like citizen related.

188
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,120
And then we could create targeted interventions for patients with functional dependencies and assess their

189
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,000
effectiveness to see if this research that we're doing actually can help instead of just in observation.

190
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,380
Oh, yeah. There we go. Just a couple quick acknowledgments. I want to thank everyone that helped me with this.

191
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:06,350
Specifically, the Chris Group. I'm Dr. Modi, the PI, and then the research group, the surrounding Morgan and myself.

192
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:13,370
And this whole journey, the CHIP program and the internship that we had this last summer and then my HIV program and cohort.

193
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:22,040
And that's all I have. Any questions? Questions.

194
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:33,110
Great presentation, by the way. Thank you. I mean, started on my first, but.

195
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:44,690
Okay. Okay. Good luck. So I said on set a really nice warm know on how we got here over the last day.

196
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,150
But. Yeah. Can you have some explanations for why that happens?

197
00:17:52,210 --> 00:18:00,620
Easy to, like, increase. You feel like you're doing things with your hands like that.

198
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:08,499
Like you smell like you're touching your hair, your face with your hands, you know, like other people do.

199
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,450
Like the people are very sweet.

200
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:18,220
Hopefully. Yeah. Yeah.

201
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,110
I'm there. Definitely some some possibility to have a couple ideas.

202
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,600
If you look at Mersa, for instance, Mersa generally colonizes in the nasal cavity.

203
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,580
So if you're just kind of sitting there by yourself, you're breathing out those bacteria,

204
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,680
maybe you're picking your nose, haven't quite knows what's happening.

205
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:40,300
But so so these organisms are very close to you and very is also a gastrointestinal organism.

206
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,210
And so if you're around yourself a lot, then those organisms are going to come into contact with you more.

207
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:51,030
Which is also interesting because if you look at the resistant gram negatives, so very and um,

208
00:18:51,970 --> 00:19:02,260
and Mersa trended towards increased odds of contamination resistant gram negative bacteria actually tend not to grow on the body.

209
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:11,320
They tend to be in the environment more, which actually could be why it appears to be protective in that case with a smaller odds ratio.

210
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,980
That's just a theory. No, I haven't dove deeply into that yet.

211
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:23,920
The questions. So I've got one that is.

212
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:32,110
He talks about contamination versus colonization. Just going to get more confusion due to the colonization versus contamination.

213
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,790
That would definitely be interesting. Yeah. I hadn't thought about that, but yes, that would definitely be a good thing.

214
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:44,530
The reason I focused on contamination here, well, obviously because of the data set, that's what it allowed for, but also with with and contamination.

215
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:51,249
Like we're looking at dirty hands and patient hand hygiene. So a patient that's colonized obviously will have bugs in their hand.

216
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,790
But people, even people that aren't colonized, still have the opportunity to have bugs on their hand.

217
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,639
And we should still be focusing on getting their hands clean as well.

218
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,210
But definitely colonization is something that should definitely be looked into as well.

219
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,280
And that's part copy.

220
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:14,090
I was just thinking of the bacteria and how you've got each patient might have like MRSA and others that these patients might have very well.

221
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:19,399
They're patients that. Yes. Was there any kind of positive or negative association with that?

222
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:25,040
Because you have MHC, we're more likely to have Valley or that's something that I did not look at that I will take.

223
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:31,249
I would that would be pretty. Yes, that would be super interesting. I will look at that just for you to give me a good idea of.

224
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:36,319
And I figured that's even better than those good things that this species.

225
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,160
Right. Yeah. So, yeah. Um, so yeah. That's cool.

226
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,719
I do. Yeah. Want to be totally, like, not relevant.

227
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:53,830
But was there like a possibility for you to look at if this patient had passed on infections, like, are you saying or was it just like that was?

228
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,420
So that was one of the variables we adjusted for where to go.

229
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:03,260
So there's this history of multi-drug resistant where as of last 90 days.

230
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,510
So. Yes. So. Yeah.

231
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:18,580
I'm sorry if I'm not sure. It was like I don't know if you have issues in certain partners or how they work.

232
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:25,700
So if I if I remember the day set correctly and correct me if I'm wrong is, this is, um, general admission to the hospital.

233
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,299
And so the acute care system, the long term care.

234
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:35,170
So these are patients that came in, they stayed for X amount of days, but we're looking specifically at when they came in.

235
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:42,980
That makes sense that this wasn't just an amazing one like we were looking for.

236
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:55,930
I think they came here because the gender issue to that.

237
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,710
But you didn't touch on the term bias?

238
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:15,060
No. Okay. No, she didn't think about it.

239
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:21,950
Emily, how do you handle it? I'm not sure. We talked about this and I'm not sure it's like a compression of the answer.

240
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:29,120
It's more general. I was wondering, based not solely based on the results that you presented it, you were like an infection prevention.

241
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,470
What would your recommendation need to like reduce that issue?

242
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,900
Great. No, definitely.

243
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:47,590
So I feel like my first step would be during the initial phase with like with the nurses identifying these patients and their needs say,

244
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,319
okay, this patient has say five functional dependencies.

245
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,979
So we're going to put an increased effort on making sure that we wash their hands.

246
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,270
We're going to for instance, there's like the five month, five moments and hygiene, right?

247
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:06,229
And so you could say the doctor encouraged the doctor when they go and say, hey, you want to wash your hands before I come in and work with you?

248
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:11,930
And as you're leaving the room saying, hey, you want to wash your hands again, just making sure those five moments of hygiene are are super expressed.

249
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:15,860
I feel like that would be my first effort, probably going to more as well, but that's the first step.

250
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,970
Yeah. Was there any association between every contamination and why it was that you ended up with it?

251
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,309
But that's a great question. Gotcha.

252
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:32,810
Please, could you clarify what the data was?

253
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:39,650
Um, it was February to. April 2017.

254
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:48,630
February to July 2017. We think that, like, this is like all of you know, I think that like, you know.

255
00:23:54,590 --> 00:24:02,700
Right now. Your personal.

256
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,870
Here. I not able.

257
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:17,950
And so she is in the hospital. I'm like 20 years old.

258
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,100
I think there's definitely a possibility. I don't I don't have the data.

259
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:27,060
I think it'd be super interesting to look at it also be interesting to look at,

260
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:34,350
I don't know when we started to become big in Detroit, but the area is actually highly prevalent in Detroit right now in this area.

261
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:39,750
And so those numbers might be going up as well. But I'm not quite sure the date range of when that that started to happen.

262
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:46,550
So that that could play a role as well. Also on hand is a fantastic busy.

263
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,790
Next we have mortgage since.

264
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:08,530
But I think it's not because I think she told us.

265
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:28,330
That's what. That's why there are no icons, no computer screens until you.

266
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:38,710
To do what I did for transporting explosives in there.

267
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:50,510
Okay. What would this be?

268
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,420
Hello, everyone. For everyone who doesn't know me, my name is Morgan Harris.

269
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:02,350
I'm also a second agent and student second year. And I also have the privilege of working with the perspective over the summer so much.

270
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:08,230
So we have some things that I noticed from his presentation that might be like a little redundant and kind of say a little bit the same thing.

271
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:14,170
But I ended up doing my Alia Amasa and I also have a full of a title name, just like Tren,

272
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:20,870
but mine is the antibiotic resistant profiles of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates for COVID in foster care,

273
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:28,690
most acute care screening of patients in environmental services. So a little bit of background on Staphylococcus aureus.

274
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:36,340
In case people know about it, it is a cocci shaped gram positive bacteria and it is one of the most common causes of bacterial infections in humans.

275
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:43,780
It is commonly found on the skin and in the nares, which is your nose. And actually 25% of people can carry it without any sort of infection.

276
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,459
If they do get infections, the most common ones are skin infections, pneumonia,

277
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,820
blood infection, sepsis, and it is usually transmitted person to person.

278
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:56,470
There are higher risk factors for people with chronic conditions children,

279
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,770
the elderly and health care workers that could be at risk for severe resource.

280
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:07,480
So that being said, what is Mercer? Right. So Mercer is short for a methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,

281
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,940
and methicillin is a beta lactam antibiotic that was first used to treat staph aureus in 1959.

282
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,550
Then, sadly, only a couple short years later in the UK, methicillin resistant was first reported.

283
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,630
So you know what kind of makes methicillin resistant happen for staph aureus?

284
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:26,260
It is usually the MECA gene that encodes resistance on susceptible strains.

285
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:30,430
The MECA gene does allow bacteria to be resistant to all beta lactam antibiotics.

286
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:35,800
So methicillin and penicillin are most common and is usually the most common carrier for this gene.

287
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,990
This gene also mutates the penicillin binding protein, which affects all beta lactam antibiotics as well.

288
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:48,010
And that's what they used to bind to the bacteria. So the binding protein was like a circle and your metazoan was a circle.

289
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:52,150
And if your binding protein like changes to a square like, you know, the cartoons from like microbiology class,

290
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,470
they wouldn't be able to bind to each other, so the antibiotic wouldn't be able to be used for staph aureus.

291
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:10,129
So where are we now? A couple of years since 1961, of course, but the CDC, the CDC was able to compile in their recent 2019 report their 2017 data,

292
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:17,540
because it's always a couple of years later for Mersa. So as you can see, we have about 323,000 cases in 2017 and over 10,000 deaths.

293
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,020
Virtual transmit is mission.

294
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:29,339
It is usually transmitted by skin to skin contact or with contact with highly shared items, while 25% of people cured staph aureus.

295
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:35,700
As I said before, 2% carry Mirza and animals can also transmit more so your pets and even birds can transmit mercy to you.

296
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,640
It is prevalent transmission and community hospital.

297
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,770
So is not just a hospital acquired infection, it's also becoming pretty prevalent in the community as well.

298
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,190
And there are sort of five season or so transmission risk.

299
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:52,950
So if you're in, you know, crowded spaces with high contact, you have some compromised skin touching contaminated items and,

300
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,090
you know, your hospital with decrease in cleanliness that will cause an increase for your transmission risk.

301
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:03,149
While anyone can get more immunocompromised people and people with wounds, even like small scratches or paper cuts,

302
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:10,530
can be at a higher risk of more infection, or it is treatable, depending on the strains resistant to other antibiotics.

303
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,549
Vancomycin right now is what we call kind of our last line antibiotic.

304
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,610
It's pretty much the last one that hasn't shown huge resistance to Mersa,

305
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,170
but there are concerns about the development of resistance to it in the near future.

306
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,530
There's about a dozen cases right now of whole resistance in the world, which kind of makes us wonder, you know, is partial resistance on the rise?

307
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:34,570
This is the last antibiotics we have left to treat this infection. Which, you know, kind of uses to be like, why do we care?

308
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,790
Like, what do we need to do about this?

309
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:41,100
So, you know, as I just said, versus becoming resistant to multiple, multiple erotica, which makes it extremely hard to treat.

310
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,659
And this is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates and longer hospital stays,

311
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,860
which of course, is increase risk you as it costs to pay the hospital.

312
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,890
It's also highly prevalent in post-acute care environments.

313
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:59,160
So nursing homes or long term long term care facilities where 60% of residents can be colonized with Mercer.

314
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:06,110
So with that being said, I was really interested to look at Masters of Transmission so I won't go through.

315
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:13,590
There's no whole again. But this is getting more into my project. So there were a couple of research gaps that I identified in the literature.

316
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,280
One was that antibiotic resistant strains in nursing home patients and their environment

317
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,420
are usually talked about is usually more hospital stays or even just like short,

318
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:28,500
short term stays. And like an emergency room that I found a lot of data on versus a longer term stay.

319
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,940
This is also one of the first studies attempting to describe and compare prevalence,

320
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,379
antimicrobial sensitivity and the relationship to antimicrobial use in colonizing and

321
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:42,960
environmental medicine strains two different nursing home settings in a distinct logical region.

322
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:47,799
Geographical region. So what were sort of my objectives and aims of the study?

323
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:54,460
I have three big ones. The first one was to characterize an antibiotic resistant profile of Mirza in these post-acute care settings.

324
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,299
My second was to determine a correlation between antibiotic therapy,

325
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,680
which is previous antibiotic use and mercer resistance when they come into the facility.

326
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,180
And then I wanted to investigate the differences in resistance profile between the patient and their environment.

327
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:14,280
So this was an ongoing prospective cohort study of Mozart strains from 43 patients,

328
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,510
their rooms and out of room for months in the Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Cleveland, Ohio, V.A. clinics.

329
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:23,010
This is I bought all of my samples from a larger VA study that my lab,

330
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:29,100
the first lab is doing right now called the Patient Movement Study, which is a study looking on MDR transmission through these veins.

331
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:34,410
So almost 240 strains last year. I got previously swabbed earlier.

332
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:40,020
These came from the nerves, groin and hands. Those are usually the most common areas on the body where bacteria grow.

333
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,129
And then we have in room surfaces your high touch surfaces.

334
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:48,870
Right. So, you know, tables, TV remotes, toilets, bed rails, curtains, everything that's touched a lot.

335
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:56,100
And then we also had out of our example swabs when a patient goes to like on duty and they leave the room and we were able to get

336
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:01,410
swabs of their hands before they leave and you services they touched and then even health care workers hands over with them.

337
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:11,490
So this looks a lot like what Trent just said. But I was able to take all 240 strains from the freezer for them and take them on MSA flights.

338
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:16,320
I know Trent showed you this, but this is what an MSA plate looks like when they're step on it.

339
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:22,920
It's always yellow. Then I was able to take one pure colony from this, and I was able to grow it on a blood agar plate.

340
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:28,740
And since we had already put these 240 strains in the freezer, we knew that they were staph positive.

341
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:34,380
So I didn't go ahead and retest the catalyzing coagulation test, but that's what you would do if you were to test for staff.

342
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:44,580
Instead of that, I went straight ahead and put them on millions of plates and that was just me swabbing bacteria from the blood agar and to be a GI.

343
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:50,400
I mean, it's just a part of me and doing the work by McFarlane, just spreading it on here to do my distribution.

344
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,479
Just diffusion works when an antibiotic just is placed onto the media.

345
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,720
So like this with the bacteria, you can see the bacteria in the street and grown,

346
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:03,390
the sample grown grows with nose on it and in addition it is resistant to antibiotics.

347
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:07,950
So you can see these ones with no zone around them. And then these ones are great with a pretty big sound.

348
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,190
So these would be susceptible to the antibiotic because nothing grew near them.

349
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:18,700
So once I did all 240 samples of those three steps, I went ahead and kept a log.

350
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,850
So I knew what their diameters were for each antibiotic.

351
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:28,899
I tested nine antibiotics with the distribution and I was able to assign these criteria to them.

352
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:39,219
So they had the classic criteria. This is just like a microbiology criteria for you find your organism and then you find your partner,

353
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,580
you find what you want to source, obviously organism, and then you find which antibiotics you want to use.

354
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:47,380
And these are just set limits that are set by people with no higher standards than I have.

355
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:51,100
But so I went ahead and I was able to use all these to make a log.

356
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,110
So, you know, how do you read something like this?

357
00:33:53,110 --> 00:34:03,220
Let's say I have a plate with gentamicin on it and I have a distribution with a diameter of ten, ten milliliters, I mean.

358
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:08,180
Mm. Yeah, that makes sense. No one else would turn it off.

359
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,529
So the ten is less than 12.

360
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:16,790
So would be resistant if I had a huge zone of inhibition and it would be like 25 like Lloyd showed you, it would be susceptible.

361
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:24,520
This is what my log looks like. I just did it on Excel, kept it nice and easy. The freezer number is one where I got from.

362
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,600
From the freezer. So if I had to retested, I knew where it came from. The idea is just the patient number.

363
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,919
The number of is it is what visit that they were swabbed on to visit zeros.

364
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,520
When they come in there, they stay for it. We're tested every week, up to a month.

365
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:43,120
And then it's every month after that, up to three months, up to 90 days. The location where there's lots of hands there.

366
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,670
There's all your eyes are all the environmental and the S's are when they go out of the room.

367
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,280
So like surfaces working deep like that.

368
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:56,680
And then I was able to keep all my antibiotics listed here and to see which ones are resistant and which one versus optimal.

369
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:04,060
I also forgot to mention in my last note that I did test from your pen, um, which is why I had this last year here.

370
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:10,840
I wanted to get the data just to have it. But there is no class criteria like in place for your pen for Mirza.

371
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,290
So I didn't do any data analysis on it. I just stopped it after the log.

372
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:21,010
Wanted to have the data just because we had the antibiotic on hand anyways, but I didn't use it to test for any sort of resistance percentages.

373
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,680
All right. So as you guys probably saw with the log, there was vancomycin in there because I did do just diffusion for vancomycin.

374
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,000
But this diffusion usually isn't that reliable or think of it as an antibiotic.

375
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:40,070
So I went ahead and I did a think of them. I see. Which is a minimum inhibitory concentration.

376
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:44,389
Just. These are a little more involved and more time consuming.

377
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:47,510
So I didn't want to do all 240 strains. I probably would've never finished by now.

378
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:54,709
So I went ahead and I chose non redundant isolates. For example, you know, if you have five muscle strains isolated from, you know,

379
00:35:54,710 --> 00:36:00,620
patient one and all five of your nurses samples have exactly the same phenotype.

380
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,940
So, you know, they're all resistant or generalized, then they're all susceptible for Ciprofloxacin.

381
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,480
Then I only chose one of them so that it kind of cut back the number that I had to test.

382
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:12,079
So. So after that, once I figured out kind of which ones I wanted to test,

383
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,890
I went ahead and did the MSI, which is dotted around your six wall plate like this.

384
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:21,649
You take them off of the blood agar just like you did for the just a fusion.

385
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:27,440
And instead of doing it on a disk, you take the samples and put them into a dry broth, let them grow, and then you're all set to go.

386
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,020
So the first step, you just kind of put all 100 milliliters of.

387
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:40,770
Amulet and bra into an internal pocket and then are able to fill all of these way faster than doing one channel by bed at the time.

388
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,690
And then so once they all have the 100 milliliters of breath in there,

389
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,080
you go ahead and you make your medical license solution, which is 100 microliters.

390
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,530
I make them I said about 128 micrograms per milliliter.

391
00:36:53,430 --> 00:37:00,240
Once that's set, you go ahead and you put it up here in this first row right here, and then you go ahead and you dilute.

392
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,899
So you go ahead. You don't pick any more vancomycin up from your sample.

393
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,680
You just go ahead and you take it from here. Take it from here all the way down to the last one.

394
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,459
You leave this one at two years of control so nothing grows.

395
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,120
You know, something was wrong or you actually put vancomycin in there. It's always nice to have a control.

396
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,400
After that, you go ahead and you get your samples ready.

397
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:26,109
So you do the 50 microliters of the samples in the broth that you took out of the incubator, and you put them with ten milliliters of the image.

398
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:32,110
I brought the same problems at the beginning. You go ahead and you filter wells that are labeled.

399
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,889
So this is patient one, one, one. This was the same. So I went ahead.

400
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:40,340
I usually get two at a time, so I got 14 hour time. But they do all seven samples.

401
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,130
So how do you, like, interpret a test like this? You go ahead and you find.

402
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:50,450
The first time that it starts to grow like the minimum growth and you got one.

403
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:56,650
So you know that this is the last dilution where it was inhibiting growth before it starts to grow.

404
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:01,850
So all these had an impact of one. Getting into my results.

405
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:07,940
As I said before, I had three aims for this project. The first was to create an antibiotic resistant profile for all this data,

406
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:15,110
and I was able to do that during data analysis, and I was able to make this nice table of present resistance.

407
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:22,430
So look at this table. We kind of noticed that Ruth or my son had the highest present resistance excuse me for the risk of fluoxetine.

408
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:29,499
I did put the vancomycin rates in here just to keep it. Listen, even with like when I was using antibiotics.

409
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,370
But since I didn't do the distribution, I have a separate wrapper that later I'm going to show you guys.

410
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,900
And, you know, at the other extreme, we have one liners all adhere with the lowest resistance.

411
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:47,950
I did one chi square test on these. And interesting enough, none of them were significant, which I thought was interesting.

412
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:52,059
But we did run that test as well. This is what I just showed you.

413
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,510
Just a graph form. I think tables like that one, there was a hard to read.

414
00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:03,550
I like pictures. So, you know, I told you, lives alone had a very high susceptibility rate, very low resistance for my 240 strains.

415
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,819
You know, that may be a good analog to get them from yours or mine.

416
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:12,490
Randomized another had lots of lots of resistance would not killed MRSA probably shouldn't give it to those 250 strains.

417
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:18,840
Right. As I promised my vancomycin results for the.

418
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:23,400
So most of the vancomycin is just below the intermediate range here.

419
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,879
And as you can see, this is the range. You read it pretty much the same as the class.

420
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:35,580
I just with 28 to 145 at 162.5 and only one really low stage at a quarter here.

421
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:43,879
So was it at all that I wanted to look back at data that we collected at the beginning

422
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,600
of the study on antibiotic usage before they came into long term care facility,

423
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,290
and if that had any sort of changes on Mercer resistance throughout their stay.

424
00:39:54,280 --> 00:40:00,040
So I was able to get resistant profiles and see that they varied over time in five patients with the Marshall strains.

425
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:07,030
So it's actually four antibiotics, four different antibiotics, nine different strains and five conditions up here.

426
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:12,160
Of the nine strains that change resistant profiles to or from the patient and seven were from the environment.

427
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:18,340
And then we have two here with the dotted line that shows that they just switch from susceptible to resistant.

428
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,969
And then interestingly, I had three from the same patient.

429
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:25,720
I had three antibiotics switch after they had stopped taking them.

430
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:29,650
So they came in on day one, taking whatever antibiotic they were taking.

431
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,950
And then the doctors that stop it, they don't get them back on at all.

432
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:36,100
And yet their resistant profile still changed for those three antibiotics.

433
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:44,170
A little caveat to this was that we haven't performed any sort of molecular typing yet to confirm that these isolates changing resistance between,

434
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,320
you know, the first time that they're isolated, the last time is actually the same strain.

435
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:51,819
It's just something that I can look at now, but I can't say that's actually for sure.

436
00:40:51,820 --> 00:41:01,100
The same strain. That kind of led me to my third aim was to look at different differences in resistance between patients and environment isolates.

437
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:10,130
So by doing this, I was able to compare the VA up here versus the Cleveland V.A. and analyzing the average resistance profiles for the total.

438
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:14,290
Cleveland average was 11.4% higher for resistance than at others.

439
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:23,000
Ciprofloxacin was that most that changed throughout Ann Arbor and Cleveland with a total change of 15.13% higher.

440
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:33,329
Okay, so I hope I said doing 18 points on hard for me. So during and after doing all my analysis, what could I conclude?

441
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:40,530
Right. One of the first conclusions that you can take from my resistance table was that high resistance rates of fluoroquinolones

442
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:45,750
and micro macrolides show that they should be avoided for a vehicle therapy because they do have a high resistance rate.

443
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:50,940
The vancomycin, if I see results, show that susceptibility is really close to the interview stage.

444
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:58,259
So, you know, in a perfect world, we would have had a lot of the vancomycin be really shifted to the left, right, very low, very, very susceptible.

445
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:03,299
But while it's creeping up, it really is getting close to intermediate and then probably, you know, eventually resistance, right?

446
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:10,180
If we don't do anything. There were there were no significant changes in the resistance profile between patients and environment isolates.

447
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:16,690
This probably could be linked to environmental strains being closely related to patient strains, although I don't know that for certain.

448
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,390
And it is useful to perform rational analysis of range of their susceptibility may change over time.

449
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:29,190
Some sort of public health implications for this and for Mersa. As of right now,

450
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:36,420
2.8 million antibiotic resistant infections per year and the CDC estimates by 2050 there'll be 10 million deaths from antibiotic resistance,

451
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,860
which would make it deadlier than cancer resistant spreads globally and across regions.

452
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,220
As I showed you, you know, versus the number versus the Cleveland VA.

453
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:51,530
And Mersa already is resistant to many first line antibiotics, including like landmines and X and it's, you know,

454
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:57,150
starting to creep into that susceptible, intermediate, creeping up resistant range for that last line, McLemore said.

455
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,500
So we really need to prevent the misuse of antibiotics to kind of decrease the risk of that.

456
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:08,240
So I only had a limited amount of time and I saw some future directions that that that

457
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,500
the study could take is to continue looking at new shrinks from the Detroit V.A.

458
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,990
We just started getting training. This is the second year of the patient movement study for the press lab.

459
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:25,520
So being able to look at their streams would be cool to. After two years of the study, the lab is also implementing interventions,

460
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,140
so looking at strange strains after intervention practices were put into place.

461
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:30,680
You know,

462
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:37,040
anything from like cleaning to an increase in hand-washing could make a huge difference in other types of the current strains that we tested.

463
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,200
Obviously would be good to see the resistant profiles.

464
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,650
Genome sequencing is usually what we do, like attempts to determine if the longitudinal strains were actually from the same patient.

465
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,890
Branching out into other VA centers in different parts of the US could be cool to see if it moves.

466
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:57,709
Different regions. Different regions have different resistance rates and you can even we could even take it really far

467
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:02,030
and look at patient features to see if there is like certain people are at increased risk of mersa.

468
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:06,620
You could do this by comparing, you know, mersa Pace's patients to most patients.

469
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:14,070
I also have a couple analogies like trip here, Dr. Modi and everyone in the Chris lab that helped me throughout this.

470
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:21,870
Dr. Marcus really helps me a lot. Alex always looking over my stuff and the internship for me to do this over the summer.

471
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:32,880
Then I just have those. What questions?

472
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:41,750
So you mentioned that this was like a population that wasn't really studied, was an alternative versus resistance.

473
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:50,610
And I was wondering if, like your results from your study compared to other populations, I guess like other hospital settings, like prisons.

474
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:57,080
And they do differ a little bit from some literature that I read on.

475
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:01,160
Just like regular hospital resistant numbers, they do seem to be a little higher.

476
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:07,170
I didn't actually read any sort of like prison or anything like that, but that would be really cool to look at.

477
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:12,410
Do most of the data that's out there is all hospitals, so that's what I was able to reference.

478
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:17,210
But that would be cool to see if even like Community Health Center right if they make a difference with that too.

479
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,860
Something like a bit of a motorway or something.

480
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:33,790
That'll be the been broken on a holiday occasion.

481
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:47,780
Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I like the idea that they're not as well aware of, like, commercial risk as hospitals are.

482
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:56,240
They want to just. Some questions.

483
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,410
Of course. I know. So you mentioned the surface in order.

484
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:06,650
Already got my attention, the picture, the remote control. And so as you test the remote control, that it's just a shower and it's working.

485
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,240
So I did it because I didn't take the samples. The samples were just brought to me.

486
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:14,659
But our samples were all the interim services were here.

487
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,520
So it was bed controls, call buttons, tabletops, TV remotes, curtains, bedrooms toward the seats.

488
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:21,110
So all those responses, I Yeah. Yeah.

489
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:26,660
I can find little patches for all of them, but I feel like these are the most highly touched in a nursing home care facility.

490
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:32,570
Right. Getting it is because like the TV remote was that in the patient's room was a communion TV remote.

491
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:38,690
And that would depend on the room, right? It isn't. Yeah, I is that because I haven't been able to talk to the VA yet.

492
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:45,200
But yeah, I think it is for every I see the movies you've seen me, the movie Cocoon,

493
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,959
for example, there's a patient they will give it to that is shared with me.

494
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:53,720
Watch the TV and has remote control of someone doing with that one have like multiple times of MRSA on it.

495
00:46:54,230 --> 00:47:01,520
Yeah. If that was ever looked at that existed at this place that I think no I don't think so because it's not like a

496
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:17,470
community event and that means for it doesn't that we don't have it like understanding exactly what I mean.

497
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:30,380
Mm hmm. So all of that and and and the number one and most closely related to patients.

498
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:42,559
So, you know, you pretty much know even that question would be interesting to see.

499
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,510
Like in a, um, assisted living facility, they test the remotes and look at them, you know,

500
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:52,390
and that versus like a singular hospital room or single room and see like how much different colors you can get.

501
00:47:52,880 --> 00:48:01,510
And yeah, like, I shared, like. Yeah. Um, and I guess that's why, like,

502
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:08,129
I see that it is so I think it's the instrument that was there associations between the patient and the woman that the patient had,

503
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:11,630
the particular MRSA with a particular profile.

504
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,400
Did you pick that up? It was saying that the toilet seat and the guy with it.

505
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:24,560
Yeah. So that was on my head. I don't know because I want all of the, um, environmental is into this one because it's easier for data analysis.

506
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:32,020
I do have the data. I could look and see if like, you know, it was higher for a TV remote or, you know, lower for a rail, right.

507
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,750
For the day. Analysis purpose. I just did all of our as just every patient.

508
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,360
Right. But I did like one the. Yeah, yeah.

509
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:45,230
Back to my log like I did put in, you know, e three isms in for even though they're both in the room.

510
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:52,490
Yeah. So I could be, I could go back and look at that. That'll be interesting and kind of cool to see like a couple of them influence, if you will.

511
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:57,739
Yeah. Um, yeah, that's actually part of what the original difference in the data set I used,

512
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:04,010
part of the original study was looking at like a comparison of patients in there you go.

513
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:12,680
It's been done. So it's been done. Yeah. And part of the study also is actually to look at not only like e organisms but also the bacteria.

514
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:23,110
Yes. To see how they're moving. So. So that so that some of the some of that question is going to be able to be better answered.

515
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:29,380
Yeah. Yeah. Especially when Mark was able to I think he already did send some samples for genome sequencing.

516
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,950
Yeah. Yeah. We think about like probably doing with more.

517
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:41,110
Wow. The bunch of things that we would like to get.

518
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:46,060
What we can see, they'd like to see.

519
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:52,280
Do they do the same? Anything in common?

520
00:49:53,130 --> 00:50:01,560
I would say he's he's already been. Isn't going to.

521
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:13,190
Any questions? Should 96 1243 Yeah.

522
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:20,380
0031i think you know.

523
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:36,090
To. You say it wasn't on the in the one place.

524
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,740
If you set it up like this. So if you don't put anything in your first column besides the image eyebrow,

525
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,630
then it's in control because there's no bacteria in it, just that in the makeup.

526
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,430
And then, you know, if you go down here and you put in overpromising, you can also use this as a like a gross control.

527
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:59,829
Since I did all of the stereotypes first, like all of the distribution first,

528
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:04,750
I did go back and identify and I had to go out and regrow like these flights to get to the 96.

529
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:10,479
Well, because they don't stay, you know, as good for very long. But if you do the control like that, you'll need to do it.

530
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:18,790
Just put the whole plate in the incubator and let it grow. I mean, like what I was talking about, like, I mean, I'm trying to apply, like, virus.

531
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:23,620
Yeah. Oh, that was similar. Like, I was thinking, like.

532
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:31,720
So you have the sample and like, each one of them, like, you have to do, like all of the other reasons are like.

533
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:41,150
Yes. Yes. I would just have to rerun a second 96.

534
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:46,710
So I didn't have to do that. I did that once or twice. I had a couple that did not look right on issues with that.

535
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:51,030
Yeah. Yeah. So I had a couple that came out that I was like, there's no way that, you know, it was like.

536
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,480
An ace or something right there, you know, looking at all my other data. So I did have to go back after I read them all.

537
00:51:56,550 --> 00:52:01,880
I had like three or four that I was able to do and, you know, rerun like I did like two or three times to make sure it was consistent.

538
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:09,550
But yeah. Sometimes. Sometimes it's so it's a very it's a it's a lot more tedious than like a distribution desk.

539
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:16,730
So it has a lot more room for error. We have questions.

540
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:25,360
This horse. Right.

541
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:26,780
Um. What was that?
