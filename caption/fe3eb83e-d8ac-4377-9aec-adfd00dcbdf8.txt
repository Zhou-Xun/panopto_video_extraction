00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:14,472
Welcome to our second online session for motivational interviewing.

2
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:15,918
Our objectives for

3
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:21,704
today are to define the role of energy in behavior change and in motivation.

4
00:00:21,704 --> 00:00:28,741
And two, define some of the essential elements of MI.

5
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:31,453
We said last lecture that increasingly,

6
00:00:31,453 --> 00:00:35,640
we're starting to view motivation as synonymous with energy.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,599
So motivation can be seen as how much energy are you willing to devote

8
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:41,818
to this change?

9
00:00:41,818 --> 00:00:46,717
Now historically, we have motivated things with more negative sources of energy,

10
00:00:46,717 --> 00:00:48,926
fear, facts and negative feedback.

11
00:00:48,926 --> 00:00:52,809
Well it turns out that's not a particularly long lasting source of

12
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:53,648
motivation.

13
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:58,116
It has a short half life and a motivational interviewing.

14
00:00:58,116 --> 00:01:01,797
We try and use more positive energy drivers like your roles,

15
00:01:01,797 --> 00:01:06,718
goals, values being a good parent, feeling in control, feeling integrated.

16
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:13,423
We try to connect health behavior to those more positive energy sources.

17
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:18,273
Now to take the energy metaphor one step further,

18
00:01:18,273 --> 00:01:23,010
we can think about successful long term behavior

19
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,413
change as equating to energy independence.

20
00:01:27,413 --> 00:01:32,726
Your goal as a behavior change counselor is to help the person get to a point where

21
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:37,984
they don't have to exert energy, they don't have to exert impulse control.

22
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:42,084
They just naturally wanna do the behavior.

23
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:45,969
Why sometimes when people are in addiction treatment,

24
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:50,442
are they encouraged to say I am recovering, I am not recovered.

25
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:54,484
Well that's because it still takes some energy to resist alcohol.

26
00:01:54,484 --> 00:01:56,847
They're not energy independent.

27
00:01:56,847 --> 00:02:01,606
But if you could help your client's get to the point where they look at a bottle of

28
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:04,251
alcohol and say it attracts me, not at all.

29
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:05,640
I'm repulsed by it.

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,006
Where the smell of cigarettes is noxious versus attractive,

31
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:11,927
where they actually say I'm really enjoying fruit.

32
00:02:11,927 --> 00:02:14,668
Perhaps even as much as I did other foods.

33
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,270
Our goal is to try and

34
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,551
get people to the point where they don't have to exert energy, but

35
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:27,703
to get to that point it takes a fair bit of energy because change takes energy.

36
00:02:27,703 --> 00:02:34,152
So let's define some of the key essential elements of motivational interviewing.

37
00:02:34,152 --> 00:02:38,096
Before we go into the active hal phase, first,

38
00:02:38,096 --> 00:02:42,938
let's address the feelings and the fears of the patient.

39
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:46,623
This video clip captures it wonderfully.

40
00:02:46,623 --> 00:02:49,016
Take a look, wow.

41
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:52,688
>> I would have sworn sparkle pony mountains right here.

42
00:02:52,688 --> 00:02:53,474
>> What's going on?

43
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:54,957
>> Yeah, I don't know what the brits.

44
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:57,125
>> That's dreamworld.

45
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:03,293
>> How the fish just animal Hall of Fame.

46
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:05,112
My rocket.

47
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:07,392
Wait, randy and I were still using that rocket.

48
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,085
It still has some song para left.

49
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:15,552
Who was your friend who likes to play?

50
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:24,144
[NOISE] You can't take my rocket and

51
00:03:24,144 --> 00:03:28,295
I go to the moon.

52
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:32,669
Finally can't

53
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:37,382
be done with me.

54
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:39,535
>> Hey, it's gonna be okay.

55
00:03:39,535 --> 00:03:40,896
We can fix this.

56
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:42,791
We just need to get back to headquarters.

57
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,718
Which way to the train station.

58
00:03:44,718 --> 00:03:47,794
>> I had a whole trip planned for us.

59
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,547
Hey, who's ticklish?

60
00:03:50,547 --> 00:03:54,203
Here comes the tickle monster, wow!

61
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:58,812
Hey, look at this boy.

62
00:03:58,812 --> 00:03:59,851
Here's a fun game.

63
00:03:59,851 --> 00:04:04,090
You point to the train station and we all go there.

64
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,327
Well that'd be fun.

65
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:09,085
Come on, let's go to the train station.

66
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:11,344
>> I'm sorry they took your rocket.

67
00:04:11,344 --> 00:04:14,572
They took something that you loved.

68
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:16,395
It's gone forever.

69
00:04:16,395 --> 00:04:17,222
>> Sadness.

70
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:18,550
Don't make him feel worse.

71
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,581
>> Sorry.

72
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:22,073
>> It's all I had left of Riley.

73
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:25,212
>> I bet you and Riley had great adventures.

74
00:04:25,212 --> 00:04:26,965
>> They were wonderful.

75
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:28,858
>> Once we flew back in time.

76
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:31,507
We had breakfast twice that day.

77
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:33,112
>> It sounds amazing.

78
00:04:33,112 --> 00:04:35,646
I bet Riley liked it.

79
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:36,817
>> She did.

80
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:38,829
We were best friends.

81
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:42,403
>> Yeah, it's sad.

82
00:04:42,403 --> 00:04:52,019
>> I'm okay now.

83
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:57,589
Come on, the train

84
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:03,862
station is this way.

85
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:07,793
>> How did you do that?

86
00:05:07,793 --> 00:05:08,888
>> I don't know.

87
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:09,967
He was sad.

88
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,253
So I listen to what?

89
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:15,664
>> Hey, there's the train.

90
00:05:15,664 --> 00:05:18,256
>> So what did you see here?

91
00:05:18,256 --> 00:05:26,267
The first character try to helping bang by saying get over it, distract yourself.

92
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:29,474
Didn't seem to work, did it?

93
00:05:29,474 --> 00:05:35,296
Second character, sadness reflected back, Bing bong's emotions.

94
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:40,160
After draining the swamp, something we'll talk a lot about during this course.

95
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,354
After draining the swamp of his sadness, Bing Bang naturally perked up and

96
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:48,993
said, you know what I might be able to get over this.

97
00:05:48,993 --> 00:05:52,346
That's very different than telling someone you should get over this.

98
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:56,738
So, in MI, by reflecting someone's feelings,

99
00:05:56,738 --> 00:06:00,195
we actually move them towards change.

100
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:04,779
The second principle of MI is to rely more on reflections than questions.

101
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:08,995
There's even a ratio we recommend 2-3 reflections for every question.

102
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:12,095
As we'll learn later when you use reflections,

103
00:06:12,095 --> 00:06:15,658
it really helps keeps the encounter patient centered.

104
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:19,300
It really helps you avoid unsolicited advice.

105
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,283
It helps you avoid telling people what to do.

106
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,530
Roll with resistance.

107
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,957
As we've shown you in a few cases already, when someone expresses a barrier,

108
00:06:28,957 --> 00:06:33,382
don't tell them well, don't think about that way or here's how to solve it,

109
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:35,213
acknowledge it, roll with it.

110
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:37,350
Don't counterpunch.

111
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:43,295
Number four ellicit change talk versus advise.

112
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:46,235
There's something that Bill Miller talked about called the writing reflects.

113
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:48,661
Someone needs to quit smoking or quit drinking or lose weight or

114
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:49,911
manage their chronic disease.

115
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:53,329
And that's true they need to do it if they wanna stay alive.

116
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,032
But you have to resist the temptation to say you must issued.

117
00:06:56,032 --> 00:07:00,752
You have to and instead ellicit from the patient why they

118
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:05,682
might wanna do it and also how they might wanna go about it.

119
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:08,443
It takes a little bit more discipline to do it this way.

120
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:14,025
But it's far more effective than advice.

121
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:19,121
Affirm the effort of patients, even if they haven't succeeded,

122
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:22,311
find something positive in their story.

123
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:25,892
Let's take a look at this next client's statement.

124
00:07:25,892 --> 00:07:34,974
Go ahead and read it.

125
00:07:34,974 --> 00:07:37,871
So in a minute we're gonna show you what we might want to affirm in this patient

126
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:38,372
statement.

127
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:45,756
But first let's go to the old school, let's go to the old finger wag.

128
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:50,912
Can you imagine how the mom would feel if a provider talk this way?

129
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:54,296
Probably a little pissed off.

130
00:07:54,296 --> 00:07:59,996
And remember we're trying to affirm something positive about mom's statement.

131
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:04,557
So as we've recommended before, we wanna first roll with resistance

132
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:08,203
because you're so busy and it's hard to cook healthy.

133
00:08:08,203 --> 00:08:10,787
But we affirm the fact that she cares about her kids and

134
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:12,580
she's trying to do the right thing.

135
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,377
This helps establish report between you and the client.

136
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:21,461
This is gonna be important that this report is gonna allow you to sometimes

137
00:08:21,461 --> 00:08:26,797
make an accurate reflection because you have some report points in the bank.

138
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:31,341
Now let's take a look at another MI skill or another MI essential principle.

139
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:34,594
And we call it reflecting on omission.

140
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:38,137
Here's someone is talking about their desire to exercise more but

141
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:39,284
she's frustrated.

142
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,112
She doesn't have anyone to do it with.

143
00:08:41,112 --> 00:08:46,615
And she seems to be someone who really can't do it by herself.

144
00:08:46,615 --> 00:08:52,920
Given what she said, let's take a look at a non MI response.

145
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,386
How would you feel if someone gave you this advice after what you just said?

146
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:58,392
Does it reflect that you're listening?

147
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:01,995
Or doesn't reflect that you're more of an advice giver.

148
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:04,380
Clearly it's the latter.

149
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,781
So what would an MI response look like here.

150
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:11,777
So what we do here is we establish that I heard you, it sounds like

151
00:09:11,777 --> 00:09:16,664
although you really wanna exercise, your husband really isn't the answer.

152
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:18,422
We're crossing them off the list.

153
00:09:18,422 --> 00:09:22,810
Now if we're wrong and she says my God he would be great to exercise with.

154
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,214
She won't get upset.

155
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:26,781
She'll actually take it as a suggestion.

156
00:09:26,781 --> 00:09:31,115
But it's a lot better than saying why don't you exercise with your husband when

157
00:09:31,115 --> 00:09:34,163
she just told us two minutes ago that he is not an option.

158
00:09:34,163 --> 00:09:37,722
Now, let's take a look at another example for

159
00:09:37,722 --> 00:09:42,388
how reflective listening can be used to respond to clients.

160
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:45,275
This client says, look at you, you're not heavy.

161
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:47,640
How can you help me?

162
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,129
Now in the old school response, you may say something like well,

163
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:52,849
I struggled with other things.

164
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:57,812
I struggle with shopping, I struggled with cigarettes so I can relate to you.

165
00:09:57,812 --> 00:09:59,874
That's not an MI response.

166
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:05,145
An MI response is there's a feeling or meaning to this question.

167
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:07,268
You're trying to get at something.

168
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:14,099
And an MI your reflections are in effect your best guess for why did you say that?

169
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:17,457
So your best guess is you know what, I think you're worried that if I haven't

170
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:20,209
struggled with my weight, I won't be able to understand you.

171
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:24,216
Maybe I can't help you or maybe even judge you.

172
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:28,381
So this introduces this idea that reflective listening is

173
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:29,997
hypothesis testing.

174
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:32,220
That ends our second lecture.

175
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,026
We hope we've established the essential principles of MI and

176
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:40,653
showing you a little bit more about the role of energy and behavior change.

177
00:10:40,653 --> 00:10:43,209
Thanks for watching.
