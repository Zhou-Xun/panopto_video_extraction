1
00:00:08,977 --> 00:00:13,722
Risk averse consumers facing a risky
financial situation are willing to accept

2
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:18,253
a relatively small, but certain loss
paying the premium to protect against

3
00:00:18,253 --> 00:00:22,951
the chance of suffering a much larger
loss of increasingly valuable dollars.

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,840
Insurance operates by pulling
many people facing similar risks.

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,081
Each one puts premiums into the pot at the
beginning of the year not knowing who will

6
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:35,440
actually experience the loss.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,807
Those who do experience the loss can
then file a claim for reimbursement.

8
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:43,557
Insurance works best when the chances
of loss are independent or

9
00:00:43,557 --> 00:00:48,418
uncorrelated across policy-holders' so
that the insurer can use the law of large

10
00:00:48,418 --> 00:00:51,831
numbers to accurately predict
their exposure to claims.

11
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:56,576
Stop the video for a moment and try to
think of a situation where risks might not

12
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:01,761
be independent and how that might make it
harder for an insurance market to operate.

13
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,254
A couple examples would be storm or
wildfire damage and

14
00:01:07,254 --> 00:01:09,061
major infection outbreaks.

15
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,536
My likelihood of having a heart attack is
uncorrelated with whether any other person

16
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:17,840
covered by my insurer
also has a heart attack.

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,628
However, my house's probability of
being damaged in a hurricane or

18
00:01:21,628 --> 00:01:26,151
a wildfire is very strongly correlated
with my neighbors suffering such damage.

19
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,367
Unlike a health insurer who will likely
cover a similar number of heart attacks

20
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:37,272
every year if it continues insuring the
same sorts of people, a homeowners insurer

21
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:41,616
in Miami will likely pay no claims at
all for hurricane damage most years,

22
00:01:41,616 --> 00:01:44,938
it will be liable for
a huge number of claims some years.

23
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,128
Such an insurer would need to hold very
large reserves to avoid defaulting on

24
00:01:49,128 --> 00:01:50,968
claims after a really bad storm.

25
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,232
This graph shows how a hypothetical
risk averse consumer will respond to

26
00:01:58,232 --> 00:02:01,140
the opportunity to buy insurance.

27
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,525
Suppose they start with
an income of $15,000,

28
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:08,582
which gives them a utility of 36,
that's point A on the graph.

29
00:02:08,582 --> 00:02:13,840
They face a situation where they
might experience a $10,000 loss.

30
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,405
If that loss happens,
they would only have $5,000 left,

31
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:21,540
which would give them a utility of 20,
that's point B.

32
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,673
If the loss happens, 50% of the time,
their income will be $10,000 on average,

33
00:02:26,673 --> 00:02:30,943
half the time they're 5,000,
half the time they're 15,000,

34
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:34,161
their utility will be 28 on average,
that's point C.

35
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,375
What would their utility be if
they could eliminate the risk and

36
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:43,122
guarantee themselves
the average income of $10,000?

37
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:45,251
It would be 30, that's point D.

38
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,452
That would in fact be the outcome if they
could find an insurer willing to charge

39
00:02:50,452 --> 00:02:52,961
them a $5,000 premium for that protection.

40
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,440
However, the insurer
hopes to make a profit.

41
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,240
They'll need to charge more than $5,000.

42
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,699
Otherwise, they'd expect to have to
pay out claims using every dollar they

43
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:07,540
collect in premiums on average.

44
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,994
We can also use this graph to infer
the most this consumer would pay to be

45
00:03:11,994 --> 00:03:15,102
insured, rather than
having to face that risk.

46
00:03:15,102 --> 00:03:19,932
At point E, we can see that the consumer's
utility from having $8,000 for

47
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:23,851
sure is exactly as high as their
average utility when uninsured.

48
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,710
Since the uninsured situation has
an average income of $10,000,

49
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,646
we can infer that the consumer would
pay anywhere up to $2,000 above their

50
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:38,865
average loss of 5000 to have
the insurer bear the risk for them.

51
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:43,492
There are a couple of ways in which health
insurance is different than most standard

52
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:44,691
types of insurance.

53
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,511
Renter's insurance doesn't
replace your stuff with

54
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:51,140
much better stuff that you
couldn't otherwise afford.

55
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,431
Your auto insurance doesn't give you a new
Ferrari you could never afford if you

56
00:03:55,431 --> 00:03:56,336
tow your Chevy.

57
00:03:56,336 --> 00:04:00,543
Of course, health insurance protects
against financial risk associated with

58
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:04,998
care you would get even if you didn't have
insurance, but it also improves access to

59
00:04:04,998 --> 00:04:09,440
care, even care that may be
unaffordable to you without insurance.

60
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,927
You might want health insurance to
cover organ transplantation and

61
00:04:12,927 --> 00:04:17,025
be willing to pay enough premiums to
include that coverage even if you couldn't

62
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:18,751
otherwise afford a transplant.

63
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,846
The second way in which health insurance
is weird is that we don't seem to have

64
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:27,912
a problem with higher risk people
paying higher premiums for

65
00:04:27,912 --> 00:04:30,240
most other types of insurance.

66
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,736
Such risk rating is not generally
controversial for homeowners' insurance,

67
00:04:34,736 --> 00:04:37,940
car insurance or even life insurance.

68
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,395
People with sports cars and
bad driving records,

69
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:45,140
paying more than people with many vans and
good records just feels right to us.

70
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,972
People with houses on the beach
subject to hurricane risk

71
00:04:47,972 --> 00:04:51,540
paying more than those with
inland houses feels right.

72
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,026
Asking a 60 year old life insurance
applicant to pay more than

73
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:57,540
25 year old feels right.

74
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,712
However, asking a person with cancer to
pay more for health insurance than someone

75
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:05,640
without a preexisting condition
somehow feels different.

76
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,591
Premium protection for those with
preexisting conditions has remained

77
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:13,938
the most popular feature of the Affordable
Care Act since the day it was passed.

78
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:17,288
One often hears something like quote,
the healthy paying for

79
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:21,040
the sick is the point of health insurance,
end quote.

80
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,359
I've never heard anyone say that, quote,
safe drivers with minivans paying for

81
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:28,561
bad drivers with sports cars is
the point of auto insurance.

82
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,457
Several possible factors might
explain the popularity of preexisting

83
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:36,440
conditions protections.

84
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,768
First, many conditions are out
of the person's control, so

85
00:05:39,768 --> 00:05:42,651
high premiums are themselves
partly a random event.

86
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,915
Annual insurance contracts leave people
at financial risk of being reclassified

87
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:52,675
if new chronic condition
diagnosis raises future premiums.

88
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:57,087
In principle, this could also be
solved by longer term contracts.

89
00:05:57,087 --> 00:06:01,323
Tying insurance to employment mimics
that sort of long term contract,

90
00:06:01,323 --> 00:06:04,217
but still leaves us at risk
of loss of coverage and

91
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:08,640
protection from reclassification
if we have to leave our jobs.

92
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,057
Finally, we may want others
to be able to access care and

93
00:06:12,057 --> 00:06:15,561
may view high premiums as
a major barrier to that access.

94
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,140
Health insurance markets will have to
deal with several complicating factors.

95
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,440
The first is known as moral hazard.

96
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,480
By reducing the price of care faced
by patients, insurance encourages

97
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,202
the consumption of extra care,
even if that care is of low value.

98
00:06:32,202 --> 00:06:35,513
Insurers must develop mechanisms
to limit world hazard or

99
00:06:35,513 --> 00:06:38,640
charge premiums high enough to pay for it.

100
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,140
The second problem is adverse selection.

101
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,445
If people have private information
about their health risks,

102
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,872
those at higher risk would probably
be more likely to buy policies

103
00:06:47,872 --> 00:06:50,761
leaving insurers with
an expensive set of enrollees.

104
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,780
Most health risks like heart attacks,
strokes and

105
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,540
cancers are independent across
enrollees or nearly so.

106
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,651
However, contagious diseases are by
definition correlated across people.

107
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,622
Another issue in the design of health
insurance is whether people make good

108
00:07:08,622 --> 00:07:13,246
health care decisions, particularly when
faced with out of pocket costs for care.

109
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:14,653
Both lack of information and

110
00:07:14,653 --> 00:07:18,540
decision making biases could
contribute to bad decisions.

111
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,325
We'll consider these complicating
factors in other videos.

112
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:27,008
Summarizing the key points in this video,
risk aversion leads to a dislike

113
00:07:27,008 --> 00:07:31,930
of situations randomly varying outcomes,
creating a demand for insurance.

114
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,563
Relative to other types of insurance,
health insurance has several

115
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:39,887
distinguishing features and the structure
of health insurance creates problems

116
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:43,161
that both private policies and
governments try to mitigate.
