1
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,100
After watching this video,

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,160
you will be able to
conduct a paired t-test on

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,300
matched data by using the
PAIRED statement in PROC TTEST.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,210
We keep moving in
our algorithm and

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,210
we're now into
continuous predictors.

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,460
In this video, we will focus on

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,370
normally distributed
variables, and therefore,

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,415
we will do the equivalent of
a t-test for matched data,

9
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:35,625
which is a paired t-tests
as highlighted here.

10
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:39,125
Remember our example from
the last video, once more,

11
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:42,590
this is a match case-control
study in which cases of

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,870
myocardial infarction
are matched to controls

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,560
by age, sex, and county.

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,435
There is one matching ID
that identifies that.

15
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:54,900
Therefore, our outcome
is MI, yes/no.

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,060
For this example, our exposure

17
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,270
is going to be physical activity.

18
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,995
It's called TMETS in our dataset.

19
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,260
That stands for Total METS.

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,380
We have measure physical activity

21
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,645
in METS or metabolic equivalents,

22
00:01:08,645 --> 00:01:10,310
which is a standard
way of measuring

23
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,085
physical activity in
epidemiologic studies.

24
00:01:13,085 --> 00:01:16,265
This variable reflects a
gradient in physical activity,

25
00:01:16,265 --> 00:01:17,340
the higher your METS,

26
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,460
the more vigorous physical
activity you will do.

27
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,790
Our hypothesis is that
physical activity

28
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,705
will be inversely
associated to MI.

29
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:28,680
So remember this live
on a previous video.

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,070
Every time you have a
continuous variable,

31
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,340
you do have to check
if it's normal or not,

32
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,190
regardless of the data
will match or not.

33
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,220
Now for the purposes of
this and the next video,

34
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,620
I'm not going to do it
for physical activity,

35
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,220
and I'm going to use a
variable for both tests.

36
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,555
The one for normally
distributed data

37
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:50,030
and the one for non-normally
distributed data,

38
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,505
because that will
have me to illustrate

39
00:01:52,505 --> 00:01:54,365
an important point about

40
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:57,305
choosing the correct
statistical test.

41
00:01:57,305 --> 00:02:00,140
You can use the same code that we

42
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,750
used before to get a
paired dataset in which

43
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,690
each observation is
a pair of case and

44
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,129
control with their corresponding

45
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:09,100
physical activity information.

46
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,885
TMETS for cases and
TMETS for controls.

47
00:02:12,885 --> 00:02:15,290
Note that, of course,
you don't have to

48
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,480
run this code every
time you want to

49
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,320
transpose one variable and
you could do as I show

50
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,330
on the right for as many
variables as you want.

51
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,425
In this case, I'm doing it for

52
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:28,470
smoking and physical
activity at the same time,

53
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,925
but you can do as
many as you want.

54
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:34,030
In our example, we're
going to use MI as

55
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,310
our outcome and physical
activity as our exposure.

56
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,639
Assuming that physical activity
is normally distributed,

57
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,890
we will conduct a paired t-test.

58
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,990
In order to conduct
a paired t-test,

59
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,700
we'll use PROC t-test,

60
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,265
but on the paired dataset,

61
00:02:49,265 --> 00:02:51,440
same as we did for the McNemar.

62
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,595
You use the PAIRED statement
in this situation.

63
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:57,710
What SaaS is doing here,

64
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,870
is calculating the
mean difference

65
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,835
between cases and controls,

66
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:04,165
and here you get
your paired t-test.

67
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:06,365
As you can see,
with this p-value,

68
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:08,630
we will fail to reject the null.

69
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,670
Since the physical activity is

70
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,085
not associated with
myocardial infarction,

71
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:15,350
we will talk about
reasons for the later

72
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,005
since that seems a little
counter-intuitive.

73
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:20,450
SaaS is going to be
the also a bunch of

74
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,285
plot after this output
that you can ignore.

75
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:26,410
Finally, same as it happened
with the McNemar test,

76
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,320
you don't get the description of

77
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,640
physical activity by MIS
status in this output.

78
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,990
So you will have to run

79
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,875
PROC MEANS in the
non-transposed dataset.

80
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,800
If we run PROC MEANS in

81
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,365
our non-transposed
dataset, temp.mi,

82
00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:44,375
I will get the means and
the standard deviations

83
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,780
of physical activity
in cases and controls.

84
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,190
In this case, we have

85
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,540
a slightly higher physical
activity controls than cases,

86
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,710
but that difference was

87
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,200
clearly not statistically
significant.

88
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,660
Since we know that
physical activity is

89
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,465
a well-known protective
factor for MI,

90
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:04,790
we have to wonder
about reasons for not

91
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,570
finding that different
significant.

92
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,080
The most reasonable ones are

93
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,580
measurement error since

94
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,160
physical activity
is self-reported,

95
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,700
and there is also
potential for recall bias

96
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,705
too among many other biases.

97
00:04:19,705 --> 00:04:21,740
This will be the means and

98
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,010
standard deviations that you
will report in your Table 1,

99
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,130
but the p-value of the
comparison will come from

100
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,080
the paired t-test that we just
run in the previous slide.

101
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,130
In summary, in this video,

102
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,380
we'll learn how to conduct
a paired t-test on

103
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,980
matched data by using the
PAIRED statement in PROC TTEST.

104
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,190
In the next video, we will
continue with tests for

105
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,050
matched data for non-normally

106
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,747
distributed continuous variables.
