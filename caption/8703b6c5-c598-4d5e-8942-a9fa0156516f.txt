1
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:10,685
Many of you will be lucky enough to become either appointed

2
00:00:10,685 --> 00:00:15,650
public health officials or elected politicians.

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,690
But most of you will serve in position

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,680
where what you will be doing is analyzing policy.

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,720
What I wanna cover right now is basics of policy analysis.

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,200
What is it, how does it function, why is it important for you.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,828
To begin, we have to define what policy analysis is.

8
00:00:39,828 --> 00:00:43,139
And there's several different definition, and

9
00:00:43,139 --> 00:00:47,188
I think three of them in particular are worth talking about.

10
00:00:47,188 --> 00:00:52,090
One is Walker's definition, the policy analysis is

11
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,120
a systematic approach to assist policymakers in choosing a course

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,520
of action from among complex alternatives under uncertain conditions.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,690
Welmer and Vining define it as client-oriented advice relevant

14
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,810
to public decisions and informed by social values.

15
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:20,060
Aaron Wildavsky simply said it's speaking truth to power.

16
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,190
We're going to spend most of our time really unpacking Walker's definition,

17
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:31,970
because most public health practitioners are forced to make trade-offs among

18
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:37,830
various alternatives that operate under conditions of uncertainty,

19
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,000
where there's not necessarily any clear answers.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,600
To be sure, Weimer and Vining's note that your decision will be

21
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,160
informed by social values, it's important to keep in mind.

22
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,920
And inevitably, Wildavsky has write that

23
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,966
you are speaking the truth to power even though you may not be doing so

24
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:06,170
in an aggressive or direct confrontational manner.

25
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,565
Policy analysis is both art and science.

26
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:15,300
It's an art because there are techniques that you can use and

27
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,770
develop and practise to become better at it.

28
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,050
But science is uncertain.

29
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,990
You’re rarely going to have clear answers.

30
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,430
An exception to that, would be tobacco control.

31
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,669
We know that tobacco causes cancer and

32
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:40,280
other serious diseases, respiratory, heart, etc.

33
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,480
But for the most part, you won’t have that clear causal connection.

34
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,030
You'll be dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty.

35
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:57,430
Hence policy analysis relies on many analytical methods and data sources.

36
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:03,095
What you really face is the problem of not having enough data and

37
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:06,325
not having the resources to collect the data.

38
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:14,165
As we just alluded to, there are certain values that underlie policy analysis, and

39
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:19,720
you should try to think of all of these when you're conducting an analysis.

40
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,030
The first is maximizing war as an economist

41
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,100
say its satisficing economic efficiency.

42
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:34,630
Satisficing simply mean your often forced to take the second best option,

43
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:40,110
if the primary option isn't available for whatever reason.

44
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,040
You need to take a comprehensive view of what the consequences are.

45
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,180
Given the value serving a community, are you meeting those in

46
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:56,250
your policy analysis of the particular policy that you'd like to build.

47
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,000
What are the alternatives?

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,380
Whenever you’re thinking about policy analysis,

49
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,060
you need to think about the options and alternatives.

50
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,150
Every policy maker wants to know, what my options are.

51
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,910
And what the rational would be for

52
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,780
selecting the one that you're recommending.

53
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,620
And finally, what are the cost and benefits of each option?

54
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,500
At one time public health could operate at the level of the moral high

55
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:30,738
ground without worrying about determining the costs and benefits of each option.

56
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:33,346
I'm afraid those days are gone.

57
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:38,284
And politicians are now demanding that you provide them with costs and

58
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:40,131
benefits of each option.

59
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:45,750
And really that's what policy analysis is designed to do.

60
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,230
So what are the key objectives?

61
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,546
And if you think back to our discussion of the policy process,

62
00:04:52,546 --> 00:04:54,790
that's really where we start.

63
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,830
You have to define and redefine the problem.

64
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,370
Now, that sounds easy enough.

65
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:07,400
The problem is too many kids start smoking, okay that's fine.

66
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,990
But then what are some of the sub questions you have to ask?

67
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,860
What's the right age?

68
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:22,890
If we wanna say 21, how do you justify sending kids off to buy more at age 18?

69
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:28,060
But not being able to smoke tobacco, if you want to legalize marijuana,

70
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,260
you can say, the problem is that we put

71
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,520
too many people in jail for non-violent offenses.

72
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,480
But then you have to ask, what are the implications for

73
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,970
highschool students or even younger if we legalize marijuana.

74
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,320
So the fining and

75
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:54,530
redefining the problem is much more complicated than it seems at first.

76
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,320
Second, you have to look for alternatives.

77
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,397
It's an iterative process to help strengthen decision-making.

78
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:12,586
In particular, you have to think about the alternatives and the trade-offs.

79
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:17,990
For example, if you have limited resources, how do you choose between

80
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:24,330
investing in, let's say, maternal and child health care, or HIV prevention.

81
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:32,120
Or, for the long-term, obesity versus the short-term of opioid addiction.

82
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,520
Third, define what you don't know and need to know.

83
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,820
Basically, this is about data.

84
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,017
What can the data you already have tell you?

85
00:06:42,017 --> 00:06:46,625
And what data do you need to know to address the particular

86
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,890
problem that you want?

87
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,060
Again, take the opioids as an example,

88
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,326
we have to know whether this is an decision driven problem.

89
00:06:56,326 --> 00:07:04,220
A pharmaceutical manufacturer-driven problem, a pain medication problem.

90
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,508
What's the source, what do we know, what additional data do you need to know?

91
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:13,751
Fourth, what barriers can you anticipate when

92
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:19,264
you try to build the policy and then implement it?

93
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:21,705
Remember in the policy process,

94
00:07:21,705 --> 00:07:27,300
that we talked about the need to think about implementation upfront.

95
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,410
To do that, you need to consider the relationship

96
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,960
between the solutions you're proposing, and the potential barriers.

97
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,380
Finally, you must evaluate in policy assessment

98
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:48,120
process once the policy has gone into effect.

99
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,040
What went right?

100
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,150
What went wrong?

101
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,550
What didn't work?

102
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,620
Why was this policy not implemented or

103
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,920
developed in the way that you though it would?

104
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,678
Did you not anticipate the right barriers?

105
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:08,380
Were the resources you thought might be available not available in the end?

106
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,820
That evaluation is essential to how you think about the next

107
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:21,100
policy or even making changes to the policy you just developed.

108
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:27,190
So we might also think about what the policy analyst's role is.

109
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,060
Well for one thing,

110
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,420
you wanna use policy analysis to get your issue on the policy agenda.

111
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:39,770
You can use analysis to raise the importance, the salience,

112
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:45,130
and potential resonance of the problem that you think needs to be addressed.

113
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,750
Second, it helps advocates facilitate better decision making.

114
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:56,750
If you provide good analytical results, both the advocates and

115
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:02,530
the decision makers will be in a better position to implement these ideas.

116
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:07,020
Third, policy analysts are entrepreneurs for ideas.

117
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,140
If you've got a good idea,

118
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,560
public health policy maker that maybe people haven't thought about before.

119
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:19,940
Floating the idea is great, but providing a detailed analysis of it is even better.

120
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,850
And finally, you can use that analysis to educate either the client

121
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:31,570
or more importantly if you're in an a health department, the public.

122
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,720
The public will understand it better if you've done a thorough,

123
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,380
comprehensive analysis that takes the community

124
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,030
through why there's a problem, how you defined it?

125
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:51,810
How you're going to address it, why the benefits outweigh the costs.

126
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,061
That's the role in the policy analyst.
