1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,785
Today, we're gonna introduce you to the core skill of motivational interviewing,

2
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:17,249
reflective listening.

3
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:20,698
Today, we're gonna define reflective listening,

4
00:00:20,698 --> 00:00:25,459
understand its key elements and describe the benefits of this strategy.

5
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:30,877
So first of all, reflective statements go down at the end, not up.

6
00:00:30,877 --> 00:00:32,947
If you go up, it becomes a question.

7
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:36,897
For example, you're upset with him.

8
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:40,685
That is not a reflective statement, that's a question.

9
00:00:40,685 --> 00:00:43,114
Instead, you're upset with him.

10
00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:45,139
When you go down, firmly down,

11
00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:50,080
you communicate something quite differently than when you go up.

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,477
Deeper reflective statements are actually hypothesis testing.

13
00:00:53,477 --> 00:00:57,964
I'm gonna give you my best guess for how I think you feel about this or

14
00:00:57,964 --> 00:01:02,475
how you got to this point in your life or where you're going with it.

15
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:06,527
Don't worry if you get it wrong, the patient will simply correct you and

16
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:09,397
say no no, no, doc, it's not that, it's this.

17
00:01:09,397 --> 00:01:14,304
Reflective responses affirm and validate the person, and they wanna keep talking.

18
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:19,646
They wanna even correct you vehemently, so you understand them better.

19
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,914
Now, how do you construct reflections?

20
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:25,517
On the left is the long form, we call them baby reflections.

21
00:01:25,517 --> 00:01:29,416
On the right is the short form, more advanced reflections.

22
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:32,282
So on the left you see clauses like, it sounds like so

23
00:01:32,282 --> 00:01:35,489
you're saying correct me if I'm wrong, those are fine.

24
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:38,559
But what the patients really hearing is the you word.

25
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:42,093
So as you get more comfortable, just jump to the you-word, and

26
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:45,047
you won't actually need those additional clauses.

27
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:48,855
But for now, as you're just beginning your MI journey, use them.

28
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:54,908
They can be wonderful crutches, wonderful learning aids, wonderful mnemonics.

29
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:57,880
As I started to mention a few slides ago,

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,700
reflective responses carry a lot of very powerful information.

31
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,878
I am listening to you and trying to follow your story and understand you.

32
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:10,346
It also implicitly conveys that I accept you, and

33
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:13,823
I'm not trying to judge you or push you to change.

34
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:19,064
All of this together establishes rapport and comforts the afflicted.

35
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:24,055
Now, let's take a look at a goofy clip that shows you

36
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:28,041
what happens when you go up at the end.

37
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,677
I'll talk to you on the other side.

38
00:02:30,677 --> 00:02:32,511
>> [APPLAUSE] >> I'm aware that as Australians,

39
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:34,739
we do have the most annoying accent on the planet.

40
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,543
>> [LAUGH] >> I'm sure you're aware of what we

41
00:02:36,543 --> 00:02:39,615
all do if you're here, where we all go up at the end of every sentence.

42
00:02:39,615 --> 00:02:42,047
>> [LAUGH] >> Because we're all too insecure to

43
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:43,781
actually make a statement.

44
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:44,384
>> [LAUGH] >> So

45
00:02:44,384 --> 00:02:47,315
we have to make it sound like it's a question.

46
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:49,950
>> [LAUGH] >> Because we secretly need your approval.

47
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,950
>> [LAUGH] >> Even when it's something serious.

48
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,822
>> [LAUGH] >> Since he got eaten by a shark.

49
00:02:53,822 --> 00:02:57,644
>> [LAUGH] I'm afraid you're going to be high court judges in 30 years time handing

50
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,439
down verdicts.

51
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,706
Just going, I find you guilty of murder.

52
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:02,348
>> [LAUGH] You know what we do here in Australia.

53
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:02,848
I didn't realize until we went overseas, we ask questions that don't need

54
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:12,056
answering, how nice it was the weather today. >> [LAUGH]

55
00:03:12,056 --> 00:03:13,176
>> I didn't know we

56
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:16,803
didn't until I got to England. I was with a group of English people.

57
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:17,667
[LAUGH] I just went,

58
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:22,493
how heavy is that rain? [LAUGH] Just looked

59
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,042
at me. >> [LAUGH]

60
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:27,563
>> Really heavy.

61
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:31,639
[LAUGH] I think Jesus might have been

62
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,921
an Australian. I think maybe Jesus was a nosy, and

63
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:37,554
we've just been reading his scriptures with the wrong inflection.

64
00:03:37,554 --> 00:03:40,491
Maybe Jesus walked out to the servant on

65
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:44,500
the mountain, just went, how blessed are the meek.

66
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,102
>> [LAUGH]

67
00:03:45,102 --> 00:03:47,788
>> So what this comedian, Adam Hill,

68
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:51,737
has shown you, is that up talk conveys insecurity.

69
00:03:51,737 --> 00:03:53,879
Up talk makes you question whether or

70
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:57,830
not you should be thinking that are you have the right to think that.

71
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,107
So we're gonna be very careful

72
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:03,398
to go down at the end with our reflections.

73
00:04:03,398 --> 00:04:08,271
Let's just compare a little bit the impact of a question versus reflection.

74
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:12,639
How well do you think people understand you when we described open-ended

75
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,161
questions in a prior lesson, we would score this in a plus,

76
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:18,568
that's a great open-ended question.

77
00:04:18,568 --> 00:04:22,919
But let's compare that to a more empathetic, reflective statement.

78
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,022
You're feeling, nobody understands you.

79
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:27,539
Which one of these?

80
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:31,550
The question of the reflection better captures, I'm listening, I get you,

81
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,447
I'm tracking, I don't judge you.

82
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:38,167
Hopefully, you can clearly see, it's the reflective statement on the bottom that

83
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,705
better conveys empathy and understanding.

84
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:42,254
Let's look at another one.

85
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:44,965
You're having a conversation, it's clearly emotional.

86
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:48,869
You can see the emotion in the person's face, and you ask an open question,

87
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:50,277
how did that make you feel?

88
00:04:50,277 --> 00:04:52,525
Instead of motivational interviewing,

89
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:56,772
we would recommend you reflect it back your best guess for how they would feel.

90
00:04:56,772 --> 00:04:58,501
You seem to be really sad about that.

91
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:02,799
Again, I hope you can see that it is the reflection of better conveys empathy and

92
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:06,077
understanding than even a good open question.

93
00:05:06,077 --> 00:05:10,713
So one of the epiphanies that most people when they're learning MI have to

94
00:05:10,713 --> 00:05:15,067
experience is well, I need to ask questions to gather information.

95
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:18,829
Well, you'll find, you'll actually get the information faster and

96
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:20,967
deeper through reflective responses.

97
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:24,557
Now, having said that there's a time and place for questions,

98
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:28,162
there is some content for which the question is more efficient.

99
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:30,652
Here's just five examples, an amount.

100
00:05:30,652 --> 00:05:33,278
How often do you do something, a number?

101
00:05:33,278 --> 00:05:35,131
How many kids were there in your home?

102
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:36,669
A frequency, duration, or date?

103
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:41,531
When you're looking for a very specific, quantifiable information,

104
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:43,450
absolutely use a question.

105
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,106
But that's a pretty small sliver of your counseling

106
00:05:47,106 --> 00:05:51,768
encounters often in the phase one, remember that explore phase.

107
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:57,685
Other than that, we're going to rely largely on reflections.

108
00:05:57,685 --> 00:06:01,383
Now, let's take a look at a lay person, in this case Ray Romano,

109
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:05,700
using some very effective reflections with both his daughter and his wife.

110
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,103
To set the clip up, he and his wife had taken a parent communication skills

111
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:15,002
training course, and he just got back from talking with his parents where he found

112
00:06:15,002 --> 00:06:17,364
the reflections were very effective.

113
00:06:17,364 --> 00:06:19,848
Now, he enters the room and his wife and

114
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:23,470
his child are having a little argument about something.

115
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,565
I'll see you on the other side.

116
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:28,204
[SOUND] Debbie, you can't believe this.

117
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:29,986
>> Why did you do this, Ellie?

118
00:06:29,986 --> 00:06:31,795
This is terrible.

119
00:06:31,795 --> 00:06:32,614
>> Great.

120
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:35,615
>> [LAUGH] >> This is Michael's giraffe.

121
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:37,738
>> [LAUGH] He's crying now.

122
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:39,424
Why did you do this?

123
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:41,821
>> Cause. >> Cause is not an answer.

124
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:42,973
Active listening.

125
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:44,517
>> Ray, that doesn't work.

126
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:45,279
>> It works.

127
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,910
I just used on the worst kids in the neighborhood.

128
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,931
>> [LAUGH] >> Would you this?

129
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:49,539
Look at this?

130
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:50,339
Look what she did.

131
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:51,526
>> Try it. Try it.

132
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:52,042
>> Ray.

133
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:52,963
You want me to do it?

134
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:54,372
>> No, no, no.

135
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:59,877
Okay, Ellie, let's talk about what you did.

136
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,415
>> I don't wanna talk.

137
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:03,842
>> Are you feeling angry?

138
00:07:03,842 --> 00:07:05,573
>> Reflect back.

139
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:08,744
>> [LAUGH] >> You're angry?

140
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:09,552
>> Yes.

141
00:07:09,552 --> 00:07:10,219
>> Okay.

142
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:14,276
But it's not okay to rip up toys when we're angry.

143
00:07:14,276 --> 00:07:16,036
>> Judgmental.

144
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,026
>> [LAUGH] >> [SOUND]

145
00:07:18,026 --> 00:07:20,571
>> You are angry.

146
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:26,854
>> Because it used to be your toy.

147
00:07:26,854 --> 00:07:28,297
>> Yes.

148
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:33,277
>> [LAUGH] >> I see.

149
00:07:33,277 --> 00:07:33,992
I see.

150
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:38,090
You think that mommy and daddy paid too much attention to Michael and Geoffrey.

151
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,669
>> Okay, I was handling this.

152
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:41,070
>> They get everything.

153
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,770
>> Right, and you're upset because we gave them your old giraffe.

154
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,300
>> I still liked it.

155
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,957
>> But you weren't playing with it.

156
00:07:48,957 --> 00:07:53,400
>> But that doesn't matter though because it was still yours, and

157
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,266
you're mad because we gave it to Michael without asking you, right?

158
00:07:58,266 --> 00:08:00,750
>> Right.

159
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:08,174
>> Well, mommy and daddy made a mistake and everybody makes mistakes, right?

160
00:08:08,174 --> 00:08:08,744
Mommy.

161
00:08:08,744 --> 00:08:09,530
>> Yes, yes.

162
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,519
>> [LAUGH] >> Do you feel better now, Ellie?

163
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,514
>> Yes. Can I have a giraffe?

164
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:16,071
>> It's broken, honey.

165
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:16,702
>> I know.

166
00:08:16,702 --> 00:08:22,342
>> I wanna try to fix it for Michael.

167
00:08:22,342 --> 00:08:27,576
>> [LAUGH] >> Thank you, doll.

168
00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:32,667
>> See what I did there.

169
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:33,548
>> Yeah.

170
00:08:33,548 --> 00:08:35,339
I can't believe it.

171
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,873
It's pretty amazing you did it.

172
00:08:39,873 --> 00:08:44,278
Anything else you need taken care of while I'm around here.

173
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:45,764
>> No. >> [LAUGH]

174
00:08:45,764 --> 00:08:46,535
>> What?

175
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:47,472
What's the matter?

176
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:50,201
Nothing with you, obviously.

177
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:52,349
>> [LAUGH] >> Don't go by me.

178
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:55,072
I'm a natural.

179
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:59,602
>> [LAUGH] >> You are so proud of yourself.

180
00:08:59,602 --> 00:09:04,323
Listen, if I hadn't dragged you to that stupid class,

181
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:08,949
you'd still be standing there going, hey, no, TV.

182
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:13,688
You're feeling inadequate because I mastered it before you.

183
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:17,373
>> Don't give me that active listening crap,

184
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:20,470
where do you get off listening to me?

185
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,370
>> [LAUGH] >> Never happen again.

186
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,385
>> [LAUGH] [MUSIC]

187
00:09:25,385 --> 00:09:28,980
>> So what did you see here?

188
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,364
You saw some very high-end reflective skills from Ray,

189
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,562
both with his daughter and his wife.

190
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:38,570
With his daughter, when he allowed her to drain the swamp.

191
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,927
When he allowed her to express her sense of unfairness, her swamp was drained, and

192
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:45,740
she naturally gravitated for doing the right thing.

193
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,559
In this case, fixing the doll for Michael.

194
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,195
One of the core principles of MI is that if we can simply get the crowd out of

195
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:58,085
the way, get that resistance out of the way.

196
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:06,765
People will naturally start to gravitate towards the productive behavior.

197
00:10:06,765 --> 00:10:09,489
Nothing more I can say.

198
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:12,215
Well, that's our introduction to reflective listening.

199
00:10:12,215 --> 00:10:16,739
We've defined it for you, showing you a few people doing it, and set us up for

200
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:21,542
the next part, where we're gonna explore the different types of reflections and

201
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:26,626
ultimately how to use this in your clinical practice.
