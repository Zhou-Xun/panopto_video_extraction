1
00:00:00,468 --> 00:00:08,358
In this module, we're going to be talking about building capacity. Within ourselves to do big and difficult things.

2
00:00:08,358 --> 00:00:15,468
And this is kind of demystifying what it means to be a high achiever.

3
00:00:15,468 --> 00:00:24,458
Over the course of your life. And over the course of your career. And even doing big and difficult things in your personal life.

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:33,488
So what I want you to think about here is that it's a process. We're going to kind of like do the pinus scenes on the idea.

5
00:00:33,488 --> 00:00:36,918
So people we see people often be wildly successful. How do they do it?

6
00:00:36,918 --> 00:00:43,398
And why am I not doing it when really there's an internal process behind the scenes?

7
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:48,308
Often you're having to do things a lot and sometimes get negative feedback or not a lot of feedback.

8
00:00:48,308 --> 00:00:52,608
You're also making mistakes and having it feel like failures along the way.

9
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:57,278
This message doesn't go straight up like this. It's kind of all over the place.

10
00:00:57,278 --> 00:01:02,088
Right. And we want to be able to take care of ourselves, be back and know that we're not off track.

11
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:13,178
It's sometimes a bumpy road. So this information comes from Bernie Brown's work, his multiple books out there.

12
00:01:13,178 --> 00:01:21,068
But I mean, are we referring mostly to the content from her book, Daring Greatly and Rising Strong in those those curriculum?

13
00:01:21,068 --> 00:01:27,818
So we're going to actually start at the top. And he uses this metaphor of being in the arena.

14
00:01:27,818 --> 00:01:33,818
So any time in life that you decide, okay, I'm gonna do this big and scary thing.

15
00:01:33,818 --> 00:01:40,508
It's like kind of like walking into this arena and she is kind of like the Coliseum and this idea of gladiators.

16
00:01:40,508 --> 00:01:46,418
I think almost like if you think about a big concert hall where basketball arena is anywhere where you would be,

17
00:01:46,418 --> 00:01:52,078
where it just feels like there's a lot you have to show up. And do this big thing.

18
00:01:52,078 --> 00:02:02,268
So think about what this has been like for you in the past and your past arena is maybe like college during a big speech.

19
00:02:02,268 --> 00:02:04,458
And sometimes it's just something like speaking up for yourself,

20
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:10,958
innocent or being vulnerable and telling somebody for the first time that you love them.

21
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:14,978
There's so many different things that a feeling when you're like this is exciting to me.

22
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:21,368
I want to do it. It matters. But it takes my breath away a little bit because it is a little bit scary.

23
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:26,968
We talked about that at risk monuments.

24
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:28,658
So hopefully in life,

25
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:36,668
there'll be lots of moments where you decide that there's this big thing that I want to do that matters and I'm gonna go ahead and get in the arena.

26
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:43,128
Now, when we get ready to do that, there's some important prep work. So one,

27
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:49,448
Briney talks about writing ourselves permission slips and literally sometimes you use one like this on a sticky note somewhere where you can

28
00:02:49,448 --> 00:03:00,758
see it near your workspace folder and you want to give yourself permission as you're giving a lot of energy towards doing this big thing,

29
00:03:00,758 --> 00:03:06,848
to let some other things go, to be nice to yourself, that you remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes like this.

30
00:03:06,848 --> 00:03:10,998
Those little self-closing notes. Sometimes we need to literally write them on a permission slip.

31
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:18,978
Tourism. We want to be aware that as we move into this space, the vulnerability and shame are likely to be there.

32
00:03:18,978 --> 00:03:26,948
And it's OK, just got to kind of weather them. We want to know who are the people who are going to really support us, if possible,

33
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:32,588
through this friend who believe in us, who see us, our strength and our weakness, that we can be prepared.

34
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:38,508
We'll talk more about this to listen for their voices when we're going through our highs and lows.

35
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:45,608
And we want to know what our values are, so, again, be that exercise that you have available where you can identify your values.

36
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:51,658
What are two things that are really important to me that are going to take me through this?

37
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:58,038
Time still, one of them might be serviced like a thing that I'm doing is preparing me to show up and

38
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:06,208
serve in ways that matter for me or my perseverance is going to really help me through this.

39
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:15,468
My confidence is really going to help me through this. My commitment, you know, look at those kind of figure out worth a few things.

40
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:20,558
For some people, it might be faith that are going to guide you as you move through.

41
00:04:20,558 --> 00:04:30,178
Arena is that when you have the moments where you're like. This is hard and you can kind of hold onto those those values to orient you to help.

42
00:04:30,178 --> 00:04:34,678
Those are kind of. It's kind of like, know, you're kind of gearing up.

43
00:04:34,678 --> 00:04:39,768
To go into the arena now, an important moment, no doubt, right here.

44
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:44,868
First, this is the hand on the door moment. So again.

45
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:51,198
If you're leaving their locker room to go into an arena, leaving the green room or arena or in like a Coliseum,

46
00:04:51,198 --> 00:04:57,658
getting ready to go in, there's this moment that you put your hand to the door right before you're about to go in.

47
00:04:57,658 --> 00:05:02,338
Often this is a moment anxiety spikes and self-doubt spikes.

48
00:05:02,338 --> 00:05:05,858
Sometimes change spikes. It's kind of like who do you think you are to do this?

49
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:11,368
You're not good enough. Because I think part of it is that it's our body.

50
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:18,578
We're saying you can still run. It's it's it's kind of freaking out a little bit about all the things that go wrong.

51
00:05:18,578 --> 00:05:24,298
And if you know that that's coming, you'll be prepared for that rush and you'll just say you're totally OK.

52
00:05:24,298 --> 00:05:31,278
I know those voices. They are here to help me. They don't want me to experience scary things.

53
00:05:31,278 --> 00:05:35,858
I'm actually prepared for this and I'm going to go forward because it's worth it.

54
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:39,848
So just knowing that when those voices come up that they're not actually a sign that you're doing something wrong,

55
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:47,598
that you can't wait now time to kind of reckoning or do some deep breathing and grounding.

56
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:53,608
But no, that that's a moment that comes up any time you get ready to do some.

57
00:05:53,608 --> 00:06:01,618
The next piece of business is focusing on our support section section, and I want to show you an image that will help make.

58
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:07,768
When you walk into your arena, there's going to be lots of different voices that come up.

59
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:13,388
And it's really important kind of where you focus.

60
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:17,748
Because it's going to determine how you feel inside and how you're able to code yourself.

61
00:06:17,748 --> 00:06:25,798
So Rene breaks it down into these four different categories of places that you kind of look in the arena and I'll explain them.

62
00:06:25,798 --> 00:06:29,808
The cheap seats is just anybody and everybody with an opinion.

63
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:34,418
And it's important to know that if you do anything, anything, anything in life.

64
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:40,348
We'll look small. You're going to have critics. You're going to have haters.

65
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:46,218
There's even. Especially now in social media. Everybody has a microphone. Everybody has an opinion.

66
00:06:46,218 --> 00:06:52,218
And so just knowing that there's going to be people who have things to say about how bad you are.

67
00:06:52,218 --> 00:07:04,778
And a lot of times they don't particularly. Matter for your success sometime, these people aren't even experts in your field or, you know,

68
00:07:04,778 --> 00:07:10,878
again, they just have an opinion, sometimes they may be really competitive or envious.

69
00:07:10,878 --> 00:07:17,238
But one of the things to keep in mind is, you know, if they don't share my value system, if they're not in my inner circle,

70
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:24,118
if they're not out here trying to dare greatly inferior other people on, and they're probably not trustworthy, supportive information.

71
00:07:24,118 --> 00:07:30,448
So we want to. Just kind of like the comment sections on social media.

72
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:36,038
They're not worth taking to heart. We're spending a lot of time, roughly.

73
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:41,998
The critics section can be kind of similar, but different, so this is often voices that are close to us that matter to us.

74
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:46,748
So this could be a professor. This could be a parent. This could be a good friend.

75
00:07:46,748 --> 00:07:53,668
It's also the voice inside our own head. And what's key here is that these are usually voices at.

76
00:07:53,668 --> 00:07:57,748
Emphasized scarcity. So kind of like there's not that many thought.

77
00:07:57,748 --> 00:08:02,758
I don't think you'll make it. You probably shouldn't try. Maybe you're too old.

78
00:08:02,758 --> 00:08:08,348
Maybe you're too young. They compare you to others.

79
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:11,038
May, Jamie, make you not feel not good enough?

80
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:20,798
This can be well-intentioned people around this or this can be your own internal voice and we want to be able to this voice get activated.

81
00:08:20,798 --> 00:08:27,038
Three comment down and shift our focus is.

82
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:37,328
The last one is really important for us to understand is the box seats. So this is basically where all of the power structures lie.

83
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:42,838
And a lot of the power structures are based.

84
00:08:42,838 --> 00:08:54,748
On things like patriarchy or racism and xenophobia, homophobia, I mean, just all of the isms.

85
00:08:54,748 --> 00:09:02,358
Sexism. And so. We want to know when the voices come up that you're not good enough because you

86
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:08,088
don't look like because you're not a part of this group because your first has.

87
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:14,068
We want to know that those are also not voices that we want to listen to.

88
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:19,598
They're there. We've got to acknowledge it exists. All of these spaces, unfortunately.

89
00:09:19,598 --> 00:09:25,428
And until we're able to eradicate and break down those barriers, we want to know that when we step into the arena,

90
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:36,088
when we hear those voices, but they're not going to be where we focus. They're not true and they don't help us get where we're going.

91
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:45,918
So the place we want to focus the most. Is on the support section, though, there's only a few seats like the VIP section, and it's kind of like,

92
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:50,498
you know, when we see on TV or if we've had the experience of being at a basketball game or something.

93
00:09:50,498 --> 00:09:59,178
And there that one mom. This is really loud and cheering. For dad, that's kind of the voice that we want to listen to.

94
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:08,358
Empathy is that people in our squad who see us, who will cheer for us, whether we get the position or don't.

95
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:12,258
But they value us, they see our strengths and our weaknesses, and they are in our corner.

96
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:20,838
They're going to tell us that. Give us honest feedback when I need to. You're always going to ideas towards the things that matter to us.

97
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:28,278
With something valuing and then as we've talked about before, the self-taught section, self compassion.

98
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:35,238
So we're gonna want to find that voice within our itself. They can say this is a difficult moment.

99
00:10:35,238 --> 00:10:41,018
It's OK. I'm having a hard time. It's only human and.

100
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:46,028
Right now, I just need some caring and nice and support. I need to try again. Anything.

101
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:53,078
So when we go to do big, big things, we need to know that these other three voices are gonna be there when all we see.

102
00:10:53,078 --> 00:11:02,108
There's gonna be a lot of noise. We want to really be able to focus in on the support section if we get to focus on the other areas.

103
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:10,568
Not going to help us do. The big and difficult things we want to do in my.

104
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:15,008
So that was the focus on our support section. The next part.

105
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:21,598
A lot of people don't like to hear, but if you are a person who gets in the arena,

106
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:26,768
if you stand there long enough, you live a life, you continually take on big and difficult things.

107
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:35,708
You're going to have a down moment. Bernie says, you know, if you stay in the race long enough, you're gonna get your bucket uses different language.

108
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:41,378
So you have to know that that's part of the process, too, and that it's OK.

109
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:48,038
So when you're having that moment of like I didn't get the position that I wanted, I said I told the person I loved that they didn't love me back.

110
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:51,888
You know, all of these moments, I just feel like failure.

111
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:57,448
That feel discouraging. You tried really hard to do the speed.

112
00:11:57,448 --> 00:12:04,168
You forgot the words. We have to know that that's a face down moment and that doesn't mean that we won't eventually have success.

113
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:07,558
Does it mean that we shouldn't get back in the arena?

114
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:15,108
So in those moments, we want to notice, as Britney Brown once said, that we're emotionally hooked.

115
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:23,528
That we are feeling all of our feelings and often this is a time where in our body we may start to feel numb.

116
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:28,028
We may start to feel a lot of anxiety. We might start to feel sadness.

117
00:12:28,028 --> 00:12:35,438
But if we're not leading, just if we're not leaning into support can kind of turn more towards depression.

118
00:12:35,438 --> 00:12:41,188
We might start stuffing down our feelings or it's kind of feeling frozen and paralyzed.

119
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:47,908
All of those are just signs in our body that it's like I had a face down moment and now I'm kind of emotionally.

120
00:12:47,908 --> 00:12:58,088
My feelings about it and I need help and support. We may find ourselves kind of be trying to be even more perfectionistic.

121
00:12:58,088 --> 00:13:07,478
Lots of overthinking or rumination or self-doubt. We may find ourselves trying to be overly positive and pretend it didn't even affect us at all.

122
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:10,268
Or we may find ourselves kind of lashing out at other people.

123
00:13:10,268 --> 00:13:14,678
I'm just getting really angry, irritable, starting to just judge and criticize other people.

124
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:25,218
All of Buller's finds that we're in this place and we just want to notice it. We want to move into just coming our body, taking care of herself.

125
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:30,198
And we also want to check the stories that we're telling our is in those moments.

126
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:32,748
It's normal and healthy to feel grief, disappointment,

127
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:38,988
all those feelings sometimes turn the feelings into these stories that are like, this is why I should never try again.

128
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:47,028
I knew I couldn't do this. And those stories often have this Tahitians built into them.

129
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:57,048
You can do all kinds of distortions and it'll show you the common ones. But the stories don't help coach us through these difficult moments.

130
00:13:57,048 --> 00:14:00,888
We want to get in, reconnect with the soccer passion.

131
00:14:00,888 --> 00:14:05,158
We want to be able to tell ourself, OK. Made a mistake. I might need to retool.

132
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:10,248
I might need to practice more or. This might not be irony.

133
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:15,608
I may have to shift a little bit. All of those things are OK this cycle.

134
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:23,838
Being able to kind of fall down, get back up is actually what predicts being really successful.

135
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:28,648
Not. Never feeling scared. It's not.

136
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:33,178
Never falling down. Things happen to everybody out here trying to do big inaudible.

137
00:14:33,178 --> 00:14:39,548
I just know that this is a cycle that you want to know and get really good at.

138
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:46,788
And no is perfectly normal. When you're trying to do.

139
00:14:46,788 --> 00:14:50,778
So here's another exercise, it's called a personal manifesto.

140
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:57,948
This also comes from Rene's work. And it's kind of like a mantra, but a little bit more book out.

141
00:14:57,948 --> 00:15:06,208
Kind of like a mission statement. It's writing down. A statement of your intentions, your motives, your views.

142
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:11,818
What's most important to you? And it's kind of speaking into, like the things that you want in that matter, do you?

143
00:15:11,818 --> 00:15:17,248
And it's putting the nurse that you can reflect back on them and those face down moments or in that.

144
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:27,218
And on the door moment to remind you what matters. Most here remind you who you really are and how you want to make a difference of your core values.

145
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,828
So you can write whatever you want.

146
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:36,438
Here are some prompts that can kind of get you started and you can just kind of dig out of here the ones that stand out to you the most.

147
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:44,698
And you'll have to refer back to. Just kind of pig like I I'm most passionate about, I have courage to my heart of hearts.

148
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:52,678
I am on this planet, too. I love myself by idea greatly by.

149
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:56,758
I'm going to show up why? So you're going to put these things down.

150
00:15:56,758 --> 00:16:01,418
You're going to put them somewhere where you have them. In those moments to kind of keep you on track.

151
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:05,188
There are many that you really do have a tiny little bit more support.

152
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:18,188
You might need a little refocus. But you can get really good at this process and this process can take you closer and closer to the.
