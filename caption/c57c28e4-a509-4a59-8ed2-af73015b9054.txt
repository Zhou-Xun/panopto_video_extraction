1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:10,230
Nothing to do with your house at all.

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,610
I think it's like not coming in.

3
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:29,459
I mean, I'm I'm waiting for my fall structure patterns for any other groups if I was going to get started in like a minute or two.

4
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:51,860
Okay. So but you know, I'm been around here and I feel like I'm just like, you know,

5
00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:04,380
this is not like the struggle to be like a feeling that, like, you take it out.

6
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,090
Like I like going to be like, you know, I'm not I'm not really getting any.

7
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:24,240
And it's like, I'm not taking it to refresh.

8
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:36,389
It's okay. Like, that's like something about my way of life connections.

9
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:44,890
It's. It's like I'm like. So when I first took it in my life, I think it was all right.

10
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,310
Well, I feel like we've got a good group here. Nice to see you.

11
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,660
How are you feeling today? I heard already some people are feeling very professional.

12
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,920
That's very good. Professional and professional development class.

13
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,730
Welcome. All right, let's see here now.

14
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:07,030
Did you want to start with for everyone? You want me to get going? All right, we'll start.

15
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,480
We'll start. We'll get to that, I think. Okay. All right.

16
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,799
So welcome back at 603, this is your professional development seminar.

17
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,780
You're going to get to know me nominee for this winter semester and in the fall as well.

18
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:26,079
So it's kind of a two part class. This is meant to be just kind of a supportive, guiding class.

19
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,559
This is a comfortable space where we're here to help answer questions,

20
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,680
help you think through what's coming in your curriculum, get you ready for your summer internships,

21
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,670
help you think through your graduation requirements, and then start to think about what will be happening after you graduate the program.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,870
So that's what we're here for. It's always a casual class, you know, and really, if you think about it, you know,

23
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,000
when you think about professional development needs a lot of different things, we're going to get into that.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,070
Like, what does that mean to you? And you think about like, what are you expecting to learn in a professional development class?

25
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,379
And then think about all of you and all the different departments that you're in, all the different experiences you've had before.

26
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,390
Coming here, you probably have lots of different ideas or just different sort of levels of

27
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,750
expertise and different types of things when it comes to professional development.

28
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:17,739
So that's kind of what we are about this class and what we're going to do today is really just the usual stuff.

29
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,910
On the first day of class, we're going to get you, get you to know I tell you about the class.

30
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,860
We what's expected in the class have a little bit of brainstorming about what do you think is professional development?

31
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,849
What does it mean to you? And then I'll give you a little bit,

32
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,770
just a teeny bit of lecture about just some different professional development frameworks to think about and to know

33
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,480
about and just sort of processing your own journey as you think about what you're learning here and then each program.

34
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,660
Okay. So go ahead with introductions then I'll.

35
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:50,420
I'll start. So nice to meet you all. My name's Laura. Laura Power.

36
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:56,599
You guys can call me Laura and a little bit about me, so I'll give you the long version since you're going to be stuck with me for like a year now.

37
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,750
So I want to make sure you all know me. I am.

38
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:05,180
I'm a let's see. What about me? I'm a clinical associate professor in our epidemiology department.

39
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,919
I'm the director of our Office of Public Health Practice, which is a very exciting role for me.

40
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:18,080
I've been doing that for about a year and a half, so in my role, what I do is a lot of teaching and training before coming to space.

41
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:24,290
So I'm a physician actually, so I kind of made my way to public health through like I started off kind of traditional,

42
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,749
you know, undergrad, med school, straight, straight in internal medicine, infectious diseases.

43
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,820
And I worked as an infectious disease physician. I was I went Wayne State undergrad.

44
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:41,030
We went to med school waiting for my internal medicine. I went to Boston to do my infectious disease training, came back, got a job at Henry Ford.

45
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,350
And so I was working at Henry Ford doing infectious diseases, and I was the medical director of infection prevention there.

46
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,190
That was like feels like ages ago at this point. That was what feels like a long time ago.

47
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,509
I started there in 2008 after I finished my fellowship,

48
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:03,950
and then I was there until 2014 when I discovered and kind of came to do a training program to learn more about public health.

49
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,280
So I came to do our preventive medicine training program that we have here.

50
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,549
So I like to tell stories about the different infectious disease experiences I had that got me more curious about public health,

51
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:19,879
like the botulism patient that I had. And I got to see like how activated local and state health was during that time.

52
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:28,400
And as a physician, I didn't really appreciate that at that time helping with like TB exposures and things like that guy just got me more

53
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,930
interested in public health and I like to say I saw the light came to public health through preventive medicine.

54
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,470
So that's a training program that we have here in our EPI department.

55
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,209
So I did that 2014 and 2016 and that kind of changed my career really.

56
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,170
And I ended up I joined in the School of Public Health as a faculty member.

57
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:45,950
For a while.

58
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:51,500
I was still seeing patients at the hospital, but then I just got really pulled into what was going on here in the School of Public Health,

59
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:58,850
our practice office, really thinking about the connections for what people are learning and having them be ready to be out in practice.

60
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,320
Whether you're a physician, whether you're a public health practitioner, that's kind of what what's pulled me in.

61
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,159
And so so now when I meet people and I go, What do you do?

62
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,240
I tell them I do lots of teaching and training. It's like a whole long story and I can't explain my whole background sometimes.

63
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,740
So you'll think about your own elevator speeches when you're, like, telling what you do.

64
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,730
For me, the simplest now, like when a doctor. But I don't see patients anymore and I do.

65
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,600
I tell people I do lots of teaching and training in public health, and that's true.

66
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:30,110
So in addition to teaching this class, I right now I'm teaching one of our core classes,

67
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:37,700
the leadership class, which you guys take in your second year. And then I have a couple training programs that are big part of what I do here.

68
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,819
One is the MED program. So that's the one that got me here.

69
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,570
And then I ended up like, I take that one too. And so that's a smaller program.

70
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:50,630
We take about two residents a year, but they take classes with you and then they do rotations out in different health departments.

71
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,130
So that's a program I did.

72
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:59,840
And then I'm the director for the Region five Public Health Training Center, which is really more it's about preparing our public health workforce.

73
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:07,610
The biggest focus is on people currently in the in the current workforce, but it's also about the future workforce, which is all of you.

74
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,510
So it's a nice way to be connected to like what are the needs of the current workforce?

75
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,800
And then how does that how does that tie in for our students and how do we kind of

76
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,700
understand the needs of the workforce and make sure we're teaching our students those needs?

77
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,950
And then we have a newer one.

78
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:28,190
The Public Health Prepared is a training program that I'm part of that is sort of based out the Region three Public Health Training Center,

79
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,510
but it's focused on infectious disease preparedness in the state of Michigan.

80
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:37,399
So it's kind of needs like a smaller version of the Region five training center, but really focused on infectious diseases.

81
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,809
So for me, I really like that one because it kind of brings together my my old infectious disease

82
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:47,610
experiences and what I learned in public health and kind of comes all together. And then, of course, I'll mention the practice office fair.

83
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,399
So anyone who's in here, who's a fast member already. All right, we got some fast members.

84
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,500
I'm glad and I hope to get more of you next year.

85
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:00,830
Maybe the Public Health Action Support Team, part of the practice office, worked closely with Shani Richardson and Nurse Munger,

86
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:08,030
and that's a kind of a program through the year where you get a chance to really build community and then think about what it

87
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,819
means to be engaging in public health practice and you get opportunities to go out and actually deploy and use those skills.

88
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:20,600
So and then my obligatory dog pager, because I always talk about my dog, I don't have kids, but I have a big dog and I can talk.

89
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,200
I do talk about it a lot. So that's a whole picture. That's like a year ago.

90
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,060
But okay, that's a long story about me. Mine is and so on.

91
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:40,160
My background is in K-12, so I started at K-12, Oregon, Oregon's Ecology Advisor for like two years and during that time.

92
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:50,190
I kind of help those high school students with professional development things, getting into jobs or internships and things like that.

93
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,220
And so that's how I kind of landed in it.

94
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,499
So my background is more student focused, which is makes sense as well.

95
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:07,770
I'm in student services and so now I'm getting a doctorate and higher education so that I can do more of this.

96
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:20,669
I'm a two time album of the year of Plant Camp Campus, so that's where I'm originally from, moved to the Detroit area and 2020 down to the pandemic.

97
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,750
So that's right after the pandemic. And I've been here ever since.

98
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:31,740
I love it here and at it. I love helping you guys. I do pretty much all things practice is what I like to say.

99
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,320
So internships, your high practice experience as well?

100
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:43,150
Dr. Paul and I do together. I really resources all that stuff.

101
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,400
But I'm guessing the group kind of knows you. Yeah, they should already, right?

102
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,770
You guys probably know. Oh, I forgot. The new part of it this year is the track coordination.

103
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:58,200
So if you're a GP or oh yea, then I'm like directly helping you with your classes and things like that.

104
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,020
So we're a team, we work together, you know, we're always meeting, checking in.

105
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:09,359
We think about this class and we also, we both in the faculty or in the department, we're both on the practice committee.

106
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,679
So there's different committees that we have like the faculty and staff are part of in our department.

107
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:21,360
So we are a small committee. It's me, Dominique and professor against the three of us are make up the practice committee.

108
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:26,189
So together we kind of talk about stuff through the class and we try to understand like what is needed for our students,

109
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:31,470
what is happening with experiences, how can we improve things for continually trying to figure that out?

110
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:42,059
So that's us. Now first, before I go into the class a little bit about you and I think you guys probably all know each other pretty well now,

111
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,240
or at least your little groups in that you know, the classes you have together.

112
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:54,660
But so I can kind of put some faces with sort of names that these departments I just want to ask about who so who is g here?

113
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,730
How many of you I know it's most like popularity. Okay, okay.

114
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,500
I'm just like trying to, like, I'll forget, but I'm just trying to remember now and then.

115
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,739
What else do we have? We have. Oh, all right.

116
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,100
There's always a few of you, and you're. You're all together. What could you back there now?

117
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:14,129
There's. I don't think we have any interviews in here just to take everything out, but, you know, we'll reach out to them now and then.

118
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,850
Are there any. All right. Oh, good, good, good. I'm glad you're here.

119
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,730
We want to move in here. They don't have to be here right now. We're glad you're here.

120
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:28,050
We can spread the word back to them because we need to we need to help them know what's going on with Apex, with stuff like that.

121
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,759
JT Okay, it's always.

122
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,870
JT Do we ever get anybody to credit?

123
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,560
Oh, no, no, no, no. Okay.

124
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:46,350
I tried to take it in, but I'll probably forget and ask you again later, but just so you can see who is here and.

125
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,090
Okay. Okay. So what is this class we talked about? I kind of gave you an intro in the beginning,

126
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,660
but really it's kind of sometimes I want to think about it as homeroom in some ways because we're kind of like getting you through,

127
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,190
thinking through the requirements in a place that we can be a resource for you.

128
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,920
Sometimes we may not have all the answers for you, but we have connections back to the department or the people who are overseeing the curriculum.

129
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,350
We can try to help figure things out.

130
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:18,209
So and when we think about it, like I said, sort of part one in part two, this is part one where we're really focused on what's coming in the summer.

131
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,270
For most of you, you'll be able to do some kind of internship in the summer,

132
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:26,100
you'll have some other graduation requirements coming like that applied practice experience.

133
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:32,009
We really focus on that, like trying to get you ready for what's coming in the summer so that you can think about how you're

134
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:36,839
going to apply what you're learning this first year and then program apply in a practice setting,

135
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:44,340
possibly then come back in the fall and then we kind of debrief, talk about how your experiences were in your internship,

136
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,989
and then think about going forward, where are you going to do after the program?

137
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,280
And for many you that's very different. Some are going to be applying to Ph.D., some are going to med school.

138
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,420
So I'm looking for jobs. I'm going to go do fellowships like you all have different goals.

139
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,930
And so we're trying to help understand what your goals are and help you get there.

140
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,889
So that's sort of the that's what that's what we're about. Would you add anything to that?

141
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:12,570
As I can sum it up pretty good, yeah. And just making sure that those requirements that the school requires are completed.

142
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:18,090
Exactly. So we're trying to tie in to what our department in the school is looking for, for your graduation.

143
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:24,179
So here's our a summary of the course topics and you maybe you're looking in the canvas page out to which I'll pull up in a second,

144
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,380
but you'll see that we'll kind of if you look through our course schedule next week,

145
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:33,209
actually, we'll have someone from the careers office come to just kind of sharing what their resources are,

146
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,030
and they have very good resources there that we encourage you to take advantage of.

147
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:41,460
And then they'll be talking about resumes and making sure your resume is written as best as it can be.

148
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,739
And that so so I'll tell you about that once you have an assignment related to that and we'll tell you more.

149
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,830
We'll spend some time talking about what what is the internship?

150
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,580
How do you find your internships? What is the apex for the applied practice experience?

151
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,590
How do you find that? Is it your internship? Does it relate? And it can look different for all of you.

152
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,020
But we'll tell you what it is, what the requirements are,

153
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:06,629
and and then how you actually meet that requirement, which will be through the fall part of 603.

154
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,350
So we'll tell you all about that and we'll give you some idea.

155
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,290
As for how you might find some of those opportunities, again, how you might find an internship,

156
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:18,410
how you might find something that maybe is not an internship but would help you so meet the apex requirements.

157
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,120
And then we'll have some thought of some classes that are really focused on getting you

158
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,659
ready to engage with communities and just work with people and be in different settings.

159
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,050
So one that will be about entering and engaging communities.

160
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,880
We'll have two sessions actually about the intercultural continuum.

161
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:40,159
So thinking about how you're developing and thinking about culture and working across cultures.

162
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,860
And so I don't know if anyone's already done the the idea they call the intercultural development inventory,

163
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,040
but we'll do that here and we'll kind of debrief on that as a group.

164
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,760
We'll get some perspectives from practice partners of like what is it like when we have an intern coming in?

165
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,880
What is it like? How do things what goes well, what do you know? What are the things that work well?

166
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,740
Well, a couple of sessions on ethics and epidemiology and like understanding the IAB,

167
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:10,280
but I feel like IAB was never no one's ever excited about the IAB, but it's very important to get that done, to understand what it is.

168
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,760
And then we'll do some workshopping again, just to help you start to feel ready for what's coming in the summer.

169
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,040
And then really just planning for year two,

170
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,099
inviting some of your colleagues in who are second years to kind of tell you what they what they wish they had known in their first year.

171
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,889
And like, what is it like for them so. It's pretty low stress.

172
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:33,130
And this sort of like guiding is what it's intended to be.

173
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,560
There are some requirements and you'll see actually, let's see.

174
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:44,950
Maybe I'll say here first actually that the grading for this class is it's on the satisfactory, unsatisfactory scale.

175
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,370
So, you know, everything pretty much gets satisfactory. There's the same things you do.

176
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,890
Then you'll get a satisfactory grade.

177
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:58,330
If you don't, you're more likely to get an incomplete until you do finish what you need to finish because it is required for graduation.

178
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:05,050
But this is what we ask of you for this semester, and we'll we'll guide you through this and some of these things you may have even already done.

179
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,970
So maybe it looks like a lot, but you might have actually done some of these because some of these are things you you,

180
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,120
I believe, were told about when you first matriculated and you might have already done them.

181
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:20,710
But we just have it here so that it's like check. Yep, we did that because at some point, as in your graduation audit later.

182
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:29,320
So what we are asking is one to confirm and you'll see this in the canvas to who knows what I'm talking about when I say those modules,

183
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:35,270
the flow modules or the foundations of public health practice. I see sometimes it seems like it's familiar.

184
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:40,510
It might have been you probably heard about, but even before you started class. I did.

185
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:45,250
I did a couple of those and you hear my voice and stuff. I talk about that with me on there.

186
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,170
So we want to make sure you did those. Those are required for graduation.

187
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:58,209
And all you have to do for the assignment is like either upload a certificate of completion, a screenshot, even just tell us I finished it.

188
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:03,610
You tell us you did it good. We just want to make sure you remember that you did it and that it's done.

189
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:09,280
Someone will check it on the back end, you know, like, you know, the audit, the graduation and the registrar and all that.

190
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,229
They they actually check that you did it.

191
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:16,690
But we're just kind of doing it to remind you that you needed to do it so that you don't get to your end of your graduation.

192
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,900
Like, Oh yeah, those basic learning modules that were supposed to be the foundation or everything, I didn't remember to do them.

193
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,950
I want to make sure you got those done. So that's that's all you so maybe you all did that one.

194
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,099
You already done the first assignment. Go in, put in. It was finished.

195
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:37,180
Find the certificate. That's one. The second is a resume submission, which we'll tell you more about next week.

196
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,600
But you'll be you'll be given some structure about what is a good resume, some tips about that, then you'll upload it.

197
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,379
And our careers office will actually review everyone's resume and try to give some

198
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,010
pointers or help you help improve it if there's there's always room for improvement.

199
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:58,120
So we'll try to help you make your resume as nice as possible so that it can be used for internship applications or job applications,

200
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:04,330
things like that. What I would say about that class in particular, I enjoyed it and I wasn't in the class,

201
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,200
but I actually took what they said and changed my own resume literally.

202
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:14,740
So the point is that they give you during class are like a one and they tell you they'll

203
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:21,250
show you like how employers are looking at your resume and like that points on your resume.

204
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:28,030
So it's really important you come to them because the other deliverables we have are

205
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:32,950
related to the the class above the idea of the intercultural development inventory.

206
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,310
So through that class, it comes from the Trotter Multicultural Center.

207
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:41,470
There is a self-assessment that you do. It's like an online, it's like an online, you know, quiz assessment thing.

208
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:48,159
And so once you do that, basically just doing that, completing that is that assignment you'll get at that class session,

209
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,850
you'll get more instructions about how to access that. You go do the online assessment and then that meets that assignment.

210
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:01,870
And then the other is an individual debrief session to talk about the idea your own individual result,

211
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,489
they offer individual debrief session to just like talk about it.

212
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,180
What does it mean? What do you do with that? How can you grow from there?

213
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,710
And what we ask is that you have scheduled an individual debrief.

214
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:21,610
You don't have to actually finish it by our due date, but we just need to like make the appointment and finish it at some point in the semester.

215
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:28,840
And I think for me, I know I took the idea for me that was actually the most useful part was the individual reflection and like,

216
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,570
what does my own assessment mean and how can I,

217
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:41,170
what can I do in my daily practices and things like another one that do I believe were assigned is this one's unfamiliar peers modules.

218
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,309
Oh, I feel really different. It's like you're supposed to know it and you do know it.

219
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:49,240
So that's good. Things are working then, so you might have already done that one as well.

220
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:57,309
So it's similar to the flow modules. You just need to upload a certificate of completion or put in a text entry that you did it check.

221
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:02,410
If you don't know, you'll see in that assignment you can actually go and find it will tell you your

222
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,670
status like are you do like I for because I have to do them every so many years too.

223
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,360
And sometimes I forget I have to go in there and check where I'm at. So it'll tell you how you did it.

224
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,900
But you can't remember. You can usually find it in their web page. So that's pretty simple.

225
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,330
And then the last two things.

226
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:24,040
One is another brief worksheet, but it's thinking about it, sort of reflecting on your own professional development and then planning for the summer.

227
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,340
We really want you to start thinking about your end by then and.

228
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,940
You'll have thought a lot about your internship. And we want you to have thought about what are you doing for the apex?

229
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:37,490
Will your internship experience help you meet the apex? For many of you at will, you'll hear more about this.

230
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,559
If it's not going to you based on the type of internship you chose to do, that's totally okay.

231
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:47,990
But we want to know that you have a plan to get some practice experienced to meet that requirement.

232
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:54,440
So it's just asking you to plan so that you don't show up in the fall like, you know, we had soon, so we got him through.

233
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,240
But, you know, sometimes students will show up in the second fall and they're like, I have no idea what I'm doing for Apex.

234
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,900
We don't want you to leave here this year feeling like you have no idea what you want to do.

235
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,500
We want you to know that you've got resources that you can reach out to them.

236
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,650
And I want to know that you've been thinking about it. You can totally change it.

237
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:16,700
Okay. Your plan changes. We just want to see that you're planning. So it's really just to get you thinking the last piece is your attendance.

238
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,780
We like to see you here. So we are taking attendance for this class.

239
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:25,220
And Dominic has I'm sorry, Dominique has finances.

240
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,639
There is a path around. Normally I would just have him up here and we were out of the saying, yeah, I'll start one on this side.

241
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,260
I want to know. Okay, perfect. So we have it written right now is that we'd like you.

242
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:41,239
We have 14 in-person sessions and we ask you to attend 11 at least.

243
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:47,479
But that means there are three absences that we don't, you know, you don't have to get excused or anything.

244
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,070
You can just do as you please if there is are extenuating circumstances.

245
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:56,190
Just retired class. Just talk to us about it. Okay? We are here to help you.

246
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,260
We want to help you get through so we figure out how to work things out, trying to book.

247
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:06,620
So if you already missed three, then something happens and going to you're not sure to talk to us.

248
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,130
I think that's like the biggest message, what questions you guys have so far.

249
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:25,460
You feel pretty straightforward, not by yourself about episode 670 or so.

250
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:35,390
Yeah. Just a quick note about like communication, the word team.

251
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,469
You know, try if you remember something, you know, but, you know,

252
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:45,200
try to email both of us because like if you email me, I'll probably end up seizing Dominique or forwarding.

253
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,880
We just try to be together on what's happening with things in the class.

254
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:57,800
But we're both instructors, so we want to be in touch with what's going on and really we just want to hear from her.

255
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:01,460
You're already meeting with Dominique a lot anyways. Our student services.

256
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,600
We want to know how we can help you use our office hours.

257
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,140
You can sign up through our. Our links that we have on the instructor page.

258
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,820
Just reach out to us. We're here for you. Use this as a resource.

259
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:20,420
If there's ever a time that you need to meet with me and it's I don't have time listed

260
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:26,030
or because I have it set up where you have to look within 48 hours before the meeting.

261
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,240
So if it's something that is urgent, please send me an e-mail.

262
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,150
You're positive. But if it's something urgent, make sure you email me for that.

263
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:40,540
I know you prioritize that. I'm just going to take a minute.

264
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,340
I know I walked through the requirements. I'm sure you're all very familiar with navigating canvas now.

265
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,430
You probably see in the way it set up each week.

266
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:55,899
We have a few things to do in the course, have slides and kind of reminders about the assignments in there,

267
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,150
and then just sometimes additional resources finally.

268
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:10,090
I think that it's kind of self-explanatory. We have the official syllabus here that's there and we'll get to this one later.

269
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:14,470
But you'll see. Of course, here is our instructor page so you can find our appointments with us here.

270
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:19,900
And then we'll get into this one link in a couple of classes.

271
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:25,270
But we try to keep it like a running list of internship and apex resources and we'll use this tab.

272
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,540
We'll actually copy those and use it again in the fall.

273
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,680
But this is sort of weird because we found it was peppering people with more and more information.

274
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,250
So I just here is like a me tab on your on your page there.

275
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:46,179
They miss anything but the class. Other than that, if we get more information about internship or Apex or anything like that, we will update it.

276
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:51,140
So that comes in all the time. Right.

277
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:03,850
So I think we're ready for the execution of the world class and class students.

278
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,240
All right. So we're going to have you break into like some small groups kind of gather where you are,

279
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:18,460
maybe groups of like maybe six ish and kind of talk some talk amongst ourselves.

280
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:25,560
Think about things like what do you hope to get out of this class? What do you think when you hear the word professional or phrase?

281
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:37,060
And then how do you apply a learning from the past for your learning from this via your internship,

282
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:46,020
applying practice experience or your future career? So just kind of talk amongst yourselves and then report back.

283
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,090
So you can just have one person from the team answer each of these questions.

284
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:54,550
Look, you know. And I think I see you're on there, but there's the Google doc.

285
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,020
It's LinkedIn cam in that first patient there. So I see you're finding your way there.

286
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:04,630
Use that there. You don't have to list your names or what group you are just sort of a running tally.

287
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:08,469
But this is just a how do they want to help us get insight into where you're at,

288
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:13,870
what you're thinking about, and then also to help you really think about what is professional development?

289
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,460
Because, again, I think it's a very broad term and it can mean a lot of different things to different people.

290
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:21,900
Be asking questions, just make yourselves in a little group.

291
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:29,100
You have to move around. Yeah, move around, get comfortable, you know?

292
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:42,980
What do you think? And I hope you are going to be talking about.

293
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:54,960
Oh, okay. I was just really stuck with three things.

294
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:13,350
What do you want to make sure that you're not afraid to talk about?

295
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,570
They don't want a good wrestling match. Sorry.

296
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:34,000
Looks like somebody else was really good at that.

297
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:44,160
I don't know.

298
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:59,970
Look, I was in college, and then I have no one tomorrow, so.

299
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:32,860
I don't know. Yeah, so I definitely think.

300
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:46,920
Know I don't know about you, but you.

301
00:28:52,610 --> 00:29:01,250
I. Did you hear anything?

302
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:52,230
Like I remember, you know, I tried to say, yes, you can sign up for not being invited to go back to the concert.

303
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,480
Yeah, I find it funny. Yeah.

304
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:10,769
I do not know why I'm telling you.

305
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:18,330
I'm going to cover it up for you, I.

306
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:33,950
I really want to finish.

307
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:43,770
I know there was some kind of. You're not proposing to do anything.

308
00:30:44,230 --> 00:31:00,200
Yeah, I actually think that because it seems like sometimes.

309
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:18,220
That's why I have a dream come true.

310
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:50,490
That's great. You know, I like organizing and things like that so that we can bring it back.

311
00:31:51,430 --> 00:32:01,130
To bring it back. And everybody is not going to like it.

312
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:11,190
Yeah, right. So, you know, I see a lot of that a lot of the answers that you guys wrote are definitely what we'll be doing in this class.

313
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,920
So that's good to know that that's what you hope to get out of our class.

314
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:21,450
We will also go to these to look ourselves together and kind of make sure that what

315
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:27,240
you're expecting to get out of this class is what we're prepared to to help you with.

316
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:37,230
And so a lot of the common things I see our hope with Readymade and CV, which is what the Careers Office will share with you,

317
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:44,550
Apex entirely, which is what we're here to kind of help guide you through guidance on internships.

318
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:50,880
That's what we're here for. So that's that's good. The things that you were expecting are what we're going to do.

319
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:59,190
And so some of the things that you think of when you hear professional development, these are some good ones being proactive,

320
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:04,500
navigating the real world, knowing what to expect in future jobs or academic pursuits.

321
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:09,990
That's a good one. Ability to communicate who you are.

322
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,970
I think that's a really good one because a lot of times when you're going into interviews and things like that,

323
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:19,900
I know for me personally it was so hard for me to kind of like talk about myself because I'm not a brat.

324
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:24,000
Like, I'm not a person that goes around bragging about myself.

325
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,800
So I think that's learning how to still communicate who you are without being a part of professional development for me.

326
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:39,460
So these are some good ones here. And then how do you hopes of higher learning from this class to your internship

327
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,200
apply practice experience and your future career being confident interviews.

328
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:51,640
That's really good. Interview Tips. Understanding the IAB protocols would really help to get you through that process.

329
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:02,120
Navigating relationships with fellow colleagues. I think that is a good one that the university itself has taught me.

330
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:06,040
So these are some some some good ones that you guys came up with.

331
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:14,500
And like I said, we'll go through that with you together and just kind of see what you guys have come up with you.

332
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:22,940
All right. I'm going to go through a couple different frameworks here, but thanks for taking time to do that.

333
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,700
Does that go with Dominique said? And I you know, I think really when you think about professional development,

334
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,460
it really is different for everybody what you're expecting, what you mean.

335
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:39,350
And, you know, even in preparing for this class and you're teaching this class a couple of times just looking for other frameworks,

336
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:44,030
like what does that mean? And I feel like it does line up a lot with the idea of teaching leadership.

337
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:49,460
A lot of it is self-reflection, understanding yourself, understanding where you're trying to go.

338
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:56,460
And I think it is important to step back and have time for that self-reflection where especially with,

339
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,510
you know, like our numbers were cranking out data,

340
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:04,639
we like to just think about numbers, but sometimes it's nice to step back and think about like, what does it all mean?

341
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,680
What does it mean for me? Where am I going?

342
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:12,980
So we'll try to give you resources about what you're all going to need is, you know, it's different for everybody.

343
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:20,569
I do want to just have some foundational kind of framework discussion about just just different resources that are out there for you

344
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:28,100
to think about when you're thinking about what skills and what what competencies you're trying to develop for from this program.

345
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:38,590
So you know, all of this, right, where we're studying public health or studying epidemiology, all in order to improve the health for our society.

346
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,080
I mean that when you think about like what is public health?

347
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:48,960
There's really the ultimate goal is when you when you define public health as what we do as a society to improve health for others.

348
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:55,860
And if you look at the different frameworks that are out there, you've probably heard of healthy people 2030, which, you know,

349
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:05,310
every decade our is the federal government puts out this guidance of different metrics and how we can try to reach and improve health.

350
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,890
So to get there, there's other frameworks that help us think, well, how do we do that?

351
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:18,060
How do we have the right capabilities and skills in order to have a public health workforce that can do that?

352
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:23,429
And so those different frameworks you you're probably familiar with the ten essential services of public health.

353
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,690
We'll talk about that in a second.

354
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:31,320
There's another one that's more focused on governmental public health, specifically called the foundation of public health services.

355
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,320
And then underlying those types of services,

356
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:42,490
there are specific skills and there's a couple of different frameworks and you'll see how the SIF competencies kind of line up with that too.

357
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:49,500
So the things you're learning here is a student line up with things that the public health workforce is trying to learn as well.

358
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:57,480
So just to help you see that connection, this is just about telling or making sure you knew how to do the 2030.

359
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:01,410
So there's that. But I want to get to that.

360
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,390
So does this look familiar to you, the ten essential services.

361
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:16,260
Do you, though know? So just like maybe it's time to check where we're at because I don't know how much you all maybe remember from all this,

362
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:21,930
but the three things on the cyber assessment, policy development and assurance.

363
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:28,110
Do you know what those refer to? So some of it's getting to the history of the essential services and like where they came from.

364
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:39,080
We know what those three things are. So I'm going to step back for a second and you can refer to my foundational module where I go through this.

365
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,809
You probably in the beginning of the summer, you've heard me blabbing this and then I forgot about it.

366
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:49,500
So I'm going to just kind of tell you real quick, a little summary of it, but basically way back to 1988,

367
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:55,260
picture it, 1988, Institute of Medicine put out a big report about what's the status of public health right now.

368
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,459
And they wrote this bigger part. And their big summary was public health was in disarray.

369
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:05,010
It was like totally chaotic governmental public health, like things had been growing and growing, but not in a very structured fashion.

370
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:09,270
And they came to the conclusion public hospital was in disarray and needed to be more organized.

371
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:16,950
And from that time on is when there there was trying to be more infrastructure and how especially governmental public health was set up.

372
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:22,709
And they said, well, what is the purpose of public health? And they were really talking about government and public health and they said, well,

373
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:30,360
the purpose of public health was to assess, to do policy development and to assure the public that was what they decided.

374
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:35,340
It was very broad. Then in the 1990, it was like 1994.

375
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:43,920
They these big committees, I keep saying things like these federal commissions created the first version of the ten essential services.

376
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:49,769
So that was it created in 1994 to define what is needed for public health,

377
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:54,450
whether it was conducted by the federal government or public health or other systems.

378
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,240
It could be health systems, it could be nonprofit organizations like different things could be working towards public health.

379
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:08,000
So all of these ten essential services, they don't need to be met just by a health department, but they need to be met somehow in a community.

380
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,209
So it's like a broader than just governmental public health. It was updated in 2020.

381
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:16,440
What was do you guys know what the change was from the old version to the new version in 2020?

382
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:25,180
The change was to focus on equity. In the past they had.

383
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:30,309
So there's 1010 things around this we are an equity is not actually one of the service is a thing that

384
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:37,299
each each service is is really aiming towards the idea of equity and health equity before they had it.

385
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:42,900
So that I think research was in the middle and researching and understanding public health was the ten service.

386
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:47,440
They had it in the middle, so it reworked it and a lot of them are kind of similar,

387
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,670
but they there are some changes that change the wording and how they talk about it.

388
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:59,080
But they really made a big focus on pointing out that the reason we're doing all of this is really

389
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:04,300
to get to a place of equity and trying to acknowledge that there's still a lot of work to do.

390
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:09,070
And then how can all these essential services feed into that? So that was the big change in 2020.

391
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:14,740
I want you to know about that. And the reason I'm talking about this is one, it's a framework, again, for what we're all doing.

392
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:20,560
And when you go out into practice, oftentimes our public health practitioners, being our students, need to know the essential services.

393
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,090
Sometimes they feel like our students aren't aware of them when they show up in their internships.

394
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:30,060
I want to make sure you know about it a little. The history behind it, too, the one that people aren't as familiar with, but I think is just nice too,

395
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,070
when you're thinking about professional development and competency that you need.

396
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,340
Is this others that call the foundation of public health services?

397
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:42,280
And this is really specific for governmental public health as saying in a governmental health thing, like a local health department,

398
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:49,719
there should be this type of infrastructure and this type of ability to, you know, for having foundational services.

399
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:57,100
So the structure, you should be able to do surveillance, emergency preparedness, performance management,

400
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:02,230
and then there should be these different areas of focus within within a government health department.

401
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:09,520
So those are some of the structures there. And then with that and there's all these competencies that are there for people working in public health.

402
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:15,499
And you may know that actually the majority of people working in public health do not have a master of public health.

403
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:20,409
They're actually a small piece of the public health workforce when it comes to people who are working in public health.

404
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:26,260
So thinking about for people who are out there working right now, if they're working in a health department and you're trying to do workforce

405
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,920
development for people currently working in Washoe County Health Department,

406
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,850
what are the things that they need when you assess your workforce, what are you looking for?

407
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:39,820
So the Public Health Foundation, these are kind of big nonprofit organizations that think about public health.

408
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,620
They have lots of great resources and they're linked on that first page or first campus page,

409
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,880
but they talk about these different domains that a lot of things fall into.

410
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:53,620
And then the De Beaumont Foundation, these are like two separate big nonprofit organizations.

411
00:41:53,890 --> 00:42:00,220
They have these strategic skills that kind of line up with the Public Health Foundation domains.

412
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,010
So you can see things fall into like effective communication.

413
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,590
They call it Jeddah is often how they call it the justice, equity, diversity and inclusion.

414
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:13,540
Sometimes people say Jedi resource management, change management systems and strategic thinking.

415
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:18,790
So those are the different domains and the different strategic skills that when we think about the workforce,

416
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:24,880
that's what we think they need in order to really meet those foundational services and the essential services.

417
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,370
And the Development Foundation also talks about this public health team.

418
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:34,149
I always like to show this and it talks about, you know, the things that you need.

419
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:37,660
There's these sort of cross-cutting strategic skills and core competencies.

420
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:40,030
Which are those those basic things.

421
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:46,840
It is if you look on the tee, they would have all of these the effect of communication, change, management, those things are all here.

422
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:52,510
And then the specialized skills are things such as your epidemiology methods that you're all learning or

423
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:58,270
your your communication expertise or your nutritional sciences or your environmental health expertise.

424
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:02,680
You're all learning those specialized skills in the epidemiology department.

425
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,310
That's what you're learning in all your methods, classes and all that.

426
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,640
But you also need those strategic skills and core competencies.

427
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,140
And these are more I'm your learning some of those in your core classes,

428
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:17,440
but I want you to think about where those fit in and when you think about your professional development journey.

429
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,500
These are both important and you have to decide for yourself. Which one of these do you?

430
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,200
You want them all, of course.

431
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,400
But sometimes you have to prioritize what you're going to work on for yourself, and it's going to be different for all of you.

432
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:32,590
And I like talking about proposals here, but I could go on and on about that.

433
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,250
Those are all very general competency frameworks, but there are competency frameworks as well for epidemiology specifically.

434
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,140
Are you familiar with CFD counsel for State and Territorial Academia Colleges?

435
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:50,050
Check out CFD. They always offer these cool fellowships that people tend to do sometimes after graduating our program.

436
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:56,200
They're the ones that define the surveillance definitions when you're reporting infectious diseases.

437
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:02,080
So as part of the CDC, well, they have these competency frameworks for epidemiologists.

438
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:05,510
And you can actually go on their website and look at it.

439
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:09,670
You can assess your own skills, your capacity, like what? What are the things that you're good at?

440
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:13,809
They're really helpful for thinking about jobs. This is like a lot of words.

441
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:20,530
I just I'm putting in here more just so you can see it and see what's there. But they basically have these different tiers.

442
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:29,020
So like this is I put up the tier one example. They have entry level or basic epidemiology jobs and then they talk about the different types

443
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:33,820
of skills and things that are needed in those different skill domains that came up earlier.

444
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:41,470
So I think if you look at the Public Health Foundation, ones like data analytics and assessment skills, you know, these are different domains.

445
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:49,390
They have competencies that line up with those and they describe what does it look like?

446
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,239
So you could talk about this or you might see what someone hiring someone,

447
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,530
the Tier one epidemiologist, what are the types of things that they're looking at?

448
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:03,890
So I want you to know about that. So that specifically for epidemiology, what you're studying, there is those frameworks.

449
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:10,990
And then, of course, so those are all like those are frameworks for people outside of people working now.

450
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,650
But what about, you know, our student? So do these look familiar?

451
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:20,420
I hope so. And if not, we're going to get familiar with them.

452
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,820
These are your core competencies for the MPH program.

453
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:27,639
These are those fifth core competencies that you probably know.

454
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,270
And that's why you're taking on those core classes, our MPH.

455
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:35,049
So these are all the this one is the foundational one. This is what everybody,

456
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:40,510
anyone getting in MPH in the C4 accredited school is required to learn and be assessed

457
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:44,980
on these core competencies like standard across all schools of public health.

458
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:50,350
Right. So in your core classes, they probably tell you this class needs this core competency.

459
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:54,399
And I don't know how much or I'm not sure how much that like things that or how much.

460
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,810
Even we as instructors are making sure to tell you that. I've been thinking a lot about that because of the Apex stuff,

461
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:06,360
but I want you to start thinking about a little bit of control and knowledge of your own education program that you're going through.

462
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:09,910
Like where are you learning these things? Which ones do you care about the most?

463
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:14,260
Yeah, we have to we're we're we want to teach you in a session all these. But which ones do you care about?

464
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,880
Which ones are going to be helpful to whatever it is you want to do? So these are the foundational ones.

465
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,800
So you'll you'll get to know these because you'll need to know about these for your apex, and we'll talk about them.

466
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:29,830
And then these are the epidemiology concentration competencies that are decided by our our department.

467
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,390
They're not standardized. You know, these are what you're learning in our programs.

468
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:40,750
So for each of your concentration, there are specific competencies that line up with what you're studying.

469
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,790
So make sure you've looked at these.

470
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:49,140
And do you feel like you're really learning these and you know, where where are things that you might want to spend more time on or things like that?

471
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:52,180
So I want to make sure you know what those I would say to when you're in your core classes,

472
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:56,620
if the instructor does it make it plain that you are learning this competency?

473
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:01,480
Ask what kind of core competency should I be learning in this class if they haven't said it?

474
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:06,930
Because you're going to need that information when it comes to your. Just.

475
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:15,390
Good. So make sure you've seen them. You'll see where they are. So I was trying to make the connection between what's needed in the work force,

476
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,569
what the different frameworks are that people in the workforce are using,

477
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:23,410
and how well you're what is happening in your MPH program, how that is tying into all of that.

478
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:27,300
And there's actually a document that tries to relate the C competencies to these other ones.

479
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,710
It might be little more than you want to know, but there's ways to relate them together.

480
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:40,260
So any questions that I have got so far, and that was the majority of the material, just a couple reminders and things we wanted to tell you.

481
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:47,879
Did you want to go through or ahead? So our first assignment for the semester was as we talked about it earlier,

482
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:53,040
but it's the foundation of the Public Health Practice online module, which many of you probably have already done.

483
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:57,480
So if you have already done it, it's good to go. You're already done with the first assignment.

484
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:02,910
You just need to upload it. Let us know that you've done it and it's due by January 24th.

485
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:10,260
And then we just have a few reminders that's coming up. So next week, first, the careers office is going to actually come in.

486
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:14,399
They're going to talk about some resume best practices and then you'll have an assignment.

487
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,639
Where you going to turn in your resume and then they'll go over it. So you'll get some feedback and things like that.

488
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,650
And like I said, the foundational learning online modules are due on the 24th.

489
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:33,060
For those of you who are unaware, everybody should know. But just in case you don't, the student services team has moved.

490
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:37,860
We're on the across the hall now. So when you get off the elevator, if you turn right, we're right past the restrooms.

491
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,850
And so my new office number is four six, four, six.

492
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,700
And then we also have a new ticketing system.

493
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:50,940
So if there's a question that you don't know who to ask, so if you're nine times out of ten, you're going to be.

494
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,020
Amy and he would go to Carolina.

495
00:48:56,140 --> 00:49:00,550
But if there's a question, you're like, I don't know who asked this question. You can email the ticketing system.

496
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:04,450
You go in and it kind of tries and we send it to who it's supposed to go to.

497
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,850
So that's a new thing. We just started it to go ahead and use it if you need to.

498
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,909
Yeah, I just do two last clubs really, really quick. I swear this is the last thing.

499
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:19,600
But I want you to. This is happening today. This is the ahead of the curve in the register for this.

500
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,139
Yet I'm registered. Awesome. Okay. This would be really cool.

501
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,100
And you know, what this is is a leadership series that Dean Bowman does.

502
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:36,180
He's been a few times a year. He reaches out and then does interviews with prominent leaders in public health, and they're live streamed.

503
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:41,670
You can watch it just if you register on the link there, you'll get like a way to log on and you can watch it live too.

504
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:47,479
You can watch it. We drive it at the same time. Like I encourage you to to, you know, get on there or it'll be recorded.

505
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:53,139
We can watch it later, but they're definitely excited. And, and I know our school wants to see our students register.

506
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:57,730
And so if you're not, please do and you'll at least get the link and then you can watch it even later if you want.

507
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:58,918
And there's other really cool ones to watch.
