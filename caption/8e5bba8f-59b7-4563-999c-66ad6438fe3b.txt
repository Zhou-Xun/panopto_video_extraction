1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,310
Avoiding weight.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,270
So this is the domain where we talked mostly about health information exchange.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,336
And is there an opportunity for

4
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:12,477
health information exchange of views it is a redundant care.

5
00:00:12,477 --> 00:00:16,957
There have been a lot of papers that have estimated the potential for

6
00:00:16,957 --> 00:00:19,940
savings from reducing redundancies.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,532
One study that came out RAN went through and

8
00:00:22,532 --> 00:00:27,212
sort of calculated all these different domains in which HIE really helped and

9
00:00:27,212 --> 00:00:31,690
came into this estimated about $80 billion dollars a year in savings.

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:36,691
And then there was similarly another study that came out of partners at the time that

11
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:41,335
I was part of that came up with a very similar estimate of what the potential for

12
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:42,632
waste reduction is.

13
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:46,124
And that's what a lot of interest in in in HIV was like, wow,

14
00:00:46,124 --> 00:00:49,780
you really can save $80 million like that would be so great.

15
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,423
Get rid of a lot of ways, but all of you at this point,

16
00:00:52,423 --> 00:00:55,840
it's hard enough to know that it's easier said than done.

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,030
And there's a couple of reasons I'm gonna use intuition for for why that is.

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,859
And that's because so there's, so it's really here, right?

19
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:10,383
So where where are the two sources of saving sources.

20
00:01:10,383 --> 00:01:15,020
We're saving receiving $8 million.

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,340
Where is that coming from?

22
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,707
So one of them is from reducing redundant tests and for

23
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:24,112
society, that's a good thing, right?

24
00:01:24,112 --> 00:01:28,676
But who do you think is not so happy about reducing redundant,

25
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:32,141
>> Tests possible charged with that, Yeah,

26
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:32,821
right?

27
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:36,735
They're not all that, [INAUDIBLE] Right?

28
00:01:36,735 --> 00:01:40,606
So, again, please becomes this tricky thing because what they look like waste to

29
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:43,340
one person and another person sort of thing.

30
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,188
So you better believe that they're not gonna be all that thrilled

31
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:48,851
about implementing with gusto and technology the same way.

32
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:58,334
>> I also think that there needs to be more education patients because we,

33
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:03,031
one that's the one weekend segment later.

34
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:07,314
What we read on the internet, which may not be necessary, yeah.

35
00:02:07,314 --> 00:02:11,616
I think that's right to some of the reasons we have driven by this lack of

36
00:02:11,616 --> 00:02:16,135
education about whether it's truly valuable care when I say I want that has

37
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:19,147
to be done again because it's still hurting me and

38
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:21,260
I think it's important for them.

39
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,740
So there is absolutely there to.

40
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,422
It reinforces the broader point that the technology only gets you so far, right?

41
00:02:28,422 --> 00:02:29,720
It gives you the capability.

42
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,653
But actually turning that capability into federal care last week involves

43
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:39,361
incentives, involves education, involved all these other places.

44
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,298
So I like this one other fun weeks storey that I'd like to tell,

45
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:49,069
which is that one of the ways in which the sort of the second big domain of savings

46
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,560
was really from labour savings, right?

47
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,960
People who no longer had to spend their time faxing and copying and

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,170
mailing things.

49
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:02,012
And this has been one of them, like when we do these savings calculations from EHRs

50
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:04,910
and HIE, right, that we count that as, right?

51
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,240
People who no longer have a centre of doing that.

52
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,840
And so I was doing a research study in physician practises in Massachusetts.

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,816
So one of the questions I asked was, well, have you been able to have, different

54
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:19,930
kinds of labour savings and has been able to reduce your front office staff, right?

55
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,200
There are a lot of people who have to do these information management.

56
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,465
The doctor looked at me and he said, well, my wife is my friend office now and

57
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:31,197
I don't think it would go to well by eliminating people's jobs and

58
00:03:31,197 --> 00:03:31,728
lives, >> [LAUGH]

59
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:33,340
>> And like it's been, you know,

60
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,550
looks like waste to us.

61
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,340
But these are I mean, it's not that easy to get rid of them.

62
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,840
So I don't think about that when I think about waste.

63
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,320
Some of it is truly here that everyone would agree that no much yet.

64
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,251
But a lot of this sort of second big chunk of waste

65
00:03:49,251 --> 00:03:54,306
is people's jobs and it's not that easy again,

66
00:03:54,306 --> 00:03:58,507
[INAUDIBLE] So I think wasted the tricky one,

67
00:03:58,507 --> 00:04:03,787
particularly in the health of the world because here, so

68
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:09,940
for two reasons, first one man's places on the mantle.

69
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,610
So that can be hard to again realise those benefits.

70
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:16,851
And also because care that's wasteful in a lot of scenarios can

71
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:19,741
actually be helpful in some small number.

72
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:22,449
And so how do we know for that patient that care is wasteful and what

73
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:25,701
you are the patient because I want that additional tests and it actually turned

74
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:29,540
out to be something that was really useful and they say, well that was the case.

75
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,197
We only know it after the fact, right?

76
00:04:31,197 --> 00:04:34,360
So it becomes again a strictly thing between, how do we actually get rid

77
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,180
of ways and is the technology really going to help us with that?

78
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,604
Well, you know, only if you can really figure out how to solve these problems?

79
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:46,236
>> Yeah, I agree

80
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:52,027
that, [INAUDIBLE]

81
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:58,976
Integrated system,

82
00:04:58,976 --> 00:05:03,228
[INAUDIBLE],

83
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:07,921
>> Sure, great questions.

84
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:11,563
I think you doubt that we're in a world where moving from secret service,

85
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:14,619
more sort of accountable care organisations bundled payment

86
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:16,558
different things where you would say,

87
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:20,640
well it actually is the providers best interest not to repeat that task.

88
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,767
And part of the answer that he gets a bit too soon to really see that we

89
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:27,347
see a little bit of evidence that that a COS

90
00:05:27,347 --> 00:05:31,240
are adopting health information exchange for rapid.

91
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,081
So I think it's an early signal that they are taking seriously the need to have

92
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:38,761
better information and give them the opportunity to reduce redundancy.

93
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,919
But I think we're still really trying to see whether that actually can,

94
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:49,665
[INAUDIBLE] But I think that that is the biggest domain was involved in

95
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:51,926
the survey of the VCS last year.

96
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:56,398
And the number one HIT functionality that they said that they were

97
00:05:56,398 --> 00:06:01,535
investing in was it was called a, [INAUDIBLE] Alerted anyone heard of that.

98
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:07,079
>> [CROSSTALK] So it's different, [CROSSTALK]

99
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:11,951
>> Yeah there's another hand over there.

100
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,037
>> Yeah exactly so it's basically alerting something when a patient is either

101
00:06:20,037 --> 00:06:22,590
admitted discharged or transferred from the hospital.

102
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,050
So why wouldn't a CEO won with deaths and that technology?

103
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,675
What are you learning alerting the patient's primary care provider but

104
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:35,662
patients admitted to structure, >> Cuz the CEO is on the hook for

105
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:39,461
them getting committed places and expanding which they.

106
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,387
>> Right, so why do they want the,

107
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:44,651
[INAUDIBLE] To know that the patient has been excellent.

108
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,859
>> So you could like call them and say like don't go there,

109
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:53,937
come back here, >> [LAUGH]

110
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:55,043
>> In the best case scenario, right?

111
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:57,284
Is that what you need to learn from the in the ED and

112
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,574
the physician immediately contacted tries to stave off an admission.

113
00:07:00,574 --> 00:07:04,402
But that doesn't happen sort of the second best case scenario is that

114
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:09,088
when they're discharged from the hospital the decision actively tries to make sure

115
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:12,521
that the transition happen through the absolutely, right?

116
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:17,435
So I think again it's not quite the level of knowing that that's actually reducing

117
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:22,488
the emissions but it's a signal that they really are taking seriously investment and

118
00:07:22,488 --> 00:07:26,559
the technology tools will allow them basically way any time in my life

119
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,551
probably by this time next year.

120
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:30,760
That's really right now.
