1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:10,670
There's a whole industry. Okay.

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:18,290
How are we doing on that? Good. All right. So makes you realize how much you've learned active learning.

3
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:27,600
So today I want to go through, oh, I don't know, a dozen or so slides to sort of recap and.

4
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:34,150
But you know. And I mean, this is.

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:42,820
From my perspective on unusual, of course, you know, we don't ask of you.

6
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,480
We want you to come. We want you to participate in the discussion.

7
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,230
We hope you. That's it.

8
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,850
And as a sort of lifelong launch into this world of.

9
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:05,600
Responsible conduct of research or practice. You know, it's something that's in the background for us.

10
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:15,560
This is the guy. This is basically the key reference for NIH.

11
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,080
You've heard excerpts from that. It's been on a number of the briefings.

12
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:28,080
Okay. And, you know, that's that's kind of the guidance for the set up of this course with the nine modules and so forth.

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,980
So to start off today, who's this person?

14
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,590
Yeah. What do you know about her? Where is she these days?

15
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:48,900
In person. Okay, now come. Yeah, she's about.

16
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,880
A lot of drama. Yeah. Yeah.

17
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:02,940
So they defrauded investors based on a claimed advance in science with this gizmo here,

18
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:09,720
which promised to diagnose a tiny drop, not even a drop of your blood, and tell you all kinds of things.

19
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:17,160
And, you know, being an instrument of systems like this and it has all of these things which typically take up a whole,

20
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,090
you know, bench and require like maintenance and everything else.

21
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:28,360
So she promised to put it all in a tiny little box. Small text.

22
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,310
That's an image not to scale. And also. Yeah.

23
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:40,700
Well, so. So, you know, this is, of course, about research responsibility.

24
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,360
And I mean, she was a businesswoman, okay?

25
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,350
And she got caught, but she had lots of scientists working for her.

26
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,360
Okay. And where are those scientists at this point? You're not in jail.

27
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,450
All right. Should they? Today perpetuate the fraud.

28
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,269
Would you work for a company like this? You're going to be you got to do Masters Degree.

29
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:19,379
You've got an expertise this company needs to throw at you $300,000 plus a bonus, you know, or an enormous salary.

30
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,420
Right, for these and startups. Very tempting, right?

31
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,910
Where does your responsibility start to say?

32
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:45,600
This is from. So I think that they had very strict non-disclosure agreements so they couldn't disclose.

33
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:59,200
It's very interesting to think of who's this guy? Well, I don't expect you know,

34
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:13,980
he's a researcher who published all kinds of stuff on Alzheimer's by we are getting tremendous advancement in his career in a

35
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:26,370
very young age when he presented her and others that were cited thousands of times that led to what is almost $300 million of.

36
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:32,740
Money addressing neurological disease and Alzheimer's specifically.

37
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:44,230
And it seems like it's always a problem. Based on his manipulation of images and eating patterns and things like this one, he was caught.

38
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,000
And he won prizes for neuroscience and so forth.

39
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:59,910
Yeah. You should ask me where this guy is now, and. I don't know. I don't know if he's still at this university.

40
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:17,049
And who's this guy? Well, again, I don't expect you to know either, but he's the editor in chief of one of the journal Science, you know,

41
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:23,740
a very prestigious journal, which, in fact, published some of the other guy's work and had to retract them.

42
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:34,270
And he gave an editorial this year, a few months ago talking about how we need to improve this process,

43
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:40,480
because retraction is a very hard process and very few articles are, in fact, retracted.

44
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:47,350
And in fact, journals need to understand and collaborate among themselves.

45
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:55,390
Because if I take a fraudulent piece of work and it's rejected from science and try to publish it in nature or some other journal,

46
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:05,050
you know, we're just spreading the problem. Right. So there's a need to sort of have some degree of collaboration here to have an effective process.

47
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:10,690
And in fact, one of the very positive things coming out of this, in fact, is expedited process.

48
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:18,740
And this article talks about corporate on publication ethics, which has been adopted by many other drug.

49
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:32,230
So you know this course with the Satanic Guide and the modules that were in his guide and then added to it,

50
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:41,250
we've covered these nine different topics and you've had exposure to nine different faculty to get nine different perspectives on these things,

51
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,590
and I hope you've gotten good stuff out of that.

52
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,540
In fact, I'm going to ask you what you remember from each one of these modules.

53
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,979
So, you know, a little PowerPoint to start off with. I mean, you're mostly first year students.

54
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:04,020
You're going to be here for another year, but you have a road, your career path in front of you.

55
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:10,310
You have lots of decisions. You should make them actively. There will be lots of signs along the way.

56
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,350
Road post, milepost, whatever. Lots of things to take care of.

57
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,230
And you know, the guy here with this course is to, you know,

58
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:31,760
lay out some expectations and provide some sort of benchmarks or pillars or whatever you want to call them, something that you can always refer to.

59
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:39,590
And the key things for responsible conduct, research like for pillars here and we've talked about codes of ethics,

60
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,400
government regs, your institutional policies, but then you have them and then your own belief system.

61
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,559
And so this is what you fall back on. Okay. And key thing.

62
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:59,450
So, you know, if you guys don't have a code that you're affiliated with, that's okay.

63
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:07,030
But I always urge you as a student to enroll in a professional society, get their journal, okay?

64
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,249
For a student, it's very, very cheap. And, you know,

65
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:19,400
go to some of the meetings and things like that and you can learn a lot of things to get along on the perspective that you're moving into.

66
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:27,230
So join whatever it is, whatever society, epidemiology, exposure, science, environmental science.

67
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:35,120
Okay, there are lots of professional societies you should join and then get your advisor to pay for a trip to their meeting and some nice fun.

68
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,600
Do that to. So, you know,

69
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:52,580
when we show things like the Toronto debacle or I think we had talked about the Duke University situation earlier and lots of other cases,

70
00:08:52,970 --> 00:09:00,980
you know, when this becomes public, we lose trust, we lose credibility, we lose our sense of integrity.

71
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,460
And so we need very strong approaches to, you know.

72
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,960
Minimize these kinds of things and to address them properly and so on.

73
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:16,449
You know, we need definitions for kind of we need protection,

74
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:22,120
we need outline the procedures to report, investigate, and we need whistleblower protection.

75
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:31,660
And that's really key because if you report misconduct and then you are penalized, then no one's going to do it.

76
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,040
And so we need that kind of protection.

77
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:43,050
Okay. So, you know, we have these nine modules. We talked about human subjects.

78
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,580
Who did human subjects with you? Do you remember?

79
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:56,340
Oh, really? Yeah. So did she talk about any experiences that she had with human subjects?

80
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:10,910
Do you remember any. Yeah, I know that.

81
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,530
Like the old workers. The same meal, so.

82
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,640
Yeah. Yeah. So that's. Okay.

83
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,450
You talk about her? He. Okay.

84
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:35,010
Okay. Yeah. I mean, I've been, you know, ever since. I guess.

85
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,930
I guess I've been doing human subjects research.

86
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:43,740
Even in my master's degree, we have like American studies, but I wasn't a PR or anything like that, obviously, you know,

87
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:51,210
and well, we've had people behind us who are enrolled in our study, you know, for some of the things I do with med school.

88
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:59,990
What happens? It's a recordable incident.

89
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:09,320
Right. Okay. And, you know, if it was if we are associated with that, then that's a huge problem.

90
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,700
You know, fortunately, these are people who die from other causes.

91
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:18,020
But it's a reportable. And so if you have to provide it, obviously the irony.

92
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:27,530
But she should have talked to you about consenting and things like this and making sure people understand, you know, the risks and the benefits.

93
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:36,560
And, of course, you know, you're responsible for the compliance with the rules of your institutional review board.

94
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:44,799
Right. So I'd be, you know. Right. Animal research.

95
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,140
I know. And I talked to a neighbor and she had this is not my field.

96
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,980
I come to public health to get away from animals, to be honest.

97
00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:01,540
But, you know, some people love animal models and things like that. Did she talk about any particular experience that stands out?

98
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,950
This is the fall of the know.

99
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,030
Anything of. She talked about dosing of animals or if you want them to remember.

100
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:34,000
Talking about some mistakes that were made. And she talked about that acetate and dosing from before.

101
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:40,790
Where. Okay.

102
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,860
I know she was near the beginning. So that's what they're trying to pull from you guys.

103
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't know else. I would like.

104
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,320
Yeah, well, there's a beauty mouse which changes color, but, you know, easy thing to look at.

105
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,310
Okay. Well, I don't know because I don't do that,

106
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:13,820
except that sometimes we test the levels of chemicals because see a white who talks to you, Deb Watkins, if I recall.

107
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,380
Right. So how did that go? Do you remember?

108
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,180
You guys remember anything I've been talking to you about?

109
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:32,050
No. Oh, you had the fight. We talked about.

110
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:43,610
Like research from somewhere. Yeah, exactly.

111
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:53,270
I mean, U of M has very I wouldn't say completely comprehensive, but fairly comprehensive seal disclosure rule so that if you serve on the board,

112
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,580
whether you're paid now, which is quite interesting, you have to report back.

113
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:04,340
So, you know, if I do advice to the state government, I think state governments are exempt.

114
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,050
But if I am on the board of an NGO.

115
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:21,830
But clearly if I'm doing consulting or if I get a contract from another place and the government is really crazy fixated on international.

116
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:30,850
Okay. So if I take money from Germany or whatever country, I have to ensure that every grant.

117
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:38,240
So I feel like it really is not only financial gain, but it's also work commitments.

118
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,400
So if I'm spending more too much of my time on some other project now on

119
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,240
university time that I have to report that and intellectual and personal matters.

120
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:53,600
And that can even be if I'm giving, you know, favoritism to one of my former students or something like that.

121
00:14:54,340 --> 00:15:00,400
Okay. That is a potential civil war. All right.

122
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,390
Data management who talk to you about data.

123
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,480
I think it was intellectual property with Jim to watch.

124
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,180
I'm glad I caught my keychain here because I'm sorry I didn't remember that.

125
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,639
So the question is, who owns research data? And this is non-trivial.

126
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:33,290
And it's getting much more complicated because as of March next year, to get in each grant, you now have to commit to sharing your data.

127
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,320
One more thing. Okay. It means I need a data manager for every project.

128
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:47,810
Why are they doing? Yeah.

129
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,100
The data's complete basically a replicate studies.

130
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,850
Yeah. And other people can look at your data and avoid problems that might be there.

131
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:02,960
So just one more burden, you know, and if you're in private industry, obviously you don't do that.

132
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,340
You're taking the girl. Know.

133
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:16,120
And I'll talk to you a little bit about archiving data and the fair principles, if you remember ways to archive your data essentially forever.

134
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,899
So that's pretty cool. AU mentor and trainee responsibilities.

135
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,590
And you should remember this. That was like. Yeah.

136
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,950
Good. So what did he tell you? He remembers something.

137
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:42,030
You talk about? Between the TV and.

138
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,300
Everything that the winter was.

139
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:54,030
Guys have been on this. Okay.

140
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:59,290
So honesty, communication. Good.

141
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,980
How many of you have met with your advisor this term?

142
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,490
How many of you met with your advisor? More than once.

143
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:16,450
Good. Okay, everybody. Sure. Okay. Because this is a key individual for you.

144
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:23,260
I mean, you're going to need letters of recommendation. How do you go to your advisor?

145
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,530
Okay. I mean, I wrote like 14 of them this term.

146
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,160
Okay. And, I mean, I'm happy to do that.

147
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,200
And it's part of the job. Okay. But that's only a limited role.

148
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,720
It's somebody who can connect you to. You can provide some input.

149
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,430
You know, you can disregard it. You don't even have to like if you don't like to, you're going to.

150
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:50,429
But I mean, they're there to help you. And it is really part of the job.

151
00:17:50,430 --> 00:18:00,030
And it's part of a commitment that we feel. So anyway, that's important in that respect is important.

152
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,110
You know, you guys don't always have to agree, but at least you have a clear understanding of what the goals are and.

153
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:13,320
If you don't agree, you should still. Committed to have some sort of productive and supportive.

154
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,720
So that's a difference in graduate school and a difference at Michigan for many other schools as well.

155
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:28,910
We really do want to emphasize this. Okay.

156
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:37,040
Collaborative research. And I think we call this the global work workplace.

157
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:44,600
And I think Jacky Goodridge talked to you about that. Is there something that stood out in your mind in her presentation and discussion with you?

158
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:53,400
Yes. You have to work with countries where they have different types of restrictions.

159
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,150
So. To make sure that.

160
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:06,080
Translation. And understanding of what maybe they will not be like the same level of.

161
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,020
Did she give an example? You know her.

162
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:21,190
How they ended up having stricter restrictions. Yeah, that's interesting.

163
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:29,379
I mean, translation I have to do get things translated into Spanish and even Michigan work in Arabic too sometimes.

164
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:35,460
But dealing with like in an Arabic country where you can come in and see it.

165
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,860
It's very interesting. Very different. That's interesting.

166
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:50,980
What else did you talk about? To talk about how we can do communication between the teams that are required to.

167
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,170
It's very important to obtain a very good picture.

168
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,810
Yeah. The findings.

169
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,350
For for some of the global projects about but also for the.

170
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,520
Yeah. That's that's really interesting. In effect. Yeah. You know, I did this kind of work.

171
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:16,050
And once you do these overseas work, your commitment kind of never stops to change.

172
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,480
So, like, on Thursday, I have to give a talk at a keynote for opening for a new building.

173
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,570
You know, you gotta. I'm here 6 hours, 5 hours time difference, whatnot.

174
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,420
But, you know, it's just that you just have to put yourself out there and to keep helping.

175
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:40,080
To the extent that you feel like you can. So anyway, a lot of stuff here.

176
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:49,500
I also talked about this with respect to you biasing your work and improving its representativeness,

177
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,220
where instead of competing with other teams, you collaborate with them.

178
00:20:53,670 --> 00:21:00,030
And so it's a very interesting philosophy, you know, if you can possibly approach it that way.

179
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:07,900
Authorship and publication. And who did this?

180
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:18,930
Yeah. So this was the one you guys did remotely. And I understand you brought you into sort of some sort of job.

181
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:38,520
Any moments that you want to share? It was the first.

182
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,190
Okay. So authorship order. Yeah.

183
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,480
Yeah. So, I mean, you know, he's at a point where, you know, he's got.

184
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:04,370
Publications. Who cares if you remember one anymore? Right. So, I mean, senior faculty are like a junior faculty or not.

185
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,180
Okay. They need to be corresponding senior or.

186
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:16,000
Edit or whatever. Some journals get around this by actually saying what each person did.

187
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:24,970
But whoever looks at that, I don't believe that that's what they. So in authorship is a big deal.

188
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,150
But there's more, obviously, because, you know,

189
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:37,110
you need to have enough of a description of the work so that others can valuated interpret the results appropriately.

190
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:45,150
And you want to have completeness. And we talked about this a little bit, too, and the greater responsibility part that I give you guys.

191
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:59,020
And that kind of leads into peer review. And I think peer review we kind of did throughout the course in many ways.

192
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:07,690
And so, you know, I think we have a lot of feelings about peer review here.

193
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:18,560
It was just here. But it's challenging. And increasingly challenging given all the churning, all the work that's involved.

194
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:29,920
All right, Reagan responsibility. So I did this with you, and I kind of love these old guys looking at the blackboard.

195
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:35,710
Something happens, and then a miracle occurs. And then I get the results that I anticipated.

196
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:41,380
You know, I want to. Okay. And the was there as well.

197
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:50,660
So there's lots of stuff here. And we talked about how rigor and responsibility can be, if only part of.

198
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:58,560
Okay. And, you know, the bottom line, though, is that you want it to be.

199
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:06,530
Impactful. You want it to be credible. They want it to apply to not just your lab experiment, but more broadly.

200
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:15,180
That's what they produce for. All right.

201
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,760
So really, this is the wrap up slot.

202
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:30,360
And all of these nine pieces are explicit attempts to ensure that both you and the work that you do has integrity and the pillars.

203
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:38,860
The basis of integrity really is citizenship and protection, combined with citizenship and honesty.

204
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,490
Inaccurate, inefficient and obviously false.

205
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:53,250
We've. Know, this is really just the take home message for this course is that we want you to incorporate these values.

206
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:58,260
We want them to be explicit in your thinking about challenges that you have.

207
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:03,750
We want you to have this sense of integrity and expectation of integrity.

208
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,540
So I'm here on the pulpit preaching this stuff to you.

209
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:18,090
Okay. But it's really important. And it defines the difference between sort of science evidence based approach.

210
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:32,300
Okay. And the rest of. You don't have to agree as a participant in society that this is what you want to find, that this is what we should strive for.

211
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,820
And so that's the message.

212
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:44,840
That's what the course is about, sort of explicit steps that can be taken that are out there for you to use, that you need to be aware of.

213
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,680
Okay. To have this integrity.

214
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,650
So to follow.

215
00:25:54,250 --> 00:26:01,899
Yeah. All right. So I've got a couple more minutes.

216
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:12,580
Okay. I wanted to have a discussion here about the course format and structure and anything that went well that that could be improved.

217
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:27,250
I'm always interested. I'm going to send you this week another survey that has to do with the last four or instructors that you have.

218
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,649
Just like the one that I did before, a number of these folks are new to the course.

219
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:39,610
They have not done this before. And so I would like to get some feedback as well.

220
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:49,260
So. Prove more than just what others. So I will put that out on.

221
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:55,200
I guess I will just be like the last one, I guess.

222
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,710
But right now, in terms of just power structure, you know, it's a pass fail class.

223
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,250
I am always eager to do pass fail classes because I don't have the grade.

224
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:17,459
But on the other hand, I really want you guys to be motivated to do the readings, to attend the class and so forth and pass fail.

225
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:24,460
I have no. Paris and no cameras here.

226
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,660
No push things along. Right. So should this be a different.

227
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:44,330
From. All right.

228
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,080
How about the good class? What would it do better? What would get you more?

229
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:11,050
Over. Personally, I. I know that was done where?

230
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:16,070
Olivia is being honest. Did you do that in another section?

231
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:25,100
Yeah. That's a good sign.

232
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,859
I encourage folks to do that. But, you know, we we get up here on these PowerPoints.

233
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,500
We have so many slides to go through. You just run out of time.

234
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:38,920
And, you know, I do feel it's important to cover the content, but yeah, it's important.

235
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,780
Thanks for that. What else?

236
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,940
I appreciated it when the lecture.

237
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:05,700
For instance, just talking about the three. Especially when the reading is like an article that.

238
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,100
A little more interesting. Was there something that you remember?

239
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:28,380
Is the paper about? Yeah.

240
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:35,900
Well, you know, it's interesting because I brought in some newer people.

241
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,710
The guidance and of course, the guidance. It's supposed to be.

242
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,750
You know, I can reach back decades of memory.

243
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:56,360
Think about stuff right now. Some of these junior people don't have a.

244
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:01,740
But. So. So, you know, obviously.

245
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:08,370
So I appreciate that. I mean, we should be talking from personal.

246
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,550
Talking about how. It's just nice to hear.

247
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:29,590
We call that authenticity. And so, you know, if you're going to be an effective teacher, you can teach both.

248
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,540
But that's where you.

249
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:44,660
To recognize that everybody has. Yeah.

250
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:54,409
I guess one suggestion I might make would be to have the days for, like, a monday and Tuesday course, maybe just a little bit further,

251
00:30:54,410 --> 00:31:02,570
so that if you do have something happen, there's a chance to make a course later versus like if something happens on Monday.

252
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,060
All right. So we start with. Yeah.

253
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:11,910
Yeah. So. Yeah. Emergency or something like that.

254
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,540
It just might be nice to have an option. Yeah. No, that's good.

255
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:20,720
I have to say, I don't do the scheduling, but I. Um.

256
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:26,940
Yeah, I mean, it's here most of the time. Each week was the same on Monday and Tuesday, but a couple of weeks.

257
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:43,750
How about any other changes to the format that. You know, we give instructors carte blanche.

258
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,490
You know it's like a legal to do with some type of.

259
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:00,410
They don't feel super. I mean, like, maybe there's, like, a.

260
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,390
Oh, you're thinking of the public? I think a lot of.

261
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:15,250
Right. Yeah.

262
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,380
You know, so I just think that means that. It means that, like. Like.

263
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,370
Like I didn't have. Deeply entrenched.

264
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:29,410
Yeah. Yeah. No, I really think that.

265
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:39,530
But but but, you know, with all of our and the reason for this is that many of our students, including some of our students, are supported from.

266
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,860
So we're required to provide this training for.

267
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:57,200
Yeah. And then I like that. So then I had to do something a lot earlier and things like that.

268
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,050
Perfect. Yeah, but.

269
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:09,090
Okay. What kind of building?

270
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,950
She said. Are you allowed to bring in people from industry?

271
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:20,610
Yeah, because that might. I feel like that might resonate with people who are in huge degree tracks.

272
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:25,860
Is there a particular topic? Do you get it? Not necessarily.

273
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:30,590
I guess from an industrial hygiene standpoint like the global workforce,

274
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:39,600
it might be interesting to see how somebody from industry kind of navigates working with people from other countries or something.

275
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,530
And I don't know, I think that might just be a little bit more applicable.

276
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:49,170
Yeah, no, that's a great suggestion. Not just a research perspective.

277
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:57,690
Sorry. Yeah. Yeah, I could certainly see some of this applying for conflict of interest stuff.

278
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,780
Yeah. Um. And I.

279
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,170
It's. Has made it research.

280
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,770
Okay. But, you know, they're not exactly bringing down my dad.

281
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,900
But I mean, I do have to. We're doing this, but that's how we got here.

282
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,000
For me, the challenge is the hard to get focus.

283
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:24,770
And so, you know, it's even harder to get.

284
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:35,380
In the past we have had folks elsewhere in the university particularly dealing with.

285
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,320
Also dealing with conflicts of interest, because we have although it's very interesting,

286
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,010
we have an office for Research Integrity and they refuse to purchase any.

287
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:59,890
So President Obama, I know that for the most part was supposed to be in person, but if we did like a lecture, we'll be a zoo.

288
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,760
Okay, we do like that maybe more. But you yourself do something in industry.

289
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:14,210
For sure. Something for sure. I never changed their guidance regarding face to face small classes.

290
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:33,410
We assume, you know, you're going to have. Doctors really like filling out a lot of our questions like you didn't see or like.

291
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,860
So online you just. Yeah, we had like a Google pie, but like each group and like put it.

292
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:52,910
I thought that was like. That's what we were saying, how we did all this in one out.

293
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:58,690
Yeah. Quickly, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. All right.

294
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:12,190
But my favorite. I felt like that was. And this was done in context.

295
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,500
Yeah. You know what, three groups or. Yeah, sure.

296
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,510
Compared to. Four or five questions.

297
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:27,170
Okay. And where the question based around some scenario.

298
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:34,930
Yeah. He gave like a couple guidelines for like each question, which was like the other [INAUDIBLE].

299
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:46,940
All right. Nothing about peer review. You.

300
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:52,570
No, I mean, you know, he's he's obviously an.

301
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:05,460
He's gone now. This is the last year because we actually recruited him a long time ago to come in here.

302
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:14,220
You get a cup of coffee together or we. And I think also was really good.

303
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:22,570
I like that you have a bunch of different. I really.

304
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:30,830
Really? Yeah. Well, I'm all for interdisciplinarity and her professionalism.

305
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,370
Speak the lingo or epidemiologist or whatever.

306
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:43,710
Public health. Nice doodles.

307
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,400
Okay. Anything else? Sorry. Promise?

308
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:51,780
No problem overall. All right.

309
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:59,720
Well, I know you feel like you have the whole term ahead of you in the next week or two, but you don't to be done with the term.

310
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:06,360
And beyond that, you're traveling all over the place and travel day, hopefully.

311
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:16,070
Whatever. No answers.

312
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,880
Just how do you think about it? Yes, I want.

313
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:26,250
Oh, I don't know. Now I know this is yours.

314
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,610
Well, if you know, I know your name on it.

315
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:34,910
Well, don't worry about it. I look all right.

316
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:41,560
I do want the attendance. You know what I just discovered on the bathroom?

317
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:46,170
Things were another one of the really bizarre.

318
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:51,870
Did you not have one? Well, no, I wasn't saying.

319
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:59,010
Yeah. Because I mean, often, you know, you're pregnant.

320
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,490
So maybe like maybe like their phone.

321
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:14,350
So I just. Yeah. You know, if you are.

322
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:21,020
You thought about the other stuff. Yeah. Good luck with your business.

323
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:25,530
Oh, okay. You know, it's very.

324
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:48,639
Right? Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm very happy holidays, but we're early.

325
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,700
We're just, uh.

326
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,210
Yeah. Thank you.

327
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:08,230
I thank you so much. Thank you. Okay.

328
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:17,720
So. Thank you. That's just so you know, product, 40 year old business.

329
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,929
Yeah. I think, you know, it's just a balancing act.

330
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:30,040
But you're right there to the break.

331
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:36,920
So. You know, with respect to the support.

332
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:43,360
Oh, my gosh. Oh, dear. Oh, honey, it's all right.

333
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:49,270
What the [INAUDIBLE] happened? So they just went through.

334
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:52,870
Yeah. So I had that first surgery.

335
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,240
Then perhaps. And then they grew.

336
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:07,290
Much of that has to has looked like the on the basis of cartilage.

337
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,810
Okay. So I like a little bit more cartilage.

338
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,379
Okay. Okay. So it's going to grow. Yeah.

339
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:21,810
So over the next six months, I like to fill up. It's like a big piece of the movement.

340
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,380
It's pretty. It's really rare for someone my age to get it.

341
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:36,100
A last ditch. Knee replacement, which so far do they have to do another operation?

342
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,150
We wouldn't know it all for you.

343
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,939
Like I think they use like this. So it's like this.

344
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:47,500
All that part is like. Like. So I will just.

345
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:53,040
Because they are not supposed to be wearing them. And then they cut.

346
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,370
You? Certainly. So this is just another of one.

347
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:07,180
You just on the one. This one will probably have something for you.

348
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:12,920
It's. It's not the first. But.

349
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:18,910
Well, you you sit through this class or somehow you.

350
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:22,630
So no idea how I.

351
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:38,120
You know, I'm really glad to have you back on your feet, you know, and I'll be able to walk in like Friday on Friday you to two weeks.

352
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:43,150
I can start with the breaks. And we had the surgery.

353
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:51,140
Yeah. So, I mean, I. It's just a little complicated.

354
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:58,310
Just like so they did that the tibia and then they put an olive branch like so.

355
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:05,139
I didn't know until I woke up then if this was a full yes.

356
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:09,400
So I actually when I was a junior here, I fell on the stairs and.

357
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,820
And that was the first time. Well, it.

358
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:24,620
And that's when I decided that it was my cartilage, just.

359
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,780
Obviously there's nothing wrong with it.

360
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:33,440
Well, let's hope so.

361
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:39,070
It I because they didn't think this was some sort of.

362
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:48,850
She's at the. But she's out.

363
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:56,780
But she's out. And that's for. Yeah. Yeah, I like those guys there that's always been there.

364
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,000
Yeah, well, I mean, that's is one of the problems because for you.

365
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:08,380
Level of physical condition. We got feet. It's so hard, you know?

366
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:13,770
And so I ended up getting one of these bicycle things for your arms.

367
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:24,510
It's good for your heart. I mean, I always like to try to be funny, but it's really hard because your legs are so.

368
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:32,120
Now they're just taking shape. It's hard to believe we have.

369
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:37,780
So. I like my work.

370
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:46,770
After three weeks or so now, I'm, like, fully able to read your what do they call you?

371
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:53,389
Like, I just have this thing that I wasn't supposed to spend it.

372
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:57,230
You can unlock it, but I can't. Unless.

373
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,770
It's not of the muscles and they're strong enough to.

374
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:12,870
All right, well, look, I'm so happy to see you.

375
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:16,300
Think so?

376
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:22,860
So everybody's on board with that, I.

377
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,950
Five or six. So if you.

378
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:48,930
You know, like I. Adviser.

379
00:45:52,500 --> 00:46:05,680
Your relationship with your. So figuring out a strategy at this point.

380
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,150
The film. Is.

381
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:37,440
Sorry. I mean, this is the first time we've been around, so I don't know.

382
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:51,620
Discuss. You know, there are services available.

383
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:16,910
I don't. You talk to somebody should.

384
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:37,270
What? Question. Your advisor.

385
00:47:41,230 --> 00:48:01,690
Also. So with respect to this course, you know.

386
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,880
A good example. You write a couple paragraphs.

387
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:13,350
Module you should still send it to.

388
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:32,970
Actually. In his. A projector recording in the case where?

389
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,050
The Dr. Olivier.
