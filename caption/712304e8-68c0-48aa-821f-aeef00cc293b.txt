1
00:00:09,044 --> 00:00:09,554
Monica L Rosen: Because and.

2
00:00:09,764 --> 00:00:15,344
Monica L Rosen: I built in some things into this that allows us to go in whatever direction you want to go, so when we get to that.

3
00:00:15,374 --> 00:00:24,254
Monica L Rosen: kind of split off point you can let me know now that I breezed over a few things and we can take a deeper dive in those based on what you what Piques your interest that sounds.

4
00:00:25,664 --> 00:00:36,404
Monica L Rosen: awesome so i'll go ahead and get started here and because it's just you in here we can kind of skip over this, if you have questions just you know unmute yourself and let's have a conversation.

5
00:00:39,554 --> 00:00:45,194
Monica L Rosen: So what I had planned originally for this workshop is we'll we'll kind of go over what active learning is.

6
00:00:45,284 --> 00:00:53,714
Monica L Rosen: I think their rate that's teaching has a pretty good idea, but we'll kind of go back to like what those definitions are pull into the different tools that will be talking about.

7
00:00:54,104 --> 00:01:05,024
Monica L Rosen: And then I want to compare and contrast attendance based participation and inclusive based participation and kind of distinguish between you know where do they overlap and how do they differ.

8
00:01:05,684 --> 00:01:15,704
Monica L Rosen: Then i'll describe a couple of alternative strategies for assessing participation which aren't like the traditional ways like you know the button seat you're here i'll give you full credit and we'll talk about other ways that you can assess.

9
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:23,804
Monica L Rosen: Participation besides just that kind of blanket statement of attendance and then we'll kind of very briefly talk about the different tools that.

10
00:01:24,524 --> 00:01:37,664
Monica L Rosen: The instructors in our school at the university level and up those school public health level can use and capitalize on to assess inclusive participation, including some of the newest tools that we just got this this coming semester.

11
00:01:38,714 --> 00:01:49,664
Monica L Rosen: So again, active learning includes you know teaching methods and strategies that involve student participation and engagement with the material in a meaningful way so that's kind of an a key component there.

12
00:01:50,294 --> 00:02:03,734
Monica L Rosen: It is an approach to instruction that involves actively engaging students with the course material and with each other, so in all areas of the classroom we have the tools we have the you know with heroes that they're learning and also each other and the instructor.

13
00:02:04,514 --> 00:02:16,154
Monica L Rosen: Through intentional types of reflections and discussions Problem Solving case studies role plays anything that if you've probably likely seen like a bloom's taxonomy talking about things that are a little bit more at that higher level.

14
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:23,024
Monica L Rosen: And some of the benefits that we know about active and learning includes you know enhances the student learning.

15
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:35,834
Monica L Rosen: and improve student performance during class in on assignments because it's you know, enhancing engagement and getting them to really think about where they're at right now, not zoning out with the phone or you know somewhere else, basically.

16
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,614
Monica L Rosen: So when we talk about active learning.

17
00:02:40,664 --> 00:02:47,414
Monica L Rosen: We have this scale here that goes from very simple forms of active learning to the most complex and most.

18
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:50,984
Monica L Rosen: involved types of forms of active learning.

19
00:02:51,464 --> 00:03:08,354
Monica L Rosen: On that lower end right there on the simple or we called simple, these are those low classroom time commitments they don't take too much time within the actual classroom they're normally more at the low stakes assessments levels and they include lower instructor prep.

20
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:21,194
Monica L Rosen: prep time and they're a little bit more on the reflective level so you've probably seen things like you know these pauses in your in your lecture component for reflection, whether that's just for students to do on their own, a one minute moment.

21
00:03:21,464 --> 00:03:28,544
Monica L Rosen: Or maybe they're doing something like I think pair share where they're kind of splitting off for 510 minutes to talk with a peer or a small group.

22
00:03:28,784 --> 00:03:34,754
Monica L Rosen: about what they're learning so they're reiterating the stuff that they're learning in their own words which helps solidify that knowledge.

23
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:43,484
Monica L Rosen: On the other end at the very high level at a complex level we're talking about things that require a little bit more classroom time commitment.

24
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:59,384
Monica L Rosen: Sometimes they might extend over the entire classroom over the Semester they're a little bit typically on that more higher stakes assessments and they do typically require a little bit more instructor prep to get those up and running.

25
00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:10,064
Monica L Rosen: But they are considered a little bit more a form of more authentic and real world, so, especially if you have those higher level courses where students are now taking the concepts that they've learned.

26
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:16,634
Monica L Rosen: Previously, and trying to apply it to the real world and practicing those skills, these are better and for those.

27
00:04:17,684 --> 00:04:27,284
Monica L Rosen: Those types of learnings and i'll tell you different types of tools that kind of map on to to this, depending on what your own classroom goals are for your own students.

28
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:37,934
Dana Thomas: Could you say i'm sorry i'm a little bit more about two things I saw there, which I thought were interesting inquiry learning and just saw discussion.

29
00:04:38,324 --> 00:04:49,364
Monica L Rosen: i'm glad you brought those up because I I took a couple of these I didn't go into inquiry learning deeply, but I do have a section that about jigsaw discussions, which is really cool.

30
00:04:50,624 --> 00:05:02,384
Monica L Rosen: So I just saw discussions are where you have different groups get split up and one group one member from each of those groups becomes the expert of a particular content, so they.

31
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:12,374
Monica L Rosen: They learn that material and then you scramble the group's up a little bit so each person is representing a different content expert teasing that knowledge and they share that knowledge with each other.

32
00:05:12,584 --> 00:05:18,644
Monica L Rosen: it'll make a little bit more sense, but I will whenever I get into their to that section i'll talk about a little bit more.

33
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:30,554
Monica L Rosen: um so again I kind of said this already when we were looking at that map, but when we kind of talked about the simple and the complex.

34
00:05:30,794 --> 00:05:43,154
Monica L Rosen: I kind of break this up by you know how much class time is required to devote to them how much instructor prep is required, and then how how much those each of those assessments are really worth.

35
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:53,384
Monica L Rosen: So here we have like those ones that are on the far left bottom the simple ones lower class time prep lower instructor prep lower stakes.

36
00:05:53,774 --> 00:06:07,304
Monica L Rosen: prep and the purpose is a little bit more reflective where it's on the complex a little bit more time intensive for the instructor and for the students assessments are a little bit more high stakes, but you do have that more real world authentic type of application for them.

37
00:06:09,554 --> 00:06:13,574
Monica L Rosen: So I did have a poll everywhere here but it's just us and you kind of already.

38
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:23,294
Monica L Rosen: gave me a little bit of adjust to the ones that you're interested in it within query learning and jigsaw discussion, so I won't have you fill this out because it'll be an, no one will make a whole lot of sense there.

39
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:31,964
Monica L Rosen: So one thing I do want to talk about is how do we prep for this, how do we design a course with active learning.

40
00:06:32,294 --> 00:06:40,904
Monica L Rosen: in mind and I kind of break this down into three simple steps, and this is goes along with almost any good course design process.

41
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:45,944
Monica L Rosen: That is, you know, having a pretty good idea of what your core schools are or articulating what you want the.

42
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:54,014
Monica L Rosen: students to learn through some type of formalized learning objectives and then from there, assessing what does your classroom environment looks look like.

43
00:06:54,284 --> 00:07:00,914
Monica L Rosen: Are you in person, are you online, who are the students from what backgrounds are they coming from how much knowledge are they bringing in.

44
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:05,414
Monica L Rosen: Here working for instance in the online program you may be bringing in like caretakers and.

45
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:16,784
Monica L Rosen: Individuals who have a lot 20 years of experience in the real world and those things are kind of important when we're trying to assess what is the best type of active learning strategy to implement in that classroom.

46
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:29,264
Monica L Rosen: And then, once we kind of ironed out those two steps, the next step would be to what what tools align best with those learning objectives that will help assist the students achieving those course goals.

47
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:39,854
Monica L Rosen: So it's never they know that smart have an idea to be like, I want to implement this tool, because I want to implement it, so it has to have a purpose we're using it for a reason not just you know, trying to put.

48
00:07:40,364 --> 00:07:43,934
Monica L Rosen: It into our course when it doesn't really fit or it's not really achieving the goal.

49
00:07:45,854 --> 00:07:52,244
Monica L Rosen: So, as I mentioned before we can kind of think about these when we think a little bit through the strategy of the bloom's taxonomy their.

50
00:07:52,514 --> 00:08:05,174
Monica L Rosen: Active learning is primarily associated with the top half of of bloom's up here and, if we look at how the various learning activities are late to this taxonomy we get something that kind of flips this a little bit.

51
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:14,474
Monica L Rosen: So, and that is that when we are having students helped teach each other when they are actually practicing and applying those are concepts.

52
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:25,874
Monica L Rosen: These this is more along the lines of like what our instructors, how are they prepping their course for it, and this is more or less, how does the student consuming that knowledge to kind of think of those as like kind of a flipped upside down.

53
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:39,374
Monica L Rosen: This gives us a better perspective, like, how do we want to set up our classroom and how do we want a time to be allocated so if we're sorry i've got like pop ups happening on my computer right now, no updates, please.

54
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:55,424
Monica L Rosen: How do we want to divvy up our time in the actual classroom if we want the classroom to be more that high level of bloom's and active in creation, then we should probably downplay a little bit of those lower level types of strategies, such as lecture.

55
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:11,804
Monica L Rosen: So, again kind of going back to the step to like the variables, to consider regarding creating that classroom environment for active learning, one thing I like to say I like is this little chart that we have this video here.

56
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:17,714
Monica L Rosen: All overlapping and that helps us kind of think of like what does that active learning ecosystem look like.

57
00:09:18,194 --> 00:09:25,244
Monica L Rosen: We have tech that can help us with it, this regard we have pedagogy and teaching strategies and we also have the environment.

58
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:30,644
Monica L Rosen: And so, when I talk about the environment, I don't necessarily just mean the physical invite element.

59
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:39,614
Monica L Rosen: I also mean the entire classroom environment, the students are included in the environment, the modality, whether this is a remote hybrid or in person type of class.

60
00:09:39,794 --> 00:09:50,324
Monica L Rosen: And then also what those interaction expectations are whether you're expecting students to interact with each other, regarding the classroom material synchronously only during the classroom time or if you're trying to.

61
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:54,344
Monica L Rosen: you're hoping to have more of a complete active learning.

62
00:09:55,034 --> 00:10:02,804
Monica L Rosen: process throughout the entire classroom time whether they're there in the physical classroom at that time or not so studying time or studying with each other.

63
00:10:03,224 --> 00:10:12,974
Monica L Rosen: And then also you know, there are some other constraints, we have to sometimes consider such as class size, sometimes it's not always feasible to do the same types of active learning activities.

64
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:19,874
Monica L Rosen: In a classroom about 200 students, as we could, in a more intimate 20 or 30 person classroom setting.

65
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:29,564
Monica L Rosen: But the main thing I try to take away from this is that we often say we're going to assess participation and then you look at the syllabus and participation includes.

66
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:38,174
Monica L Rosen: And that's not always the best way, because just because students attended your class doesn't necessarily mean that they are actually actively participating in.

67
00:10:40,694 --> 00:10:48,464
Monica L Rosen: The other thing I wanted to talk about and how this is relevant is the inclusive learning model inclusive learning and teaching recognizes that all students.

68
00:10:48,824 --> 00:11:00,524
Monica L Rosen: entitlement to a learning experience that respects diversity and it enables participation and removes barriers and anticipates and considers a variety of learning needs and so when we you know, think about active learning.

69
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:06,554
Monica L Rosen: and trying to get everybody to participate in the active learning process, we have to make sure that we are making it one.

70
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:19,814
Monica L Rosen: arm and available for them to all to be active during that participation, but sometimes the way that we set up our courses, especially in larger classrooms, for instance, students, will the quieter voices will go to the back.

71
00:11:20,294 --> 00:11:25,784
Monica L Rosen: You know those set off to the side they don't want to participate, so when we think about creating active learning tool.

72
00:11:26,114 --> 00:11:35,174
Monica L Rosen: strategies and especially using capitalizing and some of the tools that we have this may break down some barriers for the shy students to become more active in that learning process.

73
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:47,234
Monica L Rosen: So it the way I like to think about this is that if you have good thoughtful course design, with clear learning objectives and you marry this with a you know, a tool that's capitalizing on that learning objective, so that it aligns.

74
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:57,464
Monica L Rosen: Well, with those goals, this can help to then foster engagement and collaboration, which you know, leads to a better inclusive active learning environment for all students.

75
00:12:00,524 --> 00:12:08,654
Monica L Rosen: So then step three is like Well then, I have my core skills, I know what my course environment looks like now, I want to talk about what technologies will help me.

76
00:12:08,924 --> 00:12:11,684
Monica L Rosen: To create this active learning environment.

77
00:12:11,894 --> 00:12:24,704
Monica L Rosen: tools that emphasize engagement and collaboration, are our best aligned actually with active learning techniques and we've actually given a workshop that have a we have a recording and some materials on our research and teaching site.

78
00:12:25,214 --> 00:12:34,094
Monica L Rosen: That if you're interested in seeing a more overview of those tools you're more than welcome to go in there, but some of the ones I like to talk about our peer reviews.

79
00:12:34,694 --> 00:12:40,094
Monica L Rosen: peer reviews can be accomplished through tools such as perusal, which is a social annotation reader.

80
00:12:40,814 --> 00:12:52,454
Monica L Rosen: critic and which is one of the newest tools that we have in our toolbox that will brief over and then also the Google suite of tools as well also some people like the case studies.

81
00:12:52,874 --> 00:13:00,134
Monica L Rosen: Gala is a tool that's available to us that they get scholar a Gala I can't remember exactly how they pronounce that one and Google, so you can also be used as well.

82
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:17,744
Monica L Rosen: And then, some of the other ones such as simulations role plays and just jigsaw discussions can be you know use with creative thought with tools such as viewpoint yellow dig and also will sweep and I know that you had mentioned some interest in the jigsaw discussion.

83
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:22,244
Monica L Rosen: And so, this is kind of where I was saying, you know what direction should we go.

84
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:33,944
Monica L Rosen: Did you kind of want to discuss a little bit more of the different types of strategies, here are some of the ones that I have pulled out and flushed out a little bit more, or we can also jump to a couple of the tools.

85
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:35,834
Monica L Rosen: Did you have.

86
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:47,204
Dana Thomas: I would say, so I am interested in understanding jigsaw a little bit more, because we do peer reviews case studies and simulations already.

87
00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:49,094
Dana Thomas: So i'd be interested in that.

88
00:13:49,124 --> 00:13:53,714
Dana Thomas: But then I didn't sign up for the critic but was unable to attend.

89
00:13:55,064 --> 00:14:08,594
Dana Thomas: So i'd be interested in kind of understanding the tools, why i've used poll everywhere and i've used yellow day but all the others are new unless G sweet is that just Google right.

90
00:14:08,774 --> 00:14:20,144
Monica L Rosen: yeah that's just Google, but there's some interesting ways that i've seen instructors use Google sweet for collaboration with students, such as creating slide decks and then having everybody contribute to the slide deck things like that yeah.

91
00:14:20,354 --> 00:14:25,574
Dana Thomas: Okay yeah so those would be kind of what i'm interested in.

92
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:28,544
Dana Thomas: Since I have one I can control.

93
00:14:28,604 --> 00:14:29,744
Monica L Rosen: yeah exactly.

94
00:14:31,424 --> 00:14:36,314
Monica L Rosen: So yeah well discussions and then maybe we'll look at critical little bit.

95
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:40,094
Monica L Rosen: Luckily Joanna is recently just gave that critic.

96
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:54,284
Monica L Rosen: A workshop so i'm sure she can add a little bit more on that side, and then I know that you hadn't talked about her is Alba Cruz, was one of the ones that's coming up soon, and maybe maybe we'll if we have some time we'll jump into perusal as well.

97
00:14:57,644 --> 00:14:57,884
Oh.

98
00:15:06,944 --> 00:15:07,484
Monica L Rosen: Okay.

99
00:15:08,594 --> 00:15:23,174
Monica L Rosen: So jigsaw discussions these encourage students to develop collaboration skills so it'll, as I mentioned before, and it's considered a cooperative learning strategy strategy as a has groups of students.

100
00:15:23,744 --> 00:15:29,984
Monica L Rosen: become experts in a specific area, so they become a subject matter expert on a specific topic and.

101
00:15:30,824 --> 00:15:42,524
Monica L Rosen: Then they share the material with another group so in round one here we divide the students into those different groups, this is considered the focus groups and students are assigned to the same topic or some.

102
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:54,314
Monica L Rosen: People call this the expert groups and each expert group meets to strengthen each other's understanding of a particular topic so all of the group ones will all talk and they'll you know we.

103
00:15:54,854 --> 00:16:04,124
Monica L Rosen: Basically hammer down on certain key concepts are fill in the blanks for each other, and then you basically scrambled these, and this is where this is considered the test group or the jigsaw group.

104
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:15,314
Monica L Rosen: And in the jigsaw group, this new jigsaw groups are formed with one representative from each of the focus groups so that each student contributes to information about the topic and a jigsaw group.

105
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:23,624
Monica L Rosen: So this is kind of cool, especially for being in the actual classroom but you could imagine you could do something like this with the zoom breakout rooms as Joanna was saying.

106
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:32,084
Monica L Rosen: So we could have we could scramble everybody up into zoom breakout rooms group one, two and three, and then we could come back to the main room and then scramble those up again.

107
00:16:32,864 --> 00:16:40,574
Monica L Rosen: and have people talk that way, so I can see this working pretty well, both in a in a remote state or in the actual.

108
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:42,914
Monica L Rosen: Physical classroom.

109
00:16:48,614 --> 00:17:08,744
Dana Thomas: So with this Is this something that the students, would the focus group would have like some time like so they would have a week to become experts in that topic, and then the in class session, as the round, two, four, and it could be.

110
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:13,364
Monica L Rosen: It could be either way that you want, so it depends on the extent that they need to.

111
00:17:14,264 --> 00:17:23,534
Monica L Rosen: go into the material, so if we're talking a graduate level course where they really need to do, like some type of literature review this could be extended over several weeks.

112
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:34,724
Monica L Rosen: If it's more or I would say at it, you want those individuals become experts, experts at a surface level that they just spend maybe a you know, a day or a week or so getting to know that content.

113
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:43,064
Monica L Rosen: Strengthening with each other, the groups, then it could be shorter more compressed, and so this is one of those I think that we saw more at that mid high level.

114
00:17:43,574 --> 00:17:44,894
Monica L Rosen: But it's really more or less.

115
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:48,914
Monica L Rosen: You know how deep you wanted students to go with that material.

116
00:17:51,344 --> 00:17:51,764
Thanks.

117
00:17:56,534 --> 00:18:03,914
Monica L Rosen: let's see maybe this is a good point to talk a little bit about who would.

118
00:18:04,964 --> 00:18:11,444
Monica L Rosen: only be a better one let's go into critics and say that was one that you had brought up that you were interested in first so critic.

119
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:13,454
Monica L Rosen: Is an.

120
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:22,454
Monica L Rosen: API driven peer review platform that enables fair accurate and quality peer evaluations.

121
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:32,504
Monica L Rosen: It does this by calibrating students reviews with each other kind of like what you would see on if you're looking at Amazon reviews and some reviews me more than others.

122
00:18:32,984 --> 00:18:38,624
Monica L Rosen: People will get a certain badge or an indicator saying there are a star review or people your reviews really mean something.

123
00:18:39,164 --> 00:18:48,254
Monica L Rosen: That is integrated and critic as well, it does have an lta integration with canvas and for Sarah so things like it makes it very easy for to work with those elements.

124
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:58,484
Monica L Rosen: platforms already allows the grades that are collected from critic to be automatically pushed back into your gradebook and automatically enroll students into the critic tool.

125
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:05,084
Monica L Rosen: So, as I mentioned before, this is one of our very newest tools in our toolbox and we're still piloting this new tool.

126
00:19:05,324 --> 00:19:15,854
Monica L Rosen: And we are actually actively looking for interested faculty volunteers Sharon has been kind enough to say that she will you know purchase a few of these licenses for instructors who are interested in using it.

127
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:20,834
Monica L Rosen: And we do have a couple who are on board with with with working on it this year.

128
00:19:22,214 --> 00:19:29,414
Monica L Rosen: We do have a video recording of the DEMO with an s pH instructors and the critic Dima critic representatives.

129
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:40,424
Monica L Rosen: That we have available and will share the slides afterward and now we have some materials that we put in her room is a teaching canvas site from the training that we've worked with earlier this week.

130
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:43,064
Monica L Rosen: So this is kind of what it looks.

131
00:19:44,294 --> 00:19:58,964
Monica L Rosen: Like for the actual peer review process students go through three main stages, the first stage is called the create stage where students create their submission, so this is really just submitting whatever it is that they would be putting in for peer review.

132
00:19:59,474 --> 00:20:04,754
Monica L Rosen: All of these scores that are in here, you can alter these you can change how you want the weights, to be.

133
00:20:05,234 --> 00:20:14,024
Monica L Rosen: Normally the actual physical the real deliverable the students have to get his you know ranked the highest is the most points because first get the assignment done.

134
00:20:14,354 --> 00:20:21,884
Monica L Rosen: And then it moves into the evaluation stage, and this is where students will be assigned as an evaluator to score another students.

135
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:35,444
Monica L Rosen: Creation and right now the default is that 40% of their final grade will come from evaluating somebody else's this gets further divided in again can be all customizable on there.

136
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:45,344
Monica L Rosen: They get a great score and a written evaluation score and then the last one, the last kind of like low stakes 10% they're getting is that, then they get to be.

137
00:20:45,884 --> 00:20:59,984
Monica L Rosen: evaluated on how good their feedback was so as I mentioned, not everybody's going to be a great peer reviewer, but this is part of the process, especially in academics, that we learn how to give good critical feedback and receive that feedback and then become a better.

138
00:21:00,614 --> 00:21:18,404
Monica L Rosen: person, you know better evaluator from that process so, then they can rank at how useful or helpful was the feedback that they received from their peer Joanna did you want to add anything about this this component, I have a few more slides on this, but before I move forward.

139
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:31,604
Monica L Rosen: Okay, and so here is an example of kind of like what an assignment and it would look like from the students perspective, like when they are given a little bit of a learning.

140
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:39,224
Monica L Rosen: curve, telling them what they're supposed to be doing with the assignment some instructions, these are all what you would put in for the instructions.

141
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:45,854
Monica L Rosen: That I can that gives them an idea as to like you know the when these things different items are due for during the peer review.

142
00:21:46,274 --> 00:21:54,884
Monica L Rosen: So one thing to note that I didn't cover is that in the beginning, students, actually get calibrated so that is a learn how to actually give a peer review apple assignment.

143
00:21:55,364 --> 00:22:04,544
Monica L Rosen: So that gives them a week, basically, so I think it's a one to six or one to five scale on how strong their evaluations are when they give them to other students.

144
00:22:07,424 --> 00:22:16,694
Monica L Rosen: So in the peer reviews, they also has it goes off of a rubric so students will be given provided a rubric on how to peer review each other, and this is all customizable this is.

145
00:22:17,654 --> 00:22:25,664
Monica L Rosen: just an example of what they have based in there, but you could add as many levels or as many items that you want students to evaluate each other's work.

146
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:37,784
Monica L Rosen: On and these can be worth different ways in points as well, so maybe, for instance, you want complexity, to be worked, you know, be a higher rate whenever they get those points out.

147
00:22:40,634 --> 00:22:52,274
Monica L Rosen: So, as I mentioned before it kind of students can learn to be a better peer reviewer the process it, you know the learning goal for this peer review process is almost to be a better peer reviewer.

148
00:22:52,874 --> 00:23:01,334
Monica L Rosen: Which is great, especially whenever you're thinking about those higher level courses in which they're you know kind of learning how to.

149
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:12,194
Monica L Rosen: Read manuscripts and give each other's information, you know evaluations that way, so if you have many different assignments, which critic I sorry for this thing is just going over and over again.

150
00:23:13,214 --> 00:23:27,104
Monica L Rosen: That they get better and better at evaluating the more they evaluate and their score, for you know how good of an evaluator their progress report will kind of get higher as well, so the weight of their evaluations will be stronger as they learn to be better at evaluating.

151
00:23:29,504 --> 00:23:37,994
Monica L Rosen: So we're we're in would be critic be a good use tool, I put in here perusal as well, because I haven't gone over proposal with you.

152
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:51,614
Monica L Rosen: But perusal allows you to also do peer reviews it wasn't necessarily made for for peer reviews, but it can be configured to create peer reviews, but critically, be a good tool, if your course has multiple peer reviews, so if you're if there learn it the.

153
00:23:52,814 --> 00:24:01,874
Monica L Rosen: peer review process is an essential part of your learning goals for your students critic is probably the better tool, if you just have like a one off kind of peer review, maybe perusal is a better tool.

154
00:24:03,134 --> 00:24:11,744
Monica L Rosen: critic also as an integral part of the learning experience, as I mentioned, using perusal if you're already using perusal in your course for socially annotation reading.

155
00:24:12,164 --> 00:24:22,634
Monica L Rosen: Then present might be a better tool so you're not having so many tools out you're throwing at the students at one time and, as I mentioned, if it's just a one off kind of peer review, maybe for a reason might be a better option.

156
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:31,814
Monica L Rosen: So that's what I had on critic I didn't know if you wanted to add anything at that point Joanna.

157
00:24:33,824 --> 00:24:41,534
Monica L Rosen: oops sorry yeah and she added some in the chat some more information, you can learn about critic.

158
00:24:43,184 --> 00:24:56,354
Joanna Kovacevich: yeah probably just to summarize that critic has built this to be an anonymous peer review platform, and it really has a lot of the features that we haven't seen in other tools, like the canvas peer review assignment.

159
00:24:57,974 --> 00:25:07,334
Joanna Kovacevich: Allowing you to set deadlines and a sort of timeline for each phase that create phase evaluate phase and feedback phase.

160
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:17,864
Joanna Kovacevich: And there are also individual assignments, but you can also have group assignments for peer review as well, so it has a lot of really.

161
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,494
Joanna Kovacevich: Nice impressive flexible features.

162
00:25:23,774 --> 00:25:28,154
Monica L Rosen: And if this was something you were interested in this is not something we were just there right, you were.

163
00:25:28,214 --> 00:25:32,714
Monica L Rosen: More than happy we help instructors set these sites up and get it all plugged away.

164
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:37,574
Monica L Rosen: We would help you through the entire process of getting it set up.

165
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:45,254
Dana Thomas: How is perusal typically use.

166
00:25:46,274 --> 00:25:46,514
Dana Thomas: Okay.

167
00:25:46,724 --> 00:25:52,784
Monica L Rosen: Great question and so that's probably where I had set this episode that perusal or my company for credit critic.

168
00:25:53,534 --> 00:26:04,124
Monica L Rosen: But I can talk a little bit more about perusal as well, this is one of the more popular tools, I would say a lot of instructors are using cameras all right now, especially at the graduate level.

169
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:09,494
Monica L Rosen: And so perusal is actually a social annotation E reader.

170
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:18,164
Monica L Rosen: And it allows for direct asynchronous peer discussions to occur regarding all different forms of course material, but the way that we normally.

171
00:26:18,404 --> 00:26:24,554
Monica L Rosen: See being used is with like journal article readings that are a PDF format, so you can upload the PDF form.

172
00:26:25,004 --> 00:26:31,364
Monica L Rosen: To the site and then students can highlight and comment with each other at their own time.

173
00:26:31,754 --> 00:26:43,514
Monica L Rosen: Regarding those readings, so it kind of reminds me of a seminar style graduate level course where you have assigned readings and the new come together and a small table and you kind of discuss what are the things that came up during those readings.

174
00:26:44,294 --> 00:26:53,444
Monica L Rosen: The cat you know the great thing about this, though, is it allows students to do this, whenever they want, they can sign in and read the reading at 2am if they want to leave their comments and then somebody can come back and.

175
00:26:53,624 --> 00:26:59,354
Monica L Rosen: and continue that discussion in another time, so it removes the barriers of space in place.

176
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:07,754
Monica L Rosen: It can be used as a great component of the course with the customizable Ai algorithm and then it also has an lta function, so that.

177
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:17,744
Monica L Rosen: perusal actually grades how students are interacting with each other, it takes a little bit of that burden off the instructor to grade whether they're participating.

178
00:27:18,254 --> 00:27:22,244
Monica L Rosen: In in that conversation around him, so this is kind of like where.

179
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:30,974
Monica L Rosen: What perusal site looks like again, this can all be embedded in canvas and and coursera but basically have this reading that's in here students can scroll through it.

180
00:27:31,244 --> 00:27:40,004
Monica L Rosen: And off to the side you see conversations happening about certain aspects of the reading so you know for certain the students are actually reading the readings, because that's one thing that we hear from the instructors.

181
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:44,834
Monica L Rosen: I assign these readings, but they come to class they're not prepared they didn't actually read it, this actually kind of.

182
00:27:45,284 --> 00:27:57,074
Monica L Rosen: forces them to actually read it, because they've had to give some thought to it before coming in, and then they can have this discussion, the instructors are in there as well, so some instructors aside, I you know, hands off this is for the.

183
00:27:58,214 --> 00:28:09,344
Monica L Rosen: Students only others say that this is great, because then I know exactly what Parts I should elaborate on with the readings, the next time we come together in our in person or zoom session.

184
00:28:11,294 --> 00:28:19,604
Monica L Rosen: So whenever I think about where kind of for result sits on that continuum it can be it's kind of a little bit all over the place and depends on.

185
00:28:20,294 --> 00:28:30,524
Monica L Rosen: How you use it, but it can be used for large group discussions kind of like that seminar style all the way up you know it has a peer review functionality, as I mentioned before.

186
00:28:31,304 --> 00:28:42,464
Monica L Rosen: And can be used in other areas, so this might be one, I do have a let's try it in case you wanted to kind of poke around and see what that looks like I can drop that link in there, if you if you're interested.

187
00:28:45,884 --> 00:28:46,334
Monica L Rosen: Good.

188
00:28:54,494 --> 00:28:57,164
Monica L Rosen: I will drop this in the chat.

189
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:12,194
Monica L Rosen: And then so once you get into there it'll take you two hours and teaching canvas site, so this is showing you how it's already plugged in there and everything you can actually go to the trial component, where it says sample perusal assignment.

190
00:29:13,784 --> 00:29:14,744
Monica L Rosen: And that will actually.

191
00:29:15,794 --> 00:29:17,144
Monica L Rosen: launch into it.

192
00:29:19,364 --> 00:29:21,164
Monica L Rosen: And then the load perusal.

193
00:29:22,364 --> 00:29:23,654
Monica L Rosen: Time in a new window.

194
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:36,944
Monica L Rosen: Oh yeah that happens.

195
00:29:38,204 --> 00:29:39,434
Joanna Kovacevich: You shouldn't have this issue.

196
00:29:40,064 --> 00:29:43,214
Joanna Kovacevich: yeah try opening a new tab and go to resolve calm.

197
00:29:43,844 --> 00:29:44,444
Monica L Rosen: yeah sorry.

198
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:45,494
Monica L Rosen: Apologies this.

199
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:53,774
Monica L Rosen: Is because we use it in coursera as well, so we're on our side, it will give us an error occasionally this won't shouldn't happen on your side of things.

200
00:30:05,144 --> 00:30:10,724
Joanna Kovacevich: So you may just have to locate the assignment from the course the resulting teaching course.

201
00:30:21,044 --> 00:30:26,444
Monica L Rosen: Okay, so here is that reading so right now, this is again if once you're in here, you can do whatever you like.

202
00:30:27,404 --> 00:30:34,814
Monica L Rosen: This is only for instructors and students won't see it, but we have the library of items right now I put two papers in there.

203
00:30:35,144 --> 00:30:45,584
Monica L Rosen: And then, once you're in there, as you can see if you open up over here on the side window you'll see the conversations that are happening, I put the current conversations to see all the list of different comments that.

204
00:30:46,064 --> 00:30:51,704
Monica L Rosen: People put in there, and so they can highlight there's also a drawing tool so.

205
00:30:52,034 --> 00:31:03,044
Monica L Rosen: For instance, if you had a graph or i'm thinking, like, for instance, a scatter plot, and you see this outlier and you want to circle and say hey what's going on with this outlier over here students can also draw around items as well.

206
00:31:05,594 --> 00:31:09,584
Monica L Rosen: So this is pretty neat and, as I mentioned before, this is all being.

207
00:31:10,364 --> 00:31:24,464
Monica L Rosen: On Ai scored and in the scoring system here, this is where the score is coming from so students will be scored automatically based on whether they and 60% of their greatest coming from annotating it that it's highlighting and leaving comments.

208
00:31:25,154 --> 00:31:29,984
Monica L Rosen: 20% in this case it's coming from just opening the readings, so making sure that they open it.

209
00:31:30,824 --> 00:31:34,934
Monica L Rosen: You know reading it to the end or active reading all the way through.

210
00:31:35,324 --> 00:31:41,774
Monica L Rosen: And so we can customize all of this, depending on what your goals are and i've seen this go in different ways, some instructors.

211
00:31:41,954 --> 00:31:54,044
Monica L Rosen: it's more that they use perusal because they want to make sure that the students are doing the reading so they up the annotation and it's all about interacting with the actual reading, whereas the other instructors are saying, well, I want this more about conversation.

212
00:31:54,824 --> 00:32:01,724
Monica L Rosen: and communicating with each other, so they will downplay the annotation and it has more to do with getting responses and leaving comments with the other.

213
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:12,434
Monica L Rosen: So this is a great tool, like, I said that kind of satisfies a lot of different goals, depending on what your goals are whether it's interacting with each other interacting with the reading.

214
00:32:13,814 --> 00:32:23,684
Monica L Rosen: But this is not only have to be readings and so when we go to the library, you can actually add videos you can add podcasts i've have a podcast in there from one instructor.

215
00:32:24,884 --> 00:32:32,954
Monica L Rosen: So there's different items multimedia sources that you can actually add to the library that students can annotate and comment on during their own time, so this can.

216
00:32:33,134 --> 00:32:44,534
Monica L Rosen: If you have an in person class this might free up a little bit of your in person, time and you're just say yeah keep on learning, even when the classroom you know class time is done i'd like you to continue this could be their homework piece.

217
00:32:45,554 --> 00:32:47,654
Monica L Rosen: So, or something along those lines.

218
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:02,174
Monica L Rosen: Did you have any questions about perusal would you like me to dig into it a little bit more.

219
00:33:03,224 --> 00:33:17,864
Dana Thomas: i'm just a quick question so when you go to grading and you have that chart at the end is that something, because I didn't see that, and this maybe I just i'm in the student view, perhaps.

220
00:33:18,104 --> 00:33:19,514
Monica L Rosen: yeah yeah that's exactly.

221
00:33:19,514 --> 00:33:23,684
Monica L Rosen: Right so because we created the course we are set as the instructors.

222
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:30,764
Monica L Rosen: So you shouldn't have all of these things that great book and things like that, and there I can show you because you know there's.

223
00:33:30,854 --> 00:33:37,664
Monica L Rosen: there's no students in here but yeah you would see an entire score book and it's just accumulating as.

224
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:52,964
Monica L Rosen: The students are interacting with it so maybe they put two comments in, but they need to get three comments in there to get full credit so you'll see the scores going up and, as I mentioned, with the lci those scores will be pushed back to the canvas great book as they come in.

225
00:33:53,774 --> 00:33:58,124
Joanna Kovacevich: Monica can you go to the assignment and show those analytics for the instructor.

226
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,144
Monica L Rosen: Oh yeah great.

227
00:34:00,194 --> 00:34:00,884
Monica L Rosen: A call.

228
00:34:06,284 --> 00:34:18,734
Monica L Rosen: it's a nice one oh here we go, so another really great feature to to perusal is sometimes we wonder how long is actually taking the students to read these things, how long you know, we might say.

229
00:34:18,884 --> 00:34:19,964
Dana Thomas: This is a 20 minute reading.

230
00:34:20,204 --> 00:34:29,534
Monica L Rosen: Well, for an expert who you know knows how to read this material 20 minutes for but for students, this might take a lot longer, and especially if you're annotating and you have to go back and you have to read it multiple times.

231
00:34:29,954 --> 00:34:47,204
Monica L Rosen: So there's some really great analytics that instructors can use as well, so how long are they taking to read this this was just an example so you're seeing only like five minutes but traditionally like we're seeing you know PDF readings anywhere between 20 minutes to an hour.

232
00:34:48,944 --> 00:34:52,694
Monica L Rosen: yeah so there's some great stuff to dig in there.

233
00:34:54,404 --> 00:35:09,014
Monica L Rosen: And you can also export these types of reports as well, so these aren't as useful, since this isn't an actual real class but it gives you an idea, if you like, to have those types of stats that you can have you have access to them all.

234
00:35:13,964 --> 00:35:14,654
Dana Thomas: Yes, me.

235
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:21,944
Dana Thomas: Because I do think that there's sometimes it's like Oh, this should you assign all these readings and.

236
00:35:22,364 --> 00:35:32,354
Dana Thomas: not really having a sense of how long is taking them to do it so having that as a tool is also helpful for us for modification for future classes.

237
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:38,174
Dana Thomas: Right um that's really helpful hmm lots of new tools out there.

238
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:48,644
Monica L Rosen: yeah and I would definitely say right now, this the perusal one is one that I have been you know, setting up the most that and yellow dig at the moment them.

239
00:35:51,494 --> 00:35:57,104
Dana Thomas: How are people using yellow dig Now I know we used it for poster sessions.

240
00:35:58,514 --> 00:36:12,374
Dana Thomas: And I know it's kind there's a gamification part of it right like there's a where people can students can gain points etc are they using it similar to perusal or How are people kind of.

241
00:36:13,454 --> 00:36:23,714
Monica L Rosen: Using a bit it's a we actually are doing workshops soon I think it's called five one tool five ways of use or something along those lines.

242
00:36:24,344 --> 00:36:34,724
Monica L Rosen: Because it is a really versatile tool was originally intended to be a replacement to the discussion board, and if you, you know implemented discussion boards, you can know that.

243
00:36:35,114 --> 00:36:40,274
Monica L Rosen: Students don't really like them, they they tend, and the the conversation that happens in discussion board skills, a little harder.

244
00:36:41,444 --> 00:36:52,214
Monica L Rosen: vishal it feels like you get this question prompt and then either a there's only one right answer and so students tend to just be like I agree good job yeah, and so it doesn't feel natural for them.

245
00:36:52,604 --> 00:36:58,604
Monica L Rosen: yellow dig it looks as you said, you have a little bit of experience, but it kind of looks like a normal social network platform.

246
00:36:58,814 --> 00:37:07,874
Monica L Rosen: Where it's like Facebook you scroll through and there's comments and there's emojis and there's multiple ways of expressing your ideas around the content, so it feels a little bit more.

247
00:37:09,014 --> 00:37:19,904
Monica L Rosen: You know authentic and what students are currently you know, in the real world, using and like you said, there is a game of by component to it because students can gain points.

248
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:32,084
Monica L Rosen: During for various interactions on the platform, whether it's putting in a new comment, whether it's you know some thumbs up being something whether it's putting a an article link out to somewhere else.

249
00:37:32,354 --> 00:37:36,464
Monica L Rosen: The main thing is it's it's incentivizing engaging on the platform.

250
00:37:36,824 --> 00:37:45,854
Monica L Rosen: it's incentivizing socializing with each other, and then it did you make that into a percentage that can be pushed back to the gradebook for participation, so it can take place, it can.

251
00:37:46,154 --> 00:37:53,504
Monica L Rosen: take over the discussion board, it can be another alternative way for assessing participation, so let me look at.

252
00:37:55,004 --> 00:38:00,764
Monica L Rosen: So you have a couple of different people that are using it in different ways, one of the ways that i've been working with Professor.

253
00:38:01,784 --> 00:38:03,884
Monica L Rosen: they're sharing car do with it she's using yellow.

254
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:17,804
Monica L Rosen: As a simulation so, for instance she's having students pretend, you know or assume roles of different experts that are trying to fight the opiate crisis, the opiate epidemic in Ohio.

255
00:38:18,044 --> 00:38:24,074
Monica L Rosen: And this is a three week long the simulation and students have to be in character and they have to create.

256
00:38:24,494 --> 00:38:29,264
Monica L Rosen: Co op collaborations with each other and to come up with some proposal to fight it.

257
00:38:29,624 --> 00:38:39,974
Monica L Rosen: And these socialization they occur in character, on view on yellow day the students actually change their profile pictures to match the biographies of the role that they're playing.

258
00:38:40,214 --> 00:38:55,064
Monica L Rosen: And then they just play in character that way, which has been pretty successful, and I think that they you know they've highlighted that simulation case a couple of times now, but let me kind of go through a few of what we have for for your dig.

259
00:38:57,074 --> 00:39:16,064
Monica L Rosen: Right so because it creates points for students there's actually an a bonus again, it takes a little bit of that lift off of the instructor to have to grade those interactions it's happening for you, but you do have some flexibility in deciding how you want it to great things.

260
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:19,694
Right.

261
00:39:21,014 --> 00:39:33,764
Monica L Rosen: So I think i've kind of covered some of these things that designs is designed to foster collaboration and social learning kind of reshape students behavior and it lowers the burden on instructors, because it has an Ai component to it.

262
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:48,314
Monica L Rosen: And it also had some really interesting analytics on the back side of things, for this I looking at, who are the big players in the class so who who's taking over you know the most the most component.

263
00:39:49,364 --> 00:39:52,424
Monica L Rosen: Of the discussion board or who is leading those conversations.

264
00:39:53,354 --> 00:39:57,374
Monica L Rosen: It fosters a different type of relationship between the instructors and students, instead of the instructors saying.

265
00:39:57,614 --> 00:40:09,044
Monica L Rosen: This is the discussion prompt and this is how I want you to talk about my material it actually swaps things it allows the students to decide what part of the course content are they most interested in and and what direction do they want to take it.

266
00:40:09,224 --> 00:40:17,744
Monica L Rosen: So it comes out more natural you know the water cooler chat the chat that happened before and after the classroom that aren't so stage and controlled.

267
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:23,654
Monica L Rosen: And then it also aligns with you know evidence based practice best practices in teaching and learning.

268
00:40:24,224 --> 00:40:35,414
Monica L Rosen: For more trauma informed types of pedagogy so in comparison with like a traditional yellowed traditional discussion board prompt you kind of see something that looks like this one topic per.

269
00:40:36,464 --> 00:40:42,704
Monica L Rosen: week with you know the instructors sets what the discussion is going to be, and you have your go getter student who's like the first one right out the gate to.

270
00:40:43,124 --> 00:40:47,174
Monica L Rosen: answer that question and then the other students kind of fall, you know in line afterward.

271
00:40:47,414 --> 00:40:58,544
Monica L Rosen: But as time goes on, what we end up seeing in the pattern of behavior is that the instructor sets the tone and then you have everybody waiting to the very last minute 11:58pm to turn in that discussion board prompt.

272
00:40:59,444 --> 00:41:06,404
Monica L Rosen: Interesting blue with yellow dig, this is a little bit more what the conversations tend to look like they kind of go off in their own direction and you allow.

273
00:41:06,584 --> 00:41:16,724
Monica L Rosen: Maybe the instructor in the first week or two is setting the stage for how the questions should be modeling a little bit of what that interaction on that platform should look like, but then, at some point you allow.

274
00:41:17,444 --> 00:41:26,144
Monica L Rosen: students to kind of take that in their own direction and take it in the areas of content that they're most interested in which might spin out into other types of forms of topics.

275
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:40,124
Monica L Rosen: yellow did can be when we place this on that type of chart it can kind of go and you know, depending on how you use it, it can be used many different ways, but it can you know tap upon various different types of active learning strategies.

276
00:41:41,354 --> 00:41:47,504
Monica L Rosen: And so, as I mentioned in in public health by 15 we're sharing party as she's using it right now, as a simulation.

277
00:41:48,134 --> 00:41:57,344
Monica L Rosen: And so, she actually has this is who the instructor Sharon is playing and her role the Governor of Ohio and here a couple of examples of student roles in there.

278
00:41:57,494 --> 00:42:09,524
Monica L Rosen: So they get these little biographies and then they take this information and they said that as their profile and yellow dig and then she kind of has these different assignments and said, are all tied into that simulation.

279
00:42:11,324 --> 00:42:19,604
Monica L Rosen: We also have in a couple of people who are using it for poster sessions so students will you know, create their PowerPoint posts.

280
00:42:20,264 --> 00:42:35,624
Monica L Rosen: save them as a PDF maybe create a little video of themselves presenting it, and then students can comment on that so again takes away that space and place that students can come in, whenever they like and view people's posters or their presentations and yellow day.

281
00:42:44,114 --> 00:42:53,594
Monica L Rosen: So we do have a DEMO site, I know we're kind of running out of time, we do have a DEMO site for the yellow dig as well, but I think that you're a little more familiar with this, since you said that you've used it before.

282
00:42:55,064 --> 00:43:05,414
Monica L Rosen: But if you ever want to see other features of yellow dig feel free to poke around and are resilient teaching canvas site, which has a yellow dig community as well, of instructors.

283
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:19,334
Dana Thomas: Thank you again so definitely more consideration for the types of tools that are available to encourage more of the act of learning.

284
00:43:20,774 --> 00:43:21,584
Dana Thomas: And it does.

285
00:43:21,644 --> 00:43:24,074
Dana Thomas: You know, it requires a bit of.

286
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:28,844
Dana Thomas: Thought and setup in ahead of time, so I think that.

287
00:43:29,894 --> 00:43:41,564
Dana Thomas: is good to kind of have this information to consider that so we'll be planning for next summer for for our group, and I already have already taken some notes about.

288
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:46,934
Dana Thomas: So I don't lose track of it for things that we may want to incorporate.

289
00:43:47,324 --> 00:44:02,774
Dana Thomas: Or consider in the slides will be available after because I didn't like also that tool that talked about like from the simple to the complex the types of things and as a good reminder, as I look at you know the taxonomy.

290
00:44:03,524 --> 00:44:13,304
Dana Thomas: Because i'm always looking at that as i'm building the objectives, because you're trying to make sure that you're moving along within the taxonomy that everything isn't just knowledge.

291
00:44:13,904 --> 00:44:22,874
Dana Thomas: Or, remembering that you also want students to evaluate synthesize and create and those are off easy, as you mentioned, those are the.

292
00:44:23,234 --> 00:44:31,334
Dana Thomas: Far more difficult things to do, but that's also where I think more of the active learning occurs so having these tools and thinking about.

293
00:44:32,084 --> 00:44:44,564
Dana Thomas: How to incorporate them and using the tools, whether we're in person or virtual I think is going to be helpful as when we move forward and luckily I have, I have a lot more, I have a lot well Okay, time is relative.

294
00:44:47,144 --> 00:44:55,124
Dana Thomas: I say that now and then come April i'm gonna be like Oh, my goodness time that I had all the time in the world to grade it.

295
00:44:56,804 --> 00:45:02,114
Dana Thomas: And so, but it's also good to know that you guys will also be available to assist as we're thinking about.

296
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:18,794
Dana Thomas: How we're going to incorporate it and helping us kind of send that because I think this will sometimes that's the scary piece right it's like oh I gotta do this new thing with this new technology, I have no way to know where to begin I don't know so that's a reassurance as well.

297
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:27,704
Monica L Rosen: yeah definitely we're always here we can help with every step of the way, whether you have just an inkling of an idea of what you would like to do we can help you with making sure that's a line.

298
00:45:27,944 --> 00:45:31,094
Monica L Rosen: Getting that tool, you know properly set up in your course.

299
00:45:31,394 --> 00:45:41,084
Monica L Rosen: And then go, you know we help with it, even when the courses live and it's like oh no it's not going the way I want it, we can help you kind of fix that during that session that time as well, so.

300
00:45:41,354 --> 00:45:53,384
Monica L Rosen: Definitely, if you have some ideas and you would like you know, a consultation with one of us feel free to reach out Joanna kindly through our email again and in the chat we would love to help you out.

301
00:45:54,074 --> 00:45:59,264
Dana Thomas: awesome well Thank you so much, I appreciate, you know, having this very personal session.

302
00:46:01,784 --> 00:46:04,964
Dana Thomas: But it was it was helpful for me, because it does it's about.

303
00:46:05,084 --> 00:46:07,544
Dana Thomas: understanding what the possibilities are.

304
00:46:08,204 --> 00:46:09,884
Dana Thomas: So i'm just like Oh, my goodness.

305
00:46:14,474 --> 00:46:16,394
Dana Thomas: Thank you, both of you so much.

306
00:46:17,144 --> 00:46:18,164
Monica L Rosen: My pleasure.

307
00:46:18,824 --> 00:46:23,564
Dana Thomas: All right, and i'll take a look at the resources to and sharing them with the team, so let me.

308
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:25,394
Dana Thomas: So I have two quick questions so.

309
00:46:25,724 --> 00:46:28,874
Dana Thomas: I recently used goose chase.

310
00:46:29,924 --> 00:46:45,224
Dana Thomas: which was a which was fun and they just announced that they're goose chases typically the scavenger hunt thing, but now they've they've leaned into it being a much more expansive tool so i've been thinking about how i'm going to.

311
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:57,974
Dana Thomas: Make that much more expansive, but it was piloted in the summer, and it was really kind of fun, it was fun, for me, creating it, but then also seeing the students.

312
00:46:58,484 --> 00:47:08,534
Dana Thomas: Do it, and so you could follow their activities and real time, as they were doing the scavenger hunt but i'm also thinking about other ways to use it, some curious have you guys had.

313
00:47:10,544 --> 00:47:18,404
Dana Thomas: interacted or worked with goose chase and then the other platform i've worked with, and this is because CDC, this is the platform CDC use this.

314
00:47:18,644 --> 00:47:19,514
Dana Thomas: For our.

315
00:47:19,994 --> 00:47:22,274
Dana Thomas: conference and virtual conferencing as rufa.

316
00:47:23,714 --> 00:47:24,194
Monica L Rosen: mm hmm.

317
00:47:24,974 --> 00:47:25,784
Dana Thomas: Aruba.

318
00:47:25,874 --> 00:47:28,904
Monica L Rosen: I can go w Wo BA or something like that.

319
00:47:29,234 --> 00:47:30,944
Dana Thomas: Who va.

320
00:47:31,484 --> 00:47:40,964
Monica L Rosen: yeah I feel like i've used it for a conference seminar as a spectator, but i'm not familiar with actually setting it up or back end admin side of things.

321
00:47:43,334 --> 00:47:45,584
Dana Thomas: If either of you use goose chase or.

322
00:47:46,454 --> 00:47:48,704
Monica L Rosen: I have not heard of goose chase before what are you doing.

323
00:47:49,454 --> 00:48:03,644
Joanna Kovacevich: I have heard of it, I have not done it both of those tools it's my understanding that they there's license fees attached to those so because we, as a school don't have a license we haven't explored those too deeply.

324
00:48:05,774 --> 00:48:11,234
Joanna Kovacevich: For yeah for like the event platform, we would typically lean towards like zoom webinars.

325
00:48:12,914 --> 00:48:19,424
Joanna Kovacevich: There is a new tool, depending on how sort of like internal or public your.

326
00:48:21,314 --> 00:48:39,914
Joanna Kovacevich: Events event is there is a it s was just piloting a cal tour events APP which seemed to work seems to be built similar to like Hoover if there's like breakout tracks that you could attend.

327
00:48:41,714 --> 00:48:51,224
Joanna Kovacevich: They just did a full day seminar where there was just one set of presentations and it was not a great use case for that event because you actually had to exit every presentation.

328
00:48:51,674 --> 00:48:52,124
Joanna Kovacevich: And like.

329
00:48:52,184 --> 00:49:04,634
Joanna Kovacevich: physically click on the next presentation you it wasn't like zoom webinar where I could just stay in the room, all day and they could just you know, keep switching presentations without me having to do anything.

330
00:49:06,284 --> 00:49:14,504
Joanna Kovacevich: I don't know how ready for prime time that tool is but it seemed like it would work well for a multi track type of event.

331
00:49:14,774 --> 00:49:19,004
Dana Thomas: Okay, and then the goose chase I use the free version.

332
00:49:19,934 --> 00:49:30,194
Dana Thomas: So you can create up to three teams in the free version and then you can have unlimited teams, with the subscription which I didn't even look to see how much it is, but it may be worth us.

333
00:49:30,464 --> 00:49:44,654
Dana Thomas: For our program to do it because, if we can figure out how to use it in a more expansive way, because this is gamification is also that gamification piece, that the students like really seem to lean into so.

334
00:49:45,374 --> 00:49:51,854
Joanna Kovacevich: I wonder if anyone from like oh SAP has done anything like that you know with sort of like orientation or.

335
00:49:51,854 --> 00:49:52,784
Dana Thomas: Things like that.

336
00:49:53,234 --> 00:49:55,994
Dana Thomas: it's a great orientation tool, I think.

337
00:49:57,404 --> 00:50:07,394
Dana Thomas: So we so i'll mention it to them, because I haven't checked in with them on whether or not because I stumbled upon it, and so i'll Let me try this thing out and it was it was kind of it was fun.

338
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:13,574
Joanna Kovacevich: I think, where I have heard of it is that a it was used at a conference.

339
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:27,374
Joanna Kovacevich: Where like a three day conference this was way pre pandemic, but it was they basically had like a scavenger hunt things to do, while you were there during the conference, and there were like.

340
00:50:27,374 --> 00:50:28,484
Joanna Kovacevich: prizes and things.

341
00:50:29,744 --> 00:50:33,584
Joanna Kovacevich: Where their limits of how many people, you could invite into your teams.

342
00:50:34,454 --> 00:50:53,744
Dana Thomas: And no because I had fairly large teams well there were like 10 and each team so about 30 total because I was only allowed to do three teams, but from the student feedback was the teams were too large, so they would have liked smaller teams, because I had them all over campus.

343
00:50:54,884 --> 00:51:13,064
Dana Thomas: But I can also see how it could be done virtually right, so you launch it and people even as teams in their own place you know, have to find different things, I know, so a couple years ago there was a student who had one this global scavenger hunt.

344
00:51:14,444 --> 00:51:22,184
Dana Thomas: contest and I think that they so her so by winning it was her team got a week long trip to New Zealand.

345
00:51:23,234 --> 00:51:24,404
Dana Thomas: And they were all over the.

346
00:51:24,404 --> 00:51:39,494
Dana Thomas: News, they were all over the world, their team data people all over the world, and so he they had about like 50 challenges that every team had to do, and you had to like take the picture do the activity for these challenges and.

347
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:40,814
Joanna Kovacevich: her team amazing race.

348
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,494
Joanna Kovacevich: yeah it was amazing like.

349
00:51:42,524 --> 00:52:00,644
Dana Thomas: It was cool so that's what the ghost face was reminding me of like Oh, we could use this either, as an in person or even as remote, but I am definitely interested in doing this global amazing race kind of thing that's a side note right because it's so cool so yeah.

350
00:52:00,704 --> 00:52:02,354
Joanna Kovacevich: trip to New Zealand yeah I.

351
00:52:03,314 --> 00:52:08,054
Dana Thomas: And the interesting thing was she did not she only know one other person on the team.

352
00:52:09,254 --> 00:52:20,984
Dana Thomas: Because strategically you want it people in different parts of the world, because the the scavenger hunt or the goals were from literally all over the world like go to a volcano.

353
00:52:21,374 --> 00:52:32,684
Dana Thomas: Like how many people have access to a volcano right or different things like that, so you strategically wanted people from all over the world, so it's kind of cool and then they get a week together in New Zealand.

354
00:52:33,824 --> 00:52:50,414
Monica L Rosen: yeah this is really cool I have this I can I can imagine that this might be a really fun like thing to bringing students who are in the online program from different areas to bring in their culture, and you know together, this is really cool i'm going to definitely check this one out.

355
00:52:50,654 --> 00:53:02,744
Dana Thomas: yeah so kind of cool and then on the you can see the activity feed, and so you can see them, and you have a sign the point, so this is cool it's cool so all right, ladies Thank you so much.

356
00:53:02,834 --> 00:53:04,004
