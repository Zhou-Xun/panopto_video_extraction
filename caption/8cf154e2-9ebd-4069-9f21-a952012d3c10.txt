1
00:00:05,395 --> 00:00:06,598
My name is Erica Jansen, and

2
00:00:06,598 --> 00:00:10,380
I'm a post-doc at the School of
Public Health and Nutritional Sciences.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,560
And in this segment,
I'm gonna talk about diet and culture.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,940
Specifically, how culture may explain why
different populations eat the way that

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,620
they do and what implications this could
have for public health intervention.

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,000
Diet is important because it is related
to many different health outcomes and

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,950
it's a potentially modifiable behavior.

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,430
In order to think about trying to
modify dietary behaviors in different

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:40,270
populations, we have to first understand
what the population is eating and why.

10
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,168
The first step is
understanding what people eat.

11
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,480
The slide you're looking at shows typical
breakfasts that might be consumed in

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,080
different regions of the world.

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,350
It's very clear that there are dramatic
differences in diet according to

14
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,935
geography.

15
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:55,208
And what's important from a public
health viewpoint is that these

16
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,728
differences might have implications for
health.

17
00:00:57,728 --> 00:01:02,334
As an investigator interested in
documenting the differences in diet

18
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:04,519
according to country or region,

19
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,369
one way that you could do it is to
directly observe what people are eating.

20
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:13,308
Or you could have people tell you
what they're eating, for example,

21
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:16,998
through a 24-hour recall or
a food frequency questionnaire.

22
00:01:16,998 --> 00:01:21,158
Moving beyond figuring out the differences
in what people are eating,

23
00:01:21,158 --> 00:01:25,570
the next step is to figure out
why these differences exist.

24
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,610
While there are many factors that could
affect variations in diet between and

25
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,110
within populations, culture and
tradition play an important role.

26
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,460
Investigating how culture and

27
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,250
tradition may affect diet often
requires a qualitative approach.

28
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,586
For example, pictured on the right is Dr.

29
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:47,670
Roberts, an anthropologist at
the University of Michigan.

30
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,311
Her work is focused on learning about the
way of life for working-class women and

31
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:53,821
families in Mexico City.

32
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:57,510
The way that she does this is to
actually spend time in their homes.

33
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,550
She takes notes, talks to families as
they go about their daily routines, and

34
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,770
takes a lot of pictures.

35
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,960
In this way, she's able to gain a unique
perspective on dietary practices and

36
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,610
habits.

37
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,290
Ultimately, this kind of
knowledge becomes very important

38
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,870
as interventions are being
designed because it can provide

39
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,290
information on whether the intervention
is likely to be effective.

40
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,810
I'm now gonna illustrate what I
mean in two specific examples,

41
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:29,160
both drawn from work Dr.
Roberts and others have done in Mexico.

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,700
You can see here a batch of
beans cooking in a large pot.

43
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,030
The significance of this ceramic pot
is that it was made in Mexico by local

44
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,600
artisans.

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,830
What makes the ceramics from local
artisans different from larger companies

46
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,728
is the use of lead-based glazes.

47
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:49,546
Smaller-scale companies and local artisans
use these lead-based glazes because

48
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:53,410
they allow the cookware to be
produced at much lower temperatures,

49
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,900
making it cheaper to produce.

50
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,700
And it also improved the appearance of
the pots, improving the marketability.

51
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,470
However, you might ask,

52
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,560
what's known about the health risks
of using these ceramics to cook?

53
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,440
Indeed, we know a lot about
the consequences of lead exposure.

54
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,060
It can cause serious cognitive and

55
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,690
neurologic harm,
especially to young children.

56
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,570
Pregnant women and their unborn babies
are also a vulnerable population

57
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,190
since lead can cross the placenta.

58
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,600
Finally, it's been well documented
in the Mexican population

59
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,840
that the use of lead-glazed ceramics does
lead to higher lead levels in the body.

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,825
However, despite this knowledge,

61
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:37,270
many people across Mexico continue
to use lead-glazed pottery.

62
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,620
For some, this may be a lack of
access to knowledge about lead or

63
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,590
the presence of lead in the pots,
but this might not be true for all.

64
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,410
So what cultural factors could play a role
in the decision to continue using these

65
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,540
dishes even though families are aware
of the lead that's present in them?

66
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,740
What's important to know is that,
in working class families,

67
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,480
these large cooking pots are used
on an almost daily basis.

68
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,500
Typically, the mother or
grandmother will spend most of the morning

69
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,320
cooking in preparation for the midday
meal, the largest meal of the day.

70
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,460
Because of its daily usage, the woman
becomes very familiar with the pot and

71
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,870
how it cooks.

72
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,460
Another reason for the attachment is
that they're often purchased from local

73
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,570
artisans, potentially friends and
neighbors, and

74
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,360
are often very beautifully and
intricately designed.

75
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,910
These pots are also very durable and

76
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,690
may be passed down from mother to
daughter as a family heirloom.

77
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,520
Finally, there is the belief by some that
the food actually tastes better when

78
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,870
prepared in these dishes
than in other kinds of pots.

79
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,205
Overall, this example highlights that
several cultural factors may explain why

80
00:04:42,205 --> 00:04:43,914
these pots continue to be used.

81
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:48,114
Further, what it might suggest is that,
when designing public health

82
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:52,944
interventions, it will be important to
find replacement cookware that fulfills

83
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:57,750
the same role and attachments
that the old lead-based pots did.

84
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,225
2nd example is with soda consumption.

85
00:05:01,225 --> 00:05:04,437
We know that soda consumption is
one of the factors involved in

86
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,975
the high obesity rates present in Mexico.

87
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:11,715
Despite public health efforts to reduce
soda intake, consumption remains high,

88
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:13,745
particularly among children.

89
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:18,770
One policy that is used at the school
level in an effort to reduce soda intake

90
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,300
is to prohibit children from
bringing soda in their lunches.

91
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,290
And no soda is supposed to be sold
around the school during the school day.

92
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,890
However, these rules
are not always followed.

93
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,190
In the photo of the lunch,
you can see a water bottle.

94
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,670
Seconds before she took that photo, Dr.

95
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,440
Roberts witnessed the mother dumping
out the water from the water bottle and

96
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,260
replacing it with a clear soda for
her daughter to take to school.

97
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,800
Why would a mother disregard
the rules in this way?

98
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,180
Again, while there are many reasons
behind this, we'll explore a few.

99
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,114
A recent qualitative study was conducted
in nine and ten-year-olds from Mexico City

100
00:05:56,114 --> 00:06:00,580
concerning their attitudes and
thoughts about soda consumption.

101
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,170
Two of the most common reasons for
consuming soda are listed here.

102
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,380
The first thing that they talked about is
that soda is what you drink with meals.

103
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,010
One of Dr. Robert's picture
is highlights this perfectly.

104
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,490
You can see here leftovers
from the midday meal.

105
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,225
You see some leftover lettuce,
chicken, a bowl of fruit, and

106
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:21,408
the remaining soda that was
not consumed at the meal.

107
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:25,129
Another reason that the children
frequently talked about was they need to

108
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:27,980
pair something salty with something sweet.

109
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,650
So they might pair a salty snack,
like chips or

110
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,750
a meal with a salty meat, with a soda.

111
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,130
Some other cultural and contextual factors
to explain why soda consumption remains so

112
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,780
high are listed here.

113
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,650
First, historically,
water has not always been safe for

114
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,490
consumption, particularly
water from the tap.

115
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,860
In contrast, soda, because it's bottled,
is thought to be safe for consumption.

116
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,580
Another is the sharing of
soda with friends and family.

117
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,330
For example, when a friend stops by,

118
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,110
it's considered the polite thing
to do to offer that person a soda.

119
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,270
And finally,
in some indigenous communities,

120
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,840
there is the belief that
soda has healing properties.

121
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,000
So overall, when designing
interventions to reduce soda intake,

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,040
it is important to address these
cultural and contextual factors.

123
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,240
For example, figuring out a way to
normalize drinking water with meals

124
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,160
rather than only after
intense physical activity.

125
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,270
And again, while we may be able
to glean some of this information

126
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,490
through epidemiologic and
nutritional studies,

127
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:38,260
having a qualitative aspect of
research adds important information.

128
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,040
So overall, there are 3 takeaways.

129
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,800
1st, diet is an important and potentially
modifiable determinant of health.

130
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,920
So it's necessary to gather
information on what people are eating

131
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,885
in order to figure out how to
intervene and on what to intervene.

132
00:07:53,885 --> 00:07:57,960
2ndly, information might be missed
by only gathering information

133
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,030
on what the population typically eats.

134
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:04,580
We also have to figure out why
a population eats what they do.

135
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,900
And this requires a multidisciplinary
approach, incorporating epidemiology,

136
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,150
environmental health,
nutrition, and anthropology.

137
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:16,730
And finally, education on healthy eating
might not work without considering

138
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,360
how these recommendations fit
within the dietary practices and

139
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,702
perceptions of the population.
