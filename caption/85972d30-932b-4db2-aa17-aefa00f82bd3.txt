1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:27,500
Sorry. 31,646 inches singles experiences for his clients.

2
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:46,990
Clients store its balance sheet.

3
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,190
This is like, not what you meant. You get to be the best piece that I can be concerned about, she said.

4
00:00:53,210 --> 00:01:06,320
There's like a draft, but it's only like two and associates and there's like one page, like 1000 or something.

5
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:15,470
But she said stuff to them, like work life issues, like she gets in the picture is not me.

6
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,970
Okay, 22 figures watching.

7
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,169
You can take a student. You should take it.

8
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:38,410
But it's a lot because it's like you don't give a [INAUDIBLE] you should go to.

9
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:47,190
She's doing. They have certificate like terrorism not.

10
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:59,570
Is this? We have taken.

11
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:11,200
Yeah. You have to actually look.

12
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,080
Is that tough? She says it's not easy.

13
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:28,710
Tell them so we can take it next year for next year's edition.

14
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,960
Oh, sure, sure.

15
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:44,750
But to figure out why people want to see.

16
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:58,370
Is there. Okay.

17
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,870
So. The.

18
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:41,990
He did. Believe me, there's nothing.

19
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,460
I'm not. But.

20
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:27,210
It's. Sometimes.

21
00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:03,620
Here's what you.

22
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:28,530
She wants. I suppose.

23
00:05:48,830 --> 00:06:00,290
I don't really care. Dear Mr.

24
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:28,910
It's sort of. Okay.

25
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:37,290
You think we're in business? Good morning, everybody.

26
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:47,010
Any questions about what we covered last time? Okay.

27
00:06:47,670 --> 00:07:00,460
So if you remember, we are we we are dealing with appraising information and we where and,

28
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:09,990
you know, apply Bayes theorem in the code in the context of a test for an infectious disease.

29
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,370
And what was the prevalence of the of the disease.

30
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:22,530
And, and so it was a 400 page. So I can ease in any any type of disease.

31
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:33,870
Right. So so it have infectious disease, but there's a test and this has some accuracy given the accuracy of the basis of the prevalence then of the

32
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:41,220
disease among the population that we figured out was the probability of the person having the disease,

33
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:50,580
given that that person has tested positive. And so and we figured out that because the prevalence of the disease was so low,

34
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:59,910
the probability of having the disease, given that the disease positive was pretty low, was nine point or 9%.

35
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:07,680
These are called these these set of probabilities are what they call posterior probabilities.

36
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:19,020
Right. So we started with these we called priors or abilities, and then we collected information, applied Bayes theorem and Bayes formula.

37
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,129
And we have two sets of posterior probabilities.

38
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,430
These for the people put people that test positive.

39
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,820
This is a new set of posterior probabilities for a set of bacteria.

40
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,870
Probably these are for the people that is negative. So that person tests negative.

41
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:42,590
The probability of having the disease is zero and the probability of not having the disease is 100% right.

42
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,139
Based on the information we have put in the person test positive,

43
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:55,470
the probability of having the disease is 9.49% and the probability of not having the disease is 90.91%.

44
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:04,260
And we've solved this problem, you know, doing in two different ways.

45
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:11,460
One, we applied a frequency argument.

46
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,430
So we started with a population with a million people and with a population of 2 million people,

47
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:24,030
we divided that population between people with a disease of people with no disease.

48
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:30,690
And then figure out how many people test positive, how many people test negative followed all the people with the face,

49
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:37,770
how many people with no disease tested, positive or negative and then applied proportions.

50
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,660
We figured out what's the probability of testing positive of having the disease, even testing positive.

51
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,150
And then so the numerator is,

52
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:59,969
is going to be the out of all of all of the probably all the people that tested positive which ones are having the disease.

53
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:07,380
Right? And so this is going to be a hundred divided by 2100.

54
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:24,030
And the probability of having the disease given testing negative is going to be out of all the people that tested negative case zero 998,900

55
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:35,430
zero divided by that some of these two test negative and this is the probability of having the disease given that you tested negative,

56
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:45,360
which in this case is zero. Right. So so now that we know these, you know, these frequency argument,

57
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:55,040
we also apply Bayes theorem directly using some formulas from in your mate and from basic probability and.

58
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,680
That we need, that we're going to keep applying.

59
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:21,220
So let's see if we go to the next problem for this homework and that is going to the assignment and the assignment number six.

60
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:39,580
So we got now assignment problem 923 and the problem 923 involves these of these data waste on our grade six,

61
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:47,620
a Bayes rule for six because it has a prior information that we need to solve problem.

62
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:56,740
923 So let's go and do that. So I'm going to open the problem 923 first, right?

63
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:13,150
And. Think you can close this one.

64
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:21,490
I have already made 23 here. And.

65
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:40,989
Just a bit. Are you afraid to see and the problem prompt is the term prior and posterior a relative assume that the test in the year 917.

66
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:52,149
That's what I'm going to show you right now on the I mean the base rule for expiration has been perform and the outcome is positive,

67
00:12:52,150 --> 00:13:01,090
which leads to the posterior probability shown. Now assume that there is a second test independent of the first test that can be used as follows.

68
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:08,070
Assume that is that is false. Positive and false negative rates are pointing to 1.6.

69
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:19,960
Okay, so let's put out these use the posterior probability, such prior probabilities in the second base rule calculation, no prior means,

70
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,890
no prior means prior to the second test, if you will test positive in the second test, what is the posterior probability that has?

71
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:33,009
He says that he has the disease. We assume that the two tests are independent.

72
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:38,139
What may not be why these might not be realistic is they are an independent.

73
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:43,420
What kind of additional information would you need about the likelihood of the test results?

74
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:52,630
This is not we're going to pay too much attention to this, but I'm going to give you some some general.

75
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,520
I'm going to make some general comments about this. So let's go to the model here.

76
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:07,720
And so this is the problem. The problem 923 means that these individual is going to perform.

77
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,900
You know, that this individual thinks that there is a disease in the population.

78
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:20,590
This individual performed one things is positive. And then he performed another test and he's positive again.

79
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:27,460
So the question is, after performing two test and if the tests are independent, what is the probability that that person has the disease?

80
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:39,850
So let's let's start by opening because this is not directly from the the previous model that we saw.

81
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:49,420
This is actually coming from. From from another problem in.

82
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,780
In Winston. So I already gave you that problem and.

83
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:09,750
So. So this is the one that we have to open the Western Albright based rule for six.

84
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:15,960
This. Right.

85
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:27,300
So they they this is the information, the prior probability of the disease are going to 1.99.

86
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:39,060
And the you know, the sensitivity and specificity of that test are point 95.9.

87
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:47,880
So, I mean, the the false positive as 1.10 and false -3.5.

88
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:55,430
So it it's actually called the these two that this information.

89
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,960
And I'm going to copy that to our new template.

90
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:10,040
And these are given probability, prior probabilities of the disease.

91
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,460
And nobody says we're going to do in here.

92
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,370
And that's going to be going to 1.99.

93
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:32,060
Right. Okay. So this is we know, 1.99 and then the accuracy of the test, the first test.

94
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:39,980
So I'm going to copy that. I'm going to go back to the.

95
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:49,020
Could you zoom in on this sheet a little bit? Sure. Let me let me copy that first.

96
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:56,260
And so let me make it a little bigger.

97
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:03,940
So these are the prior probabilities of the height of the person having the DC seven having the DC.

98
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:07,860
Right. So this is who you get without any test.

99
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,229
If you take at random eye one person from the population,

100
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:18,250
the probability that that person had two weeks is 1% and the probability of not having the disease is 99%.

101
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:28,290
So it's always been good idea to some to make sure that the probability set to one where they shoot up to one.

102
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:38,920
Right. So there's some check he had that they have things press here that is going to be equal to this some.

103
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:53,770
Of these probabilities just to make sure that everything up to one hand is what I was really.

104
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:11,080
We want to now. So, no, these are these are the probabilities, the accuracy of the first test.

105
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,020
Who can tell me? What is these? 95% is the probability of what?

106
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:33,240
I'm giving you have to take things and you have to speak how they're giving.

107
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:41,520
You have to do things and your tests will be positive. Is the probability of testing positive given that you have the disease right.

108
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,390
So the probability if you are if you have the disease, what is the probability of testing positive?

109
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:57,270
And this is one is given that you don't have the disease, what is the probability of the negative?

110
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:04,140
So so these are the true positive and these are include negative and these are the outposts.

111
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,100
And is these are the false negative. So.

112
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,450
So these. Anyone else?

113
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,940
What is this number here? What does that number represent?

114
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:30,350
David, you want to answer that question, right? What is this, 10%?

115
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:41,170
10% isn't a probability of being positive and not is is the probability of testing positive given that you don't have the disease rate.

116
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,180
Okay. And this is the probability of testing negative, given that you have the disease.

117
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:54,590
Is this about accuracy of the test? And so remember that we're conditioned in our universe.

118
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:59,500
Is either that R0 or D0.

119
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,780
You see, this is among all the people who have the disease.

120
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:09,200
What is the probability of testing positive or negative? And of course there's probably more 0 to 1.

121
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,040
And this is out of all the people that don't have the disease.

122
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:17,030
What's the probability of testing positive or negative? Right.

123
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:28,130
So if we sum these two.

124
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:43,709
I have one one. So that's, you know, my initial in the initial condition.

125
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:54,010
So let's make sure that we understand that these are the prior probabilities and then we want to do is key.

126
00:20:54,030 --> 00:21:05,790
You know, if we apply that test, we need to figure out what's the probability of having what the probability of having the vaccine

127
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:11,369
you test positive and what's the probability of not having the disease to use this negative.

128
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:18,270
Right? So okay, so let's do the base calculations as we did before.

129
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:29,160
Okay. So we what we need to do is find out what, what are the probabilities of the first test result.

130
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,090
So what is the probability that a person test positive?

131
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:38,490
I'm worried the probability that a person out of the three randomly test negative.

132
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:52,650
And what we've figured out last time and that and again you can you can get go with your probability then you're in your probability class, right.

133
00:21:52,650 --> 00:22:03,719
Is that the probability of testing positive is equal to the probability of testing positive, given that you have the least ease times,

134
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,310
the probability of having the disease closed,

135
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:14,730
the probability of testing positive given that you don't have the disease times the probability of not having the disease.

136
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,610
Okay. So essentially is this some product of the prior probabilities with this accuracy?

137
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:40,680
Right. So we go and say this is a two in some problem and then I'm going to get my prior probabilities and then I'm going to love this probability.

138
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,860
Of course, I want to copy that for later.

139
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:52,590
And then the probabilities of testing positive, given that you have the disease or testing positive, given that you don't have the disease.

140
00:22:52,650 --> 00:23:05,610
Right. So that problem is this some of those two conditions, do you know how, you know, having the disease or not having the disease,

141
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:11,790
the probability of testing positive in which one of the situation times the frequency of having

142
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:18,000
the disease or not then will give you the whole probability of testing positive in these cases.

143
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,440
Or 11% right or no point 11%.

144
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:28,200
11% on the probability of testing negatives is going to be one minus that right.

145
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,719
So, so in 80, 92. So I use copy the formula.

146
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,860
So this is equal to this. So just to make sure.

147
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:47,740
Make sure that your computations are right because some probabilities, make sure that they are one.

148
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:55,870
All right. So we are using two decimal, so let's keep using the decimal.

149
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:04,920
Right. We are using all the basic.

150
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,720
But only when I showed how to do this.

151
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,190
Right. And now what do we need to do?

152
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:26,500
So I want to figure out if I go to the test and tested positive.

153
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,190
I want to probably know that you're having the disease.

154
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,360
I'm not going to apply Bayes Theorem right now.

155
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:46,940
So as we did before, the probability of having the disease given tested positive is equal to the probability of testing positive.

156
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:54,310
Given that you have the disease times the probability of having the disease divide it by the probability of testing positive.

157
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,210
And we have all this information here.

158
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:08,100
And so what I'm going to do, I'm going to do for all possible situation, even if you're tested positive or negative.

159
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:18,099
Right. So I'm going to do this. This is equal to the probability of testing positive,

160
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:29,050
given that you have the disease which is here times the probability of testing of having the disease, which is .01.

161
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:37,530
In this case, I'm going to lock the economy because I want to copy this formula around.

162
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:48,070
So I'm going to column B and then I'm going to divide that this divide by the probability of testing positive.

163
00:25:48,070 --> 00:26:00,910
Right. Which is this number here. And in this case, I'm going to log out row seven, because, you know, I want the column DNA to flow the the rows.

164
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:04,900
So I'm going to draw Prozac.

165
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:14,250
And then once I do that, then I have that is 8.8%, right.

166
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:20,320
The probability of testing plus the probability of having the disease, given that you test positive.

167
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,970
And then I'm going to replicate this formula.

168
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,880
I copy this formula and then I have all these.

169
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:35,770
Now, what I want to make sure is that these now these probabilities add up to one urgently

170
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:42,920
because this person either tests positive and the person is either intangibles or negative.

171
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,910
And so those are two different universes, right?

172
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:51,770
If the person tests positive, these are the probability of having the disease or not the person test negative.

173
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,840
These are I probably need to do having the disease or not.

174
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:06,610
So I'm going to some make sure that that's the case, that those are valid, no probability.

175
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,780
And then I am going to put in these numbers.

176
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:22,090
And so they add up to one, I'm going to get to the decimal and area.

177
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:35,880
So so what happens is that I now have constructed two different two different posterior set of posterior probabilities.

178
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,940
This is this set of quotidian probabilities.

179
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:49,790
If the end result is positive, either tests positive for you and these are the posterior probabilities if the result is negative for you.

180
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:55,509
So I am, in this case going to four for everybody.

181
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,530
To be clear, I am going to.

182
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:10,120
Make these two different calls. Right. So this is going to be a and this is going to be read something like that.

183
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:18,010
Really? Okay.

184
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:26,460
So what is interesting, what is important for you to realize is that is, you know,

185
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:34,389
that what's valid is either these set of probabilities or this set of probabilities for a single individual.

186
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:39,549
So you apply apply that test to Joe and your test positive.

187
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:49,930
Then you think then the probability of Joe having the disease changed from .012.09 from 1% to 9%.

188
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,300
Right. So that's that's that's the issue.

189
00:28:54,310 --> 00:29:00,550
Given the accuracy of the test, it could you showed a formula for capability.

190
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:07,590
Again, this one. Next one. So we.

191
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:33,410
Okay. So one. Okay.

192
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:42,410
So is he making payments?

193
00:29:45,940 --> 00:30:03,849
Yeah. And you see better now. So this is day, you know, reverse, you know, where we have flipped probabilities,

194
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:12,910
times of probabilities of the state of nature divided by the probability of the forecast or the or the probability of thing for me.

195
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,690
Right. And these are in prior probabilities.

196
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:24,020
Right. Which are 0.01 or point 99?

197
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:34,300
No. So Joe or these individual tested positive.

198
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:40,630
Right. So if that person tested positive, then you don't care about these probabilities anymore.

199
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,170
They don't exist for you, right? Because you'll be tested positive.

200
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:50,200
So the posterior probabilities of Joe are point at 9.91.

201
00:30:50,590 --> 00:31:04,270
So we don't even you know, we don't we don't even have to show that or simply let's make sure that.

202
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:13,500
We just simply think that blanked out or, you know, they think they got her.

203
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:21,460
So, you know, that we are looking at only positive because that was the result that, you know, yo tested positive.

204
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:29,799
All right. So what's going to happen is that Joe I'd say it was 9%.

205
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,230
I tested positive in April. It probably probability of having the disease is 9%.

206
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,040
Let me do another test. And these deaths is going to be independent of the first one.

207
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:46,810
And the second test is going to be either the same accuracy or different accuracy in this case.

208
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,890
You know, I think we are going to have a different accuracy for that test because it was given to us and that accuracy before.

209
00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:05,890
So he says that I assume that is false positives and false negative rate are pointing to 1.6.

210
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:12,370
So let's see here. So what is the false positive rate?

211
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:20,580
Where do I put that for four positive rate. So false positive is the probability of.

212
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,450
Testing positive. Given that you don't have the disease.

213
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,960
So until just year.

214
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:43,210
And then. And the false negative is the probability of testing negative given that you have the disease that you know the rate of false negative.

215
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:48,330
So 1.6. And then.

216
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,930
And then let's say that. Okay.

217
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:04,680
So that person. Now, remember that you don't care about these probabilities anymore because Joe tested positive the first time.

218
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:15,239
So for you, that was the probability of your having the disease is point 9% and the probability of not having the disease is 91%.

219
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,730
So that those become your prior probabilities for the sake of this.

220
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:29,940
Okay, so now you get Joe that person and say the probability of Joe having the disease is point or nine.

221
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:40,680
The probability of not having the disease is point 81. No, I'm going to apply a second pass to Joe and that is is going to let's say two is positive.

222
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,910
And now I want to know,

223
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:50,640
given that I applied to test one after they ordered and they're independent of what is probably needed now that Joe had the disease,

224
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:55,830
the first test gave me a point or 90% probability of having the disease.

225
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:00,620
What happened if I apply the same observation and it is positive again.

226
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,880
So now what is a probability? What do you think the probability of?

227
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,930
You'll have it, and now that's up to you.

228
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:43,850
So let's take 5 minutes and do that. You.

229
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,380
So if you remember what, the first thing you need to do is completely stable.

230
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,760
Right. And there's the accuracy of the second test.

231
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:53,160
We know what the false, negative and false positive rate are.

232
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:59,550
So we know the true positives and negatives are because the ladies have one.

233
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:08,520
So given that you have the disease, you test positive or negative and then then something has to be here,

234
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,860
has to be one, given that you don't have the disease fueling the test, positive or negative.

235
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:17,790
So they and they saw what you saw that you don't have.

236
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:28,650
It has to be one of these two probabilities. So if it is so, then of course, this is has to be a point 94.

237
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:38,020
And then he just has to be only 88. So.

238
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:45,970
And, you know, you make sure that you are done correctly.

239
00:38:54,140 --> 00:39:00,920
Yeah. Well, you can say this is this is this is equal to one minus God and this is equal to one minus that.

240
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:09,620
Oh, you. And so you go into the table of the accuracy of the second test.

241
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:13,700
Right. So now what we need to do is what?

242
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:25,240
We need to find out what is the probability of testing positive or testing negative in the second dose.

243
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:32,000
So. So what is the probability of testing positive or testing negative in the second test?

244
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:41,110
So remember, we do the same problem again. The probability of testing positive is equal to the probability of testing positive.

245
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:51,029
Given that you have the disease times, the probability of having the disease is no .01 anymore is .09.09 because you,

246
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:56,970
you know, you're tested positive the first time. So now the probability of your having the disease is point one.

247
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:08,480
So that's the the posterior probabilities for this first test becomes the prior probability for the second test, so and so.

248
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:13,610
And then you multiply that times the probability of testing positive.

249
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:18,499
Even now you don't have the disease, times the probability of not having in this case.

250
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:24,770
And then the sum of the two will give you the probability of testing positive of the same thing.

251
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:33,240
The probabilities, right? So remember that these probabilities here do not apply anymore, right?

252
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:39,560
This is the probability. The probabilities if you had tested negative, which he did.

253
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:44,300
So they don't you know, you can even erase that.

254
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:49,669
Right. But they didn't, you know, test didn't test positive.

255
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,430
So, you know, we don't need those, right?

256
00:40:52,730 --> 00:41:00,710
The only thing that we need is that they both stadium probably you know that applied to your because you tested positive.

257
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:09,020
So now I am going to do that exactly the same problem that I did before.

258
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:19,210
So this is equal to the sum of. The.

259
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:25,320
Conditional probabilities and times.

260
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:46,310
The custody of probabilities, the probabilities of the cyclone, which is that it was still the first test, and it does point 11.89.

261
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,450
And of course, we were using two decimals.

262
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:55,990
Right. So of course, these have two out of the one.

263
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,760
So this is equal to the sum of those two probabilities.

264
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:12,740
Make sure that they are what they do. Now, the issue is that Joe tested positive the second time.

265
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:24,260
Right. So we are going to use this probability of testing positive to figure out what are the probabilities of having the disease,

266
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:27,310
given that Joe tested positive the second time. Right.

267
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:33,800
So we're going to use Bayes Theorem. So I'm going to apply to the whole table as we did before.

268
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:43,610
So I'm going to use all these these these probabilities and then these prior probabilities I did before.

269
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:46,950
But let's see.

270
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:54,710
So this is equal to the reverse probability, right?

271
00:42:55,130 --> 00:43:07,520
Which is here the probabilities of the the accuracy of that second test times and the probabilities of this of the state of nature,

272
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:19,130
which is now the higher probability. Right, or of the posterior to the to the first and prior to the second thing.

273
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,720
So I'm going to lock on G.

274
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:35,830
Amazing. But I didn't either through the media or the information that tested positive in this case.

275
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,610
So I'm going to lock parole.

276
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:47,290
I mean, I wrote a blog for a week. Right.

277
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:52,930
And then hit it there. And then we have our answer there.

278
00:43:53,470 --> 00:44:03,250
So we don't need this information. We don't need this because, you know, each person tested positive.

279
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:08,350
Right? So they tested positive the second time. So all I need is this number.

280
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,870
So if I want even to the I haven't even delayed that.

281
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:28,420
And so so the answer is this is so the probability is if you tested positive twice, the probability of your having the disease is 82%.

282
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:39,760
So you tested that person once with this test and the probability happens to be that 9% in tested positive is 9%.

283
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:49,420
You tested the person the second time with this test and then the probability of having the disease is 81, 82%.

284
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:58,270
If you test positive the third time is and is positive then is going to probably do 99, 98%.

285
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:07,390
Right. So it is very even if the test is even if the prevalence is very small and you know,

286
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:13,380
you have to you have to be very low key to have a false positive, you know, three times.

287
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:17,020
Right. So that's that's pretty much the the idea.

288
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:22,030
So so that's it.

289
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:34,090
So that's stayed the answer here. And the issue the question is, can we do this better?

290
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:46,480
So that's that's that's 82% and we are using two decimal.

291
00:45:46,490 --> 00:46:05,010
So that's. So the second question is, how likely are these two tests to be independent?

292
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:09,420
Right. So is is this a good assumption?

293
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:13,050
Most of the time it's a good assumption. You have two different things.

294
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,690
Right. And then two has happened to be, you know, independent, the youth, as the base said.

295
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:25,290
But sometimes you get, you know, two tests of the same batch, the same brand.

296
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:33,000
And, you know, the test might be the result of a test might be correlated, right?

297
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:41,399
So the true or dated false, the probability of having a false positive, if you get it,

298
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:50,639
one is higher and you get a positive, you get one, you can get another and so on.

299
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,790
If that's the case, we are, you know, totally if you're very correlated, then,

300
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:03,139
you know, you need to know the correlation between one this and another.

301
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:08,910
And we do need to get into the into the computations, but that's very difficult.

302
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:21,120
So you need to know what is the probability of the second test positive in the first one so that we know

303
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:30,719
that involve knowing how correlated the and make some assumptions are about the correlation between

304
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:42,150
the two which is quite easy to do so you know you can assume most of the time unless is blatantly

305
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:53,720
incorrect that your tests are independent so it you know test if you are doing that or did the you know,

306
00:47:53,730 --> 00:48:01,170
the doctor is doing that they will be careful to administer the test with different batches.

307
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:09,800
And so to assume the independence of the test, if you are doing that on your own,

308
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:18,750
make sure that you get two different brands of test and they are, you know, their accuracy of the test, but they are totally independent.

309
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:40,890
Right. So that's a you know, of course, these you get to negative and you can be pretty sure that that you can have the disease.

310
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:48,509
And so that's what I have to say about these.

311
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:56,450
This is lab now. The response that I would like for you to comment.

312
00:48:56,450 --> 00:49:00,529
And this is based on and these are the answers.

313
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:14,030
So how about and this is because I want you to watch the videos and there is a fair amount of videos on top of the homework.

314
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:17,060
So we are going to finish the homework today.

315
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:26,960
So you have that homework, but I would like you to watch the videos and figure out how the videos relate to what we have been doing.

316
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:32,030
All right. So the third one.

317
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:41,340
Any questions about this? So let me save it.

318
00:49:52,430 --> 00:50:12,469
The third one would be 937. And the question goes like you have sued your employer for damages.

319
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:21,020
So for when you recently slipped and fell on an icy surface that should have been treated by your company's physical planning department,

320
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:29,590
your injury was sufficiently serious that you, in consultation with your attorney, decided to sue your company for $500,000.

321
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:35,360
Your company insurance provider asked, offered to settle the suit with you out of court.

322
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,230
If you decide to reject this settlement and go to court,

323
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:46,330
your attorney is confident that you will win the case, but is uncertain about the amount of the court will.

324
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:47,810
Where are you? In damages.

325
00:50:48,110 --> 00:51:00,110
He has provided his assessment of the probability distribution of the court's award to you in filed 937 that I provided to you.

326
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:04,520
In addition, there are extra fee legal fees of.

327
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:13,010
In addition, there are extra legal fees of $10,000 that you have to pay if you go to court.

328
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:21,739
Let s be the insurance provider proposed out-of-court settlement endorsed for which values of s you

329
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:27,500
decide to accept the settlement for which values of s when you choose to take your chances in court,

330
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:32,030
assume that your goal is to maximize perspective that payoff of these litigation.

331
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:38,360
Okay, so let's do that. Let's actually go and.

332
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:44,280
Let's make sure that we have the information.

333
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:49,590
So we're going to go with a decision tree out of this. We're going to solve that with a decision tree.

334
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:56,790
We can do that with a payoff table, and we'll do that with a big table.

335
00:51:56,790 --> 00:52:08,220
But we are going to do that with a decision to tell you this is a one time, you know, so it's one step decision.

336
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:15,370
So you make a decision and then make your percentage 2% estate.

337
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:21,410
So and then your decision is go to court or central.

338
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:26,610
They are they in the state of Maine.

339
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:33,950
Curious is do you go to or what would be the award that you will get?

340
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:44,340
So that's that's it. So is anything that we do with a of table can be done with decision tree but not vice versa.

341
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:51,719
So this is going to be one case in which we are going to present a failed table under decision three.

342
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:58,130
They're going to tell you exactly the same. But then it will it will give us on practice in the decision tree.

343
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:04,920
All right. So now what I'm going to do is open.

344
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:13,020
The data data. 1937 data.

345
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:24,880
And this is the amount of probability for the award.

346
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:32,860
And so I'm Kopi Dan I go back to.

347
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:42,960
And this. So this is the amount and the probability on.

348
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:53,610
These two. I me make it bigger so you can see.

349
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:09,990
Insert one on. So we don't know what what is the insurance provider settlement.

350
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:22,660
So that's what we want to figure it out. So what was the breakeven settlement that we accept either to go to, to settle or to go to court?

351
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:28,260
Right. So I'm going to put zero here to start.

352
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:32,060
And then then we'll we'll figure that out.

353
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:36,520
And because this is this is going to be donor.

354
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:48,030
So. Right, I am going to make it currency and no sense.

355
00:54:51,750 --> 00:55:02,110
Okay. So. I this will give me a accounting which I don't like that much.

356
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:09,940
So what is the first thing you need to do? You need to figure out your that your state of nature.

357
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:18,100
You know, the probabilities are of the one. Right. So that's the first thing you figure out if you're given probabilities.

358
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,220
So there's some this is some check, right?

359
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:38,050
Some complete. Remittances to this.

360
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:56,920
And so we have one we've seen three, three decimals where the probabilities was all right.

361
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:02,200
So the amount of the lawsuit is how much?

362
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:11,000
He says $500,000. And so that's what you sue.

363
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:19,110
And then the legal fees are $10,000 that you have to pay if you go to court.

364
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:39,100
So 500,000 and $10,000 are going to get better if you're a candidate in the.

365
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:59,770
Right. So now. We are going to run a decision tree, right?

366
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:13,030
So in a decision tree, the best thing that you can do is get all the parameters in the top part of your spreadsheet,

367
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:17,440
all the numbers, parameters, and then refer to them in the decision tree.

368
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:23,860
So if you change something in any of the parameters, the amount of probabilities or whatever,

369
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:30,160
then you don't have to go and change in every place in the decision tree that you use.

370
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:36,399
And we just, just change this here and everything will wind ideas automatically.

371
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,990
So that's a good a good practice.

372
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:46,510
But I'm going to now call the decision tree open.

373
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:51,100
Does it position trees to finally say.

374
00:57:54,080 --> 00:58:10,180
And then position three. Close that and that's the start.

375
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:27,860
So I want to start in this fish tray here and I'm going to call that this is 937, so I'm going to kill that problem in 37.

376
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:43,000
And this is what's going to do this.

377
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:48,520
This is a maximization problem. Right. So because we're going to these are, you know, pay off.

378
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:55,720
So is going to be the maximum payoff, what probably the most total to 100%.

379
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:03,879
They got around 6.01% need for any kind of calculation.

380
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:08,100
That render is probably a little bit different than that.

381
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:12,880
There's so many between, you know, for one, that's going to be a little bit of a tolerance.

382
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:16,630
Right. But we are not we're not going to use that.

383
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:28,300
So the format, the calculated values, I'm going to change that to currency with no decimal.

384
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:41,280
And then they calculated probabilities is going to be is a percentages.

385
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:50,170
With percentages with one decimal.

386
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:56,709
So it would be like three decimal with with plane numbers.

387
00:59:56,710 --> 01:00:02,740
Right. So then this is going to be.

388
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:13,150
Currency. No sense.

389
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:29,480
Did I do? Okay.

390
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:55,400
I did something wrong with this. So let me get these numbers.

391
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:16,250
12 p.m. Two two close.

392
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:21,870
It could save that the.

393
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:49,660
Okay. And then we have 39, 37 this.

394
01:01:55,310 --> 01:02:09,070
Escobar. 3937. We?

395
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:26,070
3937. This model will include.

396
01:02:48,370 --> 01:03:03,749
The more. The amount of the lawsuit.

397
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:09,970
400,000. The legal fees, 10,000.

398
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:17,100
And. Those are.

399
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:31,050
He and. Okay.

400
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:40,550
So let me I know that these are the one will really be that with the sum check and the amount is zero.

401
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:49,270
So I'll deal with the. With the fallout later.

402
01:03:53,420 --> 01:04:04,590
This is. All right, so I'm going to start my decision tree and.

403
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:35,750
So a new decision tree. And that's going to be a problem.

404
01:04:45,890 --> 01:05:00,620
937. Let me give you more the view to this and then I'll I'll deal with the format later.

405
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:09,370
So what we have here is the first is going to be a decision or a state of nature.

406
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:20,470
You are doing that to make a decision that once was the decision of the court or settle for a settlement.

407
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:31,490
Right. So that's the first decision. And if you go to court, just if you have a status of nature, if you settle, then you have a settlement.

408
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:40,270
And that's great. And the settlement amount is is this number here that we want to figure out how much is going to be so.

409
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:48,330
So we have a decision and the decision is going to be what?

410
01:05:48,730 --> 01:06:00,300
The Court. This one for sale.

411
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,980
You know, when you go to court, does it if you settle?

412
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:19,960
You know, if you go to court, you're going to get I'm sorry.

413
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:24,890
If you settle, that's it. You're going to get this settlement number here.

414
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:28,790
That is in E! 17.

415
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:31,879
So we are going to refer to E 17.

416
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:35,540
So this is equal to the amount in B 17.

417
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:38,809
I don't know what you mean right now is zero, right?

418
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:50,780
So I'm going to find court. That is too long might but I'm a judge and then I'm going to if I go to court, one can have it.

419
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:54,440
So it can I can have how many possibilities?

420
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:00,879
I'm going to win. Right. But I don't know how much I'm going to win.

421
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,550
So how many possibilities are there? Seven. Seven.

422
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:15,900
So if I go to court, then I'm going to see seven.

423
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:22,930
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to make them branch up.

424
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:48,330
It is. For for club and country, though this year's photographic alone doesn't have to do anything.

425
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:56,640
And then those are. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

426
01:07:57,090 --> 01:08:02,460
And then this is a word.

427
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:15,550
And then I come put the name of these of these of these know a word, right?

428
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:19,290
I mean, this is meant to be the zero.

429
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:50,010
Tune into. But over the phone, we instead of trying to find a way to call that zero, then this is going to be 50,000.

430
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:56,820
This is going to be an underestimation.

431
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:13,260
This is going to be 200,000 is it's going to be an 800,000.

432
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:31,150
And this is going to be 400,000. Know, finally, this happened to me.

433
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:37,190
500,000. Hey.

434
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:42,860
Now I need to put the same thing, but now they are true numbers.

435
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:51,710
So this is the amount that I'm going to get if I go into or in this case is zero.

436
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:16,460
And the second one is equal to 50000 to 1 million is the tier one is the 100000 to 200000.

437
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:35,970
They did include to. 200,000 and this is equal to 300,000.

438
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:43,740
It's a sequel to 400,000.

439
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:54,650
And finally, the sequel to 500 sounds, right.

440
01:10:55,790 --> 01:11:02,570
And now they probably it is this is equal to one vote to five.

441
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,800
Equal to five.

442
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:26,650
For anyone. 1 to 5.

443
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:47,080
1175. I'm going to three.

444
01:11:54,630 --> 01:12:11,940
But so we we know that if we go to court, we are going to pay equal to, my gosh, the extra legal fees by going to court, which is 10,000 a year.

445
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:22,320
So so finally right now, you know, going to court, if the settlement is zero,

446
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:29,970
going to court, you know, is the best decision, which is will give you 311,250.

447
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:35,850
So this settlement, it has to be greater than 311,250.

448
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:41,190
So that settlement is exactly 311,250.

449
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,690
You are in different going to court or settle.

450
01:12:44,040 --> 01:13:03,270
But they say if there is the settlement is 400,000, then you go to you know, you settle compound 400,000.

451
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:14,930
So it's it's it's just have to be more than these know the value of this notoriety of going to court which is 311,253.

452
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:20,730
So that's the that's that's your breakeven for the settlement.

453
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:31,530
And so if this settlement is is simply, you know, these they if they break even these this amount and put it this way,

454
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:35,160
at this amount, you should be different of going to,

455
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:53,639
you know, to to court or to said of course you know it that if you are dealing with suspected one to any value in this case you get 300,000,

456
01:13:53,640 --> 01:14:06,390
250 and 11,200. So the decision to go to court is just randomly is the first one that is, you know, they did 3000 with the same amount.

457
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:22,980
And so it doesn't matter if you if you they if the settlement is down 311,000 307,251 311,251.

458
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:47,160
Then in this case, you settle if you 50 318,250 249 211,000 311,249 11,239 then.

459
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:55,770
So what do you think then?

460
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:58,920
In this case, you would go to court?

461
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:03,210
Right. Because one would go there in expectation here.

462
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:10,540
Suppose that you know so.

463
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:19,590
So how much? How would you pay for someone to tell you exactly what day court is going to award you?

464
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:24,960
If you go to if you go to court before you make the decision.

465
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:32,780
Right. There is someone that says, you know, I know that George had a in your case.

466
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:39,390
I know exactly how much the judge is going to award you and how much would you pay for that.

467
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:45,570
So so that's what is the value of perfect information in this case.

468
01:15:47,700 --> 01:16:01,700
So how would you determine that? So I assume that let's say that the settlement is supposed to.

469
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:08,290
The settlement is. 300,000.

470
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:18,700
So let's assume in this case that they, the insurance company said we can settle for 300,000.

471
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:24,999
I mean, you use and you sue for 500. If we win, we are going to settle for 300,000.

472
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:30,460
And if not, then, you know, take, you know, take your chances in court.

473
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:40,180
So how would you do that? How would you find how much money would you pay the person with perfect information?

474
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:58,640
Think about that. Okay. So just remember that what we can do is you know how to do this is if I give if I if I put you in a bay of table, right?

475
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:06,709
So and the same thing happens if you put it in there in the decision tree, that's exactly the same.

476
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:11,270
So let's put it in the payload bay of Babel very quickly.

477
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:16,940
So I'm going to do here decision one is go to court.

478
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:48,090
And the decision to resettle. And then I am going to get the probabilities of what you do could be and your base special transpose transpose.

479
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:54,940
So you have my probabilities and then the amounts that I'm going to get going to call.

480
01:17:57,350 --> 01:18:08,820
Go to a special transpose and then Santo.

481
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:16,670
We said that company over 300,000, 300 even if we did.

482
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:28,320
Right. And then in the you in your EMV.

483
01:18:33,730 --> 01:18:38,780
For your EMV, your goal. There's some of them.

484
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:53,730
Of. These numbers with these probabilities is informed.

485
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:57,360
The probabilities and then.

486
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:13,200
Obviously these these I need to subtract these and to subtract to all of that this problem dog minus the fee, which is that $10,000.

487
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:16,810
Right. So I'm going to get my notes.

488
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:22,310
And so was. They love these.

489
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:26,010
So that's why we have 311,215.

490
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:35,359
Okay. So of course, I will go for that, for respect the monetary value of the board, because it's not yet on 300, $300,000.

491
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:43,309
But if I want to now compute the MBI, I get the maximum.

492
01:19:43,310 --> 01:19:48,260
So if I for $1. So this is going to be the maximum.

493
01:19:57,090 --> 01:19:58,140
These two numbers.

494
01:19:58,290 --> 01:20:11,009
If I knew exactly what my state of nature is going to be, what my pay would be there in this case, like in this case, I would settle.

495
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:14,880
I would settle. I would say set said, I would settle.

496
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,480
And then I would go to Paul and I would be for this case.

497
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:28,290
Right? So I would go to court in Houston to last the cases and I would settle in the first 1 to 3 or four.

498
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:38,550
And here I am in different right, because it's the same amount. So the MBI would be equal to the.

499
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:52,040
Eat and eat and the right is painted white only on the perfect information.

500
01:20:52,040 --> 01:21:04,070
It would be that some problem. My problem is with this maxim on the mountains.

501
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:13,820
So 380,000. And therefore, it may indeed be I.

502
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:32,960
Has to look in the eye. It's going to be in the eye.

503
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:36,970
Minus the maximum expected monetary value.

504
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:40,140
This is this is what I would get with perfect information.

505
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:44,270
This is what I would get without any particular information.

506
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:56,089
And I have a little bit of a problem here because this is 300,000.

507
01:21:56,090 --> 01:22:00,670
But these numbers are I need to subtract.

508
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:06,530
You know, it won't. It's simply one of them. So sorry about that.

509
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:09,890
So this is going to be my notes.

510
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:14,650
And then in the other one, I know this is obviously.

511
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:37,390
And. Well, you know what?

512
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:48,510
You know what to do. So what I mean is that in order to compute the EVP, I was.

513
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:56,400
You pay special? Yeah. So that's why I'm going to.

514
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:13,640
The only easy way to get this number equal to is minus ten.

515
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:23,190
So. Right.

516
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:47,430
And the. It'll be a base issue in terms of tracking solutions and then the EMV is able to do some things here.

517
01:23:48,300 --> 01:24:00,060
So I guess the MVP is going to be 300,000 and the maximum in the.

518
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:11,780
He's never been through good days.

519
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:15,620
Finished, I suppose.

520
01:24:20,150 --> 01:24:25,750
Yeah. 318,200. $300,000 MVP.

521
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:36,010
3075. And BPI is equal to the MVP minus hundred 11,250.

522
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:39,550
So a 63,760.

523
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:51,390
So the 63,750. Is that what I would pay the maximum without paying for someone to tell you in advance how much I am going to be awarded in the quote?

524
01:24:52,330 --> 01:24:59,002
I think we're out of time, but you can do this either by looking at the tree or the.
