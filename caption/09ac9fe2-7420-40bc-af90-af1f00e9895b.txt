00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:17,520
At the end of 2019, a very contagious and highly lethal respiratory virus was first reported in China.

2
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:25,200
It wasn't long before it spread globally, and both the public and governments were looking to epidemiologists for answers.

3
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,340
How deadly is this virus? How is it being spread?

4
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,080
Is it impacting all of the people the same? And what about children?

5
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:43,080
Do I need to worry about their safety? Infectious disease experts were really doing their best to figure out the answers to these questions.

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,380
But the problem was, at the start of the epidemic,

7
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:54,360
the testing capacity for the coronavirus was so low that they were really lacking the data they needed to answer these questions.

8
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:03,810
This drives home the point that in order to do our jobs well as epidemiologists, we really need to have good data.

9
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:13,410
If we're unable to either correctly identify who is sick or what risk factors they have, then we quickly become unable to do our job.

10
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,410
In this unit, I'm going to talk about the different types of data that we use as epidemiologists

11
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,640
and the likelihood that each of these types of data are measured with error.

12
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:32,310
Then define and quantify the concepts of accuracy and precision that we use to understand how good our data is.

13
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:40,380
Next, we'll talk about how you can predict the impacts of either non differential or differential measurement error.

14
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:50,880
And finally will conclude in talking about strategies that we can use when designing a study to enhance data quality and what to do after a study.

15
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,320
If you find that information bias is likely to be impacting your findings.
