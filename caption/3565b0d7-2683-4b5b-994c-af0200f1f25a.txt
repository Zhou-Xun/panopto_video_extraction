1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,370
I might morph over depending upon how the school year goes on to zoom.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,919
But let's just play that right here. Okay.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:17,250
So so it looks like I think most everybody just kind of looking at the data that Kansas sent us, had a chance to take a look at the the Kansas side.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,730
I think I could use pretty much this campus similar to all the other courses.

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,790
Honestly, I don't know how the other faculty use it. This works really well for me.

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,860
So just a couple of housekeeping issues here.

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,319
The core syllabus is linked on a Google doc, which means that there might be changes in it.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,910
So it allows me to make the changes without having to download a PDF and then make those changes because

9
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,890
in the past that has been troublesome because we're in so many different places all of the time.

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,830
So go through definitely. I know it's kind of I'm not going to go through the syllabus because there's nothing I

11
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,489
hate more than like a whole first class that's dedicated to reviewing the syllabus.

12
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,410
When you're all bright graduate students that can do that yourself.

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,910
I think it's outlined there pretty well. So but you can pop that up, review it.

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,310
So the things the main thing that I want to point out here, though,

15
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:14,330
I am it's not that I'm old school, but there's a there's really good food science textbooks.

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,070
Almost everything else I give you will be links and articles and a lot of like media that I like to use throughout class.

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,480
But there is something inherently very good about this understanding food.

18
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,670
They update it every couple of years. I try and always recommend an older version.

19
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,690
I've worked with the company to, you know, in the past I kind of could capture a version that I,

20
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,409
you know, probably illegally downloaded for you to use.

21
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:46,440
I don't have access to that anymore, but it looks like you can get electronic version for like $19.

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,620
That's about Amazon. I saw that, too.

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,820
I also have another email into the company thing if there's anything else that we can do.

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:00,090
The older versions of these books are about $40, as opposed to the new version being 240.

25
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,910
Even if you can find an older version than the sixth edition that I recommend, you can go for that.

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,299
I do also have some books in my office if anybody needs to borrow any of those, and we can also put a call,

27
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:19,210
shout out to the on the Facebook page to see if anybody and who's in the D-I now might want to actually let you borrow it.

28
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,670
I like it, though, honestly. You know, sometimes you get those books where you want to keep them on a bookshelf.

29
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,580
So those kind of bookshelf books, this is one of them because there's just a lot of basics in it.

30
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:36,700
With that being said, there's going to be chapters every week, I would say, you know, like like skim.

31
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,720
Okay. Some of that might be repetitive. If you've ever had a foods class before, you might have learned some of that before.

32
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,049
But you know what? There's really nice highlights, though, and boxes that have an interesting science.

33
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:57,480
And then there's also some great biochemistry chapters that if you need a refresher from 630 or 631, you can go back to those and like, oh gosh,

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:05,820
I totally forgot about carbohydrate structure and protein metabolism and what is a triglyceride versus a fatty acid and what is that structure?

35
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,600
I'm not going to go into great detail, but baseline knowledge of that is really good.

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,490
Other than that, you'll have kind of like standard every week readings that you'll need to do.

37
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,970
So if we back up here, I don't have everything.

38
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:27,900
So take a look at my instructor page and that each week you're going to have a link here with everything that you need on it.

39
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,489
And I don't have everything published yet. I tend to update those and those publish those that usually like I will probably

40
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,030
update next week later on today and it's published and ready for you to go.

41
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:45,510
All of the assessments. Assignments are all published now that you can access those up is that.

42
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,040
Oh okay. So sorry. The view here is really weird that I can't see that because it's so close.

43
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,339
So in every week what you're going to see on there will be required readings.

44
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:04,139
And what I like to do is I like to give you something that's more appropriate for perhaps a client or a patient that you're seeing,

45
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:13,860
like that would be, you know, heavier duty lay like a lay reading that always links the science articles that that that the the writing came from.

46
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,090
So one of the things that I like is this that's called the conversation.

47
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,920
And I don't know if this always comes out of universities across the United States in the world,

48
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,410
and they often interpret scientific research into readable articles for laypeople.

49
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,360
So you'll have something like that. And then you'll probably also always have like more of an evidence based article.

50
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:42,659
This one is a little older on the on patch as Tanzania of taste but really good because it just gets at our innate kind of like for things like salty,

51
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,250
sweet, bitter, etc. There's always going to be some textbook readings on there.

52
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,580
You'll have the PowerPoint slides in the back, sometimes with the note,

53
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:57,120
sometimes without what assignments you have coming up and then going to the actual readings and resources.

54
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,940
And don't freak out over that because I like. There's so much good information out there.

55
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,010
They'll often throw things in there that maybe I read that I thought that you might be right.

56
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,579
We don't do tests and we're not doing tests and quizzes here.

57
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:16,220
It's really gaining knowledge that you can at this stage of the game, you're applying it to your assignments.

58
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,940
So it's all application based. So anybody like Gastropubs anybody ever listen to.

59
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,760
Okay, so Gastro Pod is also one of my favorite.

60
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:32,390
They kind of blend history and science and the culinary arts and they have a great one on taste for this unit.

61
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,410
They actually have a really good one on crunch taste on flavor.

62
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:42,710
My favorite thing to do, like walking to class or walking in your neighborhood or walking her dog, you know, to listen to one of those.

63
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:49,159
This one's really interesting, the one I taste. So if there's anything you're doing, the actual readings do it sometimes.

64
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:57,620
I'll also put something like really happy in there that maybe you don't have the capacity that week to read a 15 page evidence based article,

65
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,340
but maybe you're one of those people that really like to do that. So that's there for you, too.

66
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:09,350
And then the other thing that I wanted to point out is that this is a document that you should all have access to.

67
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,300
I can see some of you on there now, and that it is and you should be able to edit it.

68
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:23,660
If you don't have editing access, let me know. But what this is this is the collection over the years of books that we've recommended, food, blogs,

69
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:30,889
many of you mentioned you have a blog, add it to here, blogs that you may really like, food, podcasts, etc.

70
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,780
So, so there's quite a bit of information on here that you can find helpful.

71
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:45,770
We have some YouTube channels and then Celia, my GSI from last year, help with this final section of food tech.

72
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,750
So food science and food tech.

73
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:58,159
So this kind of there's some climate and some business articles in there related to food, again, just for you as a resource for you to go to,

74
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,710
if you're looking for more information and perhaps add anything in there, this is just a running list that we have.

75
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:10,190
I'm going to just pause any questions kind of about the layout. That's what it's going to look like pretty much every week for you.

76
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,560
So this first week with the long holiday weekend coming up, you'll have a little catch up in reading,

77
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,220
perhaps like today's material and then you'll have next week's.

78
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:25,760
I also have a whole bunch of other books that I keep both in my office and every week I'll bring something to class.

79
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,620
The textbook is good. This is one of my favorite and you can all take a look at it.

80
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:34,400
How to read a French Fry. So it's really interesting.

81
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:43,459
Science written again for the general public with some great recipes in it, and I'll do a quotation from it later by for Mother's Day this year,

82
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,980
my oldest son gave me this book, Catching Fire,

83
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:53,660
and it's all about kind of how we evolved after we learned how to cook with fire and brain development.

84
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,550
It's a little bit more like Edward.

85
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:03,140
Edward Ruiz Narvaez may, like in his course, teach a little bit more of kind of the anthropology of food is a very interesting anthropology.

86
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:08,810
Focus on it. Since you guys are going to be writing a lot of recipes, feel free to stop by my office.

87
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:19,940
Office hours will be Tuesdays from 930 to 11 or anytime by appointment, but this has a lot of interesting examples about how to write recipes.

88
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,260
We'll talk more about that next week. And there's a whole PowerPoint posted on recipes.

89
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,290
This is of course, this is all about kind of like the genomic kitchen,

90
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:37,910
how our genes and our microbiome interact with us in terms of how we cook and the whole new concept of culinary genomics,

91
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,240
which we're going to touch upon this semester, too. So basically,

92
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:51,200
how do I optimize the food that I'm eating to make sure that it has the nutrients that can actually improve the genetics that I've been dealt with?

93
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,320
So for example, we'll talk a little bit about, you know, somebody here mentioned cruciferous vegetables.

94
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:05,510
We'll talk today about the kind of bitter genetics that go along with people that can and can't tolerate some of those cruciferous vegetables.

95
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:13,849
But we'll also talk about how we optimize some of the ingredients in the nutrients that are available that aren't really even classified.

96
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,470
We call them bioactive.

97
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:23,549
So things like sulforaphane that actually we know that if you actually chop that broccoli in advance and you let it sit for 30 minutes,

98
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,459
that actually get more of it because there are enzymes, remember enzymes 630.

99
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,920
So there are enzymes that actually need to do some digesting, but if you immediately put it in the oven,

100
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,540
the science tells us that those enzymes will actually die pretty quickly and they're not

101
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,550
going to be able to do some of the digestion of the bile actives that are in the food.

102
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:49,220
So that's what we'll talk about. This is probably my all time favorite food Bible, Harold McGee.

103
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:55,910
He's kind of like the grandfather. We might even have to call a great grandfather knob, but of our food science.

104
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,480
So this is like beautifully exquisite detail.

105
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:06,920
Of all of the different foods and food science again and myself in my room, I'll bring it occasionally to kind of reference.

106
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,089
And I have a whole bunch more of these and they should all be listed.

107
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:17,239
So if you ever like have like a birthday coming up or you want to give somebody an idea of like,

108
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,220
Hey, Mom, buy me this, you know, it should come and look at it.

109
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,250
If you like it at my office, I do think of it as a suggestion.

110
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:32,060
So I don't ever assign readings out of these unless I were to copy a chapter and put it up there for you.

111
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,710
So questions. About any of that.

112
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,360
Okay. Cool. I think.

113
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:51,990
The probably the most important in my 8 minutes before we take our brave is everybody cares about grades, right?

114
00:10:52,530 --> 00:11:00,209
I don't think we should. I think we should all be pass fail. But we do great this course and it is a latter grade.

115
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:05,780
And there is absolutely no reason in the world that all of you should end this course with an eight.

116
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:12,300
You do the work, you know, your read, the assignments, you follow, the rubrics, you come to class, you participate, you engage.

117
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,590
We should all be getting A's out of it. So that is my goal.

118
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,820
I don't do it the same way that Dr. Bridges does with a whole bunch of extra assignments that you can pile up your grades to a thousand.

119
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:32,879
I work really simply on 100 point scale. It's pretty clear all of the points are assigned pretty equally throughout these assessments

120
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,740
that we have and the assessments when you do spend 10 minutes looking at the syllabus,

121
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:43,650
they do directly relate to our competencies and learning objectives that we need to achieve in the course.

122
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:51,209
So basically the main assessments that you're going to have is our three recipes to development we'll look to develop.

123
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,130
We alluded to all of these with the first one coming up do at the end of unit one.

124
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:02,760
As you can see, there's the courses organized into units and that's going to be this kind of food pantry farmer's market.

125
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,160
Like how do I possibly develop a recipe if I have a client who has SNAP benefits?

126
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,120
So basically taking some of your community nutrition,

127
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:18,480
some of your other experience that you've had over last year, you know, putting some of your skills to work.

128
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:27,450
Like if I have $5 a day and I have to feed a family and I need to develop a recipe, how much of it can I use for a lunch recipe?

129
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:34,050
And how can I optimize the dollars that I can by utilizing utilizing things like the Mason Blue Cupboard,

130
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,630
perhaps a farmer's market, learning a little bit about double up food bucks if you don't know it already.

131
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,450
And that's all linked into the assessment.

132
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:50,010
So for that, for that assignment next week at the beginning of class, I'll pull that up and I'll show it to you in greater detail.

133
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:56,190
Your goal for the next week is to review that first recipe because it comes up pretty quickly.

134
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:06,870
And it's and I do want you to engage in your community by either going to Mesa Blue Cohort and seeing perhaps what you can use for the recipe.

135
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:14,010
And I do want you to engage in a community by perhaps trying to go to a local or the Ann Arbor farmers market to try and engage to.

136
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:22,110
So the little field trip oriented on your own. Just to let you know, also, we've evolved over the last couple of years with COVID,

137
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:28,860
but I'm all about trying to reduce the amount of cost that you spend, not anything that you develop in this class.

138
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:35,640
So I'm okay with you working in small groups or if you are somebody with prefer to work alone, that's fine too.

139
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:41,370
And that's all outlined with the maximum number of people that can be in compared cost

140
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,879
because this is something you're going to actually you can take a picture of it.

141
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,740
We want to see it and you are always welcome to bring things in for everybody to share.

142
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,350
We weren't able to do potlucks last year like we've done in the past, but we might be able to do that this year.

143
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,900
And you'll find in my assessments and the descriptions of it, there's multiple links that can help you.

144
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:08,700
I would say the biggest obstacle, which really surprised me last year, was people.

145
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:16,249
Not really understanding that if you're working with a client that uses SNAP

146
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:22,760
benefits to hopefully supplement their grocery store income and you develop a snap,

147
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:30,469
and that snap costs 2 hours and $0.50 per serving and you only have $2.50 left for the rest of the day.

148
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:39,200
If we're operating on $5 a day, that and then the calories are only 200 calories per serving that that's just not working.

149
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:45,400
So I really like really want you to think critically. This is like a critical thinking assignment about that.

150
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:54,290
I apply everything that I've learned to this point to make a recipe that I'll probably know roughly how many calories you know,

151
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,970
somebody would need per day. And then the math of the cost of the food.

152
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,560
It's a crazy year. And we'll talk about that with the rising cost of food prices, too.

153
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:10,099
So we'll talk a little bit more about that in the second half. Later in the semester, I won't get into details.

154
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,239
One of the really fun projects that I do, I switched this out years ago from a research paper to a white paper.

155
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,120
It's very much more the business industry standard as opposed to the academic community.

156
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:28,399
These are more colorful, engaging ways of displaying information, and we kind of take everything that we know when we want to know.

157
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,440
And you want to explore in the food additive world and we create a white paper.

158
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,749
More details there. End of the semester.

159
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,969
Probably the biggest point distribution other than the food additive white paper is you are actually

160
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:46,000
going to put a video together where you cook something using a skill that you learn this semester.

161
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,579
Film yourself and we're going to really work this year.

162
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:58,459
On making those as professional as possible. I think that's probably my biggest complaint from last year was like the professional nature of them.

163
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,090
They were fun, you know, fun is good too. I'm fun.

164
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:11,510
I think I'm fine. But I think that we really want to look the part a little bit of the professional in these videos and articulate in that way also.

165
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,870
But we want them to be educational and fun and successful.

166
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:22,309
So more to come on that in couple of years past with color I use the yellow did in canvas if anybody's ever use

167
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:28,550
that I actually put that aside this year because it became really clunky and people were looking at it as,

168
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:36,410
Oh, I have to do this, I don't want to do it, but I'm going to really encourage more participation in the classroom every week.

169
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:42,290
I want to start with some type of like a pair share where with your neighbor you share something about something,

170
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,910
some food label that you read at the grocery store that you've never led before.

171
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,030
Like you're going to go out and you pick up, this is my former student.

172
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:56,450
This is a true story, but this is my former student, Aaron new project that he developed this beef jerky.

173
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:04,009
And you're like, oh, wow. Like I remember when I looked at it for the first time from my dietitian lens, I'm like, Oh my gosh,

174
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:10,250
you have these three different flavors here, Amrit, and they're all made out of beets and none of them have extra protein.

175
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,850
But why in the world do they all have different amounts of protein in them?

176
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:20,510
That doesn't make sense. So I kind of like that eagle eyed nutrition to start looking at labels and ingredients and sharing.

177
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,099
We'd probably all go to some store that sells food once a week, I would imagine.

178
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,000
So I'm just prepared with some story to share with your neighbor,

179
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:35,690
and periodically throughout the semester we'll have a couple people every week share out and we'll include that as part of participation.

180
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:41,210
Again, I'm not going to be a checklist. You know, we'll just get a general community sense that we're all engaging.

181
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:51,799
Okay. And and then because we're offsite doing demos through Zingerman's, we're actually collaborating with South Quad,

182
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,510
the dorm on campus that has a beautiful kitchen because my usual kitchen is closed this year.

183
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:03,590
So every time we do this, then you're just going to do a two minute little survey to tell me what you thought about it and whether or

184
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:08,510
not you really thought we applied some of the knowledge we've learned in class into this demonstration,

185
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:16,250
because that's really what I'm all about in this class, is trying to not just teach you to regurgitate, but regurgitate.

186
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,450
That's why we don't do quizzes and tests and teaching you so that you can apply it.

187
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:25,190
And if you're not applying it in the demos, then I haven't done my job and we need to work towards that.

188
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:34,580
Changing that. Okay, that's one big the last actually I'm going to end here, the last class I forgot to tell you that I'm teaching this year.

189
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:38,930
I won't really call it teaching. I'm just running the 6088 nutrition seminar.

190
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,450
You guys like that for next year? Yeah, some. Yeah, some shakes.

191
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,020
Yeah.

192
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:54,890
Okay, well, you're going to love it this year because I'm actually I really have mixed it up a little bit that every researcher that's coming in,

193
00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:00,890
I want all the second year to come it and every person is coming into the Bachelor research.

194
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:09,710
I'm hearing that there's a clinician so that that clinician can then talk about the research because I think sometimes it seems so esoteric and so.

195
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,170
So it's really all about applications.

196
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:22,160
For example, Dr. Seeley, Randy Seeley, who a obesity bariatric surgery researcher, he has a he's one of our joint faculty.

197
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,760
He has a lab out on north campus.

198
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:33,140
And so he one of the first talks is going to be talking about his bariatric surgery, mice model research that he does.

199
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,520
And then two weeks later,

200
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:43,210
we actually have a former student that's coming in talking about how she actually counsels people in their bariatric surgery clinics.

201
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:48,560
Like what does that really mean in real life? So that's what I'm going to try and do.

202
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:58,010
I'm hoping that it's successful, but so far it's it's really kind of first semester is going to be a lot about, I would say, deeper scientific.

203
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,260
It's all science but deeper research that might be more bench and lab based.

204
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,250
And then the second semester is going to be more food insecurity research.

205
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:14,150
Somebody we're going to do the food analysis research. Somebody that does like kind of choice science, that type of thing.

206
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:21,970
So so we'll see. I think it's coming together well. So we'll but the proof will be in the pudding in the course evaluations at the end.

207
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,890
So but more information will come about that next week and an announcement because the first one won't be until September 14th.

208
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:34,500
So. So break let's take our 11:00 break and then we'll come back in the second half of class.

209
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:48,470
We're going to do some taste testing whether or not you don't like it.

210
00:20:49,040 --> 00:21:09,650
Thank you so much. Of course, I want you guys to respond to our list of people that have done it and a lot of them are bioscience this time.

211
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:17,390
It yeah. So I sent it to I've been wanting to go to some of that.

212
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:25,390
Yeah. Yeah. That is what I got to go back to.

213
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:48,350
You did this all my freshman year last year in the summer and this is currently and it's a big year from my fellow.

214
00:21:48,620 --> 00:22:01,150
Yeah. So I'm doing a lot of doctors as well so I'll let you know when I'm not sure that's okay.

215
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:14,559
Yeah. So know ended not getting all of that which I didn't know how to do.

216
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:23,040
Yeah. So now I'm not really a senior so I like, I like the for you know,

217
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:31,440
and then also oh my gosh, we are actually going to be spending on us and stuff like that.

218
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,680
And I'm going to feel like I just I'm going to talk to Carol, too.

219
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:41,350
I just I just want to know what is going on.

220
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:48,530
So ultimately, I will be sending a letter, her email.

221
00:22:49,130 --> 00:23:04,730
So I'd like to hear your thoughts and see what else you think you know.

222
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,470
What about Friday right now?

223
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:16,190
You know, I'm sure that.

224
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,940
I know. I know, I know.

225
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:28,280
I tell you today.

226
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:34,020
After yesterday. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

227
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:54,770
No, I. I have no idea why you didn't get anything.

228
00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:05,720
I want you to think about it.

229
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:15,059
That. I really like that.

230
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:19,670
You have your cover for that?

231
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,090
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

232
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,410
Yeah. Yeah.

233
00:24:32,070 --> 00:25:05,969
I have to tell you, you know, I think when you know what I mean, it's just not going to be like, you know, every night or anything like that.

234
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:22,270
And it's just so, you know, it's not like, oh, I can't take that.

235
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:29,050
I know. I don't like that because I.

236
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,560
I don't know. Streamline that to make it more efficient.

237
00:25:34,870 --> 00:26:09,360
Yeah. Because like, I think that, you know, I think they have for a long time and what learned want to do is just what I have to do.

238
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:47,350
But it's like I don't know, I don't know if you saw it all drive me, you know, through that I've tried that.

239
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:59,750
I had no idea that, like.

240
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:11,370
And yet it's like you have to get to know something.

241
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:29,920
Yeah. So I'm like, usually I don't have because I feel like, I don't know, going to be.

242
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:37,440
It's like I just know people no matter the time.

243
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:54,320
No, no, you know, I just.

244
00:27:54,340 --> 00:28:00,000
I wasn't exactly sure.

245
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:11,580
Yeah. So, Aaron, broccoli's all about nutrition.

246
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:19,170
He was an undergrad who partnered with me, and he's like this as the honors project as an undergrad.

247
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:24,090
And he was really interested in, like, food systems and farmers and vegan nutrition.

248
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:28,170
And so I worked with him and then he went on, he worked for him diving in sustainability.

249
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,260
And then he always had a dream of like starting his own company.

250
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:43,200
So he partnered and they're just launching ads and and there's different flavors coming in different I'll start with that actually is interesting.

251
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,300
So yeah, I'd love to hear your feedback on it.

252
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:58,390
I mean, I wasn't exactly like at first and then I was like, Yeah, I mean, we live in a society where people are going to always snap.

253
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:04,650
So, you know, how can we create snack foods that everyone might be a little bit more palatable?

254
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,090
So yeah, so like.

255
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:27,550
Okay. Let's get started. What are some the experiences developing?

256
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,510
And it looks like Wholefoods is going to kind of pick it up for a limited amount of time.

257
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:38,890
I think like I think about, you know, you analyze everything from the nutrition facts label on that to everything else that's involved in that

258
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:49,920
sodium content because it really is made with the flavor experience that's really like he's working there.

259
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:59,740
There's a busy initiative where you can give back like some of your products as a part of your model

260
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:05,890
is actually sending like 55% of the profits will go back to like issues around food insecurity.

261
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:14,559
But generally I say it's problematic when I'm very honest with it and talk about it because each bag is going to be somewhere around five or $6.

262
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,330
So I said, like, Aaron, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense because that's about the amount of

263
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:23,830
money that somebody who's visiting San Francisco that day and that's the bad.

264
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,900
And so it's production cost.

265
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:33,040
You know, all the other things are sort of with itself, but if you've got any feedback on it, you know, let me know and I can send that to him.

266
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:39,790
One thing I just didn't bring up, so you might have heard of Healthy.

267
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:46,689
And at the end of the semester, the unhealthy chefs and dietitians are trying to help teach one of our egg classes.

268
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:51,940
I really like eggs a lot. Eggs in terms of teaching about all the things you can do with them.

269
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,860
But unhealthy offers.

270
00:30:53,860 --> 00:31:01,810
Now three virtual cooking classes and they've opened it up to all of our students in this class can attend any event virtually for free,

271
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:08,920
and they have like more of like kind of like a culture ethnic theme this coming year.

272
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:15,249
As you can see, we've missed out on all this, but the link is in the PowerPoint.

273
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:20,140
Click on it. Sign up for one if you want to. If you feel like you can attend, they're there.

274
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:25,240
They do a very nice job. And what I like about it for you,

275
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:32,860
doing it in this particular class is you will see what a good food demo looks like with a combination of professionalism,

276
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,910
interesting food, great fun facts, done in a really timely manner.

277
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,570
Okay. So I want to make sure that everybody saw that.

278
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:48,940
So in the 40 minutes that we have left here, what we're also going to do is throw out a couple of different taste test.

279
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,960
So in the interest of time, I'm going to pass two things around for you.

280
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:58,180
These are tests, paper strips that don't do anything with it other than take one.

281
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:04,600
If you so choose to experiment with it, that will determine whether or not you're a super taster.

282
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,300
It's probably concepts you've heard in the past. So if you want to take one of these and when the time is right, we'll do these.

283
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,140
And then kind of one of the fun things that we do in this first class,

284
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:22,060
because we're talking about olfactory senses and how how we experience taste in flavor as we do this little jelly bean experiment.

285
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:27,180
Plus, these are vegan for anybody who's interested also and I have two different flavors of jelly beans.

286
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:33,099
You can tell by their color they're slightly different. So if you would like to participate with this as the jelly beans come around,

287
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,940
I put them on a plate so you can just take one and you don't have to touch all seven,

288
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,800
figure out some stuffing, take two of them, take one of each of the different kinds.

289
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:46,360
I have a third flavor too. I don't know if we'll have time for it, but if we do, can do that after all.

290
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,559
Okay. And then the other really weird thing about this particular classroom is it doesn't have

291
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,430
the ability for me to see instructor notes on it because of the way it's arranged.

292
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:03,820
So I have to kind of have simultaneously my even though I have most of it by heart, I have my laptop open to have to look here too if I'm doing that.

293
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,950
So I have to wear my glasses to do that. So,

294
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:14,139
so let's get into food choices and sensory characteristics because basically the basis of everything that we put in our mouth comes

295
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:21,580
from the combination of all of the different things that we've learned throughout our lifetime about why we make certain choices,

296
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:31,360
some things that some of the more social science research that's come out is that we really know that we're very adamant and our dislikes.

297
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:38,490
How many times have you heard somebody say, I absolutely hate eggplant or insert whatever it is and the other, you know,

298
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:44,440
and we think about our likes, well, I like this and I like this, but we're really adamant in what we don't like.

299
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:50,800
We also are somewhat and and not us. You have to take your self outside of this classroom, too,

300
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:56,620
because here in some ways on preaching to the choir, but open yourself up to kind of the general world.

301
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:04,840
Most people are neo phobic when it comes to food, so they're somewhat afraid of trying something that they haven't been exposed to.

302
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,510
And that increases by the decade, you know, the older people get when they haven't tried something.

303
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,240
They're afraid of it.

304
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:22,469
So we know in childhood that exposures you need usually around night exposures of an unfamiliar food in order to gain acceptance to it.

305
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:28,630
And there's been a lot of research around that and that really changes as people age because they become less inclined.

306
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:37,270
So. Other thing is that when we think about what we like and we don't like some of the research

307
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:41,770
that has come out that's been explored over the years is that we really like complex flavors.

308
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:49,299
And what do I mean by that is there's a reason why in the United States, products like Coke and Pepsi,

309
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:56,050
other than being full of sugar, are really popular and are the leading soft drinks is because they're more complex.

310
00:34:56,470 --> 00:35:00,070
People tend to tire of single flavor beverages.

311
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,690
So like when I think of single flavor, I think of something like an orange.

312
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:07,900
The sales of those aren't anywhere near as high as they are for cola products.

313
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:16,960
And what's interesting is because it's very complex. So when I say complex, like if I were to say to you, what does cola taste like?

314
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,000
You can really say, Yeah, it's really hard.

315
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:30,520
Anybody have like it's definitely a complex mix of flavors that come out of it, become a medicine, have many things you can't really pinpoint.

316
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,430
Anybody have any thoughts? It's addictive.

317
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,880
I mean, when we think about our taste, we might say it's sweet, right?

318
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:51,000
But you could say that about if you were to drink like a sunkist orange, you would say, Oh, it's bubbly, it's sweet and a taste of orange.

319
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,780
And then you might also say with cola, well, it tastes like cola.

320
00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:02,220
And yes, there is a cola now, but that's not really what the components of Coca Cola or Pepsi Cola are.

321
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,930
So we, as in general in our country, do like these complex flavors.

322
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:12,130
We also talked about the exposure effect, like being exposed multiple times.

323
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:16,379
So so that's something that we learn throughout childhood.

324
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:22,260
And then we also, you know, we it changes as we age.

325
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:30,419
Other thing that I like to touch upon too is like this sensory specific satiety or also the that really is better said,

326
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:37,950
like the expectations that we have for food. So let's say in the days when you you still unless you've done any international travel,

327
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:45,450
in the days when they used to feed you food on an airplane, you might, like sit down and you would get your food that was passed around.

328
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:49,770
And you might say to your partner who's sitting next to you, Oh, that wasn't bad for airplane food.

329
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:55,649
So you go into the situation with the expectation that something isn't going to be

330
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:00,900
necessarily good and then you adjust your expectations based upon the experience.

331
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:07,079
It might be also completely different for that if you are spending your own money rather than

332
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,920
your parents money or somebody else and your family's money at an expensive restaurant,

333
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,260
the expectation is that it would be very good because you're spending that money.

334
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:21,059
So so those are kind of just some general specifics.

335
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,950
And then there's also this other thing that kind of comes across is what we call the dessert effect.

336
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:30,360
My best example of this is with my mom, who's in assisted living now,

337
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:35,370
and she's really kind of been for me a lot in this process of transitioning to assisted living.

338
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:44,530
And she's very inactive, so she doesn't burn calories a day, but she'll take a few bites of her life and then push that away from you.

339
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:48,180
I was like totally full. What we are is the dessert, you know.

340
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:55,470
So and it is actually a phenomenon that's been studied of the dessert effect that no matter how full, you've got to have something.

341
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:59,370
How many times have you said, like, I can take another bite of that, right?

342
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:06,540
Like no more pasta, push it away. Is it any more satisfying on the 15th bite as it is on the first or second flight?

343
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:13,980
Most research indicates, no, that your greatest pleasure, it actually comes from flight one, two and three and not like 1450 to 60.

344
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,159
But when you have that, you've heard people say that you push it away.

345
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:23,010
There's always room for something sweet because you usually will have a savory type meal,

346
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,549
but our senses want to kind of finish it with something sweet.

347
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:30,150
So so just things to think about when it comes to food choice.

348
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:35,840
Another thing I like to put out here is kind of what I call the great restaurant question.

349
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:40,490
So so how do we as individuals choose what we want to eat?

350
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,750
And I give you the example of when you go into a restaurant.

351
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,960
So when you go into a restaurant, let's just do a brainstorm.

352
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,560
What makes what gives you the you know, what informs your decision about what you're going to choose on that menu?

353
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,400
Thoughts, huh? Like the descriptive words used on the menu.

354
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:08,709
Right. Right. So whether or not that would be if that evokes an emotion, if that evoked something like, you know,

355
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:18,580
they always use like what we call onomatopoeia this, you know, like something that's like crunchy or warm or whatever your mood is, right?

356
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:22,020
Kind of like that sentiment conversation that we had. Yeah.

357
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:29,710
What else? A description on the menu. That's like seeing it to me, comparing it to if I think that's what it is.

358
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:32,930
Yeah. So. So you can see it by looking at your neighbors.

359
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,880
What did she have? Oh, what did they have? What does he. You know, that sort of thing.

360
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,330
Or now, like many menus have changed the QR codes.

361
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,570
Right. Or they actually have like a pad that you're looking at the food.

362
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,440
So your expectation is if that's the way it looks in the picture, that's the way it's going to look when they bring it to me.

363
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,850
And a lot of that is changed. Right. What else? I saw other hands.

364
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,370
The good cost. Absolutely, yeah. So the cost is, are you paying for it?

365
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,080
Is somebody else paying for it? What does your budget allow at any given moment?

366
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,850
So and for a lot of people, it's a luxury to be able to go out to dinner.

367
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:08,580
So they really want to make it special and something that they love.

368
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:15,030
And they may be then like somewhat neo phobic, like, I'm not going to go and try that Thai restaurant that I've never tried before.

369
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:18,530
I may not like it, and then I'm going to actually spend money on it.

370
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,740
So. Good point. Yes. Preferences. Yes.

371
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:32,000
Right. Food. So I do I look at the menu and I scanned it like not that I had a chicken that could if that exists, what's the is there any fish?

372
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,780
Is there any vegetarian? What am I in for? Yeah, food preferences.

373
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:39,060
And you can even expand that out in our little group here. You know, I.

374
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:45,450
I might be thinking of a pancake breakfast sirup, so I need some protein for lunch.

375
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:49,890
You know, people don't always think that way, but physiologically,

376
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:55,890
you actually might like your body might be telling you like, you know, you need to fill another need here.

377
00:40:55,890 --> 00:41:01,680
So you might then subconsciously gravitate towards something that has more vegetable protein.

378
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:08,520
What the restaurant specializes in, you know, it's a steak restaurant, how they operate.

379
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:15,179
And that's a that's kind of like the airplane example. Right? Like, you know, when you go like I would say like, okay, well, this is the deli.

380
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:18,729
I am not going to order these something stir fries or something.

381
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:22,740
I like, you know, you get the burger or you get the meatloaf and perhaps potatoes,

382
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:28,790
you know, you kind of know what that restaurant specializes in people who work there.

383
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:37,460
Absolutely. Yeah. You know, and it's so funny. Like, I always think I always ask, but sometimes my family, like, hates me for doing this.

384
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:42,360
I'm sick. I'm not sure which dessert I want to pick you. The one that you would pick, like they hate it.

385
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:47,819
But when you do that, they I think they you know, I feel like it's like an idea that they can make a choice.

386
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:52,080
They second what other people like, but what somebody else likes might not be what I like.

387
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,910
And then you might also like with desserts too, like, what am I feeling today?

388
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,059
Right. And like when you say like, what am I feeling? Is that what you're emotionally feeling?

389
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,150
What you're physically feeling, what you had over the course of a week?

390
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,690
It's more complex than you think about to do.

391
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,940
I think the one that I immediately thought of was, Are you sad?

392
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:17,310
Like, if you see like that, someone else does something like, Oh, I think like that or something is on the board.

393
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,100
Like, Oh, right, like today. Right. That would be what I would have to get.

394
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:31,080
Exactly. And I always have like from a food safety standpoint, I have two rules of thumb with the with the special board.

395
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:37,770
Isn't that special? Because I want to get rid of it because that tomorrow is not going to be good or is it a

396
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:41,639
special because they just got all this fresh fish in and it's going to be really delicious.

397
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:47,790
So I don't know if we magically ever know the answer to that question, but I think you have to work in the back of a house of a restaurant to know.

398
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:52,050
So, yes, last comment, seasonality as well.

399
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:59,320
Think about soups during fall and winter. You know, I'm not going to ice cream with zero, that kind of.

400
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:03,990
Yes, yes, absolutely. So I agree with you on that.

401
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:10,799
Okay. So we talked about flavor or taste, how you feel, language of the menu.

402
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,760
Are you adventurous or are you neo phobic, you know,

403
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,229
kind of culture and heritage and what we value and the decisions that we make and

404
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:23,430
that these preconceived values that we have or preconceived notions of the food.

405
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:29,729
So and then we'll go throughout like the rest of the whole semester, we're going to be talking about why we eat,

406
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:35,309
what we eat, what are our food choices, and then we're going to wrap it up with some of the sensitive characteristics.

407
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:38,700
Today we'll talk about the sensory characteristics that we know.

408
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,430
We, you know, when we talk about food trends next week, just to kind of set the stage,

409
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:50,579
you've probably all heard of the spice company McCormick before that was the biggest spice and they have a big research

410
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:57,000
lab and they're always trying to figure out what the next best spices that's really going to change the industry.

411
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,040
And when we combine like this neo phobia that we have and then adventurous spirit,

412
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:09,330
usually what ends up working is they'll take a spice that's new, but they'll apply it to a food that we already know.

413
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:16,650
So let me give you an example. So, like, that's like kind of Chipotle seasoning, you know, that's become very, very popular.

414
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:21,240
So so when you combine that with something like chicken wings, you know,

415
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:29,940
it becomes something very familiar with a when it was a new spice that would take off kind of at the same time that that spice came out.

416
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:35,040
Like Chai became very popular and there was a lot of kind of interest around is

417
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,240
Chai going to hit the market and kind of be like the next Super Wonder Spice?

418
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:45,300
It it never really left the beverage market like it didn't go into barbecue wings and

419
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:50,580
it didn't go into things like like chips and other snack foods and things like that.

420
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,480
So so McCormick has a lot.

421
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:59,920
Got a vested interest in making sure that they produce something that's actually successful at all parts of the food industry.

422
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,550
So to keep that so when you're in this fight, you know,

423
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:09,370
go to those spice blends when you're in the grocery store and look at all the different ones the husband brought home the other day,

424
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:13,690
Trader Joe's Umami. Why? He's like, what you're teaching tomorrow.

425
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:17,760
So we're going to talk about cases like, Oh, I bought this mushroom. I Oh, did you read the label?

426
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:21,340
You said, No, not really. I said, Well, let's pull it out, read it.

427
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:24,610
And it's labeled mushroom umami spice blend.

428
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:32,139
And the first ingredient is salt. The second ingredient is onion powder, and the third medium is garlic.

429
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,520
And then I think the fourth and fifth were two different powders from two different types of mushroom.

430
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:44,139
So it did actually have some mushroom. And then here's my you know, it's like a mushroom, see, like drying mushrooms that have been ground up.

431
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,540
But we know that there's so much more to that spice.

432
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:58,900
So okay, so what we're going to do is just spend like 5 minutes talking about these various different social factors that affect patterns of eating.

433
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:03,430
I have these break out groups pre plan so that we can move through this somewhat quickly.

434
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:11,559
And what I've done is I've assigned you, I think most everybody, with the exception of perhaps one hour here, I've assigned you to a group of four.

435
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,290
And what I want you to do is take your topic.

436
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:21,969
You don't need to introduce yourself because you've already done that, but take your topic and then just talk about how.

437
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:29,080
So for Group one, how does your family and your social exposures kind of influence how you select the foods that you

438
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:35,500
eat and how somebody will be the person that reports out on that and we'll go through those quickly.

439
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:44,979
Okay. So why don't you take just 5 minutes and discuss how your various different topics might influence your food choice?

440
00:46:44,980 --> 00:47:06,250
Okay. If you need me to help you find anybody, let me introduce you to my reporting.

441
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:26,540
I'm going to get has introduced her by letting us know how.

442
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,450
Yeah. How how is your topic influence the food choices that you make.

443
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:56,690
You probably have to like one of everything.

444
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:11,770
Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I think so.

445
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:16,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right.

446
00:48:16,540 --> 00:49:00,429
Tell me about this food, this I think even the ones that are just like that I find here in my class like anything at this point,

447
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:12,790
I really talk about like, yeah, yeah.

448
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:23,350
Before that, which is part of it.

449
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:37,960
Yeah, I heard something not right there on the internet and stuff like that.

450
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:46,220
I gather that.

451
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:57,260
That's what you have. Have you guys been like 30 seconds in the interest of hindsight?

452
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:23,420
Like, I was like, Oh, I'm cool with that, but I still don't know how I was raised.

453
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:35,260
All right.

454
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:51,270
All. I worked so hard last year.

455
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:06,540
I don't have a lot to do this summer.

456
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:14,700
I don't worry at all.

457
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:22,090
I think that's why I tell you guys that I pass these around.

458
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:28,970
I don't even. Yeah, okay. Let's get you out of here.

459
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:34,220
That doesn't mean that everything I have to do.

460
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:43,340
Yeah. Okay, so basically what we're trying to do is we there's a variety of other factors that influence our patterns of eating.

461
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:54,950
In addition to the science of food, there are many social factors, cultural factors, religious factors, influence by the government and media.

462
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:57,380
So those are the things that we just want to touch upon.

463
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:03,620
So the family and social group, just tell me one thing because I really want to try and get through as many slides as possible.

464
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:08,600
How do you think family and your social environment influences what you eat?

465
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:15,100
Adult nominally adult modeling. Okay. Yeah, that's kind of the research of Dr. Bauer.

466
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:19,719
She does a lot of that in her lab. Yeah, I guess it kind of ties into that.

467
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:27,710
But, like, when you're young, you you you look for, like, guardian who brings into the house.

468
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:33,490
Exactly. You know, you only start expanding that when you're exposed to a daycare setting or, you know,

469
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:39,819
there's a lot of kids who go into preschool or daycare or kindergarten or if you've been homeschooled for a while and may have never

470
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:45,309
had anything because their parents have sheltered them from it or decided they were going to make the choice not to expose them.

471
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:48,880
And all of a sudden they're exposed in a social setting that's different from family.

472
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:55,750
So, right. So we're influenced by all of these different factors and huge influences now.

473
00:52:56,810 --> 00:53:00,250
Now, remember, you're gonna take one of each of the two different kinds and not eat them yet.

474
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,560
So jelly beans that are going around only if you want to.

475
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:10,240
You know, I can't tell you the number of times now that I see actually like kids at restaurants on some form of media pad,

476
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:13,390
you know, instead of engaging with parents eating, you know.

477
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:18,490
So some of the modeling doesn't even exist because the kids are doing something different while the family is eating.

478
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:21,550
So we'll touch upon a lot more of these in the future.

479
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:30,700
So what about like when we think about culture and cultural exposures, what what comes to mind there for this group?

480
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:41,560
Yes. For you in both groups? No. Oh, I thought of this group of them that we try to talk about, like going out to different cultural like restaurants,

481
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:45,219
like going out for Asian food, going out for Hispanic cuisine.

482
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:52,120
That type of thing could really enhance or just change, like what your preferences are.

483
00:53:52,120 --> 00:54:00,050
So like if you've got sushi for the first time, like maybe all this, I'm like, I like that feeling, right?

484
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:04,290
Right. You bring up two quick points. When we went around and we introduced ourselves,

485
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:09,490
many of you were influenced by your heritage and your culture and what you were exposed to and what you ate.

486
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:17,319
I'd seen many, many of you said that. So that's why those of us that maybe have had more of a meat and potato in brain being kind of like growing up,

487
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:23,440
have to be exposed through our exposures of the people that we surround ourselves with culture or the restaurants that we choose.

488
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:31,360
And then the example that you gave about going to a Japanese restaurant, another thing that people like when we think about food choices,

489
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:36,460
if you want to start expanding your food choices and you are like a meatloaf and potato kind of person,

490
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:41,379
you might choose to go to a Japanese restaurant, but you're going to have a safe experience.

491
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:45,190
Yeah. And what does that mean? You're going to choose the California rolls, you know.

492
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:48,370
All right. Probably even on the menu in Japan, you know.

493
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:55,330
So but it's the most familiar because you might see things in that your friend then maybe next time you're going to try a little row on it,

494
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:57,399
you know, so and the same type of thing.

495
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:04,930
Like if you've never tried Korean food and you go to a Korean restaurant for the first time, what's the safe choice they're being being?

496
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:13,540
Bob Exactly right. And often, like with the protein of choice that you might like, so, so think about it from that.

497
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:22,239
So, you know, and these are all of the different kind of terms that we actually use when we're talking about the cultural aspects of food and how

498
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:29,940
these have changed with our global economy that's growing and also us in the United States being a melting pot of different cultures,

499
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,520
media, even things like what is the quintessential American food?

500
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:40,060
What would you say? Four hamburgers, burgers, some people might say hotdogs, pizza.

501
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:45,250
You know, deli. A lot of deli foods, you know, like, you know, or diner food.

502
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:47,820
I kind of think of but also depends upon where you live.

503
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:52,270
I heard people reference growing up in the South and the foods that you had growing up in the South.

504
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:56,050
If you live by a coast, you might have more access to seafood.

505
00:55:56,350 --> 00:56:02,160
If you live kind of in like the Arizona New Mexico, you're going to have that type of influence.

506
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:07,540
Knowing when you're going to have different big cities are often melting pot for very different

507
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:12,160
different immigrant communities where you might have pockets of food that you're exposed to.

508
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:20,170
Okay. Religious beliefs. We're going to explore some labels and make sure that you guys know how to identify all of the different symbols.

509
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:29,109
Who was in this group? Yes. We've got to talk about if you're a religious group, you might eat kosher or pork or different types of things.

510
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:32,950
But also not to assume that just because someone's in that group that they eat that way.

511
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,419
Right. It's on a spectrum.

512
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:41,080
They choose to do it in a certain way or during holidays, maybe eat something that they would normally and doesn't have to pay attention to that.

513
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:48,070
Absolutely right. The reason why I have like this interesting response on here is because if you look closer at this label,

514
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:50,990
it's kosher, but it's made with imitation bacon fat.

515
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:56,770
So if you know anything about people who follow a kosher diet, they generally want to put pork products in there.

516
00:56:56,770 --> 00:57:01,130
So it's just kind of like messed up in a lot of ways.

517
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:09,820
So and it's also really interesting, like halal meats are often very similar to kosher meats, but they're seen as completely different.

518
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:16,290
So also depends on the communities you live in and the access to the specialty grocery stores that you have.

519
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,090
So, so throughout the semester,

520
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:27,340
we'll touch on different religious beliefs and how that influences how different religions view food and the choices that they make.

521
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:31,180
Okay. Nutrition and health, that's what we're all about, right.

522
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:36,879
Know. So the way I remember, like when I went and talked to my brother works at an architecture firm and he asked me to

523
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,250
come and give a talk and I started talking about I think at the time it was my pyramid.

524
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:45,879
I'm like, who knows my pyramid? And like a room of 102 people raise their hand.

525
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:50,710
I'm like, Oh my gosh, I have a lot of work to do, but if I asked you, it would be different.

526
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:55,750
So who was in the nutrition and health group? Yeah, anything to say.

527
00:57:56,170 --> 00:58:03,999
I mean, because yeah, we kind of said like it's based off of like your own knowledge of nutrition and how you grew up.

528
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,830
Like what you know about nutrition.

529
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:12,760
Like how I knew what I knew just from growing up is completely different than what I know now exactly affects my choices now.

530
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:18,459
Like what I choose to eat. Yeah. And I think like a lot of the exposure to the various different versions of the period

531
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:21,850
of my pyramid on my plate is whether or not you had cereal boxes in your house,

532
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:26,600
because if you had a cereal box, they almost always would have one of these images on the back.

533
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:32,319
So so we're influenced by what the government tells us in the various different campaigns,

534
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,680
as well as the food facts label that we've talked about already,

535
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:45,490
and the dietary guidelines for Americans that get changed every five years but have a lot of influence from the industry to sell more to come on that.

536
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:50,920
How about economics and marketplace factors? Those have definitely changed over time.

537
00:58:51,300 --> 00:59:00,160
Sarah Yeah, so we talk a lot about, you know, cost of food, cost of ingredients versus eating out when it comes to shopping for food, cost of gas.

538
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:04,420
You shop in a place near you or your shop, a place that has maybe more selection, right?

539
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:07,660
So lots of different factors beyond just the cost of it.

540
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:12,759
And so much has changed in these last two years at the beginning of the pandemic, like food delivery,

541
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:17,770
food, meal kits really sort there were like, yeah, oh no, I was going to have in that group.

542
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:26,500
Yeah. So like coupons that might influence what you're buying and then also like seasonally locally grown stuff.

543
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:31,719
So and the knowledge that you have a palisade also influences you to like.

544
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:39,430
So in the during the pandemic, the storage, there's now a 150 meal delivery kits that used to be just like Blue Apron and Hellofresh.

545
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:46,210
And those have soared. But now they're struggling right now because one positive thing about the pandemic is many people learn how to cook.

546
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:53,440
They learn like, I don't need a laminated card with all these ingredients and all these tiny little containers to pull something together.

547
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,770
I don't think I have the confidence to be able to do that now.

548
00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:00,669
Yes, I was in that group, too. But in terms of the coupons that we talked about,

549
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:08,890
also how some grocery stores are really like tech advance and that like an app where you can click the coupons on your phone and scan and get rewards.

550
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:13,000
And so that makes it a lot more accessible and people want to shop at certain stores because of that.

551
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:20,140
Yeah, it's also makes it though like for honestly like an 80 year old person that doesn't carry their phone and know how to,

552
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:25,490
you know, doesn't even know the distinction between an app and internet.

553
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:32,290
You know, it makes a challenging like people just want to click on a coupon in a flier that comes and that doesn't exist anymore.

554
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:40,460
So it presents its challenges to. Also, do you live in a neighborhood that has like signage for width or that takes a bridge car?

555
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:46,630
You know, so those types of things and those are very like geographically and economically distributed.

556
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,920
So depending upon where you live. So, so many factors and that.

557
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:54,740
So we can do a whole class on this. What about technology?

558
01:00:55,050 --> 01:01:00,690
Yes. So for our group we spoke to using like air fryers and Instacart.

559
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:05,180
Oh, I those products like convenience and they can speed up at the same time.

560
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:10,160
Right. Using like the food there have an effort to make sure it's very good.

561
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:12,760
Yeah. I mean, those are, like, simple, you know,

562
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:18,780
and like my examples here are a little bit more of like things like that per hour preservation, like irradiation.

563
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,580
You know, this site is actually it always confuses people.

564
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:25,670
We don't see it a lot, but it's a sign that a food has been irradiated.

565
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:31,700
It's usually used in spices that needs a lot of imported food, aseptic, packaging, those things.

566
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:37,400
But, you know, other more simpler tools too, when we think of technology, gadgetry, type of stuff that improved.

567
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:43,910
So. Okay. I love this. It's kind of like I'm an amateur Norman Rockwell type picture here.

568
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:47,450
But how about emotional and psychological effects?

569
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:55,250
I think back to that that spice like, are you feeling spicy or are you feeling warm and cinnamon or red pepper today?

570
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:00,740
Yeah, our group and stuff like that. That's funny. But we never have more of those negative things than psychological.

571
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:10,070
Yeah. And like thinking about like being afraid of eating foods that that was going to happen to me with my like an allergy,

572
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:13,760
but like always being anxious about whether or not you're going to eat something that you can't eat.

573
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:17,210
Yeah, I'm like, constantly questioning whether or not it's okay.

574
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:25,430
So that was something that came up. And then about celebrations was a happy thing, like you on your birthday or like Thanksgiving,

575
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:28,520
like being excited to all the different foods for certain holidays.

576
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:33,140
Absolutely. There's so many wonderful memories that whatever that food evokes.

577
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:36,020
But there was also, you know, I think bringing up that point, the negative.

578
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:40,250
And how were you being judged by other people that the choices that you make?

579
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:48,080
I think about that in judgment calls that we make even on planes for the snacks that somebody pick, you know, or you know.

580
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:54,560
I mean, it's all of this kind of like unspoken pride that we have of who you sit next to,

581
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:59,030
what they look like and what your mind processes, what they're going to eat based upon that.

582
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:04,250
And it's all like little like kind of microaggressions that we have to walk around.

583
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:10,810
So that's a really good point. I also have a link on here to about like kind of like how we support others with food.

584
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:17,510
And somebody brought this up too. There's wonderful websites that exist for people who are sick or recovering from

585
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:24,080
an emotional issue or death in their family about how we comfort them with food,

586
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:33,050
that other aspect of it. That all the groups did we get everybody okay that we only have 6 minutes.

587
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,860
Okay, we'll see what we can get.

588
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:46,019
So I think this would be a really good time to kind of pause and to utilize our jelly beans now and then at the beginning of next class,

589
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:53,849
we can kind of pour through some of these because these sensory characteristics are all things that should be review and old school for you.

590
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:58,469
So we don't need to spend a lot of time on it, but what we really like, we talk a lot.

591
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:05,100
We'll talk in this class and you're going to read and hear about it in the literature of the difference between taste and flavor.

592
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:11,700
Okay? And they're distinctly different. And flavor is much more complex and even challenging to define at this point.

593
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:19,620
But we know that the elements of flavor actually come from about 70% of what we smell and about 30% of what we taste.

594
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:26,580
And one interesting article that I updated for you is like how Koven said an impact on smell and taste.

595
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:33,690
So I found I really love for those of you future dietitians, today's dietitian is a really nice resource.

596
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:36,780
In fact, Hendersonville just got asked to write an article about something.

597
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:40,800
And so I have sometimes I'll, I'll do articles from that source.

598
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:45,030
And they wrote something that kind of like the physiology of being able to

599
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:51,149
have code that has changed and how the virus has impacted that whole factory.

600
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:57,840
The smell response that we have. So, so basically what we know and what we've always known is that that's why when you're

601
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:01,809
sick that you look at food doesn't taste as good because there's so much of an impact.

602
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:04,860
So this little experiment just kind of proves that.

603
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:15,060
So when we think about like everything we've talked about so far up to this point and how we make judgments before we even put something in our mouth,

604
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:19,950
you've probably all seen these two jelly beans in front of you and you've already made a judgment about that.

605
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:30,390
What do you what did you think? When I say fat, like, oh, this is cinnamon and cherry or anything that you associate with being grabbed, right?

606
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:39,569
Yeah, yeah. Right. So anything else I like the in the spirit of the coloring.

607
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:41,810
Yeah. The way it's presented. Okay.

608
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:51,060
They might be like, this is going to be sweet or like some type of a memory for those who celebrate Easter, you know, something like that as well.

609
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:59,669
So what I want you to do at this very, very simple experiment is just plug your nose and everybody put what I was in my mind.

610
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:03,120
What is more red and what is a little more orange you to it.

611
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:13,260
So but the one that's more red if we're going to use experiments. Well you know what the red light shows that the clear and so I'm sorry one more.

612
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:18,630
Okay. And that's why I don't have them in front of the bag.

613
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:24,920
I'm sorry. I look at the bag. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

614
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,700
There is no one here.

615
01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:37,680
I would say the clear one is the red one. So what I wanted you to do, if you haven't already done it, is plug your nose to it.

616
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:46,080
Think to yourself, what does this taste like? And I let her know to go and see whether or not it changes.

617
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:51,719
It should be like a little bit of all of that.

618
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:55,860
I saw that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

619
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:10,410
That's the first one I picked the is one of the very few classic like with what you might have said.

620
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:14,790
Okay, let's do the second one, which would be like, I think you guys call that the more opaque,

621
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:18,119
the less shiny, the one that had maybe a little bit of orange in it. Same thing.

622
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:21,480
Plug your nose. Put it in your mouth and chew.

623
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:32,290
What would you say? My goal is to kind of high school education, but I don't want to let go of your nose,

624
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:44,690
see if the olfactory response is in its roots, and hopefully it's something else other than sweet spots.

625
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:48,910
But I think I'll go the berries.

626
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:52,890
I don't like apple.

627
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:59,260
Yes, it's sour apple. So I have a third one here, that cinnamon.

628
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:05,870
So if you want to do it like that, I think you could do that, too. I don't know how we do that.

629
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:19,660
You know, you can do that with anything. Actually, it's about Europe for, you know, you have an apple.

630
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:24,330
So like if you want to make it, you know, that was great.

631
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,860
So, yeah. So anyway, so just that's just a little experiment to show you that.

632
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:33,669
And then in the last minute, we'll do this, do a little cleanse you guys.

633
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:38,260
If you have water in front of you, do a clean, make sure your palate is clear.

634
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:42,970
Next week, we'll talk a little bit about sensory experiments when we finish off this PowerPoint.

635
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:51,889
But so we also know that genetics has a big influence on things that we like,

636
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:57,250
that we don't like because we have specific genes that actually code in our mouth

637
01:08:57,250 --> 01:09:03,340
and on our taste buds to give us stronger reactions to certain types of foods.

638
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:07,030
One of the most popular ones in society is with cilantro,

639
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:18,130
so about 10% of people have the gene that actually codes for the protein that makes cilantro taste like an aldehyde or a very cell, B, very bitter.

640
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:21,940
Some people say dirt, mud. I mean, just kind of awful.

641
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:25,870
So. So is anybody one of those cilantro? Yes.

642
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:29,349
Yes. And if you hate it, you hate it and there's nothing you can do about it.

643
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:33,990
Right. And that is all genetics. So this is actually a genetic test,

644
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:41,920
a very simple genetic test that you'll do to see whether or not you haven't seen the most popular gene that codes for a chemical called PTC,

645
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,060
which is actually a bitter chemical. It's one of the ones that's been studied the most.

646
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,010
More details next. We got it.

647
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:57,559
And if you have that, you actually have that protein that codes for that particular gene and that tells you where and the range of taste you are in,

648
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:12,370
the super tasters and so on. So just go ahead and take that test strip and put it on your tongue and let me know what my taste that's not so.

649
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:15,760
It's a homo c homozygous dominant gene.

650
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:21,100
So the majority of people in this class should taste something.

651
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:29,049
And then a fraction of those who taste something should it should taste disgust, you know, like a you like it really.

652
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:33,879
It is very unpleasant. So does anybody have that unpleasant feeling?

653
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:39,430
You don't mind being called out? Yeah. So do you like better food?

654
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:44,900
No, I don't. Are you a coffee drinker? Yeah, with a lot of creamers.

655
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:51,090
And how do you do it? Like cruciferous vegetables, broccoli and like a ruble.

656
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:58,419
A lot of seasonings. I don't really do it. Right. So everything that you just said out of all about the super taster.

657
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:02,400
So, you know, so one more question. I kind of want to start out with you.

658
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:08,680
What do you think the genetics of knowing that about somebody you might be talking to and counseling,

659
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:16,750
what other types of things from like a health standpoint I think would be important to know if somebody told you like, hey, I'm a super taster.

660
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:19,809
I really don't like bitter things. What, what?

661
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:23,350
That what else might that inform you? Just kind of like take a lead there.

662
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:34,650
That's. Yeah, yeah. Well, I think that there's a lot of that.

663
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:36,250
That's a really good point. Right.

664
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:44,780
So often, though, when you are super taster, it's not just the bitter or so, sometimes it's across the board that you really react from anyway.

665
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:53,940
So that it could be true. It could not be true. And I just feel like we are much more comfortable having them on a stronger basis than anywhere else.

666
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:59,560
We know that like in certain tests that sweets like the perfect left percentage of sweetness

667
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:04,020
would be a product that's about 10 to 12% is that's about the sweetness of fruit.

668
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,989
But you have something that overly sweet, it's less desirable.

669
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:14,640
So maybe I'll take two more and we should wrap up across anybody else.

670
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:21,350
I'm else and think about. They might have a hard time finding things.

671
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:27,559
Yeah, they might be one of those people that are viable. They need somebody who makes it really hard.

672
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,920
Like, you know, those people. Like, remember the lovers in the theater?

673
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:33,500
When you make something, you're adamant about what you make.

674
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:40,330
I think it's like I'd like somebody who's just like, no matter what you do, you're never going to be like, you know,

675
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:48,680
you know, it's like that part of your nose and putting back your belt kind of thing, but doing something like that.

676
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:51,470
So you also might consume less produce.

677
01:12:51,710 --> 01:13:00,380
So sometimes people who are super tasters actually have more risk for gastric cancers because they have less actually fiber that they're consuming.

678
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:06,460
Actually, super tasters are usually non smokers, usually non drinkers also.

679
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:10,470
So glass, non smokers, less risk of actually having lung cancer.

680
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:16,870
So there's a whole kind of bundle of things that go along with that and that's how the genes kind of influence.

681
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:23,470
So we have kind of divided the science of these social factors and then we have the genetics much more so.

682
01:13:23,490 --> 01:13:31,430
But I'm going to wrap it up there and we'll crowd through the rest of the PowerPoint early next week and then move on to our next topic.

683
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,270
It's over.

684
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:58,870
So it's it's got a very large university and I know why people I just want to add to our menu and it's actually the most bitter taste not after

685
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:23,850
as in your response to this particular camisole and to think that it's a disease and it's a real problem because this has been well received.

686
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:34,820
Wow. Wow. It is public health. So is people like know that that's health outcomes.

687
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:38,130
Oh, wow. This is a new do.

688
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:43,920
Is this a discussion as far as this is all about?

689
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:47,930
All right. Can you. Oh, thank you. We have a lot of those.

690
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:53,360
I'm going to turn it off. Oh, so what are you planning on doing and asking you?
