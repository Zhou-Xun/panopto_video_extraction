00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Population Health Part one. My name is Alfred Franzblau.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm a medical doctor and I'm a professor in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences in the School of Public Health.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In addition to being trained in internal medicine,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I specialize in an area of preventive or public health medicine called occupational and environmental medicine,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
which focuses on illnesses and injuries related to exposures in workplaces and the general environment.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I want to speak with you today about population health.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
In the first segment of this lecture, we will discuss the concepts of health,

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
public health and population health and how these concepts are related and how they differ.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In the second, third and fourth parts of this lecture, we will focus on three key measures of population health,

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
in particular infant mortality, life expectancy and mortality rates for each of these three measures of population health.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We will explore how they have changed over time and why.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
How does the United States compare with other countries? What are some important patterns and why?

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How does population health help to explain and or understand trends over time and thereby inform public health policy or interventions?

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So how do we define the three concepts, health, public health and population health?

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
How do they differ? And also, how are they related? In a previous lecture,

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:05,000
we defined public health briefly as the set of activities a society undertakes to monitor and improve the health of its collective membership.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:16,000
In the early 20th century, Charles Edward Winslow, a leader of American public health, offered a more comprehensive definition of public health.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
He called it the science and the art of preventing disease,

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
prolonging life and promoting physical health and efficiency through organized community efforts for the sanitation of the environment.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The control of community infections. The education of the individual.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And the principles of personal hygiene. The Organization of Medical and Nursing Services for the early diagnosis and preventive treatment of disease.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And the development of the social machinery which will ensure to every individual

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and the community a standard of living adequate for the maintenance of health.

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This may be quite a mouthful, but it highlights that public health is multifaceted.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Public health involves a broad range of activities that include three key domains assessment, policy and assurance.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It is also much more than just medical care or medical practice.

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
In contrast to public health, the concept of health is focused on the individual.

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Some have defined health solely in terms of physical health, such as freedom from disease.

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But others, like the World Health Organization, have taken a broader,

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:43,000
more holistic approach that includes more than just physical well-being and also encompasses mental and social well-being.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Hence, personal or individual health is multi-dimensional.

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But the concepts of health and public health are not totally distinct, as illustrated by the Venn diagram.

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The concepts of health and public health are overlapping. Public health often has a major impact on the health of individuals and conversely,

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
the collective health of the individuals in a population represents the public health.

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So what is population health and how is it related to or how does it differ from health and public health?

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
How is it related to these latter concepts?

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Population health has been defined as the health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group.

38
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It is inherently a numerical concept. It involves collecting health data on or about individuals health risk factors and

39
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
health outcomes that taken together provide an assessment of a population's health.

40
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Examination of risk factors and outcomes provides a basis for assessing temporal trends and also for making comparisons between populations.

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Population health looks for patterns in health data that may help to explain or to understand such trends.

42
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Population health can provide a justification for public health policy or interventions that seek to improve individual health outcomes.

43
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Population health can also provide a foundation for assessing the impact of such interventions.

44
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So having presented these various definitions, it might be helpful to evaluate a case study in order to help clarify these concepts.

45
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Consider the case of Joe Smith,

46
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:58,000
who is a student at the University of Michigan who happens to live in Markley Hall a few weeks after beginning a semester over two or three days.

47
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He developed symptoms consisting of cough, fever and malaise, and he goes to the University Health Service for evaluation.

48
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So the first question is, is this a health issue? Well, of course it is.

49
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Joe's health has been adversely impacted as manifested by the symptoms he is experiencing, which leads to the next question.

50
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Is this a public health issue? Well, maybe it depends.

51
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Does he have a routine cold? If that were the case, the public health implications would be minor.

52
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
On the other hand, what if he were found to have the seasonal flu? This would then lead to more questions.

53
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Is his flu virus covered by the seasonal flu vaccine?

54
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And if so, did he get the vaccine or not?

55
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And importantly, what do we know about other people living in Markley or elsewhere on campus having received the flu vaccine?

56
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Does there need to be a campaign to get people vaccinated quickly to prevent the flu from

57
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
spreading through his dorm and elsewhere on the campus or even into the more general community?

58
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The point being that the details of Joe's illness may or may not have important

59
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
ramifications with regard to public health actions and interventions in his dorm,

60
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
on the campus and in the more general community.

61
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:36,000
A key question is how might we determine whether there is a public health problem and if so, what can be done about it?

62
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This leads to the last question. Is Joe's illness a population health issue?

63
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Again, this depends again. Suppose he was diagnosed with the flu recall.

64
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He lives in Markley, which typically houses just under twelve hundred students.

65
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Suppose the University Health Service had been collecting data that showed in the

66
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
preceding week that 50 other students in Markley had been diagnosed with the same flu,

67
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
but there were in the same timeframe. Only five students had been diagnosed with the flu.

68
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:22,000
In South Quad and similarly in West Quad, both of which has roughly the same number of students as Markley.

69
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
These data clearly indicate that not only is there flu circulating on the campus,

70
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:36,000
but that for some reason there is a 10 fold higher rate of transmission in Markley than in the other residence halls.

71
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
These data not only support a campaign to get people vaccinated in general,

72
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:49,000
but might warrant further investigation as to why transmission has been 10 times greater and Markley than in the other residence halls.

73
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:58,000
In addition to a vaccination campaign, should there be a temporary quarantine of students living in Markley to prevent further spread of the virus?

74
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Finally, imagine the same scenario, but substitute covered 19 for the flu.

75
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The point is that the data provide a foundation for framing questions, for understanding the problem,

76
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and for designing possible interventions to protect the public's health and individual health.

77
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The collection and use of data is an essential foundation of population health.

78
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Population health is more than just numbers. It can reveal trends.

79
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It allows for comparisons and for assessment of patterns in the data.

80
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The data can provide for identification of underlying causes or explanations of trends.

81
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And importantly, the data can provide a basis for public health interventions.

82
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We will be looking at such data throughout this course.

83
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
In the last three segments of this lecture, we will focus on three key measures of population health,

84
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
including infant mortality, life expectancy and death rates.

85
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We will explore temporal and historical trends, offer some explanations for these historical trends,

86
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,943
and also make some comparisons between the United States and other countries.
