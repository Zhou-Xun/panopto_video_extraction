1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:12,010
Well, morning, everyone. We are going to start our today's lecture class about microbiome evolution.

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:19,299
I hope that you had a great hearing and we've got time to rest to family with

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:26,140
friends and just to get ready for the final part of the term finals project.

4
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,760
And good luck with everyone. With everything. Okay, then.

5
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,130
Then as always, I will talk the first class a little bit about the microbiome.

6
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:44,530
I will focus in some aspects about what is the microbiome?

7
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:55,510
How do we study the microbiome? And also why we know about the co-evolution between the human among humans and the microbiome.

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:04,420
In the second part, we will talk. We will discuss more about the questions that were involved in the guide in class.

9
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,150
Then first, what is the microbiome? Can anyone tell me what do you understand?

10
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:21,080
The microbiome? I am the least knowledgeable person in this room, so I may see something more.

11
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,980
No, no. I'm used to it. So is native microbes the microbe yet?

12
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,290
Has the deer bile system like we think?

13
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,820
Yeah. You are probably right. All the microorganisms that.

14
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:45,589
That live within our body. Mm hmm. Now, then, when we talk about microbiome, then you are now hearing glass.

15
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:53,960
And because easier to add to do a study. Usually people talk about the oral microbiome, the gut microbiome.

16
00:01:54,410 --> 00:02:02,060
But as you'll see in the feed, you're basically all our body has microorganisms inside.

17
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:12,560
In fact, it's estimated that in total there are ten times more microbes, cells in our body, that our own cells.

18
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,460
And then you can imagine that all these micro microbes, they have their own genome,

19
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:25,070
they have their own metabolism, and they can affect our health, our physiological functions.

20
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,820
Also, we can affect their function, their metabolism under co-evolution.

21
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:40,280
Now also, again, as I told you before, even though because it's easier to study the mouth,

22
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,920
the oral microbiome from the mouth, also from that gathering from the diet track use of feces.

23
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,460
However, our body had different microbiome, different type of bacteria.

24
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:58,790
So we are going to talk here in this class mostly about bacteria, bacterias, because that are the ones that are easier to study.

25
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:06,950
But you are going to have to make sure that what we're looking at, other viruses or other types of microorganisms.

26
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,719
Then the the two most common types of bacteria that we have in the microbiome

27
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,930
that you'll see in the field are that feed me good is a whole group of bacteria.

28
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:33,590
I think they are gram positive. One example of feed cuts are the lactobacillus and you see they are two of the most common types in our body.

29
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:40,520
And the second most common types are the bacteria diet. I think these are gram negative bacteria.

30
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:49,280
And so my example or these are the ones that live in our oral cavity, for example, are ft or more not uveitis.

31
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:58,580
It's an example of bacteroidetes. However, this is these are whole groups of bacteria, different type, different functions.

32
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:06,200
Most of them are going to be just part of our body and they are not harmful.

33
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:14,000
Rather, they can be health beneficial to our official logical function.

34
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:23,660
However, as we will discuss here, the changes in the composition of the microbiome can affect our health.

35
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,900
In fact, there were some studies before, but I think the evidence is it's not clear yet.

36
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:40,940
But there was some hypothesis proposing that the ratio to feel good to bacterial dates was associated with obesity, for example.

37
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,080
I think that bias in the latest analysis showed that the evidence is not quite clear.

38
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:56,350
Question so far. Now, just to remind then to remind you that when we talk about microbiome, we are talking modern bacteria.

39
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:12,670
Even though I want to focus here in bacteria, but also we can talk about fungi, proposals, worms and viruses.

40
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:22,870
But we are going to focus our discussion in bacterias, because usually they are they are easier to study.

41
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,600
Okay. Let's talk about a little bit about macro human microbiome, Ebola evolution.

42
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:40,250
Now, what is the importance of having these bacterias in our in our Lebanese water body?

43
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:47,020
And this is an example of co-evolution between our bacterias and the host in this case.

44
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,980
And they say humans have them in the first part of the film.

45
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,150
We have different types of bacterias here represented by different colors.

46
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:09,979
We had the host and the host gig allow certain certain types of bacterias to live in size because remember, these are bacteria.

47
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,630
So our immune system is going usually to to try to destroy these bacterias.

48
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:25,310
But because we are talking about co-evolution, our immune system has been trained to allow the bacteria to live inside our body.

49
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,170
And these bacterias also, they have evolved.

50
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,330
We would expect to be able to live inside our body.

51
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,740
Now, in this case, and this is happen in some cases,

52
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:49,129
E coli are very specific co-evolution between the bacteria and the host and represented here by these

53
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:59,690
green bacteria that maybe these green bacteria can only grow within certain particular type of host.

54
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,229
And we're going to see that they are genetic variation that is associated with that type of bacteria that we can have.

55
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:16,130
We can take our body. Now here we have an implicitly sexual with this type of bacteria, the green one can live only inside this particular host,

56
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:25,580
not what it that will offer an advantage for both, both for the bacteria and for the host.

57
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,400
Because then the bacteria, as you can imagine, we have a whole different group of bacteria here inside the host.

58
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:43,100
Also, they are going to be competition by resources between all these bacteria that may be by this specialization.

59
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:52,970
There is not fitness advantages for the bacteria because he's going to have to be able to deal with everything on a specific host.

60
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,440
Now, what are the beneficial aspects for the host?

61
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:10,999
It can happen. For example, the bacteria can be part of the metabolic differential in the host labia spleen.

62
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,940
You hear, let's say here we have a Y and these y represent a response.

63
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:25,700
There's the signaling in the host and that signal or that response or metabolic process,

64
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:35,000
you can imagine that they can be almost any metabolic process here represented by y is activated by that particular for X in the host.

65
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:43,940
Then we have the X and the host they produce by the host is going to trigger this antibiotic process.

66
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:51,590
Why? However, it could be possible that these bacteria undergoing one get one to produce.

67
00:08:52,520 --> 00:09:05,180
I know there are, let's say, molecule C that is going to activate the metabolic process way in axons or that molecule X,

68
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:17,570
then it is in that case then the host that they need to produce this X molecule because the bacteria is going to produce.

69
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:29,090
Let me just the laser pointer the bacteria is going to produce the C molecule that is going to activate that Y metabolic process.

70
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,480
Now so far so good. The whole truly happy hour for doctor we happy.

71
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:48,250
But what happens if for any reason they say we have a mutation in the host and in that the host is unable to produce that X molecule.

72
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:53,889
However, because we have that green bacteria he believes in, that's the molecule.

73
00:09:53,890 --> 00:10:05,680
Still, we had a white process. However, what happens if for any reason the bacteria green the green bacteria is lost in the host?

74
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:19,620
Well, it's going to happen then. We don't have any more green bacteria and we don't have any more that x molecule from the host.

75
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:26,010
Therefore, we are going are going to have that y metabolic process in the host and that this can

76
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:32,670
lead to health outcomes or to metabolic consequence that can be harmful for the host.

77
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,930
Now I will discuss later in class and we are going to discuss how the diversity

78
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,820
of the microbiome are being are being revealed during our what we feel.

79
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,070
We have been losing bacterias from our from for our microbiome.

80
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,030
Then it is quite possible that many of the health consequence that we are

81
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:58,260
observing now can be related to these will also be drastic in the microbiome.

82
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:09,720
Now, one example of these, for example, we have discussed in previous classes that gene or that diversity gene eliciting.

83
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,690
That instead allows for the utilization of lactose.

84
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,360
You mean that's an adult? Then we have some individual.

85
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:32,160
They they they have they have a well, they are able to metabolize lactose as an adult.

86
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:39,090
They have lactase persistence. Then they are able to consume dairy products without any problem at all.

87
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:49,160
However, I also we discussed remembering glad that we discussed that they are strong evidence of natural selection in that lct eliciting that in

88
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:59,190
northern part of Europe there is a higher frequency for the lactase persistence value and that is suggestive for natural selection.

89
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,160
We discussed that previously in class now,

90
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:14,370
but we know that certain bacterias that in this case that bifidobacterium also they are able to metabolize lactose even in accent.

91
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:26,730
So lactase persistence then that that means as some sort of co-evolution that we don't need.

92
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:36,180
We don't need that if the lactase persistence if that person has the by bifidobacteria

93
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:42,360
inside their body because the bacteria is going to metabolize lactose.

94
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,840
I'm going to be are you going to allow for lactose utilization even in the absence of lactase.

95
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:57,350
It's clear, then this is a kind of or an example of co-evolution,

96
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:08,929
how a bacteria can carry out an important function for the host event in the

97
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:14,090
in the accept or die or rather that no expression or this particular gene.

98
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:24,769
Now here I just want to make the declaration that that relationship between because between

99
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:32,440
these lactase these alcohol in the LCT gene and lactose intolerance is not quite 1 to 1.

100
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:38,420
That is our. They are some person that they have different degrees of lactose beer persistence.

101
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:45,680
But still the presence of that bifidobacterium is going to allow for more lactose utilization.

102
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:57,140
The central question is, based on what you know, that which groups of people have more lactose intolerance?

103
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,740
I know many people do. Lactose intolerance.

104
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:06,080
Mm hmm. What about indigenous people and minorities?

105
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:12,350
Yes, there is, ah, bi racial and global variation of the aliens,

106
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:20,690
because not only the gene is associated with lactase persistence that other genes that also have been found associated with lactase persistence.

107
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:29,180
What we know from a study from population studies in the regions where historically having more

108
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:34,370
dairy utilization there is there is a high precision present with the lack of respect system.

109
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:43,609
For example, northern Europe also around the Middle East, I don't know is Asia, how old is the frequency at this level?

110
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:51,470
But I know that indigenous population, they don't have lactose, they don't have the lead for lactase persistence,

111
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,690
but they don't have or using low frequencies, using low frequencies.

112
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:03,920
Low frequencies, yes, we have low frequencies, therefore that allow for lactase persistence.

113
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,430
Let's say these. I live here. Yeah. You have a question from the comments.

114
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,300
So. So they have low.

115
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,690
Frequency with indigenous.

116
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:25,870
Yes, low frequency though. I mean, you can not go with can you clarify?

117
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,629
That means they can or not? They can.

118
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:39,820
But again, because they are they have different genes associated with the system with dial down or the the lactase.

119
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,740
Now what when I say low frequency or the lactase especially,

120
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,410
I refer to this particularly for the LCD gene that is in modern higher frequencies

121
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,340
in order there will be young population of the Middle East population now.

122
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,680
Now, in the break, I am going to check. But what I remember it are the appeal for our lactase.

123
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,489
Persistence in the indigenous population in the Americas is low.

124
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:09,670
The frequency meaning lactase not the exact that there would be more to this they're unable to now.

125
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:16,900
But for I want to make the clarification that one for that other genes involved in lactase utilization.

126
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:24,450
And also there's like lactose intolerance and then there's lactose sensitivity.

127
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,240
So it's like sensitivity does not lack that.

128
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:38,200
Exactly right. Even with your back, those other species in the microbe biota that are probably playing a role in that.

129
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:47,440
Sensitivity. Sensitivity is very prevalent. Let me check just that very quick before I forget.

130
00:16:53,310 --> 00:17:02,100
Alternative means to let me check. We can see this very weak entity that these persist inside you.

131
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:14,650
Because we can. I don't want to give you the wrong answer.

132
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,690
Okay. From what he did.

133
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,920
To do so you need to use keep.

134
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:40,409
Okay. Let's see this paper. Okay.

135
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:50,100
Let's see the figure here. Only three of the leading.

136
00:17:54,300 --> 00:18:11,510
Okay. Give me one second. I want to know the.

137
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:50,300
Okay. I'm going to. I'm going to stick with. I'm going to check in that break and let you know because I don't want to give you the answer.

138
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,470
But let me check that in the break.

139
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:04,610
Okay. Let's continue. Now, also, another important information that can carry out.

140
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:14,970
Our microbiome, and these are normal functions that we doubt that people have as study.

141
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:23,080
However, the. BI racial dysfunction, let's say,

142
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:31,330
for a thief in some kind of achieving the frequency of the different bacterias can lead potentially to our health outcomes.

143
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:41,710
Then this is an example of certain bacteria that can deal with carbohydrates, and they produce different type of short chain fatty acids.

144
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:50,980
And what are the importance of those short chain fatty acids is that they are they are able to regulate expressions.

145
00:19:51,640 --> 00:20:01,210
For example, they are some short chain fatty acids that they downregulate.

146
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,730
The activity of these histones are 30 days that they are inside.

147
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:14,290
They are proteins that are involved in the acetylation, morality, the acetylation, the histones in their DNA, and they can regulate this breakdown.

148
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:23,559
Now, this is a normal mechanism. The question here whether there is this balance and balance between that production

149
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,600
of each or fatty short chain fatty acids by these bacterias can lead to upregulated,

150
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,479
let's say, or downregulated gene aspiration that can produce a differing kind of concept.

151
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:41,320
For example, we know that alteration on histone modifications have being associated with different type of cancers.

152
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:54,610
Okay. Type of function that can can play the bacteria that the bacteria in this case is a modification of bile acid.

153
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,480
Now, what is the important point I want to make here,

154
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:12,210
that all of these are metabolites or bile acid can lead to inflammation also somewhat then can bind to this.

155
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:20,950
I mean, basically receptors this bile acid said every sector that either of these is involving energy in energy expenditure,

156
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:30,259
regulating of energy metabolism and also other types of bile acids confined to this nuclei respect of the furnace.

157
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,360
So it's an incredible sector and again can regulate expressions.

158
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,860
Now how these lead to different health outcome, we still don't know.

159
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:46,810
But the point that I want to make here is that if there is some environment between the activities of the different type of bacteria,

160
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:54,280
we can have more or less of these bile acid metabolites that can lead to less able to higher inflammation,

161
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:03,150
or are these dysregulation of energy expenditure or even alterations on getting

162
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,120
inspiration that can be associated again with different type of cancers?

163
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:17,830
Now. Also, bacterias can be involved in the metabolism of amino acids.

164
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:25,450
And the point that I want to make here is that some of these bacterias can take

165
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:30,910
these amino acids that l-carnitine and produce are tremendously methylamine,

166
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:37,899
that re methylamine can be oxidized in the liver and produce oxidized dimethyl.

167
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:47,230
I mean, we know from metabolic studies the oxidized methylamine has been associated with different type of metabolic diseases,

168
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:51,910
the higher, higher concentrations of oxidized three methylamine.

169
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:58,840
Now, again, these are all that type of metabolite from tryptophan.

170
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:06,190
We don't know as to how these are metabolism like the bacteria.

171
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,430
So these amino acids can result on health alcohol.

172
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:15,340
However, you can imagine that some kind of this violence here can result again in metabolic disorders.

173
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:28,570
QUESTION Because we're talking about tryptophan and the de novo synthesis in your body can make the like vitamin B three,

174
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:35,140
and that is a precursor for tryptophan. So that part of de novo.

175
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:41,080
Mm hmm. Is this is this something that these can disappear?

176
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,490
Like you were saying that we cannot make something anymore?

177
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:57,680
Uh. That thing is for an important function to disappear in our word.

178
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,969
But our diesel idea has to be neutral.

179
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:15,290
Meaning that doesn't matter if you have that function or or they or then they need to be another maybe metabolic pathway to produce that.

180
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:20,719
Now we can imagine we have had a diet to rise recently to find within.

181
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,040
We don't need that de novo product synthesis so that particular amino acid.

182
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:33,980
Then you can imagine that some mutation leading to the disappearance of that synthesis pathway could potentially occur.

183
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:44,030
However, I think from the evolutionary point of view has to be so mechanistic,

184
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,990
idealizing the alternate meaning that doesn't matter or an alternative route.

185
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:59,720
So the essential amino acid and known social history is little changed over time, like it was essential and essential.

186
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:08,450
Like we have to get it from these lists. Keep changing through the evolution of our health and you the evolutionary times.

187
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,870
Yeah. Over time was essential to us.

188
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,320
No, maybe not essential in the past.

189
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:21,740
Yeah. And that could be related to the disappearance of certain.

190
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:27,720
My changing species. Yeah. Whether or not we are.

191
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,360
Yeah, exactly. But that's an important point, because.

192
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,380
Because. And it's a very important point.

193
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,730
The one that we are making.

194
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:50,870
Because when we talk about about natural selection, we talk how have affected our genome to produce this, let's say certain phenotypes, advantages.

195
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:57,930
However, also now we need to talk about the genome and these micro how they are called evolved with our own

196
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:09,780
genome to do how they are able with our own genome to be beneficial for both because the bacteria again,

197
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:18,690
this is the kind of relationship that we call symbiosis that they are so beneficial aspect for both for the host and for the for the bacteria.

198
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:31,420
Because why our immune system doesn't destroy these bacteria's persist incorporating exactly then our immune system.

199
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:40,170
During the solution of what humans see what immune system have learned to tolerate the bacteria's.

200
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:48,540
Because these are foreign bodies of microorganisms.

201
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:59,040
But however they live inside us. Yeah, but that's a good point that Ebola we have here is affecting both our genome and also the bacteria's genome.

202
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,910
Now and then we had all these type of interactions.

203
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:15,270
Our our own genome can affect that human microbiome by direct genetic effects, maybe for interaction with diet and lifestyle.

204
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:22,670
Also the environment, chemical environment that our physical environment can affect the human microbiome.

205
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:32,600
In fact, our immune system, you can imagine that maybe some immune disorders can lead to the strong film of bacteria that useful for us.

206
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:41,630
On the other hand, that microbiome also provides some important functions to the host.

207
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:49,129
For example, with the normal metabolic activities and this may be related to that question that you would ask if they are so metabolic,

208
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,930
by the way, that we don't need any more before they are provided by these bacteria.

209
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,560
Also, they allow us to to change to certain environments.

210
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:07,940
Adaptability to changing environments. Imagine we are starting to eat and you and your food may be our own.

211
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,780
In science, they are not able to process that food.

212
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:19,280
However, maybe some bacteria can out of that can help us to be able to digest that type of food.

213
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:29,120
Also protection against pathogens because these microbes that live with us, our microbiome is in competition against harmful pathogens.

214
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:37,610
Then there is this balance between in the microbiome may be we are more susceptible to these harmful pathogens.

215
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,320
Yep. Professor, do we get our sense of the.

216
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,630
The microbe from the parents as we were born?

217
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:52,220
Yes. Yes, we got from our parents.

218
00:28:52,910 --> 00:29:02,960
Okay. So does this explain that is when we move first of all, say we didn't move like you didn't move here, you're eating the local food.

219
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:08,150
But the way to move here was this transition. And moving here was different foods.

220
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,920
Yes, you're going to change. We know the microbiome wants to change over time.

221
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:20,650
Once you change, how do you change it? You start eating some local foods and that facilitated change.

222
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:24,620
And in mentally, these become your local foods. So you eat.

223
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:31,040
With this season, the local food now is better. So when you go home to eat the food again, we used to eat.

224
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,120
Did you feel a little bit funny? This is interacting and this even we're on top of that.

225
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:44,150
I don't know if I told you that I was born in Nicaragua.

226
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,130
Nicaragua? Nicaragua. Is that a coyote in the North America?

227
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,220
Okay. But my family moved to Costa Rica. With me. Wasn't Quito.

228
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,440
I have lived in coastal. I live in Costa Rica since I was 18.

229
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:05,450
Five years old. Something like that. Okay. But the thing is that Nicaragua itself is a poor country, is a poor country.

230
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:14,510
There have been a lot of civil wars. The health system is is increased and there is a poor health.

231
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:25,040
And, you know, then I didn't hear when I was in college in Costa Rica, we are there was a scientific meeting in Nicaragua.

232
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:30,800
Was I thinking about anthropology? Then I visit with some Costa Rican friends from the university.

233
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:36,410
So now. So I'm on the faculty, we represent them some film abstracts in Nicaragua.

234
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:43,920
Then in Nicaragua it is usual that you see people are these are a food.

235
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:53,690
Oh yeah. Yeah. It's very common. You would you would walk and people are, are selling food that is very particular food in Nicaragua.

236
00:30:53,790 --> 00:31:02,749
That for me is very true. It's like a comfort food for me because my mother always called that food in a special location.

237
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:16,220
What is this goal is like and is to a B-52 is called in bowel is salt is very salty and beef with you go with that plantain and you

238
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:25,310
know then then for me to come for food because my mother always got that food in a special location is traditional from Nicaragua.

239
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:31,160
Then the thing that I went to Nicaragua would be for this Congress at all.

240
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,270
Wal-Mart was selling this food in the street garden.

241
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,059
Then I say to my friend, I went to try to. Yeah, they no, no, no, don't do that.

242
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:47,230
Because usually, yes, Costa Rican came here to Nicaragua and they eat in here in the street and they get.

243
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:52,850
But you didn't have diarrhea then. But I went it.

244
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:58,010
Yeah, I, I bought the food. I did the food and work perfectly fine.

245
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:06,909
Yeah, no problem at all. Then I do my thing. I imagine that I don't know now because that was some several years ago.

246
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:10,319
But the idea that I have maybe some microbiome from Nicaragua.

247
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,190
Yeah. Oh yeah. From, from my parents, you know I.

248
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,140
Well the water as well. Other countries.

249
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,530
Yeah. The people from those countries are charming. Yeah.

250
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:30,610
But people like me, like I went to Cuba and I accidentally drank on the diarrhea.

251
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,440
Okay. That is the legend of.

252
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,030
And I was sick for many days, but like, goodness, the family.

253
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:44,610
I went to Cuba and they were all not exactly.

254
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:50,920
Yes. I imagine now because the the history Nicaragua was many years ago.

255
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,230
I don't know now if I traveled to Nicaragua,

256
00:32:53,560 --> 00:33:00,040
maybe it's going to be different because that microbiome changed over time we got from our part and bowel.

257
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,070
So we move we change diet.

258
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,050
We are exposed to different environments, then change over time.

259
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:15,110
Mm hmm. Interesting. Okay. I'm talking about the training, the immune system, also the bacteria.

260
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,390
You know what? Gut also can regulate our immune system.

261
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,480
They help to train our immune system. And they.

262
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,200
Yes, I feel you you have to kill you.

263
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:32,500
Some of the ways the microbiome, the bacteria in particular in our the track can help to train different type of immune cells.

264
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:38,590
Because remember, these immune cells, they learn to tolerate these bacterias.

265
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:44,040
They don't destroy these bacterias. Okay.

266
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:50,070
Question So far, I don't understand the training part.

267
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,260
I understand the outcome.

268
00:33:53,370 --> 00:34:07,110
But who went to school and I don't know which training these training means are aim for the immune system is down then you're not enemy.

269
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:15,360
Exactly. Exactly like that. That development. Because our immune system first need to learn how not to attack our own body.

270
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:24,690
One that is every function that then we have in our community, for example in mass, multiple sclerosis,

271
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:33,350
lupus, but also our immune system needs to learn how not to attack these bacterias.

272
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:40,380
Then that is part of that training, how to recognize what is my own self but my own body,

273
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:47,970
what is different from my own body, or in this case also my own microbiology, those that is good training.

274
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:53,850
Okay, now there are different ways that we can study in the microbiome before,

275
00:34:53,850 --> 00:35:02,880
in the past before in from the 2000 people used to use our cultures as training to study my materials.

276
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:15,300
However, the problem with that is Westbury extends very higher have work to do that all that type of bacteria were able to growth in their cultures.

277
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:21,780
Then there were conflicting results among different techniques. Now it started in the 2000.

278
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:31,800
I think people are doing this yeah to sequence that gene for that rebuild for my 16 is reboot for my DNA.

279
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:38,350
Yeah I'm sorry I. So the final answer.

280
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:42,410
Mm hmm. So that's like you're creating a program to them.

281
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,010
Do you know what? That bioinformatics? Yeah. Yes.

282
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:51,080
The cells there? Yes. Let me I think they have a yet to upgrade about that.

283
00:35:51,110 --> 00:36:03,589
Oh, yes. Okay, then let me first spread this technique because ah, the existing is ribosomal DNA is it's a gene that is presenting all the,

284
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:10,700
almost all the human and not human, all the living things, things in the world from bacteria to humans.

285
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,650
Well, then if we sequence that gene, then we can get the information about the bacteria.

286
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:20,540
However, now there are these new techniques that are permitted genomic shotgun sequencing.

287
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,739
And and this is related to informatics. Okay.

288
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:29,210
This is an example of a study from existing is how people can study bacteria.

289
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:36,920
These are good bacteria and these are all the eukaryotic star organism with nucleus in that we are healthcare, for example.

290
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:45,980
Now, this is related to why you informatics. This is still quite impressive for me.

291
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:53,080
Hmm. And let me tell you how this work. Imagine here each of these circles is a different type of bacteria.

292
00:36:54,770 --> 00:37:03,980
Then what people do is to take all these bacteria from the sample as a feces or song from sample from saliva.

293
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,810
And there are techniques to extract that DNA to actually do DNA.

294
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:13,520
And then we break all the DNA.

295
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,710
You see here, we break it using physical or chemical ways to do it.

296
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:26,069
Then we have all these fragments. Then we went to sequence all the framing.

297
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:31,370
And now this is usually done in this huge machine that we can do out in the samples at once.

298
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,790
And then you see by the informatics tool that this is high computing tools,

299
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:44,299
we are able because now we can reference book reference data about even a bacteria were able to say,

300
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,800
okay this fragment is for these from these bacteria the fragment blue it from these bacteria

301
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,360
these red maybe from these other bacteria because we have these raw evidence databases now.

302
00:37:53,840 --> 00:38:02,240
Then the thing here is that we do a whole fermentation, we do the sequencing, and you see reference database databases.

303
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:06,020
We can know we feel the bacteria. Is our president. The sample? Mm hmm.

304
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:10,660
Now, all this is done now using computers, but.

305
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,440
Mm hmm. I was part of the team that made this happen for all you people.

306
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:20,360
Is a computer data processing capability and the processing speed.

307
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:28,340
Yeah, that. These was part of the breakthrough because I work in computers as my Mr. de Groot a.

308
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:38,600
Great. You invented this? No. We specialize in the operating system and the object oriented data management.

309
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:46,970
This put this team together. We had a breakthrough of DNA analysis in the 1980s and kind of way.

310
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:54,380
Yes. In the nineties, there was this these these project, this international pre that human genome project.

311
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,580
Mm hmm. Then you can imagine that we had the whole genome. Imagine this huge line.

312
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:04,390
Oh, yeah. Now, when the project started, then people just say, like, I stopped it for fun.

313
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,470
And the end to the end to sequence epigenome. Well, very slow, very expensive.

314
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:14,140
But then saw once again why we don't break that whole genome in pieces.

315
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:18,440
And you we see here and this is more pieces we sequenced.

316
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:23,060
But also you see that these sequences are overlapping because they are breaking at random.

317
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:28,130
Then we got some overlap. Then let's break down the whole genome.

318
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,760
Then let's you can use a small fragment that is easier to do that.

319
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:38,330
And then using computers, then we can rearrange this profile like an apostle.

320
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,590
Because, for example, I know that the fragment maybe overlap with this one,

321
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:47,270
and then maybe I know that these overlap with this one, and then we can reconstruct the whole genome.

322
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:51,140
Hmm. Now that way, now that we do that, even faster.

323
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:58,280
Cheaper. If I told you before, I think now you can get that sequence from your whole genome from $8,000.

324
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:07,070
When this started, the whole international human project was the budget was in the around the billions.

325
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:12,170
Football I think was like a $1 billion. Okay.

326
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,030
You are in director. That is a billion.

327
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:22,610
The NIH that they have a collection of different data microbiome, defeating a state of association with anti feeding of diseases.

328
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:27,220
And this is just some information. Again, I haven't used it.

329
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:32,450
I was looking I remember some time ago in this website because I was interested in doing

330
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:41,330
some analysis with the time as morning study when I was a bill looking in oral microbiome,

331
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:45,320
colorectal cancer, we didn't find any association.

332
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:53,240
But it seemed to say with any study here you are interested and you feel free to go down and look into it.

333
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,390
Regarding changes in the microbiome.

334
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:05,570
What is interesting is that even though our microbiome is more or less constant over time, you'll see he had it represented by this blue line.

335
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,190
You'll see that more or less fluke rates are on average,

336
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:19,610
but now they are so much tied that it feel that we can catch changes in hours from composition and certain materials.

337
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:30,300
Again, we have averaged over time, but around that average we can have some fluctuations that can be measured in days or even hours.

338
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:39,570
Yet another question. The blue line there, the sine wave there, was that just like for explanation?

339
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,620
Yeah, for an explanation. But it's not real. Always sine wave like that.

340
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:52,110
Yeah. They say exactly this if you have one explanation just to show you that because you see these the blue line you like are fluctuating around you

341
00:41:52,110 --> 00:42:00,020
can imagine that we have maybe a line here is so uniform may not look exactly not is it normal this explanation this is just hypothetical.

342
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:02,400
Yeah. Okay.

343
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:14,580
Also, we know that the microbiome, uh, there is some genetic component from the host, meaning from our own genome that is related to the microbiome.

344
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:19,710
And they are different studies that have found the heritability of different type of bacteria.

345
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:29,730
Remember, heritability is the proportion or the variation of a phenotypically trait that is just plain but genetic variation.

346
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,440
Then you'll see that they are some kind of different type of bacteria.

347
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:39,540
Think they can have high any heritability, meaning that they are affected by our own genes?

348
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:43,530
The bacteria that we have can be affected by our own genes.

349
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:51,780
Is that right? Like dogs can smell the difference between people who trust you?

350
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:57,420
I don't know. But it could be. It could be.

351
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,770
Professor James is his name, given the blue line here.

352
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:10,200
Now, this is yet to represent. How about reaching across an average.

353
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,250
I mean, the the other page diagram. Yeah.

354
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:25,390
Can you just. Okay. No, this is just to show you the the bacteria that we have in part are affected by our own genes.

355
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:30,459
The whole thing here. Yeah, these are different studies you see here.

356
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:34,530
The different colors. They are different studies. Revisited, established.

357
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:39,459
Yes. And also we have different type of bacteria. Then they are some bacteria.

358
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:44,290
For example, these are maternal bacteria that has a heritability of about 60%,

359
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:50,050
meaning that our own genes, our own genes can affect the type of bacteria that we have.

360
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:55,660
Well, yeah, I. Since we're talking about specific bacteria, Razia.

361
00:43:55,870 --> 00:44:01,360
Mm hmm. How come? For studies showing for this type of results.

362
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:05,070
Sorry, they are for studies. Yeah.

363
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:09,130
Oh, some has three studies. Yeah, I wait. They are different.

364
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:16,450
Yeah. And I think this is in general for any studying only microbiome differences detected.

365
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:20,109
They can give a different estimate because they are variation.

366
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:27,280
I imagine here we have original sample sizes, maybe collection type of collection in the sample.

367
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:34,390
But but I think this is something you see any study, not only microbiology,

368
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,710
see, for example, genetic or even epidemiology, they have different results.

369
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:46,000
The idea that the reason why people do a meta analysis to try to find an average of all the different studies,

370
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:55,510
but whether these are showing us regardless of this variation, eat our own genes can affect the type of bacteria that we have.

371
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,980
That's what we get from this chart. Yes. How so?

372
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:02,080
Because you see the heritability here.

373
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:11,230
Remember, heritability is a proportion with that phenotypic trait in this case, microbiome that is affected by our own genes.

374
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:16,240
How do we get to that conclusion? I don't get this study.

375
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,570
The parents and me. Yes.

376
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:25,659
Why? There are different ways to do it. And these are technically genetic epidemiology.

377
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:32,440
You need to do the whole genome sequencing when genotyping and how see how they relate to any grade in this case,

378
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:37,420
I imagine what frequency of these different type of bacterias do they actually study?

379
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,740
The people before me, they really mean that one way to do it.

380
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:50,440
But in most cases you don't need to do that. We get the heritability because you can get you can get from that genetic information.

381
00:45:51,130 --> 00:46:00,370
How much? Because you know the region for person and then you can associate that genetic variation to down to the variability of the bacteria.

382
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:08,080
For example, in general you see like that with an association, they seem to be genes and obesity and diabetes and that type of stuff.

383
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:14,320
You see what they doing here, the genes by this case, microbiome, diversity.

384
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,260
How do we get the heat to be able to heat up?

385
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:23,400
I can I can show you later, because that's a moral and statistical question.

386
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:30,060
I'll also what what is interesting is that many of the genes that are being associated

387
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:35,520
with microbiome also have been associated with different health outcomes in humans,

388
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:40,680
for example, with adiposity traits with schizophrenia.

389
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,770
These I'm a tropical atherosclerosis.

390
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:55,350
Diabetes also with inflammatory bowel disease is while we don't know yet whether these associations between genes,

391
00:46:55,620 --> 00:47:03,599
bacterias and the different health outcome because maybe the gene and affect in that type of bacteria are there

392
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:10,410
may be that change is going to affect the disease or maybe they are affecting overlapping metabolic pathways.

393
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:16,200
We are still we don't know the mechanisms. But what is interesting is that different genes, again,

394
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:23,790
that have been associated with microbiome diversity also have been associated with differing health outcomes.

395
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,380
I think we are in time. Okay.

396
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:36,800
I'm going to let me make your point, China.

397
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:41,460
I want to talk about the shrinking or the microbiome.

398
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,240
Then I guess I just want to finish with this part here.

399
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:49,080
Andy was on a study comparing dental calculus.

400
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:59,760
Yes. Because they weren't able to collect truth from as critical remains from their dental then.

401
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:07,440
And they do this by using formatted techniques again to study the microbiome from.

402
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,770
These are dental calculus in modern humans.

403
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:14,970
These have sampled from other humans and they have for this time different

404
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:19,919
for different samples for the narrative and the is by one add to that you see

405
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:27,420
here the they work in Belgium and the diet from this region was basically base

406
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:32,190
diet based on those skeletal remains all that type of remains in this case.

407
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:43,110
There were all their location in this case in Spain, again, from the Argentines and the diet was more plant based.

408
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:49,680
And here we have samples from chimpanzees. Then what we see is that the that humans,

409
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:59,069
they grew closer to the Neanderthals with meat based diet and that their dental that they had

410
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:06,510
more plant based diet they grew closer to the chimpanzee because the more similarity of diets.

411
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:07,110
Wow.

412
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:18,150
And these are some comparisons with a different type of bacteria comparing chimpanzee in again from dental calculus, now dental from other humans.

413
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:23,660
And you see that huge difference between whether humans on the island does on their dental floss,

414
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:31,780
in this case, more or less more similar to the chimpanzee. Again because of that.

415
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:42,730
If in D.C., mostly because of the value because now also these are also another study using sample from differing

416
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:49,209
again remains from the Mesolithic the analytic the bronze age medieval times and he and so he

417
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:54,760
had you'll see the different types sorry the different times for example the Mesolithic in between

418
00:49:54,910 --> 00:50:03,580
almost 7000 years ago up to 5000 years ago Neolithic you'll see that that range 7000 up to 4000,

419
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:13,389
Bronze Age 4000 up to 3000. Now medieval times that was a thousand years and to sample from other humans and you'll see

420
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:22,680
that there are some variations again for some of the difference that I see here in these two,

421
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,630
in this great arrow. These are more later mother samples.

422
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:33,850
These are these little bacterias tend to be more frequent in molecular bands compared to the humans in the past.

423
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,990
I don't know what are the implications with that now.

424
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:43,929
These other samples that you see here, Mulder, they are rather you see these are ambient mantle samples,

425
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:51,150
soil, sediment, fresh water, that one that you see here. But the two molar humans are these two entirely.

426
00:50:51,160 --> 00:51:01,870
And you'll see that that by reagents. Yes. And now we're going to talk about in the second part, how the U.S. microbiome has changed over time.

427
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:08,310
And this is yet to show you that, at least for the oral microbiota, using that we know from the previous study, still,

428
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:18,570
the more time there is a decrease in the diversity comparing the type of bacteria that we have in our oral cavity.

429
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:22,240
And these are huge examples of that.

430
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:31,260
More than a thousand subjects you'll see now that we have a high frequency or effect of novel mutant mutants in our oral cavities,

431
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:38,400
in our in our mouth, going back to sample and then athletic and early Bronze Age and medieval times.

432
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:46,520
Or do they like sugar? I mean, I think these are freedom,

433
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:51,290
the from free living subjects a direct religious participant and they measure

434
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:56,570
the frequency of effect of commuters under your feet or monastic devices.

435
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:00,710
Okay. Sorry, I was talking about the bacteria of the human.

436
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:11,930
Okay. But as to the studies that doesn't show yet these that both of them are related to to tooth decay.

437
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:23,690
Now, although they are related to the to dental calculus, however, you'll see that in modern humans, the threat of mutants is more frequent.

438
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:29,750
It was less frequent in past times. I don't get what you just said.

439
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,599
You? Yes. Even in where humans.

440
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:47,420
These two these two last bars here the effect of mutants that gray bark is more frequent in modern humans compared to samples from the past.

441
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:51,290
You'll see that Madison's lower level. Look up.

442
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,900
This guy's the Wild West.

443
00:52:54,770 --> 00:53:03,320
Yeah, I was just wondering if this bacteria can, like, something that we're eating in our diet now, and that's why it's more prevalent.

444
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,469
So, yes, go to a sugar. But you're right, Ginger.

445
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:09,500
But yeah, the is exactly the same.

446
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:17,080
It could be. This is definitely related to our diet.

447
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:23,850
That also could be related to the high consumption of Indian ultra processed food to show our high sugar diets.

448
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:34,650
But that what these graphical indices that had been received in the community of in the order of microbiota over time.

449
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:48,990
So that as is streptococcus effect of yes and a B here is feed or fetal, I think tidal hormones gingivalis.

450
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,350
Okay. Yeah.

451
00:53:54,420 --> 00:54:00,710
It's kind of like you like to metabolize large variety of the carbohydrates.

452
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:06,980
We want to caucus mutants. Okay? You want a variety of carbohydrates?

453
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,460
Streptococcus. Isn't that related to leg infection?

454
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:17,200
Those are two, in fact. Yes. Yes. Either way, the.

455
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:24,040
Yes, they are starting to cooperate, yet they are related also to pneumonia and pneumonia.

456
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:29,020
Mm hmm. Is that another specie around us Indians?

457
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,790
This one is the leaf in our mouth. Okay.

458
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:42,910
Yeah. Okay, then I'm going to stop here because the thing I want to talk more about is microbiome.

459
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:48,520
I thought that drinking then last 5 minutes.

460
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:55,270
Right. I'm going to pause here a little bit.

461
00:54:59,259 --> 00:55:04,349
Okay. Welcome, everyone. We are going then to go to the second part of that discussion.

462
00:55:04,379 --> 00:55:09,189
Will the microbiome evolution then kind of like, let's see, just.

463
00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:20,709
Okay. So as mentioned, I'm going to be discussing the evolution of the microbiome.

464
00:55:21,419 --> 00:55:26,619
I'm just putting this in a presenter real quick. Oh.

465
00:55:30,129 --> 00:55:33,809
How do I hide this? Anyone know how to do this?

466
00:55:35,049 --> 00:55:38,259
I'm. Okay.

467
00:55:38,439 --> 00:55:48,309
So I'm going to be describing the trend of the human gut microbiome diversity during recent evolution and compare with other primates,

468
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:57,039
specifically the chimpanzee. And I'm also going to describe the major differences in the gut microbiome diversity between current human populations.

469
00:55:57,579 --> 00:56:05,679
And I'm going to talk about the major dietary shifts and also what we know about archaic humans and Neanderthals,

470
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:11,559
which we already discussed a little bit, and discuss some of the health implications and a couple examples of diseases

471
00:56:12,459 --> 00:56:18,219
that relate to proof that we have that the microbiome diversity plays a role in.

472
00:56:20,049 --> 00:56:23,469
Okay. So Dr. Lewis touched on this already,

473
00:56:23,469 --> 00:56:28,689
but the microbiome is the defined as the biotic and abiotic habitat comprising

474
00:56:29,329 --> 00:56:33,219
a community of micro-organisms associated with a particular environment.

475
00:56:33,219 --> 00:56:42,128
HOST It's correlated with human diseases and it's also there is some proof that it is correlated with some treatment options,

476
00:56:42,129 --> 00:56:44,289
which I'll discuss some examples later on.

477
00:56:45,759 --> 00:56:52,929
It's greatly the microbiome is integrated with the digestive, immune and neuroendocrine systems of the host,

478
00:56:53,379 --> 00:57:02,409
and the gut bacteria process plays an important role because it's able to digest difficult components of foods that we eat.

479
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:06,729
It's able to promote angiogenesis, which is just new blood vessel growth.

480
00:57:07,479 --> 00:57:12,699
It's able to regulate metabolism, and it can influence our moods and behaviors.

481
00:57:12,699 --> 00:57:17,499
So it has an effect on neuro biological factors as well.

482
00:57:18,999 --> 00:57:27,129
So the major thing that I'm going to discuss is the loss of the microbiome diversity with evolution.

483
00:57:27,129 --> 00:57:33,669
So we talked about this already a little bit, but as humans have evolved, so have our guts.

484
00:57:34,359 --> 00:57:41,168
We also touched on this a little bit earlier in the semester with the idea that as the gut has shrunk, the brain has grown.

485
00:57:41,169 --> 00:57:45,369
So, you know, it plays a role role integrated as one system.

486
00:57:45,759 --> 00:57:52,449
And, you know, as our guts have evolved, we've seen this substantial loss of bacterial diversity.

487
00:57:53,049 --> 00:57:58,628
And, you know, it really depends on whether someone is living in an industrialized,

488
00:57:58,629 --> 00:58:05,919
modern Western society or if they're living in an agricultural society or if they're living in a more traditional hunter gatherer society.

489
00:58:06,279 --> 00:58:12,519
But the lack of diversity has been shown by Metagenomic data, which we defined earlier,

490
00:58:12,879 --> 00:58:18,219
to increase the risk of infections, autoimmune disorders and metabolic syndrome.

491
00:58:18,219 --> 00:58:21,788
So I'm not going to define metagenomic data. Dr. IS explain that.

492
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:28,689
Well already. So we are able to analyze the microbiome like as a collective instead of just a single line of DNA.

493
00:58:28,809 --> 00:58:36,999
So what I understand from that, so in the context of evolution, we don't know that much about the microbiome.

494
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:41,949
It is an emerging field. It only emerged, you know, in the past 20 or so years.

495
00:58:42,339 --> 00:58:51,879
And we have to use this new technologies and this new data to ask how different

496
00:58:51,879 --> 00:58:57,549
microbiome choose to assemble into communities of varying levels of diversity,

497
00:58:57,549 --> 00:59:00,789
complexity and like, how does the environment play a role in that?

498
00:59:02,019 --> 00:59:09,459
But these sequencing techniques and technological advancements have made asking these questions possible, which is really great.

499
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:19,539
I'm going to talk a little bit about the large intestine, which is one of the major factors in the shrinkage of the diversity of the microbiome.

500
00:59:19,749 --> 00:59:31,659
And, you know, the average human holds ten to the power, 11 microbial cells per animal in the large intestine specifically, which is which is a lot.

501
00:59:33,909 --> 00:59:37,388
So you are looking at a single person gut microbiome.

502
00:59:37,389 --> 00:59:42,639
There is an estimated 150 to 400 different species, again, varying person to person.

503
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:46,059
Although you do inherit it, it does vary as you move.

504
00:59:47,859 --> 00:59:57,999
The most common phyla are the bacteria IDs for McCarty's, actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, along with some of the other ones that we saw before.

505
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:04,359
So again, these vary greatly between individuals, even if they are related, related,

506
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:09,699
and it changes across your life span as you move different places in your diet shifts.

507
01:00:12,129 --> 01:00:20,159
So our relationship with the gut bacteria, this is reflective of a long history of, you know,

508
01:00:20,229 --> 01:00:27,699
coevolution with, you know, some symbiotic relationships that we've had with some other species.

509
01:00:29,169 --> 01:00:34,509
So the biggest one is our coevolution with the primate and how we.

510
01:00:37,069 --> 01:00:46,909
The bacteria in the gut is derived from ancestral symbionts within the human lineage since before the divergence of the humans and the gorillas.

511
01:00:47,329 --> 01:00:53,459
These gut bacteria have been conserved by selection and we were if we were.

512
01:00:53,479 --> 01:00:59,839
The viewpoint is that if we were to have lost any of these microbiota, it would have been it would negatively impact our health.

513
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:05,389
There is evidence that the humans have experienced a large scale loss of gut,

514
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:11,149
the gut microbiome in different species since we diverged from the chimpanzee.

515
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:22,309
So that's like what we trace the similarity back to the chimpanzee, although all primates kind of share similar chain.

516
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:26,699
We're going to say, no, no, no, no, there wasn't. What's going to make that?

517
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:38,899
That's a good point. Because these comparisons because we don't know how the microbiome from the didn't files I don't know maybe are so many.

518
01:01:40,999 --> 01:01:48,919
I have to look. But maybe some remains of feces samples from that.

519
01:01:48,989 --> 01:01:51,999
Yeah. Yeah. So. Yeah.

520
01:01:52,459 --> 01:02:02,389
So again, the greatest similarity we can trace to is from our, you know, evolution from the chimpanzee.

521
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:09,829
So the ancient losses of bacterial microbiome coincide with the divergence from these chimpanzees.

522
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:16,789
This was about 6 million years ago. So where we diverged from the hand species to the homo.

523
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:30,889
So one of the biggest changes that contributes to the shift in the microbiome is the shift from plant based diet to animal based diet.

524
01:02:31,279 --> 01:02:35,928
And we have proof of this from archeological remains.

525
01:02:35,929 --> 01:02:42,049
And you can see it with other evolution of other body parts, as we have discussed throughout the semester.

526
01:02:42,529 --> 01:02:50,929
And of course, as we shift to a more animal based diet, we're going to see an increase in protein.

527
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:55,009
So this is going to change the composition of our gut microbiome.

528
01:02:55,909 --> 01:03:03,709
Also, along with this shift, this decrease in plant foods, we're going to see a decreased reliance on fiber.

529
01:03:04,099 --> 01:03:05,839
So that's going to shift the species as well.

530
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:13,619
And this is hypothesized to also have led to the shrinkage of the large intestine and a greater size of the small intestine.

531
01:03:13,709 --> 01:03:20,959
And so the size of the large intestine is a quarter when we compare it to the great apes.

532
01:03:21,169 --> 01:03:26,629
So small intestine of humans constitute 60% of total intestinal volume.

533
01:03:26,629 --> 01:03:31,849
So that's where we break down and absorb nutrients, right?

534
01:03:31,879 --> 01:03:43,309
So that's really significant difference between, you know, how we diverged and that's going to greatly affect our gut microbiome.

535
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:49,309
So this is clearly shown through the differences between, you know, carnivores.

536
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:55,129
Carnivores and herbivores are greatly differentiated in this way.

537
01:03:55,259 --> 01:03:58,159
So we obviously have a combination of both.

538
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:07,339
But it just goes to show this is one of the major differences between the chimpanzees versus the humans and other mammals.

539
01:04:09,139 --> 01:04:13,789
So it's become a dog. We have become adapted to a meat based diet since this divergence.

540
01:04:15,829 --> 01:04:22,969
So there's also been a reduction in richness which coincides with the reduction in the large intestine,

541
01:04:23,179 --> 01:04:27,499
which of course has led to a lack of diversity in different species.

542
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:37,939
So there's been comparisons of African apes versus human fecal samples, which showed that humans harbored fewer phyla,

543
01:04:37,939 --> 01:04:47,629
class's order, family, genus species when compared to chimpanzees, bonobos, which is another class of primates and gorillas.

544
01:04:49,639 --> 01:04:56,439
So the decrease in bacteria, we've seen a decrease in the bacteria that digest complex polysaccharides,

545
01:04:56,989 --> 01:05:02,869
and we've seen an increase in the bacteriophages, which is, you know, an increase with meat consumption.

546
01:05:05,609 --> 01:05:10,709
Which is also going to, you know, favor amino acid. Competition.

547
01:05:11,609 --> 01:05:22,949
Although it can be seen to varying degrees, this trend in the reduction of richness persists regardless of the population.

548
01:05:22,949 --> 01:05:29,909
So it's been looked at in American Indians, Malawians and even urban Americans.

549
01:05:30,179 --> 01:05:35,049
There's just this general reduction since the divergence from the chimpanzee.

550
01:05:35,959 --> 01:05:43,079
So yeah, yeah. So it's just, you know, many factors, but the diet is just one of them.

551
01:05:45,559 --> 01:05:51,589
Okay. So why could this be another reason? Could be, you know, the modern lifestyle which plays into diet.

552
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:58,189
So the carnivore transition has been hypothesized to have led to a larger brain and improved cognitive function.

553
01:05:58,189 --> 01:06:02,269
So we're allocating more of our resources to our brain rather than to the gut.

554
01:06:03,409 --> 01:06:11,119
Some of the most obvious differences between humans and other apes have arisen, and this could be the result of human culture.

555
01:06:12,949 --> 01:06:20,689
It could be the result of the transition from hunter gatherers that occurred approximately 12,000 years ago who have any ideas as to,

556
01:06:20,989 --> 01:06:25,699
you know, where that transition happened or, you know, in comments.

557
01:06:26,329 --> 01:06:30,119
What do you guys think? Anything. Sad moments?

558
01:06:30,829 --> 01:06:36,709
No, I think you you. So, yeah, approximately 12,000 years ago,

559
01:06:36,709 --> 01:06:47,569
this is where we saw a really significant change in culture and the major shift from hunter gatherers to settled agricultural societies.

560
01:06:47,989 --> 01:06:51,109
And this is at the dawn of the Holocene.

561
01:06:51,139 --> 01:07:02,209
Holly King And this Neolithic revolution came with a cultural evolution, and even more so in a very, very short time span.

562
01:07:02,209 --> 01:07:08,779
Over the past 300 years, we've seen an accelerated version of this evolution.

563
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:12,229
So we went from hunter gatherers to agricultural settlements.

564
01:07:12,619 --> 01:07:23,479
But over the past 300 years, you know, there's been very rapid acceleration due to industrialization, commercialization, urbanization, etc.

565
01:07:23,869 --> 01:07:29,129
And this variation in lifestyle practices has given rise to the opportunity.

566
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:41,929
You see how great these changes were on our gut bacteria and how this has theoretically affected our microbiome composition.

567
01:07:43,579 --> 01:07:49,219
So with these varying lifestyle practices, we're going to see varying gut microbiota.

568
01:07:51,049 --> 01:07:57,729
The shift, though, in the relative abundance, does not equate to shifts in relative richness.

569
01:07:57,739 --> 01:08:04,279
So an example of this was seen in two different societies in the Central African Republic.

570
01:08:06,229 --> 01:08:11,349
The. The first one. I'm not going to try to pronounce it the baka believe.

571
01:08:11,649 --> 01:08:13,809
So this is the hunter gatherer society.

572
01:08:14,139 --> 01:08:23,049
And they found that they have high levels of bacteria that are capable of amino acid and vitamin METAB metabolism compared to,

573
01:08:23,559 --> 01:08:25,869
you know, adjacent society called the Banta.

574
01:08:26,109 --> 01:08:33,438
Also in the Central African Republic where there's a settled agricultural society and they're more plant based,

575
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:45,109
they're more capable of carbohydrate metabolism due to, you know, potentially the differences in the microbiome composition of these two.

576
01:08:45,129 --> 01:08:48,579
So that that kind of shows it. And this can be seen in other countries.

577
01:08:48,769 --> 01:08:52,689
It was discussed in some of the papers, but that's just an example.

578
01:08:52,689 --> 01:08:58,179
So it's like even if you're in the same country and then the lifestyle really plays a huge role.

579
01:08:59,949 --> 01:09:07,329
Do you remember down in one of our classes we talk about what for these genes that is our own gene amylase.

580
01:09:07,869 --> 01:09:16,449
We get that in populations that consume amount, they have more copies of these genes.

581
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:20,049
And then I imagine we also look into the bank to that.

582
01:09:20,049 --> 01:09:27,449
Well, maybe it wasn't too bad. Was it interesting how we see they what we've shown both in the bacteria in our own genome and you might you

583
01:09:27,459 --> 01:09:34,289
want to go back to the people who have also high numbers of these copies for this gene mutation positive,

584
01:09:34,389 --> 01:09:37,119
where you see more copies mean more variation.

585
01:09:37,329 --> 01:09:43,899
Not only is copy of the same one exactly because remember it usually we have for each you we have two copies.

586
01:09:44,379 --> 01:09:49,059
We will we will have one in our way. But there were more for one, you know, what about their chromosome?

587
01:09:49,419 --> 01:09:59,889
However, there are cases that we can have the same gene that is a one chromosome and can have several copies side by side for the same gene.

588
01:10:00,489 --> 01:10:08,229
Then what? That produces more that the respective royalty. You go one where we have more amount of protein then that it will be released.

589
01:10:08,919 --> 01:10:17,979
Yeah. And like it's interesting you say amylase because that makes me think of like salivary amylase which is secreted to break down carbs,

590
01:10:18,459 --> 01:10:21,068
even just like in our mouths after we take it in.

591
01:10:21,069 --> 01:10:30,219
So yeah, it goes to show and this was seen across, you know, countries in Asia, Africa, South America, Central America.

592
01:10:30,219 --> 01:10:35,049
But yeah, they, they looked at societies, you know, in Cameroon, the differences,

593
01:10:35,289 --> 01:10:42,579
even though they were adjacent and they have these agricultural settlers and then they have these hunter gatherer societies,

594
01:10:43,099 --> 01:10:51,909
the same countries, not different countries, they compared apples to apples, you know, so.

595
01:10:54,149 --> 01:11:08,099
Other things that come to mind. Modern contributors to the reductions in bacterial species is that food processing, which is, you know, again,

596
01:11:08,099 --> 01:11:15,149
going to decrease our dietary fiber intake and it's going to increase the amount of refined sugar that we eat.

597
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:19,759
And this can lead to the expiration of gut bacteria taxes.

598
01:11:19,769 --> 01:11:28,469
So it's like if you don't use it, you're going to lose the mentality of these taxa and the microbiota.

599
01:11:28,469 --> 01:11:39,869
Accessible carbohydrates are found in dietary fiber, can shape our microbial ecosystem and affect our metabolism and how we process different foods.

600
01:11:40,289 --> 01:11:50,949
And this is reduced, of course, in the Western diet, which is high in fat, in simple carbohydrates, low in fiber compared to a more traditional diet.

601
01:11:50,969 --> 01:12:02,429
So again, just that decrease in fiber and the increase in, you know, saturated fats, proteins,

602
01:12:03,239 --> 01:12:11,669
animal meat is going to affect these gut bacteria and, you know, the overall composition.

603
01:12:13,109 --> 01:12:25,079
So, again. People in the United States have the lowest amount of gut bacterial species richness.

604
01:12:25,799 --> 01:12:29,059
Whereas other countries have higher amounts.

605
01:12:29,089 --> 01:12:33,059
So you can see through the. Image.

606
01:12:34,569 --> 01:12:38,259
Yeah. Can I see? Yeah, I guess. Yeah, that's interesting.

607
01:12:38,259 --> 01:12:45,159
But the more Westernized, I mean, the Endocrine Society, they have lower diversity.

608
01:12:45,429 --> 01:12:50,289
Yeah, but you see that even the mortality rates, they go down to society's humans.

609
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:54,699
They still have lower than other primates in general. Yeah, yeah.

610
01:12:54,969 --> 01:13:07,418
We have the lowest of any primate, which obviously humans are the ones doing the research and coming up with all this book groups doing research.

611
01:13:07,419 --> 01:13:19,359
But yeah, we our divergence and the rapid shift like we don't know what we had, what the composition was, you know, even 12,000 years ago.

612
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:25,359
But it's definitely gone down. And the species richness and the number of different taxa.

613
01:13:28,169 --> 01:13:35,909
So again, this goes to show how humans and non-human primates have revealed parts of the gut microbiota from the ancient hominids.

614
01:13:37,259 --> 01:13:40,339
We do share those similarities, but we do. We did.

615
01:13:40,359 --> 01:13:47,398
We did see a significant decrease. And it shows specific gut extinction events that have occurred within the human population,

616
01:13:47,399 --> 01:13:50,759
depending on the lifestyle and dietary factors specifically.

617
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:56,099
You know, in the past 300 years we saw this rapid acceleration of industrialization.

618
01:13:57,719 --> 01:14:01,078
So some examples of some, you know, health implications.

619
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:04,609
These are just some ones that I found.

620
01:14:04,619 --> 01:14:12,029
But the humans living in these industrialized societies have the fewest, least diverse gut bacterial species, as mentioned.

621
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:24,088
And so since missing gut bacteria, taxa has been observed across primates,

622
01:14:24,089 --> 01:14:34,139
just some of the consequences that we can think of specific to humans is the increase in obesity, the effects on infection rates.

623
01:14:34,499 --> 01:14:37,299
And we've also seen some respiratory problems.

624
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:44,639
So obviously, everyone knows that we are facing a global metabolic health crisis, specifically in the United States,

625
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:54,059
much of which is provoked by the obesity epidemic, because obesity affects so many different diseases in different health states.

626
01:14:54,599 --> 01:14:57,269
And it is worldwide, however.

627
01:14:58,709 --> 01:15:08,759
But the study that I found which compared the gut microbial composition in a population of non obese and obese Danish individuals.

628
01:15:09,299 --> 01:15:19,769
So 23% of the individuals were characterized by more marked overall adiposity, more fat, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia,

629
01:15:20,069 --> 01:15:25,558
and a more pronounced inflammatory phenotype when compared with high bacterial richness individuals.

630
01:15:25,559 --> 01:15:32,729
So those among the lower back to your written richness gained more adipose tissue over time.

631
01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:38,039
And it shows us this association, obese individuals,

632
01:15:38,039 --> 01:15:45,329
tend to have lower levels of gut bacterial diversity than between individuals and also those who started out lower.

633
01:15:45,869 --> 01:15:48,269
They gained weight over time if they had less diversity.

634
01:15:50,189 --> 01:15:59,158
So it goes to show that obesity is something that certain like a lot of people want to place blame on the individual.

635
01:15:59,159 --> 01:16:01,138
Or as we were discussing in our earlier class,

636
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:08,849
like there's this misconception that it's all within the attribution theory, it's all within the individual's control.

637
01:16:08,849 --> 01:16:13,709
But some things like your gut microbiota, you can't just shift easily with lifestyle, right?

638
01:16:14,129 --> 01:16:25,168
So yeah, but it does show a couple of studies have shown that deviations from a certain level of different species

639
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:31,289
at the microbial level are associated with different physiological states such as obese and lean.

640
01:16:33,419 --> 01:16:43,259
And another interesting thing that I read was since obesity is correlated with different neuro biological complications,

641
01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:51,629
are we able to manipulate our gut microbiota to improve, you know,

642
01:16:51,629 --> 01:17:02,309
potential weight loss for obese individuals, potential fat loss, and just some interesting future research that can be done to,

643
01:17:02,699 --> 01:17:07,919
you know, improve the moods and mental mental health of obese individuals.

644
01:17:08,459 --> 01:17:12,158
So that's something that some people are looking into. And I look forward to reading.

645
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:20,879
And this is interesting because one field of research is in diet interactions.

646
01:17:21,509 --> 01:17:28,579
One example, what particular diabetes or dreaming can have differing effects based on that individual genome?

647
01:17:29,309 --> 01:17:36,119
But also we need to consider the microbiome, maybe another important interaction with the microbiome.

648
01:17:36,509 --> 01:17:44,599
Mm hmm. Right. And yet, when we talk about gene environment interactions, this is a gene, and this can potentially be manipulated.

649
01:17:44,609 --> 01:17:49,588
We don't know how to yet for specifically obesity and neuro biologic complications.

650
01:17:49,589 --> 01:17:54,239
But I think it's interesting that people are asking those questions in research.

651
01:17:55,719 --> 01:18:01,529
Maybe that can help with the obesity epidemic and, you know, mental health issues in the future.

652
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:06,329
But on a positive note, with regards to infection.

653
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:13,199
Certain microbiota compositions are associated with irritable bowel syndrome.

654
01:18:14,549 --> 01:18:17,699
So it's good that we're able to identify certain species.

655
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:27,259
Another common infection is C difficile, which occurs a lot in hospital set.

656
01:18:27,309 --> 01:18:31,509
Things with elderly, and it's a major cause of morbidity and mortality.

657
01:18:33,369 --> 01:18:39,039
Again, many adults and pediatric geriatric patients are affected globally.

658
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:42,939
So it's like you go in to the hospital, you have with something else and then you get C difficile.

659
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:54,759
That can be a major complication. And it's been shown that a lack of gut microbial diversity is a contributory factor to C difficile,

660
01:18:55,029 --> 01:19:04,779
especially recurring C difficile infections and studies have looked at the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation,

661
01:19:04,779 --> 01:19:12,909
which is a way to remodel the intestinal flora through stool transplants from a healthy individual with the more diverse gut.

662
01:19:14,889 --> 01:19:18,009
I think believe they gave some people like ice cubes.

663
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:22,959
Fecal matter to swallow. You swallow? Yeah.

664
01:19:22,959 --> 01:19:26,439
No, no, they do it down there. They do it down there.

665
01:19:26,509 --> 01:19:30,749
Yeah. Well, one of the things I recommend but I could yeah.

666
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:37,988
I think swallow not the people who I, I think I misread it, but it's a transplantation.

667
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:41,959
So yes, you're right. You're right. You're right.

668
01:19:43,329 --> 01:19:47,499
Okay. So okay, got it.

669
01:19:49,149 --> 01:19:55,419
But yeah, it's been shown to this has been shown to cure about 90% of antibiotic resistant cases of C difficile.

670
01:19:58,329 --> 01:20:01,769
Another example is through allergic asthma.

671
01:20:01,779 --> 01:20:07,328
So practices that reduce post nasal gut bacterial diversity have been shown to

672
01:20:07,329 --> 01:20:12,099
contribute to the development and severity of allergic asthma later in life.

673
01:20:12,609 --> 01:20:17,078
So asthma rates have increased steadily in developed countries.

674
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:21,999
And we want to know, is there an environmental etiology for this?

675
01:20:22,419 --> 01:20:30,369
And they looked at, you know, the effects of antibiotics because this increase correlates with the invention of the antibiotics in modern medicine.

676
01:20:30,369 --> 01:20:37,329
So they looked at streptomycin and vancomycin on mice and the development of asthma.

677
01:20:37,689 --> 01:20:41,138
So streptomycin wasn't shown to have a huge increase.

678
01:20:41,139 --> 01:20:53,049
But vancomycin reduced microbial diversity significantly in shifted the composition of the bacterial population and enhanced disease severity,

679
01:20:53,439 --> 01:21:01,029
especially later in life. So this brings about the discussion of, okay, great antibiotics are a good thing,

680
01:21:01,029 --> 01:21:06,818
but are our immune systems able to keep up with this great change that has occurred,

681
01:21:06,819 --> 01:21:13,629
especially in the past couple of hundred years from our ancestral gut microbe species?

682
01:21:15,519 --> 01:21:20,919
Can we keep up? So like we're we're killing it. We're killing the good and bad.

683
01:21:20,979 --> 01:21:25,899
The good and bad. Exactly. So yeah, yes.

684
01:21:26,049 --> 01:21:34,539
The term gives and what we have do as Chinese medicine, you know, that not just check those but put them together.

685
01:21:34,809 --> 01:21:41,499
So when you take antibiotics, you don't really kill the bad microbes.

686
01:21:42,069 --> 01:21:48,039
They just go hiding and dormant. They go out of the life to the dark.

687
01:21:48,699 --> 01:21:54,039
And then when the next occasion hits, it comes out again.

688
01:21:54,039 --> 01:22:05,759
That's the recurring part. So preferably that we are trying to increase our medicine is to increase the good microbes and naturally but for example,

689
01:22:05,769 --> 01:22:11,709
streptococcus, if you use AI day, it kills that within 16 seconds of contact.

690
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:18,729
But they do not practice that yet. But we do that and it is good for the defensive.

691
01:22:19,149 --> 01:22:22,179
You will see this is a is needed for early cells.

692
01:22:22,179 --> 01:22:33,279
Well those that well. Oh yeah but I know they use this but just do the pure and then you can take it.

693
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:38,499
You don't have to do that. We're really going to have the ideas that contain the mercury.

694
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:43,779
Utilize the mercury, you'll have the poison, you do the A9.

695
01:22:44,439 --> 01:22:52,359
Yeah. So it's like it makes you more susceptible to other illnesses and I've experienced that firsthand.

696
01:22:52,359 --> 01:22:59,588
So it's not fun. But you know, taking a lot of antibiotics potentially kills all the good bacteria and the immune

697
01:22:59,589 --> 01:23:05,949
systems can't keep up just because of this huge shift that's occurred from our ancestors.

698
01:23:07,779 --> 01:23:10,049
Yeah. So again, this is just showing the difference of.

699
01:23:12,809 --> 01:23:20,099
How it significantly affected those that took vancomycin versus stern, and there was a significant difference.

700
01:23:21,479 --> 01:23:31,219
So in summary, humans have lost much of our ancestral gut microbiota since our divergence from the chimpanzee especially.

701
01:23:31,829 --> 01:23:40,799
And the shrinkage began with this transition to a meat based diet from a plant based one which also saw the decrease in fiber intake.

702
01:23:41,459 --> 01:23:50,638
Hunter gatherers, agriculture sector and the transition from hunter gatherers to agricultural settlers to modern humans.

703
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:57,419
We all confer different microbiota, but we do have a certain level of richness.

704
01:23:58,649 --> 01:24:03,419
But industrialized societies do not have microbial richness.

705
01:24:03,599 --> 01:24:13,019
There's a significant decrease. So there's been a lot of health implications, and it's still a developing field of research.

706
01:24:13,289 --> 01:24:22,079
But, you know, you see the lower levels of microbial diversity in obese people versus non-obese individuals.

707
01:24:22,949 --> 01:24:27,179
Transplantation methods to treat C difficile is a positive no.

708
01:24:27,899 --> 01:24:35,729
We're identifying certain species that we've seen a decrease in for people with IBS.

709
01:24:37,949 --> 01:24:46,109
It's, you know, using the microbiome to potentially treat as a transplant method is a good thing.

710
01:24:46,769 --> 01:24:54,809
But at the end of the day, we don't really have that many answers regarding what we can do with the microbiome just yet.

711
01:24:55,619 --> 01:25:02,399
But we do know that it has taken a large hit since our divergence in evolution.

712
01:25:02,549 --> 01:25:08,578
And it's it's we've seen the shrinkage of the large intestine in favor of the small intestine.

713
01:25:08,579 --> 01:25:10,169
And, you know,

714
01:25:10,349 --> 01:25:19,619
the diversity of the microbiome can influence disease in industrialized societies because that's where we see the biggest decrease in richness.

715
01:25:20,369 --> 01:25:24,299
But we don't have all the answers. Both the good and the bad.

716
01:25:24,309 --> 01:25:27,569
So there's more that's going to occur, hopefully.

717
01:25:27,809 --> 01:25:36,629
Mm. I need you to know that people transplant is a thing and I think that would the non differential in terms of effectiveness to

718
01:25:36,629 --> 01:25:46,799
colonoscopy and it was actually found to be less unpleasant for the participants taking the orally and that's what I thought I had read.

719
01:25:47,629 --> 01:25:55,889
So so it is a thing so you're not right. And then that and then it's like take four pills a day.

720
01:25:56,099 --> 01:26:02,998
Yeah. Doses probably just have to. Yeah. But I do think you're right for in regards to the C difficile infection.

721
01:26:02,999 --> 01:26:09,419
Yeah, but thank you. Thank you. Any any questions or comments within moments?

722
01:26:10,199 --> 01:26:21,979
No. Cool. Yeah. Not just to wrap up to this lecture and then just keep in mind, now that we have been talking about network selection,

723
01:26:21,989 --> 01:26:28,719
how I think that we're all going to want to see that genomes microbiomes that also are that you've written so not

724
01:26:28,749 --> 01:26:37,739
reservation and now also think about how these lack of diversity can affect our health directly to the microbiome.

725
01:26:37,949 --> 01:26:38,209
You know,

726
01:26:38,219 --> 01:26:50,369
people that would have no need or easy to ask my boss what if we didn't concerned that some areas of concern related to changes in the microbiome.

727
01:26:50,909 --> 01:27:03,029
Um, uh, you professor based on my study that we eat according to microbiome that we start

728
01:27:03,029 --> 01:27:10,749
to develop because the oh so enormous and with us people of all people's creeds.

729
01:27:11,409 --> 01:27:19,409
And then then we start to change how we feed different foods because the gut is calling you to a funky mess.

730
01:27:21,559 --> 01:27:24,989
Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

731
01:27:24,989 --> 01:27:28,019
So, guys. Okay, so we leave.

732
01:27:29,519 --> 01:27:37,199
I will vote today. I want you to last homework assignment for no homework next week.

733
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:55,199
We have that lecture about that paleo diet. And then I'm going to quote from one political agenda that you put me to work off and work with.

734
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:59,759
Jeff. Okay. Okay. Okay.

735
01:27:59,939 --> 01:28:03,449
I was both from later today. I will see you next Monday.

736
01:28:05,539 --> 01:28:07,869
And, you know. Oh, I.
