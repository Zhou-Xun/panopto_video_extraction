1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,810
Nolaundron Harris: question.

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:03,360
Clifton Addison: This meeting is being recorded.

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,220
amondul: Right go ahead.

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:14,610
Nolaundron Harris: The first three I just I don't give back to that overthinking was it really simple or was it more than I thought.

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:26,220
amondul: No problem how about this, how about we do the lecture, because that will go through the concepts that were included on the quiz and then we can go over the quiz questions after that.

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,860
amondul: Thank you, no problem.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,620
amondul: Any other questions before we get started.

8
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,400
brenda.w.campbell: yeah I had one about the first Queens um I know it was me.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:53,400
brenda.w.campbell: I answer correctly well I didn't it scored me wrong it's probably cuz I checked all of them, when it was all the above.

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,000
amondul: Oh yeah that's probably true, we can we can fix that.

11
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,010
amondul: Which just shoot an email to the team.

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,200
amondul: Thanks and they can help you with that.

13
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:10,980
amondul: Great.

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,830
amondul: Anything else.

15
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:18,840
amondul: alright.

16
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,890
amondul: We will get started.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,880
amondul: Alright, so today we are talking about screening validity and reliability, so I think the first thing we want to talk about is what is screening.

18
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:57,840
amondul: So it is the use of testing to sort out apparently well people who have probably can probably have seized from those who probably do not okay so we're saying apparently well because the whole point of screening is to try to.

19
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,460
amondul: find people who might have the disease before they have symptoms right.

20
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:16,410
amondul: Probably have disease from those who probably do not because screening tests are number of diagnostic test right if you test positive about a screening test there's always some kind of follow up right in cancer, it would be.

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,530
amondul: A biopsy, for example, something like that usually it's some sort of gold standard test, but is more invasive.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:38,310
amondul: That you wouldn't want to be conducting on a whole population of healthy people right so Here are some examples fasting blood sugar testing for diabetes bone density cemetery for us to process of acoustic emissions testing for hearing loss and newborns.

23
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:48,150
amondul: So I think in order to talk more about screening, we need to start with sort of a.

24
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,050
amondul: I don't know a setup for the natural history of disease right, so if this is time going through the right.

25
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:04,500
amondul: You, the green is the normal phase when there's no disease there's some moment when there's biologic onset of disease.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,400
amondul: And then from that moment until when symptoms first appear is called the preclinical phase.

27
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:26,880
amondul: After symptoms appear, you have your clinical phase during which you are diagnosed or given therapy and potentially going to therapy and there's something to cloud COM right you recover you die whatever.

28
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,620
amondul: So.

29
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:40,710
amondul: In this Green phase and the normal phase, you can prevent disease by removing the causes of disease potentially immunizing against the disease, so that you never get into the first place right.

30
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:54,990
amondul: Here in this preclinical phase is when we've been screen right you're trying to screen for detect and treat the disease early with the idea that if you treat it early someone's going to have a better clinical outcome, and if they were treated later.

31
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,260
amondul: i'm in here in the clinical phase you're going to treat the clinical disease to prevent that the complications okay.

32
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:16,680
amondul: So we have different types of prevention in epidemiology removing the causes of disease and utilizing in some way, preventing the disease from ever occurring in the first place is called primary prevention, screening.

33
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,330
amondul: A.

34
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:28,230
amondul: Screening is called secondary prevention and that's what we're going to be discussing today and then tertiary prevention is this kind of in.

35
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:37,020
amondul: Treating clinical disease to prevent death or complications or intervening once the person has the disease to to have a better outcome is tertiary prevention okay.

36
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,840
amondul: So one thing that's very important to know about screening, as it increases lead time okay.

37
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:54,210
amondul: So this is the interval by which the time of diagnosis is advanced by screening and early detection compared to the usual time of diagnosis right so.

38
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:09,870
amondul: Under normal circumstances, we would be going through the natural history of heart disease, and this person would be diagnose here, in the absence of screening, but if screening is successful, they would be detected and diagnosed earlier, so this is that lead time okay.

39
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,650
amondul: This is important, for example.

40
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,640
amondul: We think about this lead time a lot in cancer screening.

41
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,060
amondul: Because if you're going to.

42
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:30,750
amondul: If I if I screen people and I tell you the people who were screened lived longer after their diagnosis, then the people who weren't screened.

43
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:45,690
amondul: That sounds really great doesn't it they live longer that's excellent But what if they only live longer, because you added this lead time on the beginning, so this from here until outcome is longer than from here until outcome right.

44
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:57,720
amondul: You don't know if they live longer, because they were diagnosed earlier because they live longer, at the end right so that's actually not a really good way of measuring the effectiveness of screening.

45
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,680
amondul: Because of this issue so it's important to keep that in mind.

46
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:13,410
amondul: critical point is also important, so this is the point in the natural history of disease before which treatment is effective and or less difficult to administer so you're kind of assuming.

47
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,030
amondul: That.

48
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:18,780
amondul: And then.

49
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:28,290
amondul: Pending I can get it out sorry tennis griffey and the little thing it's just that is also Okay, I get it well alright so.

50
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,480
amondul: let's say.

51
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,320
amondul: let's say the critical point is.

52
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,930
amondul: Here that's the critical point.

53
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:47,820
amondul: If you can detect if the disease is detectable by screening here that's great right you're detecting it before the critical point.

54
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,920
amondul: which occurs before symptoms happen is exactly what we want.

55
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,160
amondul: What is the critical point.

56
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,700
amondul: we're like here.

57
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,950
amondul: Just screening help.

58
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,470
amondul: Do you need a screening test.

59
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:17,670
Clifton Addison: Well it's just still helped at least let you have to the problems to begin possible treatment.

60
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:33,120
amondul: yeah but, if you would usually be diagnosed here then you're getting died you're already diagnosing people before the critical point so you're already diagnosing people in time to treat them when treatment is effective so screening might not actually do anything.

61
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:42,810
amondul: Is kind of the point here right you don't need to spend a bunch of money, developing a screening test if you're already diagnosing people are plenty of time to have effective treatment.

62
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,120
amondul: Okay, that makes sense.

63
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:53,250
amondul: yeah same idea here, what if the critical point is here before your screening test would detect anybody.

64
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,650
Joshua Tucker: would be an effective.

65
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:05,640
amondul: yeah screenings ineffective right because you're past the critical point by the time you could find it so that's not a good screening tests and you might as well not bother right.

66
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,910
amondul: So that's just an idea that's the kind of the concept of the critical point.

67
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:22,830
amondul: So when we're thinking about screening programs, we have a lot of criteria that we need to think about you, you want to have screening test for things that are important or serious.

68
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,050
amondul: You want to screen.

69
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:31,080
amondul: You want your screening tests ultra the natural history of disease right, so you want that.

70
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:39,990
amondul: That was kind of what we were talking about with that critical point right you want your your kind of assuming that your screening test is going to catch things early and therefore have a good outcome right.

71
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,350
amondul: It needs to be technically feasible.

72
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,180
amondul: You have to consider the costs and benefits so.

73
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,320
amondul: we're assuming it's going to be beneficial in the sense that it's going to.

74
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:02,370
amondul: diagnose people earlier to give us the opportunity to scream to provide effective treatments that we wouldn't be able to provide if we couldn't detect them earlier right.

75
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:12,090
amondul: and costs of course we're thinking of monetary costs, in part, but what are some other costs that might happen or might be part of this.

76
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,470
amondul: calculus when you're thinking about implementing a screening test.

77
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,700
Sarah Ferri: dress on the patient who is being diagnosed with the screening test.

78
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,520
amondul: Stress that's right.

79
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:39,060
amondul: Not just people who are diagnosed, but like how many people have had a relative or themselves been called back after a mammogram.

80
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:50,850
amondul: And you have to wait like a month to get your your follow up mammogram testing and then that month you're like freaking out because you had an abnormal mammogram and you're worried, you might have breast cancer, but it turns out it's just calcifications.

81
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:58,380
amondul: This actually happens really quite often the in this we're going to talk about sensitivity and specificity later, but.

82
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:07,920
amondul: You want to catch everything that could be a case with your screening tests and then weed out the ones that aren't really you don't want to miss people right, especially if it's a serious disease.

83
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:19,470
amondul: So you're going to kind of say up there's something weird we're going to double we're going to test you again and make sure right, so you get a lot of false positives on screening tests and that can cause a lot of anxiety right.

84
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:26,910
amondul: A lot of women get called mammogram is a good example because a lot of women get called a call back for like a second test.

85
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,940
amondul: There can also be you know the test itself could.

86
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,610
amondul: Have downsides right.

87
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:46,980
amondul: mammogram is, it is an x Ray right it's radiating the breast tissue, so I would guess if you're really high risk and you're getting frequent mammograms like that is not inconsequential.

88
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,620
amondul: A lot of my examples are going to be from cancer, so people have other examples, please chime in but i'm thinking about.

89
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:07,200
amondul: colonoscopies right, you have to undergo anesthesia if you'd have someone who is not well trained there is some small risk of like printing the bowel I mean it's not entirely without any kind of risk.

90
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:18,900
amondul: Right, it is a medical procedure, so you want you want to you know it needs to be kind of not only acceptable to the individual and healthcare professional, but it also needs to not not cause harm.

91
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,560
amondul: acceptability to the individual in the healthcare professional.

92
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,590
amondul: You know, when we think about this, one thing that I think of a lot is cervical cancer screening.

93
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,340
amondul: So how do we do cervical cancer screening in this country.

94
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,600
amondul: what's the cervical cancer screening tests anybody know.

95
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:49,800
amondul: Have pap smears snares that's exactly right and so to get a pap smear you have to go to a healthcare professional sometimes.

96
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,240
amondul: and get a full book exam right.

97
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,380
amondul: And not everybody finds that.

98
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:06,540
amondul: Acceptable right there are some cultures, where that is unacceptable, especially in some cultures, where perhaps most most healthcare professionals are men, and it is.

99
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:15,330
amondul: unacceptable for women to go have a public exam from a provider right so um you know it can be actually really difficult and so there's a lot of.

100
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:23,940
amondul: Studies going on right now at university of Michigan, for example, to have women do surgical self sampling, so they have these little.

101
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:30,780
amondul: These little devices that you insert in the vagina and then you kind of turn it like in a little brush comes out like a lipstick tube.

102
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:37,830
amondul: And then you can switch it back in and the brush goes back in and then you can mail it in and they'll test it for high risk HPV DNA.

103
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:49,110
amondul: So for people who don't find it acceptable to go for whatever reason, culturally, or for other reasons, but they're also doing this in a population of trans men, because you can imagine that it's really.

104
00:12:50,280 --> 00:13:03,240
amondul: causes a lot of gender dysphoria and it's very uncomfortable for a trans man to go to a female you know health care provider, for you know, a pelvic exam for a pap smear so doing it at home on their own, is actually really great.

105
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,300
amondul: So those are some examples of that.

106
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,910
amondul: All right.

107
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,040
amondul: yeah.

108
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,970
Joshua Tucker: Are those are those kinds of tests are they justin clinical trial at this point.

109
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,230
amondul: I.

110
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,610
Joshua Tucker: sell stuff.

111
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,000
amondul: In this country yes.

112
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,250
amondul: I believe so.

113
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,850
amondul: But I think they are being used in other settings.

114
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,050
amondul: developing country kind of settings.

115
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,410
Okay.

116
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,110
amondul: Okay.

117
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:36,960
amondul: um.

118
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,210
amondul: Excuse me.

119
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:53,340
amondul: All right, and then the other thing that needs to happen is, you have to have a recognized treatment like what's the point in screening for something if there's nothing you can do about it right that's kind of the whole point of screening is that you can treat somebody earlier.

120
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:03,240
amondul: So you really do need to have something that you can do, or else there's no point in screening for the disease, now there are some exceptions to that for things that we screen for like.

121
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,880
amondul: When i'm thinking of is perhaps huntington's disease.

122
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:18,840
amondul: This is a genetic disease that there's no treatment for it and people generally die fairly young when they have this, but you might want to know.

123
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:25,350
amondul: about that, so that you can do some planning for end of life kind of things financial planning planning for your relatives.

124
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:31,530
amondul: You might make decisions about whether or not to have children, based on whether you carry this gene, you know those kinds of things.

125
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:37,230
amondul: Excuse me, so there are reasons to screen for things, even if there's no treatment, but generally speaking.

126
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:45,540
amondul: We want there to be recognized treatment another example that comes to mind when we think about things we screen for the don't really have a recognized treatment is sometimes we'll do prenatal screening for.

127
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,900
amondul: For example, things like down syndrome right, we obviously can't treat down syndrome.

128
00:14:52,320 --> 00:15:05,310
amondul: But people can make planning decisions about finding the right school or you know that kind of thing so sometimes you want to know about these kinds of things just for planning purposes right but, generally speaking, we we screen for things that have a recognized treatment.

129
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,630
amondul: Any questions about that.

130
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,420
amondul: Alright, so how many people are prevented are.

131
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,450
amondul: familiar with the usps tf the US preventive services Task Force.

132
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:43,530
amondul: So this is sort of the body that makes a couple of us are, this is the, the body that makes decisions kind of recommendations about lots of different things, including what kinds of things should be screened for, so this is an old screenshot.

133
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:51,360
amondul: But you can essentially go there and click on you know screening, you can find screening recommendations for lots and lots of different things.

134
00:15:53,010 --> 00:16:00,690
amondul: and generally if if the usps tf recommend screening, to have a rating system, a B, C D and I.

135
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:13,260
amondul: is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against D means they recommend against C is kind of this wishy washy yeah maybe maybe not and then A and B are yes, you should do this with kind of various levels of certainty.

136
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,600
amondul: And so, basically if usps you recommend something with a or B rating that's important because.

137
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:27,960
amondul: insurance providers generally will cover it and I believe it's required to be covered under obamacare the affordable care act insurance plans for example.

138
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:38,730
amondul: Alright, so, in summary, screening is the use of testing to sort out apparently well people probably have disease for those who probably do not.

139
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:52,860
amondul: This is done during the preclinical face and it's called secondary prevention so screening increases lead time which allows us to detect the disease early initiate treatment sooner and in theory provide better outcomes.

140
00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:01,920
amondul: But you have to you know screening programs must be warranted right there has to be this critical point that can be preceded by screening, or else it's maybe not worth it to do screening.

141
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:06,990
amondul: Okay.

142
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:15,090
amondul: So joshua just shared a link on the latest one latest one what came out in June.

143
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:18,060
Joshua Tucker: Oh, the recommendation usp you.

144
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,970
amondul: This is for vitamin supplementation.

145
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:27,900
amondul: Their limitations on all kinds of different things supplements screening all kinds of different things right, and so.

146
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:35,400
amondul: that's one of their recommendations that was updated recently, most of them if you go to their website and click on their recommendations you'll see that it's under review.

147
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:46,470
amondul: So they're always updating so usually you'll see that there's something that came out and they'll be like up but there's you know it's under review we're going to come up with any one soon almost all the time right.

148
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,110
amondul: So that's one example of one of their things but it's not you know their entire.

149
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,000
amondul: there's lots of things that aren't that have just come out with any one, for example.

150
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,790
amondul: Alright, any questions about screening generally before we talk about validity.

151
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:16,200
amondul: Alright, so when we're talking about validity of the screening test we're really saying how accurate is this screening test, so this is a canonical picture that we all love and epidemiology our little dart boards.

152
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,200
amondul: So.

153
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:29,190
amondul: This is an example of some validity is the ability of a test to distinguish between who does and does not have disease so it's really accuracy.

154
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:37,380
amondul: reliability is another concept that we will talk about, but this is the ability to replicate results on the same sample with the test is repeated, so this is precision.

155
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:47,700
amondul: So, for example, this is a very reliable result in the middle here because they're all clustered together it's very repeatable but it's not valid because you're not hitting the bullseye.

156
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:57,690
amondul: This year on the left is maybe an example of valid, but not reliable right it's kind of spread out you're not really repeating it but you're kind of clustered around the bullseye generally speaking.

157
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,950
amondul: But here's what you really want you want it to be valid and reliable you want to hit that bullseye and you want to be able to do it over and over again.

158
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:14,940
amondul: Okay, so, as we said validity is the ability of the test to distinguish between who has disease and who does not.

159
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,190
amondul: And there are two measures that we frequently talk about with validity, we talk about sensitivity.

160
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:26,760
amondul: and specificity sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those who have the disease.

161
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:39,600
amondul: and specificity, is the ability of the test to identify those who do not have disease and we're going to talk about this in more detail valid tests have both a high sensitivity and specificity so.

162
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:46,050
amondul: we're using a screening test to try to sort out.

163
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:53,880
amondul: The people who do and don't have disease but we're comparing that screening tests always to some true disease status.

164
00:19:54,390 --> 00:20:00,960
amondul: Which We only know based on some test right, so this is a gold standard there's some gold standard test, which is the best test available.

165
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:07,380
amondul: it's not always perfect itself right, but this is what we're comparing our screening test to their compared against the gold standard.

166
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:16,170
amondul: So, for example in breast cancer or breast biopsy would be the gold standard use, you have a lump you take a sample of it follow just looks at it.

167
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:26,340
amondul: And determines that the cells are cancerous or not, that is, the gold standard for diagnosing someone with breast cancer, and we are comparing that to mammogram results.

168
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,200
Right.

169
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,410
amondul: Which is our screening test for breast cancer.

170
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:40,230
amondul: So when we're going to start doing some calculations around this and calculating sensitivity and specificity, we want to set up one of these two by two tables.

171
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:48,450
amondul: Where our true disease status or gold standard test result is shown here on the top so diseased and not diseased.

172
00:20:49,110 --> 00:21:04,650
amondul: And then, our screening result screening test results are shown here on the left hand side so positive and negative and that leaves us with these four cells so cell a are those who truly have disease and test positive So these are our true positives right.

173
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:12,360
amondul: B is our false positives right they tested positive on the screening test, but they don't actually have the disease.

174
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:21,150
amondul: See is our false negatives, so they truly have disease but they tested negative on the screening test.

175
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:28,320
amondul: And D are true negatives right, so they don't have the disease and they tested negative.

176
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,050
amondul: So.

177
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:53,730
amondul: We said that sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those who have the disease, so a more mathematical way to say, that is, it is the proportion of truly diseased people who are identified as diseased So if you want to calculate that it is a over a plus C.

178
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:59,430
amondul: Right it's a proportion of truly disease so that's your true positives.

179
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,780
amondul: And then your denominator is all of the disease people.

180
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,990
amondul: Does that make sense.

181
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:20,490
amondul: specificity, on the other hand, we said was the ability of a test to correctly identify those who do not have the disease, so does the proportion of truly not diseased people.

182
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:40,710
amondul: Who are identified as not diseased Okay, so in that case we're looking at a proportion of truly not diseased people, so our denominator here is the plus D all the Nazis people and those were identified as not disease start D so sense it specificity is calculated as D over B plus C.

183
00:22:47,130 --> 00:23:01,710
amondul: So here's an example, this is the first trimester screen for trisomy 21, which is the genetic condition on down syndrome, so we have screening positive screening negative and truly having down syndrome and do not have down syndrome.

184
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:03,450
amondul: Okay.

185
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,930
amondul: And they've added up these.

186
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,820
amondul: rows for you to get the totals in the margins okay.

187
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:27,900
amondul: So we said sensitivity is the proportion of all those who are truly disease to test positive, so what How would you calculate the sensitivity here, what would go in the numerator what number 4343 40.

188
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,240
amondul: divided by 400 correct.

189
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:38,160
amondul: anybody else had their hand talk a little more candy than I do.

190
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:48,660
amondul: What does that give us 340 divided by 400 is point eight five so our sensitivity is point eight five.

191
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,750
amondul: Okay 0.8.

192
00:23:53,190 --> 00:24:05,040
amondul: Now specificity, remember that is the proportion of people who do not have the disease, who test negative Okay, so what number would go in the numerator here.

193
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,860
Divya Manohar: Nine to 2940.

194
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:35,070
amondul: grams is here, as our true negatives 92 940 divided by the total number who truly don't have disease right so that's 99,600 and that gives us 992 949 divided by 99 600 that gives us point nine 0.93 right.

195
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:36,330
brenda.w.campbell: Right.

196
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,520
amondul: So we have 93% specificity.

197
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:59,880
amondul: Okay, you can express it this way, or you can say 85% and 93% well there you go I didn't need to use the new reddit.

198
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:10,890
amondul: Alright, so this makes it look very simple right like there's a yes and a no for your screening test and there's a positive and a negative for to the having the disease.

199
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,880
amondul: But let's think about.

200
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,610
amondul: A test result that is not like black and white right.

201
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:38,130
amondul: So this is a histogram of diameter of in duration and milliliters Has anybody ever had that tuberculosis tests like to work at a hospital where they put the little thing on your arm and, hopefully, it does not swell up enormously so he's given me quite oh so he.

202
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:49,650
amondul: yeah it's like a little it's almost like like almost like an allergy tests, I think, where they put like you know kind of allergy tests, they put like a little a little drip of stuff under your skin yeah they ingest like a little bit of.

203
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:59,250
amondul: overkill and I guess under your skin and then, if you react to it, it means you've got antibodies and if you're in the US, where we've never done workflows this.

204
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:17,280
amondul: immunization if you have antibodies it means go for it was so high reaction it's a millimeter of the spot that like react on your arm a big big spot means you have a positive test, but you know.

205
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,060
amondul: it's not a yes, no right is millimeters of the spot, so you have to pick a cut off somewhere now.

206
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:33,480
amondul: This histogram makes it fairly obvious that this is a good cut off right like you've got all these folks cluster down here and then you've got like kind of a normal bell curve of folks up here.

207
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:41,190
amondul: So you know you're like Okay, probably, this is a good cut off, these are the negatives, these are positives right so that's fairly fairly easy.

208
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,610
amondul: What about this.

209
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:59,220
amondul: This is systolic blood pressure and millet millimeters of mercury right, this is again a histogram where do we pick our cut off here.

210
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:13,980
amondul: Well they've picked one funny, and this is based on normal is less than 120 $6 lesson at ddp right so they've picked some cut offs.

211
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:21,420
amondul: Based on biology, but it's not nearly as obvious right as it was for the other one where the cutoff should be.

212
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:30,060
amondul: So this is just showing you that you have to pick a cut off and where you cut that off influences the sensitivity and specificity of your test.

213
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:41,490
amondul: Right So these are all people, the blue ones truly have diabetes, the reds truly have no diabetes, and this is their kind of distribution of blood sugar levels from high to low.

214
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:47,160
amondul: If you have a low cut off value you end up with you know.

215
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,500
amondul: Very few.

216
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,360
amondul: you end up you end up really catching all of these.

217
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,950
amondul: diabetic diabetics right, you have very few kind of false negatives.

218
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,920
amondul: But you end up with quite a few false positives maybe right.

219
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:19,920
amondul: If you have a really high cut up value you're going to end up missing some diabetics but you're not going to end up counting people who aren't diabetics as diabetics right so that cut up, you have to kind of decide when you're making your cut off out you.

220
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:34,860
amondul: What is the downside, like Do I really not want to miss true positives or Do I really not want to call people who are negative false positives right and that kind of helps you determine where that cloth level should be.

221
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:42,330
amondul: So if we do the calculation, we had if you actually went and counted up those little circles.

222
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:53,730
amondul: This is what you would end up with we had we have 22 diabetics and 22 non diabetics if you lose a low cut off.

223
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:02,610
amondul: you end up with a high sensitivity, but a very low specificity, which makes sense right and ended up with a lot of false.

224
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:04,920
amondul: positives.

225
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:18,930
amondul: But if you're a high cut off, you have a low sensitivity and specificity so lowering the cut point will increase your true.

226
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:27,990
amondul: positives and therefore increase your sensitivity, but it'll decrease your true negatives, therefore, decreasing your specificity raising the cost point will do the opposite.

227
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,950
amondul: Okay, usually.

228
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:41,760
amondul: Usually, we with a screening tests we err on the side we want both right you want to high sensitivity and specificity that's ideal like you're not.

229
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:57,030
amondul: we're not going to use a screening test probably that has a specificity it's 30% that's bonkers but you're going to usually we're going to go in favor of more sensitivity for a screening test, particularly for a very serious disease right because you don't want to miss people.

230
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,000
amondul: So.

231
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,400
amondul: Results of screening are either going to lead individuals to see further confirmatory testing.

232
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:12,960
amondul: Or to believe they're not disease to do nothing forward further, so the importance false positives and false negatives helps you to decide where the appropriate cut off should be.

233
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:25,770
amondul: If you have a false positive you're going to require extra confirmatory testing, which might be expensive or invasive you could get anxiety and stigma to do to the individual believing that their disease that's the example that people could get a positive.

234
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:32,880
amondul: suspicious mammogram and have to schedule a follow up visit and it might take, weeks and so they're really anxious for all that time.

235
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:40,290
amondul: Cost of false negatives, though, you know if there's a really high penalty for missing a case like this is a very deadly disease.

236
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,360
amondul: And you don't want to miss those people, you know you don't want a lot of false negatives.

237
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:53,160
amondul: You don't want the false security of thinking someone's healthy when they're not you know, this is particularly true for something serious that you might spread to somebody else.

238
00:30:53,610 --> 00:31:03,750
amondul: Maybe HIV is a good example of this right, you don't want people to be like cool I don't have HIV and then thinking that they don't need to practice safe sex or protect their partners, for example.

239
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:14,040
amondul: Alright, so, in summary, we said validity is the ability of a test to distinguish between who cause disease and who doesn't.

240
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:26,130
amondul: sensitivity is the proportion of disease people who were correctly identified as the spinal screening tests and specificity, is the proportion of non disease, people who are correctly identified as non disease by the screening tests.

241
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,780
amondul: Changing the cut point of a screening tests will change the sensitivity and specificity.

242
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:37,500
amondul: Any questions about that before we move on to talking about mobile testing.

243
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,400
amondul: So we use multiple tests and screening programs quite a lot.

244
00:31:51,660 --> 00:32:01,590
amondul: We use a two stage like sequential tests, where you do a lesson expensive less invasive and less uncomfortable test first and if you're positive on that first test, then you follow up with additional testing.

245
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:15,240
amondul: or sometimes we'll do a simultaneous testing where we can do multiple screening tests at the same time, and in order to be considered positive, you can test positive on either side, either test but negative, you have to be negative, on all tests.

246
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:25,290
amondul: So each test has its own sensitivity and specificity, so you need to calculate the net sensitivity and specificity of kind of this.

247
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,680
amondul: All of these these multiple tests together.

248
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:41,610
amondul: So let's talk about visual examination and pap smear Okay, this is sequential cervical cancer screening so.

249
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,370
amondul: visual exam they use like a.

250
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:56,370
amondul: magnifying lens essentially to look at the cervix sometimes they'll paint it with the scenic acid look the it's called VI a visual inspection with acidic acid and.

251
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:07,320
amondul: spots of concern will turn white with acidic acid, and then you might if you have, or if you just have a negative values to gas it even if you just have an unusual visual exam they might send me for a pap smear.

252
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:29,310
amondul: So say we have a total of 100,000 women, and we know that the prevalence of cervical cancer is point 5% Okay, so if we have 100,000 women and you multiply that by point, oh five you get 500 women with cervical cancer and 99,500 without cervical cancer.

253
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,360
amondul: Okay, now, this is something you're going to be asked to do fairly frequently.

254
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,600
amondul: you're going to have to fill in this table when you're given.

255
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:59,160
amondul: The sensitivity and specificity, so we couldn't have said to you, we have 100,000 women and the prevalence of cervical cancer is 1.5% the first test has a sensitivity of 75% in a specificity of 81% and you should be able to fill in the whole tape.

256
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,170
amondul: Because you apply the prevalence to get these marginals here like we just did.

257
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,600
amondul: And then, how would you figure out how many people tested positive if you know that the sensitivity is.

258
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,530
Nolaundron Harris: 75% 75% in the total for.

259
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,260
Nolaundron Harris: The firefighter yes.

260
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:27,300
amondul: that's correct, you would take Point seven five times 500 and that gives you 375 right because that sensitivity is the proportion of people with the disease, who tested positive with your test.

261
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:38,130
amondul: So then you've got that you can very easily then get your other number with traction we can use specificity, to get this number here right.

262
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:53,550
amondul: Because specificities 81% so we know that of those who truly don't have cervical cancer 81% of them will test negative on this test so that's 81% of 99,500 and then you just do some traction to get the rest of your cells.

263
00:34:54,630 --> 00:35:05,940
amondul: Okay, so this is sequential cervical cancer screening, so we applied this test and all 100,000 women 375 of them tested positive on this test.

264
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:10,200
amondul: Okay now we're going to send these 375.

265
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,510
amondul: To have a pap smear.

266
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:23,610
amondul: Also 18,905 without cervical cancer tested positive on the test so we're going to send those people for a pap smear to because we think they might have cervical cancer.

267
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:33,300
amondul: Now we can use the sensitivity and the specificity of the pap smear to get those two numbers, so this is 82% of 375.

268
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,980
amondul: And this is 93% of the 18,905.

269
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,580
amondul: And we use our subtraction to get this.

270
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,120
amondul: So, at the end of all of this.

271
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:53,430
amondul: We ended the net sensitivity is the total number, whose screen positive divided by the number with disease.

272
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,900
amondul: So how many total ended up screening positive at the end of this.

273
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,630
amondul: multistage screening process.

274
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,940
amondul: If these people who were negative never went on for the second test right so at the end of it 308 tested positive.

275
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,350
amondul: And we know that really 500 truly had the disease.

276
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,260
amondul: So that leaves us with a net sensitivity of 62%.

277
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,480
amondul: Does that make sense.

278
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,140
amondul: How many total.

279
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,500
amondul: tested negative well all these guys tested negative who truly didn't have disease.

280
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,100
amondul: Plus, all these guys right in that second.

281
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,280
amondul: Round, so you add those together.

282
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:47,070
amondul: divided by the total who truly didn't have a disease, and we have a 99% of that specificity.

283
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,100
amondul: That makes sense to everybody.

284
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,120
Nolaundron Harris: it's gonna take time to just lock it in but.

285
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,730
amondul: Well, and that's that's part of what the.

286
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:10,140
amondul: Working on the exercise is going to help do right but yeah essentially the net sensitivity will tell you at the end of the whole screening program at the end of both tests.

287
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:17,730
amondul: You want the number who screen positive divided by the total number we truly have the disease right same with them that specificity.

288
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,170
amondul: in general.

289
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:31,560
amondul: Net sent sequential testing will decrease your neck sensitivity, compared to the individual sensitivity of the tests that will increase your specificity.

290
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,490
amondul: You see how that happened.

291
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:41,760
amondul: So.

292
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:46,740
amondul: Simultaneous screening, on the other hand, is where you screen using more than one test at the same time.

293
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:59,790
amondul: Each test has its own sensitivity and specificity and to be positive, you can screen positive either test to be negative, he must green negative on all tests so examples might be a clinical work up where you're testing lots of different.

294
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:06,510
amondul: Biological measures at the same time to figure out, you know kind of what somebody might have or urine screening for doping agents.

295
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,130
amondul: Where you're testing for lots of different potential agents, at a time.

296
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:19,770
amondul: Simultaneous testing will increase your will do the opposite it's going to increase your net sensitivity and decrease your that specificity.

297
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:21,510
Okay.

298
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:37,650
amondul: So here's a visual to give you an idea of how this works so with sequential testing remember we do our first test if they test negative we're calling them negative if you test positive on the first test you go on to the second test.

299
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:44,940
amondul: And if you test positive on that one Those are our positives and some of them will test negative and be included with our negatives.

300
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:50,370
amondul: That was the cervical cancer visual exam pap smear example.

301
00:38:51,450 --> 00:39:04,560
amondul: This, as we said, will decrease your net sensitivity and increase your that specificity, whereas on simultaneous testing, you can be positive on either test one or test two which you're done at the same time, those are called are positives but if you're negative on both your calls.

302
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:09,690
amondul: And this will do the opposite the sensitivity and specificity okay.

303
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:13,590
amondul: So.

304
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:21,480
amondul: This is our summary sequential testings when an initial screening test is done and those individuals that screen positive our screen began using a second test.

305
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:32,400
amondul: Simultaneous testing is where we just do multiple screening tests at the same time, on the same samples, so this can either improve that sensitivity and specificity depending on which measure which approach take.

306
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,700
amondul: Any questions on that.

307
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,090
amondul: So let's talk about.

308
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,120
amondul: The clinical utility of screen so we're going to talk about predictive value and now we're going to talk about reliability.

309
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:58,050
amondul: So we've talked about sensitivity and specificity, but that's not really what patients want to know.

310
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:12,420
amondul: right they don't want to know the probability that they test positive, given that they really have the disease that's not what they're interested in, they want to know is, if I test positive what's the likelihood that I actually have this disease that's the question that they're asking.

311
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:21,090
amondul: And the same thing with negative that's that's called the positive predictive value the negative predictive value is if they've had negative what's the likelihood that they actually don't have the disease.

312
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:34,530
amondul: So, positive and predictive value and negative predictive value are affected both by they're affected by the specificity and sensitivity of the tests that you're using they're also affected by the prevalence of disease in the population that you're testing.

313
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,880
amondul: So let's do a little calculation.

314
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,860
amondul: This is our same two by two table where we've got true disease status on the top.

315
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:54,090
amondul: And the screening test results on the left with our true positives false positives false negatives entry negative it's just like we set it up for the sensitivity and specificity calculations.

316
00:40:54,690 --> 00:41:00,570
amondul: But rather than going down the columns like we did with sensitivity and specificity we're going to go across the road.

317
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:11,700
amondul: So remember we're asking if I test positive what's the probability that the patient has the disease right if the patient test positive so if they test positive among those the test positive.

318
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:20,430
amondul: what's the probability that they truly have the disease, so in that case it's a over a plus B, the true positives over all those that tested positive okay.

319
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,520
amondul: And the same thing for the negative predictive value right among those who tested negative.

320
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:33,540
amondul: what's the probability they don't have the disease so that's the true negatives divided by C plus T all those that tested negative.

321
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:35,790
amondul: Okay.

322
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,960
amondul: So here's an example.

323
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:54,300
amondul: The disease of interest is deep vein thrombosis or DDT okay so either they have it, or they don't have it, and this is the designer test, which is the screening test for this positive or negative on the screen test okay.

324
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,580
amondul: So.

325
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,430
amondul: i'm giving you the answer here in the interpretation but let's go ahead and calculate it, how would you calculate the positive predictive value here.

326
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:16,770
amondul: that's right 51 divided by 83.

327
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,890
amondul: And if my interpretation is correct.

328
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,170
amondul: That should be.

329
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:28,350
amondul: Point 61 61% okay.

330
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:36,780
amondul: So the interpretation of this is that, given a positive result on this, the dimer test the likelihood that an individual has DDT is 61%.

331
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:48,990
amondul: let's do the negative predictive value, who can tell me how you would calculate the negative predictive value among goes with a negative test what's the probability that they truly don't have disease.

332
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,890
amondul: 30 over 38.

333
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,050
amondul: that's right.

334
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:06,300
amondul: Which is 79%.

335
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:10,770
Okay.

336
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,740
amondul: alright.

337
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:27,900
amondul: So, as we said predictive value is affected by the characteristics of the test the sensitivity and specificity of the test, but it is also affected by disease prevalence so.

338
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:35,640
amondul: This is a test that has a sensitivity and 98% and the specificity of 94% which is pretty darn good on both counts right.

339
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:51,270
amondul: If you do this in a 5% puppy if you apply this test screening cast in a population that has a 5% prevalence of disease only 5% of the population has the disease so have 1000 people 50 of them have a disease.

340
00:43:52,020 --> 00:44:01,290
amondul: we're going to compare that to if you applied this test exact same test with the same sensitivity and specificity to a population of the 25% prevalence.

341
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:10,560
amondul: So in this low prevalence your positive productive value is 49 divided by 106 which gives you 46.2%.

342
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:19,920
amondul: On the other hand, if you look in the 25% prevalence scenario positives devalue is 245 divided by 298 which is at 4.5%.

343
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:25,410
amondul: Your positive print the value will always be better in a high risk population.

344
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:33,210
amondul: This is why, when we screen for things like cancer, we do it in older people.

345
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:47,250
amondul: This is why we screen for lung cancer in smokers right, this is why we kind of try to tailor our screening tests and use them in populations that have a higher prevalence of the disease.

346
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:58,620
amondul: This is part of why we have been had very poor luck with screening tests for very rare cancers, for example in the general population right.

347
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:11,940
amondul: Because, no matter how good your test is, this is a good test right you almost have to have 100% sense to be 100% specificity, to have any kind of reasonable positive predictive value for movie rare disease.

348
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:13,590
amondul: Right.

349
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,310
amondul: Even a really good test is going to have a crappy ppb in a low risk population.

350
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:34,200
amondul: Is this also why the American heart association I don't know what this is no probably it's not so this is you're talking about predictive like a prediction calculator josh was that right.

351
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,540
Joshua Tucker: yeah you're right the.

352
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:53,520
amondul: Not I assume that they have so when you make a, this is a completely different topic actually when you make a prediction you're usually using data on you use data from a particular study population and then apply it to a test population to kind of.

353
00:45:54,540 --> 00:46:06,000
amondul: You use data to train your prediction your prediction predict predict or your calculator to train your calculator and then you try it out on different populations, so I imagine.

354
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:16,740
amondul: That they've only done this for people over 40 because those are the people who mostly they use the data they have data on people over 40 to train their predictor does that make sense.

355
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,320
Joshua Tucker: yeah that's good to know never thought about that, before.

356
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:23,850
Joshua Tucker: Okay.

357
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:39,090
amondul: So negative predict value can see as it is much less affected by the prevalence then positivity count and positive predictive value is the one that's really affected, so I was actually story time I was in study section, and we were reviewing a grant that was.

358
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:54,000
amondul: Proposing to study a screening tests for a very low very rare cancer, but that has a very nasty outcome right, so you really would like to screen for this and find it earlier because people are likely to have a better outcome.

359
00:46:54,570 --> 00:47:08,910
amondul: But they did not in their grant anywhere address this problem of positive predictive value being really poor or saying anything at all about positive predictive value, because this is such a low prevalence cancer, and so they got they got really tanked instead of section.

360
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:12,810
amondul: So there you go.

361
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:22,470
amondul: This is just a little picture that's kind of showing you the same idea, the prevalence of disease, you know, in the positive and negative tests here.

362
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:33,720
amondul: This is the predictive value the positive predictive value is much more affected by the prevalence of disease, the negative predictive value drops off some but it's not really at nearly as effective by prevalence.

363
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:40,320
amondul: So disease prevalence hired the disease prevalence, the higher the positive predictive value the lower than negative predictive value.

364
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:45,000
amondul: Screening programs are most productive and efficient and high risk populations.

365
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:57,900
amondul: And again, the high risk can mean like an age restricted population right that's why we do colorectal cancer screening people over 45 to do breast cancer screening women over 40 right because you wouldn't do it in teenagers and young people, they just don't get cancer that much.

366
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:07,650
amondul: screening for infrequent disease might waste resources and you need to prevent present the positive predictive value in the context of disease prevalence.

367
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:09,270
amondul: So.

368
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:16,320
amondul: positive value is also really strong lower strongly affected by the test specificity.

369
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:18,420
amondul: So.

370
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:26,820
amondul: Here we've held constant the disease prevalence is 20% in the population, so have 1000 people 200 actually have a disease and both of these scenarios.

371
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:37,350
amondul: The sensitivity is nice and high 90% were varying the specificity here, so the top scenario is when the specificity of 76% and the bottom scenario is when the specificity is 94%.

372
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:48,300
amondul: And you can see, if you do this calculation your positive value is going to be a lot lower with the low specificity, then with the high specificity, so the test specificity also increases the positive predictive value.

373
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:53,640
amondul: So.

374
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:56,130
amondul: Remember.

375
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:06,180
amondul: sensitivity and specificity are characteristics of the test, they will be the same, no matter what population you use the test in.

376
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:11,250
amondul: sensitivity and specificity are about the test.

377
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:17,220
amondul: Positive predictive and negative predictive value are affected.

378
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:18,930
amondul: By.

379
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:26,160
amondul: The sensitivity and specificity of test, but also by whether you're using it in a higher low prevalence population.

380
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:37,530
amondul: Okay, so sensitivity specificity, will not be affected by the the population that you're using the test in because it is a function, it is a characteristic of the test.

381
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:40,470
amondul: Regardless of what population are using it, it.

382
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,560
amondul: Does that make sense.

383
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,090
amondul: Alright, so we have talked a lot about validity.

384
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:58,920
amondul: Right, the ability to actually get the correct answer on with your screening tests, but now we're going to talk about reliability right this ability to replicate your results on the same same sample if your test is repeated.

385
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:16,860
amondul: So what you really want to know is the results be replicated if the test is redone, and this is affected by several factors so interest subject variation variation within individuals right Can somebody give me an example of where like an individual would vary.

386
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:24,360
amondul: And if you repeated the test on the same person, you might get a different answer.

387
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,950
Joshua Tucker: You guys think verse nine fasting anything.

388
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,070
amondul: or fasting versus not fasting What did you say so, a.

389
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:39,420
amondul: diet change yeah I mean that would be an actual if somebody changed the diet that might be an actual.

390
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:45,150
amondul: real difference right from before and after the dietary change.

391
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:53,430
amondul: I think another good example, might be so I don't know if that's really reliability problem that might be a real difference that you might want it to.

392
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:59,610
Abby Sossen (she/her): Be you could have like urine tests like if people drink too much water, the sample.

393
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,320
Abby Sossen (she/her): might be too deep blue.

394
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:17,400
amondul: that's a good one drinking more water can change the the urine test how about blood pressure, I can remember when I was pregnant my my Ob gyn office was like couple blocks down from my office, so I walked there, and like toward the end of my pregnancy, it was like getting warmer outside.

395
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:25,080
amondul: And it was uphill a little bit, so I walked up hill is a little hot and they got there and they took me right into the office and the first thing they did is they slap the.

396
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,800
amondul: blood pressure cuff on me and you could just see the spirit, she was like oh my God.

397
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:34,590
amondul: It was like, no, no, give it a minute it's okay i'm just gonna sit here without crossing my legs and a brief for like 10 minutes.

398
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:40,470
amondul: And I was right, it was fine it was just that i'd like huffed and puffed my way up the hill to get to my office to get to my appointment.

399
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:44,790
amondul: But they were they were about ready to slap me in the bed and keep me there for the next month or two.

400
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:53,190
amondul: But yeah I mean activity, how you sit crossing your legs, you know all of that will affect blood pressure readings right.

401
00:51:54,150 --> 00:52:04,230
amondul: So you can have variation within people in observer variation so if the same person reads the results twice, you would hope that we get the same answer, but they might not.

402
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:11,550
amondul: An interim server variation is very variation between like you have two different people read the results, you might get a different answer.

403
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:18,360
amondul: Okay, and so this is for more subjective type things like people looking at X Ray films or.

404
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:24,780
amondul: Even pathologists looking at cancer samples tumor samples under a slide if they're kind of trying to decide at.

405
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:32,790
amondul: What stage of cancer is or what grade A cancer is that's a little bit subjective and if you get two different people that might give you two different answers, hopefully not very different but.

406
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:37,230
amondul: So here's An example of this.

407
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:54,900
amondul: We have two different readers they're scoring these are these are radiologists who are looking at radiographs of knees and they're scoring them for osteoarthritis and we've got 40 knees don't know if they're from 40 people are from 20 people, but we have 40 knees.

408
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:11,880
amondul: And so, each reader is saying there's no arthritis doubtful minimal moderate or severe right what you really want is for them to agree right you want all of the all of them all of the needs to be in these diagonal cells.

409
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:28,620
amondul: Okay, so we can calculate like a just an easy reliability statistic is the percent agreement, the number of people in cells that agree divided by the total number of pair of readings times 100 Okay, so if we add all this up.

410
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:39,000
amondul: it's two plus 15 plus five plus five plus four divided by 40 because we have 40 nice times 177.5% agreement.

411
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:41,610
amondul: All right.

412
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,550
amondul: there's a more sophisticated way to do this, and that is the Cabinet statistic.

413
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:55,320
amondul: Can you guys look real quick and the exercise I don't think I asked them to do a Kappa, but I can you just double check.

414
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:05,430
amondul: Okay, so i'm not going to ask you we're not going to be asked to calculate a campus statistic by hand this is a little bit more complicated i'm going to show you how it's done because I think.

415
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:11,190
amondul: For those who are math brains, this is going to help you kind of understand this, but if you're not math brain and this makes your head explode.

416
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:20,010
amondul: Try to focus more on the concept of them, the numbers Okay, so the campus statistic is a little bit more sophisticated because it's taking into.

417
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:32,700
amondul: Account this idea that people will agree, by chance, alone, sometimes right so there's some on agreement that would just if you put two monkeys in a room and ask them to score the knees, some of them would agree right just by chance.

418
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:46,650
amondul: So the Kappa is looking at the percent agreement minus the percent agreement expected by chance alone divided by 100 minus 2% agreement expected by chance alone.

419
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:54,780
amondul: Okay, so this is kind of taking to account is basically saying like how much agreement was there, above and beyond what would have been expected by chance alone.

420
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,290
amondul: i'm so glad right.

421
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:11,010
amondul: Okay, so how would we calculate this well first you want to know what's the percent agreement we just talked about how to do that so somebody told me what how you would what would go in the numerator 4% agreement.

422
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,190
amondul: 180 plus 230.

423
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:20,070
amondul: divided by the total which is 500.

424
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:29,640
amondul: So we have 82% agreement now, this is the tricky part is, we need to calculate what the expected agreement is based on chance a lot.

425
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:40,920
amondul: So what proportion of tests did reader one rate as positive okay so that's this divided by the total hundred 80 plus 50 divided by the total so 46%.

426
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,940
amondul: And they redid their 450 4% as negative.

427
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:53,910
amondul: So if the results are reader one and two are independent than reader one should have 46% positives regardless of reader to scores.

428
00:55:54,990 --> 00:56:02,370
amondul: So for the 220 times that reader to as positive, we expect me to one will be positive 46% of the time.

429
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:09,690
amondul: Right and for the 280 times reader to is negative, we expect, for your one will be negative 54% of the time.

430
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:15,360
amondul: So this is your expected agreement by chance.

431
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:25,650
amondul: that's the tricky part is calculating back there are software packages that will do this for you i'm just kind of trying to give you a sense of how this is done.

432
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:36,390
amondul: So you would take the observed agreement minus the agreement expected by chance alone so it's 82 minus 50.4 divided by 100 minus 50.4 and you get 464.

433
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:51,120
amondul: So this is kind of a good thing to have in your mind, but what does that mean what's a good CAP off anything greater than Point seven five is excellent point four 2.75 is kind of intermediate to good and less than point four is.

434
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:53,610
amondul: Not so great.

435
00:56:57,090 --> 00:57:00,420
amondul: So that's you might be asked to interpret a Kappa.

436
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:09,300
amondul: But i'm not going to ask you to calculate particularly that expected agreement by chance alone piece.

437
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:15,810
amondul: But conceptually you can kind of understand how this is better than just looking at percent agreement right.

438
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,150
amondul: Any questions about that.

439
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:35,460
amondul: Alright, so these are the reliability like percent agreement Kappa these are reliability statistics that you're going to see for categorical data data that is in you can put in a table like that, where there's yes, no.

440
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:48,480
amondul: None mild moderate severe like rated by two people right there's other like inter inter class correlation coefficient or coefficient of variation but our reliability statistics that you will see for.

441
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:51,240
amondul: Truly continuous data.

442
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,860
amondul: we're not going to discuss this in detail here.

443
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:10,080
amondul: So we've said, the positive predictive value is the likelihood that a patient actually has the disease if they test positive for that disease higher disease problems will increase it and higher test specificity will also increase it.

444
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:19,860
amondul: reliability is the ability to replicate your results on the same sample of the test is repeated there's multiple sources of variation and test results right, some are.

445
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:32,730
amondul: From the person the test subject themselves, some are from the readers interested observer variation can be quantified using percent agreement, and also the slightly more sophisticated measure of the capital statistic.

446
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,580
amondul: Alright, any questions about that before we talk about the.

447
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:51,780
amondul: Oh i've been muted this whole time I hope people well that's weird because I did hear people I don't have any idea what's happening i'm sorry.

448
00:58:52,470 --> 00:59:08,970
amondul: i'm Okay, so any questions before we talk briefly why Oh, because i'm sharing that's fine here is everybody found you found you there you are hiding all right any questions before we talk about the quiz questions.

449
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,090
brenda.w.campbell: Questions but just to comment that is a lot to take in.

450
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,310
amondul: Lots of it.

451
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:22,920
brenda.w.campbell: it's just a lot to digest.

452
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,480
amondul: is yes.

453
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:33,240
amondul: You know this is a like a whole semester score shoved into three weeks, and so we do we do go over quite a lot.

454
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:46,650
amondul: And that's why I hope that, reading it and kind of taking the quiz on it and then hearing it in the lecture and then kind of grappling with it in the in class exercise and doing some of that will help to solidify it, but it is, it is a lot, I understand.

455
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:52,710
amondul: alright.

456
00:59:55,590 --> 01:00:02,160
amondul: So let's look at the quiz briefly, which is, are we talking about because number what for Thank you.

457
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,750
amondul: So let's look.

458
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:17,550
amondul: Okay, so question one was part of the part of the problem right.

459
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,760
amondul: So if I share my screen.

460
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:34,500
amondul: Okay, so question one is based on this information, a physical exam was evaluated as the screening test for breast cancer and 4000 women with proven breast cancer.

461
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:49,470
amondul: And 8000 women whose biopsy results showed no cancer and the results of the physical examination indicated cancer in 2000 cases and in 500 controls so they're asking you for the sensitivity so let's make a table right, so we have.

462
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,230
amondul: Can I can I draw.

463
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:56,040
amondul: see what if I annotate.

464
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:06,390
amondul: No, no, please go away annotate yes okay so you've got true disease.

465
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:11,190
amondul: and true non disease, the little line means no disease okay.

466
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:19,500
amondul: And then you've got test positive and tested negative, so how many true disease, do we have.

467
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:27,030
amondul: 4000 4000.

468
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:32,340
amondul: Right and how many people truly do not have breast cancer.

469
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,230
Patients.

470
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:43,980
amondul: Okay, and now it's telling you that the physical exam, which is our screening test right.

471
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:59,940
amondul: found cancer in 2000 cases okay so they're testing causes So where do I put the 2000 a be easy, where does the 2000s go.

472
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:01,470
brenda.w.campbell: And do it.

473
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:03,420
brenda.w.campbell: awesome let's.

474
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:05,910
amondul: Start who else I.

475
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:06,600
amondul: heard a.

476
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,100
amondul: And someone else was saying something to.

477
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:14,220
amondul: Yes, a is correct.

478
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:17,340
amondul: So we're going to erase that.

479
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:20,100
amondul: And we're going to say.

480
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,700
amondul: 2000 right.

481
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:33,210
amondul: All right, and now it says that there's the results of the physical examination also indicated cancer and 500 controls so we're just that number 500.

482
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,360
Ashlee Oaks: He.

483
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,770
Chelsey Kaasa: He wrecked.

484
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:43,470
amondul: Okay.

485
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:47,430
amondul: You, and then we can get C and D quite easily.

486
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:52,140
amondul: By subtraction right.

487
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:53,130
Right.

488
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,600
amondul: Now, how do we calculate the sensitivity.

489
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,090
Divya Manohar: At my eight let's see.

490
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:06,120
amondul: So tell me the numbers.

491
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:08,790
Divya Manohar: 2000 by 6000.

492
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:10,410
amondul: nope.

493
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:13,470
Divya Manohar: By 4000 4000 times.

494
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,290
brenda.w.campbell: 100.

495
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:29,610
amondul: that's that says 50%, that is, the ugliest most most horrible Let me try again I can't even leave that the way it was 50% there you go okay.

496
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:33,540
amondul: That makes sense now.

497
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:35,010
Yes.

498
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:39,900
Nolaundron Harris: yeah okay all right, thank you, thank you, page it.

499
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,240
amondul: Can I clear this.

500
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:45,300
Nolaundron Harris: Yes, just please okay.

501
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:48,390
amondul: let's go to question number two.

502
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:54,750
amondul: Oh no I shouldn't have done that, oh no oh no Okay, let me do it again i'm so sorry.

503
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:00,360
brenda.w.campbell: to breed based on the same information.

504
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:06,180
amondul: I shouldn't have done that you are right, so disease disease test positive test negative.

505
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:14,220
amondul: 2000 4570 508,000 right.

506
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,910
amondul: So now what's the specificity.

507
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:22,860
Geehan Suleyman: So it's 7500.

508
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,210
Geehan Suleyman: By 1000.

509
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:27,900
Yes.

510
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,500
amondul: And, whatever that is a percent right.

511
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:36,540
Geehan Suleyman: thing it was 94 93.75%.

512
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:38,280
amondul: that's right 34%.

513
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:40,860
amondul: Okay.

514
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:43,020
brenda.w.campbell: that's what was wrong.

515
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:46,530
amondul: And then.

516
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,260
amondul: i'm going to erase this.

517
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:02,190
amondul: Alright, so now what's the positive predictive value.

518
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:12,060
Nolaundron Harris: that's across.

519
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:14,280
Will Brodwater: 500 over 2500.

520
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:17,370
amondul: say it again.

521
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,050
Will Brodwater: 500 over 2500.

522
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:25,050
amondul: that's not correct so tell me.

523
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:25,770
Will Brodwater: Oh sorry.

524
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:27,900
Will Brodwater: Sorry 2000 oh.

525
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:31,590
amondul: that's right that's right so.

526
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:34,260
amondul: It is the tell me in words what the.

527
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:38,160
amondul: Positive predictive value is is the probability that you.

528
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:40,830
Divya Manohar: I would decease.

529
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:42,330
amondul: Given that you.

530
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:45,750
tested positive.

531
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:51,480
amondul: probability that you truly have the disease given among those that tested positive.

532
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:58,680
amondul: Right so that's 2000 truly have the disease among the 2500 that tested positive Okay, and that is.

533
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,690
amondul: 80%.

534
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:06,090
amondul: Okay.

535
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:11,580
amondul: That makes sense.

536
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:13,290
Absolutely.

537
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,520
brenda.w.campbell: So how do we calculate the specificity.

538
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,320
amondul: Sure, so tell me in words what the specificity is.

539
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:34,380
amondul: This will always help you, I think.

540
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:43,380
amondul: Because, if you remember a B, C D and try to remember the calculations, based on that you always have to set your table up the same way.

541
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:44,340
Nolaundron Harris: uh huh.

542
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:46,770
amondul: But if you remember the definitions.

543
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:53,070
amondul: You can always find the right numbers, so the specificity, is the probability that you test.

544
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:58,020
amondul: Negative negative, given that you're truly negative.

545
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:00,210
amondul: Right.

546
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:20,310
amondul: So that is this way, these are the truly negative people so who are the ones of the 8000 who were truly negative 7500 tested negative so specificity equals 7500 divided by 8000.

547
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:23,460
amondul: which I think we said was like 94%.

548
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:28,680
amondul: Does that help.

549
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:39,480
Nolaundron Harris: yeah I think I just think what it was was I got a little bit confusing on the wording so now just lock in that and help, so I really appreciate this so much thank you.

550
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:43,530
amondul: No problem and then someone else had asked about this Brenda was it you asking about.

551
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:47,220
brenda.w.campbell: It was me yeah I think I got confused on that one too yeah.

552
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:49,800
amondul: Okay, that does that answer your question.

553
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:51,240
amondul: Yes, great.

554
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:55,170
amondul: All right, any other questions about the quiz.

555
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,290
amondul: Alright i'm clearing the drawings.

556
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:04,800
amondul: click there we go.

557
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:08,070
amondul: All right, alright.

558
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:18,750
amondul: So let's go ahead and take a 10 minute break until 250 and they will come back and do the exercise, and I think there's only nine questions this time is that right.

559
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:25,980
amondul: So it's not a marathon like yesterday, but some but don't don't yay too much there is some of this a little bit.

560
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:35,640
amondul: more complicated like setting up the table right kind of like you did for the quiz but a little bit more so, but hopefully we'll get some practice with that, but it's not as long.

561
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,790
amondul: Alright 10 minute break.

562
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:42,570
amondul: Then I will see you back for your group exercise.

563
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:32,580
amondul: Alright, welcome back everybody, we are going to start going through these answers.

564
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:35,160
amondul: Alright, so.

565
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:36,270
amondul: You were set.

566
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:41,130
amondul: up with this question about dental plaque and.

567
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:52,980
amondul: frequency of tooth brushing as a screening right so imagine you know, this is the way this is set up is imagine like you can't do a dental exam on everybody.

568
01:09:53,490 --> 01:10:03,900
amondul: That would be the gold standard right doing dental exam to determine the presence of plaque but then you want to screen for dental plan, and so this way you do that, as you kind of asked them about like.

569
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:12,090
amondul: How often they brush so in this case regular tooth brushing was defined as twice per day or more an irregular was less than twice per day.

570
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:27,600
amondul: And then the gold standard was the presence or absence of dental plaque on a screening exam or on a dental excuse me so then question one, given that the screening question you're asked about the frequency of daily tooth brushing irregular irregular which one.

571
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:35,610
amondul: Was which was sponsored you use as a positive screen for the presence of dental plaque so we're going to start middle today and go with group three.

572
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:41,520
Abby Sossen (she/her): Is that as.

573
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:43,380
amondul: I don't know.

574
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:58,410
Abby Sossen (she/her): I was so we said that he regular will be our positive screen for dental plaques.

575
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:05,070
amondul: that's right, so this is a little weird right it feels a little strange to figure this out so, then you were asked to set up.

576
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:20,370
amondul: This two by two table with data from the table above table, one that you were given and then you're supposed to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the question about tooth brushing against the gold standard, so in this case you've got plaque yes, so this is.

577
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:27,750
amondul: The gold standard is yes here and plaque know so it's regular brushing is like.

578
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:34,080
amondul: I can't make this table different than it is, but if I make it no no okay.

579
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:39,990
amondul: There we go So what if we write screen positives there.

580
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:42,930
amondul: Right, and this is.

581
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:51,180
amondul: screen negative does that help a little bit this is gold standard positive and gold standard negatives.

582
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,950
amondul: Alright, so this table confused a few people, but we, I think we all work through it.

583
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:04,560
amondul: So if you went back up to table one in the question, it told you that a total of 415 had dental black.

584
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:23,070
amondul: It also told you that a total of 875 regularly brush their teeth and 274 irregularly brush their teeth, so that allowed you to put here, this is shown as a calculation, but you could have gotten the total of those with the gold standard, yes, from the table.

585
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:37,290
amondul: And then, this 247 and 875 come from that table as well, and I think that's part of the what was confusing is figuring out that these were the totals of the screen positive and screen negative as opposed to having anything to do with the gold standard.

586
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:54,990
amondul: Then you could go back up and realize that they said Okay, of those who brushed regularly to 92 had plaque and of those who brush irregularly 123 had plaque so, then you were able to build this in right black yes among those who test screen positive and screen negative.

587
01:12:56,130 --> 01:12:59,550
amondul: and the rest of it you're able to get by subtraction or addition.

588
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:05,370
amondul: Did anybody have trouble.

589
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:16,200
amondul: Did anybody get something different for their table again I don't think, so I think we were all coming into the rooms, making sure you guys got this part right, so the rest would be more straightforward.

590
01:13:17,190 --> 01:13:34,200
amondul: Alright, so then you're asked to calculate the sensitivity and specificity, so the sensitivity is the probability of screening positive, given that you truly have the disease, so that is 123 over 415 for 29.6% so that is not great right.

591
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,230
amondul: This is the interpretation.

592
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:52,650
amondul: And the SEC specificity, then, is among those with out the disease what proportion screens negative so that's 583 goes over 707 so 82.5%.

593
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,610
amondul: Any questions about that.

594
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:06,450
amondul: Okay group for do you want to tell me how you did the positive and negative predictive values.

595
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:16,650
They don't want to.

596
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:20,940
amondul: miss a group for.

597
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:26,730
amondul: Chelsea me.

598
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:27,810
Chelsey Kaasa: hey sorry.

599
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:43,470
Chelsey Kaasa: I remember, yes, I do not have the document in front of me but um let's see here, so we calculate it across so 123 divided by 247.

600
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,330
amondul: Okay, and I gave you.

601
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:49,470
Chelsey Kaasa: 49.8 right.

602
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:52,500
amondul: And then, for the.

603
01:14:54,480 --> 01:15:01,380
Chelsey Kaasa: yeah for negative 292 over original 583 over 875.

604
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:02,160
amondul: that's right.

605
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,980
Chelsey Kaasa: or an n PDF 66 points.

606
01:15:06,450 --> 01:15:07,050
amondul: So.

607
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:09,270
amondul: Can you interpret those for me.

608
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,470
Chelsey Kaasa: And so.

609
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:15,660
Chelsey Kaasa: Those lists.

610
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:27,930
Chelsey Kaasa: A regular brushing or a positive screening had a 49.8% chance of having plaque on IBM.

611
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:34,140
Chelsey Kaasa: And then, for the MTV.

612
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:38,040
Chelsey Kaasa: 66.6.

613
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:55,800
Chelsey Kaasa: Okay, those those that with regular brushing or a negative screening exam had a 66% chance of not having black.

614
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:57,900
Chelsey Kaasa: moon.

615
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:00,210
amondul: that's okay good job you did it.

616
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:03,120
amondul: So.

617
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:10,050
amondul: Question for so this would be group five What did you guys think for the strengths and weaknesses of the screening test for us in this population.

618
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:14,070
restraints, he said that just in general.

619
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:15,780
it's.

620
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:19,440
amondul: Totally died so most.

621
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:25,230
amondul: Most children whose mothers report having.

622
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:29,040
don't have a black.

623
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,230
Mark heavy regular.

624
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:36,150
yeah also just in general, the screening is relatively.

625
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:40,260
amondul: easy to do easy accessible and expensive.

626
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:43,470
there's not really a Christ dress Piper.

627
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:47,040
On the self important people.

628
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:57,990
Is self report or indirectly, the monitors, there must be bias.

629
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:09,240
amondul: lot of great information yeah they may not be reporting correctly yeah the sensitivity for this little yeah sensitivity is really about also the positive predictive value right.

630
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:10,920
amondul: it's pretty low.

631
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:13,770
amondul: Great.

632
01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:27,090
amondul: Alright, so this is group one now if the prevalence of dental plaque doubled in the population with a sense of the specificity and positive predictive value be expected to increase decrease or stayed the same comment for each one.

633
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:33,300
Will Brodwater: yeah so I was in group one so for the positive predictive value.

634
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:46,140
Will Brodwater: We said that it would increase with an increased prevalence as it increases the numerator and as the disease prevalence increases the likelihood that your positive test is truly positive but also increase.

635
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:56,460
Will Brodwater: And then for sensitivity and specificity, we said that they would not change because they are measures of the test itself and a measure of the prevalence in the population.

636
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,140
amondul: Right very good.

637
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:07,500
amondul: exactly right and this kind of describes a little bit more in detail how people are moving around as the prevalence increases if that helps you out.

638
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:08,970
amondul: job.

639
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:27,180
amondul: All right, group to if the screening questionnaire was revised to define regular tooth brushing brushing once per day or more were originally it was defined as twice per day, what would the impact be on sensitivity and specificity and why.

640
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:31,740
amondul: isn't group to.

641
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:47,340
Sarah Ferri: So if the screen questionnaire was changed such that the regular brushing group was kind of a more broad question, and it would increase the overall end of the regular brushing group.

642
01:18:48,210 --> 01:19:01,890
Sarah Ferri: And so, if you are increasing the end of your regular brushing group, then you should see an overall decrease in your sensitivity, but increase in your specificity.

643
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:11,370
Sarah Ferri: And it's difficult to kind of talk about like positive predictive value versus negative predictive value what would happen is those variable.

644
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:21,780
Sarah Ferri: But overall you'll see a greater gap between your sensitivity and specificity it's just that gap will be different, depending upon how the numbers fall.

645
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:28,560
amondul: that's right, so this is about changing the cutoff right remember, we talked about creating a cut off point for your test.

646
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:35,970
amondul: They have the before the cutoff point was at two times and now we're changing the cut off to be lower at one time right.

647
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:45,570
amondul: So we're moving some of the people who were irregular brushes are now going to be called regular brushes so we're moving people down from the top row to the next row right.

648
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:56,400
amondul: So you're going to decrease your a which will decrease your sensitivity, as you said, and you're increasing your D, which is going to increase your specificity right so that's exactly what you said.

649
01:19:57,990 --> 01:19:58,890
amondul: That make sense.

650
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:00,780
amondul: Everybody.

651
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:11,880
amondul: All right, i'm going to go through a number seven because I think this was a bit of a fair bit of a beast for some people, this is a bit confusing.

652
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:25,590
amondul: So, then this is now about reliability so to test the reliability of the questionnaire to report tooth brushing behavior let's suppose that the regularity of tooth brushing was reported separately by the mother and father for a subset of 500 children from two parent homes.

653
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:40,890
amondul: So this is like the raider one raider to with the 40 means right, this is exactly that table except instead of 14 days we have 500 kids Okay, so the total in the table is 500 you can put that right down here in the bottom corner.

654
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:47,730
amondul: So fathers reported that 20% of the children did not fresh regularly so.

655
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:58,890
amondul: you've got your regularly your regular and regular brushing as reported by the mom in this column and irregular brushing and regular rushing as reported by the dad in these rows OK, so the data is the rows and the mom is the.

656
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:03,900
amondul: Is the columns I think the problem, the most people ran into is.

657
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:16,200
amondul: When this piece here fathers reported at 20 20% of the children did not fresh regularly that is talking about this marginal right because we're only talking about what the dad did we're not then breaking it out by mom yet.

658
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:28,170
amondul: Okay, so dad's reported that 100 kids brushed irregularly because that's 20% of the total so, then you can figure out pretty easily that they've therefore said 400 if that brushed regularly.

659
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:37,890
amondul: and mothers reported a 25% of the children not brushed regularly so, then you can get this marginal for the moms so 25% of 500 is 125.

660
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:54,330
amondul: And then, by subtraction you can get this okay so then you've got the whole outside of your table filled in and then you're given this for 350 children both parents reported regular brushing so, then you know that this cell here has to be 350.

661
01:21:55,500 --> 01:22:07,140
amondul: The rest of it, you can get by doing subtraction right once you have, if you have all of your marginals and one of these intermediate cell she gets a tractor and get all the rest of them does that make sense.

662
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:12,030
amondul: Any questions about that.

663
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:26,640
amondul: Alright, so once you have this table set up, then you can easily calculate the percent agreement right so that's just the 75 and the 350 those are the green cells.

664
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:35,370
amondul: were both on the desk your regular and both mom and dad separated when you add those together for your numerator your denominator is 500 so you get 85% agreement.

665
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:40,470
amondul: Okay.

666
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:52,740
amondul: So number eight says to check the repeatability of the gold standard let's suppose that the authors had a subset of children undergoing oral exam by two different dentists.

667
01:22:53,310 --> 01:23:03,030
amondul: let's say they developed a Kappa statistic of point nine one for the agreement between dental leaders So what does that say about the gold standard what this is we're back to group.

668
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:07,920
amondul: Three I think we're back around to group three So what did you guys say here.

669
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:24,750
Joshua Tucker: Like just gotten there, but basically the gold standard is not a whole lot better than parents ability right to detect.

670
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:31,650
amondul: Well, the agree so it's this is this talking about validity, so you seem to be suggesting.

671
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,300
amondul: Is this validity or is this a reliability measure.

672
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,280
Geehan Suleyman: or liability much more.

673
01:23:38,370 --> 01:23:39,390
Joshua Tucker: alive right.

674
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:51,870
amondul: that's right, so the gold standard test we're asking we're not saying is that correct like and we actually we're not saying whether the parents were correct because, in order to assess validity, we would be comparing it.

675
01:23:52,560 --> 01:24:01,500
amondul: The parents rating against the gold standard right which is not what we were doing here, we were just saying if we asked mom and we asked dad did we get about the same answer and, yes, we did we got pretty good agreement right.

676
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:12,270
amondul: So here we're saying Okay, so if we have now let's check and see if our gold standard the other piece of that original table is reliable right So if you have two dentists.

677
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:22,020
amondul: say whether the kid actually has plaque do they agree so with a Kappa statistic of point nine one, do you think that the dentists agree about the gold standard.

678
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:38,610
amondul: Yes, I agree, so I think there's an excellent agreement beyond the agreement based on chance alone right so now you have a cap of statistics, so you can actually say they have excellent agreement beyond the agreement expected by chance, alone, this is a very precise gold standard instrumental.

679
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,460
amondul: very reliable.

680
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:44,610
amondul: Okay.

681
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:57,900
amondul: So this is kind of getting of what we were just talking about what josh would consider your answer for eight does this mean that the validity of the gold standard is necessarily high and that's not true right.

682
01:24:58,350 --> 01:25:07,500
amondul: Just because the reliability of a test is high doesn't mean the validity is also fine it's possible to have a very highly reproducible test is not accurate right.

683
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:11,040
amondul: That would be like our.

684
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,810
amondul: Our bullseye.

685
01:25:20,730 --> 01:25:26,460
amondul: Right remember are very repeatable all of our little arrows are stuck up here.

686
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:34,860
amondul: it's very repeatable because they're all clustered together but they're not clustered together on the bullseye right so it's not valid it's very repeatable.

687
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:39,120
amondul: Okay.

688
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:43,440
amondul: Ray are you talking because you're muted.

689
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,950
amondul: you're talking to yourself okay.

690
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:48,930
amondul: fair.

691
01:25:50,670 --> 01:25:52,230
amondul: Does that make sense to everybody.

692
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:55,740
amondul: Okay.

693
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:05,040
amondul: Any other questions about today's material or the exercise.

694
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:16,860
amondul: Okay, in that case let's talk briefly about next week Monday is the exam review.

695
01:26:18,330 --> 01:26:21,090
amondul: If you go to i'm going to share my screen again.

696
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:26,550
amondul: share my screen if you go to monday's.

697
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:35,070
amondul: Class Monday July 18 click here there are practice problems and answers that are both available to you.

698
01:26:35,670 --> 01:26:51,480
amondul: i'm just working through these practice problems over the weekend is a great idea, because if you get them wrong, we can go over the answers together and clarify anything that doesn't make sense, these are really good way to prepare for the exam they're very.

699
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:55,080
amondul: indicative of the kinds of questions that will be on the real estate.

700
01:26:56,130 --> 01:27:06,060
amondul: Okay, that probably will not take the whole time so I also have a lecture for you about publicly available data, this is a little preview for alley of the class that she's going to be taking in the fall.

701
01:27:07,110 --> 01:27:11,610
amondul: So it is a class that I teach in the residential program and I think it's actually a really useful thing.

702
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:22,860
amondul: we're going to go through a bunch of different publicly available data sources that many of you may or may not be familiar with enhance purpose DHS so you're going to hear it data so i'm going to tell you kind of about those give you a little overview.

703
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:39,270
amondul: If we have time, but if you guys want to take the whole time to review for the exam we can do that too, so that is like if it doesn't usually it does not take the whole time, I will say so, that is to to give you a little bit of enrichment for the time the other time to say is the exam.

704
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:45,720
amondul: I we're not going to come in person for the exam because it is online I think that's a little silly for us to sit in this room.

705
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:54,660
amondul: On zoom with you, so we will have a day off from coming in, and we will be on zoom during the exam one of us will be on zoom during the exam to answer questions if you have.

706
01:28:00,330 --> 01:28:01,530
amondul: Any questions about that.

707
01:28:04,710 --> 01:28:05,760
amondul: Even if you're not.

708
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:06,990
Abby Sossen (she/her): Taking this for credit.

709
01:28:07,170 --> 01:28:13,590
amondul: I do, encourage you to take the exam I think it's a good way to kind of see where you're at like with understanding material.

710
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:23,310
amondul: And even if you choose not to take the exam I think running through the review problems is a really good way to kind of see where you're at as well.

711
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:25,770
Abby Sossen (she/her): I am I question i'm.

712
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:30,450
Abby Sossen (she/her): taking it for credit do we get to use any like formulas or anything.

713
01:28:31,290 --> 01:28:32,700
amondul: open its open book.

714
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:34,860
amondul: So you can lose your materials.

715
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:39,630
amondul: That is not a problem open book open notes yeah.

716
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:44,070
amondul: No one needs to memorize anything.

717
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:47,970
amondul: I don't have it memorized if I need to.

718
01:28:49,710 --> 01:28:54,930
amondul: Do something all look at my notes so don't expect anything different from you.

719
01:28:56,010 --> 01:29:04,290
amondul: I mean, I have some of that memorized you know just because i've done it for years, but like by accident, I have some of that memorized how about that.

720
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:07,950
amondul: Okay.

721
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,550
amondul: Any questions.

722
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:19,920
amondul: Going once going twice alright everybody have a great weekend and get outside get some sun.

723
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:28,050
amondul: And, but not too much because I probably skin cancer were no fun at public health people were just no fun ruin everything.

724
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:36,450
amondul: But yeah sounds great and exactly go outside enjoy your weekend and I will see you all on Monday.

725
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:37,710
amondul: Oh.

726
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,350
Divya Manohar: My God.

727
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:42,240
brenda.w.campbell: I thank you.
