1
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,390
There's so many good takeaways in this module. Yeah, I totally agree.

2
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:36,250
This content really dug into thinking about how we teach and how we create anti-racist environments that disrupt unjust hierarchies.

3
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:43,240
I have to also say that it really resonated with me to be thinking about these different levels of classroom, institution and broader community.

4
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:49,660
I certainly see that in my own classroom. What's happening outside the classroom walls definitely impacts my students.

5
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,280
We need to be working not just on our own classroom environments, but the context beyond that.

6
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,330
I totally agree. We don't teach on an island.

7
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:05,170
The policies and practices of an institution may actually prevent us from being able to fully create anti-racist spaces for our learning environment.

8
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,239
Right. Right. It's hard to think about an anti-racist learning environment that exists within an

9
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,040
institution that might have admission policies that exclude certain marginalized groups,

10
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,320
or that has an abysmal record of hiring faculty who are black, brown or indigenous scholars.

11
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:26,320
So we need to be working in the classroom, but also outside of it, to bring anti-racism principles to the forefront.

12
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,980
Yeah, it's hard to ask for, but really mandatory for us to think as anti-racist teachers outside of the classroom.

13
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,020
Absolutely. Should we keep moving?
