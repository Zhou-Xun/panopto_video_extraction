00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:16,360
Budgeting can be defined simply as planning for how much money you have and how it is spent.

2
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:28,750
A budget is a detailed plan expressed in dollar terms for how resources will be obtained and how they will be spent during a specific period of time,

3
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,260
such as a month, a quarter or a year.

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,500
Here is a simple example of a budget for an individual or a family.

5
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:45,850
The budget first lists the sources of projected revenues or income for the individual or family.

6
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:52,510
It then lists the projected expenses such as rent, utilities and groceries.

7
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:59,890
At the bottom, the budget lists the difference between projected revenues and projected expenses.

8
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:08,300
The purpose of budgeting for an organization is essentially the same as budgeting for an individual or a family.

9
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:19,460
Managers in an organization use budgets to plan and communicate their expectations for how resources will be obtained and how they will be spent.

10
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:30,810
Budgets are also an important tool for senior managers to establish performance goals and to monitor operations to ensure that those goals are met.

11
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:39,780
The complexity of organizations, especially large organizations, makes the budgeting process difficult and time consuming.

12
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,490
Managers must make several decisions regarding the budgeting process.

13
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,340
First, managers must decide how the budgeting process should take place.

14
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,520
That is how the budget should be developed.

15
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:06,010
In the bottom up approach, budgets are developed first by department or program managers and then aggregated and approved by senior managers.

16
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,710
In the top down approach.

17
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:19,840
Budgets are developed by the finance staff and then after approval by senior management sent to department and program managers for implementation.

18
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:30,680
Second, managers must decide whether to use the previous budget as a starting point for creating a new budget or start with a clean slate.

19
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,010
Under conventional or incremental budgeting,

20
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:43,970
each line in the previous budget is examined and then adjustments are made to reflect changes and circumstances when developing the new budget.

21
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:51,729
Under zero based budgeting managers begin with a budget of zero and must justify

22
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:57,940
every line item in the new budget based on the expected volume of services provided.
