1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:06,260
I think my friend from Iowa called and I was like, Yeah, I can't see right now.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:13,690
And that's when I get a ticket that it's like, she wants to send them something that's great.

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:25,850
And that's just me, which is didn't happen to me, but I just felt like mostly kosher and like that was what I was doing as well.

4
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,560
Like, I think I actually have just signed tickets on Facebook.

5
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:42,960
So this was like I think Monday after Monday, everybody had a good weekend.

6
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:57,390
So today we're going to be talking about the politics, the security, how it's assessed in this country and as part of our nutrition monitoring.

7
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:10,680
Right before we actually get started in the topic, I just wanted to remind everyone that on Wednesday,

8
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,110
Sterling Bowman Randall is going to be visiting us virtually via Zoom.

9
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:26,189
We are going to be in class in person, but she'll be virtual one of the staff from Keep Growing Detroit,

10
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,610
really wonderful randomization out of Detroit.

11
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:40,290
And if you are not familiar with this organization, please Google and Review in preparation for Wednesday.

12
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,610
Also the background sections do on Friday at noon in your extra days.

13
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:57,510
I've had a couple of questions about the background section over the weekend, and one question was,

14
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,710
will you students get deducted if it ends up being a little longer than a page and a quarter?

15
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,979
You know, I don't have any page limit or word count on this one.

16
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:21,570
So now there's also the section where you are working on your social determinants,

17
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:37,830
how social determinants link to your nutrition issue and if you just have broadly health as your topic of your community assessment.

18
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:50,620
You know, obviously health is broad. So you are still likely to find papers that are going to be discussing the links between social determinants,

19
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:58,570
such as unemployment, income and so forth, that are linked to how or they may be linked to specific health issues.

20
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:11,740
That's fine. And those of you who have more broad topics, that's fine if you're finding citations that are maybe a little bit more specific topic.

21
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:27,520
Also, there's no concern of you having more citations than what line any more citations is better as moving forward,

22
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,440
as professionals, it's really important that you provide citations in your professional documents.

23
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:42,520
Now, this document is really more of a document for you, as you'll see when we start actually working on the actual needs assessment.

24
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,230
But it's still important for you during your next two years to get in the habit

25
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:59,080
of stating definitive statements and and share with you that as a professional,

26
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:07,779
I will. It drives me crazy when I read articles or professional paper that's put out by an organization

27
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,520
or a white paper where these definitive statements are made and then there's no citation.

28
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:22,090
So as the reader, you then can't go to, you know, the source in which they make this definitive claim.

29
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:29,830
So and, you know, oftentimes, if it's something of interest, you want to know where that source is so that you can read more about it.

30
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:37,330
So and I also would encourage you to think about it. It's not just for other professionals to read, but people in the public, you know,

31
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:44,620
community members that may live a layperson, they might want to learn about more about, you know, what you're writing about.

32
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,549
And it's really important to provide those citations.

33
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:58,910
So when in doubt. And then just thinking moving it, like looking ahead.

34
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:09,300
In fact, this morning, Monday, October 3rd, we're going to begin data collection.

35
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:19,740
I'm going to introduce you to the U.S. Census Bureau. Walk you through how to access data in the Census Bureau so that you can get started.

36
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:27,120
And I would like you to actually get started in class. So please bring a laptop or tablet or whatever you can.

37
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:37,710
You use that. You can easily access the Internet, access the U.S. Census Bureau, so that you can start downloading some of this.

38
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:47,340
Well, I say download it lose turn, but start extracting identifying data that you can then put into a table or figure.

39
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:53,380
And if you do not have a laptop that you readily bring, oh, so much.

40
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,530
If you just go out this door, go past the stairs, there's an office straight ahead.

41
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,330
That's a student engagement. I always forget engagement and practice.

42
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,040
They can you can check out a laptop from that. It's on a first come, first serve basis,

43
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:19,110
but you can check out a laptop and then I'm going to be available after class if anybody has questions about their background section.

44
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,040
And just again, if you didn't see the announcement, the rubric,

45
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,020
which is a very basic grading rubric compared to the one you have for your food for thought.

46
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,750
And an example of a background section is on course resources on the home page.

47
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:41,200
Okay. So okay. Any questions before I move on from what I've just covered here.

48
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:53,750
Okay. So learning objectives today, just to explain the purpose of assessing food security,

49
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,640
how do we define food security or food insecurity in this country?

50
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,339
What state agencies or not state,

51
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:12,350
but what agencies are involved be able to describe the actual survey format and identify health risks associated with food insecurity?

52
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,720
So you've seen this figure multiple times.

53
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,379
This is, again, the framework of nutrition monitoring in the U.S. And so it's up at the top where we

54
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:32,240
have a number of factors that are part of our assessment surveillance in this country,

55
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:43,090
one of which is food security. Okay. Okay.

56
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,160
So I'd like to think about well, have us think about what do we mean by food security?

57
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,890
And sometimes it's hard to you know, if I say, well, how would you define food security?

58
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:01,540
It's a bit much. So instead, you can also think about what words would you associate with food security?

59
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,890
Thank you. Sorry. So just go ahead and just shout out.

60
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,620
What words do you associate with food security access?

61
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,390
Okay. Assets. Living wage.

62
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,470
Living wage. Eternally dense food.

63
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,960
Okay. What does contamination?

64
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,280
What's better? Health. Environment? Okay. Yeah.

65
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:41,370
Nutrition. Security. And sufficiency.

66
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,180
Deficiency and sufficiency. Sufficiency. Okay.

67
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:55,070
Yeah. Are there specific words or phrases that you think should be included in a definition of security?

68
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:12,820
Affordable? Yes, it's really tied to money and security type time and resources and money.

69
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,960
Like everybody. Like, yeah, everybody gets. Yeah.

70
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,469
I was just thinking that myself. When I ask the question, I thought for.

71
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,710
All right. For all. For every community member.

72
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:34,250
Yeah. Yeah. Any other words or phrases that you think should be in the definition for equality?

73
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,849
Yes. Yeah. Which links to for all. But.

74
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:42,590
Yes, but being very conscious about equitable.

75
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,150
Yeah. Okay.

76
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:02,560
So this is the food security definition from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, food security.

77
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:07,930
And we assess really at the household level in this country.

78
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,270
So food security for a household means access for all members.

79
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,370
At all times, which is actually a really good point.

80
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:28,200
Right. It's not just sporadic if at all times enough food for an active and healthy life.

81
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:47,550
You'll note that hunger and. Why might that be?

82
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:54,140
Because hunger is more individualized to the person rather than to a household or broader community.

83
00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:05,240
It's more individualized. Yes. And there's one other important piece about hunger that is can be tricky when it comes to definition.

84
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,290
It's hard to like food security, something we can measure if it's set like this.

85
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,320
But you can't really measure hunger on a broad scale in a community.

86
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,569
Right. Why is that? What is it about hunger? Subjective.

87
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:25,880
Perceived? It's subjective. Right. Because it's it's physiologic in a way, to some degree.

88
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,730
Right. You know, I mean, how do we define hunger? Well, all of us probably have a different description for me.

89
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:41,120
Hunger is like my stomach starts growing. And, you know, we all have different sensations of hunger and that's just sensations of hunger.

90
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:46,010
There's other aspects of the definition of hunger that would come into play.

91
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:52,639
So this was a recommendation from the Academy back in 2006,

92
00:11:52,640 --> 00:12:02,540
when the Academy was tasked with reviewing how the United States assesses food security or insecurity in this country.

93
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:10,220
And one of the recommendations was to make sure that hunger was not part of the definition because of this difficulty.

94
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,930
And how do we define hunger? Yeah.

95
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:28,300
Now, that's not to say that that that hunger is not included in some definitions in some organizations and agencies, maybe globally may tackle that.

96
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:36,760
But that was just the recommendation that came out of our National Academies in terms of our surveillance of food security in this country.

97
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:47,540
So food security includes, at a minimum, the ready available of nutritionally adequate and safe food.

98
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:54,530
So we've been talking about nutritionally healthy, dense foods, but that's an important point, that the food is safe.

99
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,030
What do we mean by that point? It's not spoiled.

100
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,270
Right. I mean, that's really what it comes down to. Yeah.

101
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:13,520
I was trying to think if there was something else to add to food, save, you know, save food now.

102
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,100
No contamination. Right. No contamination.

103
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,840
Yeah. I can't think of anything else to add to say food as we've been used to eat,

104
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:38,470
and also that a person should be able to acquire food in a socially acceptable manner.

105
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:45,610
Right. We should not have to say we folks should not have to scavenge food in this country.

106
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,580
Right. Just to cope with food availability.

107
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,920
So again, it comes down to adequate and safe foods that can be acquired in an acceptable manner.

108
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:13,120
And reasonable standards. So the definition of food insecurity by defined by the Department of Agriculture is limited or uncertain.

109
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:24,190
Availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods for limited and uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in a socially acceptable way.

110
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:37,299
I just wanted to include this was a definition defined at the World Food Summit in 1996,

111
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:44,890
which is still used in sort of international and global applications.

112
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,339
Food security at the individual household, national,

113
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:56,770
regional and global is achieved when all people at all times have physical and economic access to sufficient,

114
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:01,210
safe and nutritious foods again for an active and healthy life.

115
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,770
Which is an important point, right?

116
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:11,890
It's not just food for intake. It's food for a healthy life.

117
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:26,510
Okay. So in the U.S., we have I am going to show you the actual survey.

118
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:33,500
You're not going to see it really well, but it's really easy to access online from the USDA website.

119
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:42,110
But we have a continuum here of high food security that ranges from high all the way down to very low.

120
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:51,530
Okay. And I just want to go through these individual category categories.

121
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:06,410
As part of our discussion. So so high food security is where households have no problem or anxiety in accessing adequate food.

122
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:18,950
Marginal security is when households have problems or anxiety at times about accessing adequate food.

123
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:24,920
But the quality, quantity and their variety was not substantially reduced.

124
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:38,030
So these categories come about based on the number of affirmative responses to this survey.

125
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:45,160
So marginal security is for individuals who responded.

126
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:58,250
On at least one or two of the survey questions affirming that they have struggled or experience anxiety in accessing food.

127
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:08,330
So marginal means they've responded one or two times in that survey, affirming that they've had concerns about food access.

128
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,630
Yeah. How is quality assessed?

129
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,290
Is that like based on the individual survey responses?

130
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:31,230
What if they think the quality of their it's their perception.

131
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:39,540
And you know, I'll show you you guys. I mean, it's it's a long survey, especially if it's children involved, but it's worth while.

132
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,719
Taking a look at the survey, all the links are on the slides.

133
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,870
It's worth popping in. It's not hard to get to.

134
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,000
And just take a look at the survey questions.

135
00:17:50,520 --> 00:18:00,990
I wanted to just do a quick shout out about marginal food security, because one of the things is you'll note that, well, let me take a step back.

136
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:09,810
So in this country, we assess we we assess food security, food insecurity in this country every year.

137
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:17,670
And there's a published report every year. So the data that I'm showing you is the published report for 2021.

138
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,600
So we have data every year on food security.

139
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:26,129
You will note that we don't report on marginal food security.

140
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:32,010
It's only food secure or low or very low food security.

141
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:44,520
And I really I wanted to just highlight that there's been some research to demonstrate that even if folks reply

142
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:53,610
respond one on one or two of the survey questions an affirmative that there is anxiety or concern about food access,

143
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,680
even if their food intake quality and quantity has not changed.

144
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:08,250
The fact that they are anxious about food access has been shown in research to result in adverse health outcomes.

145
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,910
Okay. So it impacts both children and adults.

146
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,740
So for children, there's lower test scores.

147
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:25,070
There's a higher risk of fair to poor child health.

148
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:35,090
And that's also been noted in adults and also higher rates of mothers experiencing depressive symptoms.

149
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:41,980
So I think this came from an article that is on campus.

150
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:51,290
It's one of your required readings. It's not very long, but please be sure to review it if you did not have time to do that again.

151
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:56,120
This is relevant. This is all about this marginal security.

152
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:03,200
Category. And we don't talk about marginal food security very much.

153
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:17,020
And then the last two categories are low food security, which, if any caregiver or whoever is responding to the survey indicates three or more.

154
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:32,600
Responses that are affirmative, that there is anxiety and concern, an adequate food, access or intake, then they are considered food insecure.

155
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:43,310
And the difference between low and very low just depends on how many responses that are again affirming that they have concern about food access.

156
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:58,280
The difference between low and very low is that in low food security, the quantity and normal eating patterns were not reduced.

157
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:12,630
There may have been a reduction in the quality and variety of food in their diet, but quantity and eating patterns were not impacted.

158
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:21,729
Very low food security means quality, quantity and eating patterns were disrupted.

159
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,680
That means they went without meals.

160
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:37,960
And so that's the distinction between those two categories is that very low means quantity was impacted and so they had to skip a meal or two.

161
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:57,290
And so. I know you guys probably can't see this very well, but it's it's more just a reminder and you can access the the survey itself.

162
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:04,910
But the first questions one through ten are answered by the caregiver of the household.

163
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:12,290
And those are adult questions. Those are getting at, in general, the adults.

164
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:18,260
And if there are children in the household,

165
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:30,170
then we have an additional set of questions that results in the survey being 18 questions in entirety or in its full length.

166
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:37,490
So again, this is if a household is just comprised of adults, they fill out one through ten.

167
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:44,210
If there are children in the household, then they have to move on and complete the rest of the survey.

168
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:49,370
And this addresses food security relative to the children.

169
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:13,510
So the agencies involved in implementing administering the survey is the U.S. Census Bureau.

170
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:20,479
As well as the USDA and Economic Research Service.

171
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:27,440
So the Economic Research Service is this agency within the USDA.

172
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:38,320
So the U.S. Census Bureau is responsible for actually administering the survey, and so individuals are contacted.

173
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:43,729
Well, actually, the U.S. Census Bureau contacts people in our country on a monthly basis,

174
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:49,610
and they're getting labors, labor, unemployment, poverty statistics on a monthly basis.

175
00:23:49,820 --> 00:24:04,130
But in December, when they contact individuals, they also include the food security survey and.

176
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:13,549
They actually screen individuals first so that they reduce the burden because they're filling out so, you know, answering so many questions.

177
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:25,490
So there's actually a mini survey. I think it's just one or two questions to determine if there is food security concerns.

178
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:34,550
And if so, then they move them on to the full survey that you just saw on the previous slide.

179
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,950
And then the USDA, IRS is responsible for the actual survey methodology.

180
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:52,010
They do the data analysis and they put out the reports. And I did want to highlight so you can access these reports very easily through the IRS.

181
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,670
Again, there's this one doesn't have a link, but it's on the previous page.

182
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:01,100
I notice that they have a separate report for veterans that came out.

183
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,940
That was either last year, this year, but it was recent.

184
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,490
So they clearly trying to get at some subpopulation concerns.

185
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:24,620
So. These are the different surveys for assessing food insecurity or food security.

186
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,250
So the household food security is the one we just talked about.

187
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:35,240
And the adult food security survey module is just those first ten questions.

188
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:43,370
And again, if this children, then they have to complete the remaining questions for a total of 18.

189
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:52,880
There's a six item short form that is used in some applications, and this is just for adults.

190
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:03,799
There's certain other surveys that are conducted in this country where they also want to get at food security,

191
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:12,160
in addition to the questions that are specific to the survey. So they might include this six item short form and it might be used.

192
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:18,620
Researchers might use the abbreviated survey for their research purposes.

193
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,400
There's also is a food security survey module for youth 12 and older,

194
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:40,640
and it's been validated in stating that youths 12 years and older are able to

195
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:46,610
identify concerns about food access and so forth and anxiety regarding food.

196
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:54,680
So why why do you think there's a separate survey for youth when we have this survey

197
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:00,080
that if there's children all the way up to 17 years of age living in the household,

198
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:04,489
there's a whole second segment of the survey that includes questions about children.

199
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,410
So why don't we have a separate one for youth?

200
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:14,900
What would be the rationale or maybe what may have come out of research that justified the decline in the cracks?

201
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:21,950
So when who are concerned about really young children in a certain age and parents can see them as adults

202
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:32,960
with less concern for growth or calories or what the outcomes could be for not having announced it.

203
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:40,760
Yeah, that's exactly it. The younger children tend to be spared.

204
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:48,499
That's the way I want to say it in terms of food inadequacy or food insecurity.

205
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:55,700
Whereas the adults and the older children are the ones that are going to be more likely to skip a meal as opposed to the youngest.

206
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:03,200
Yeah. Yeah. And then. Then we also have the survey in various languages.

207
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:13,810
And again, this is just information about you. Okay.

208
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:19,240
So this is some data from 2000, the 2021 assessment period.

209
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:26,270
So here we have U.S. households.

210
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:31,449
Overall, there was no distinction between whether or not there were children in the household.

211
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:44,710
And we can see that 89.8% of households considered themselves food secure, whereas we had 10% of households.

212
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:51,940
Assessed. We're considered food insecure. How are households identified?

213
00:28:52,810 --> 00:29:01,450
There is a moral methodology of how the U.S. Census Bureau identifies because

214
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:05,620
it needs to be random and it needs to be representative of the whole nation.

215
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:13,809
So if you're interested in that, I was just wondering, like specifically for people who may not have like a permanent address or any address,

216
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:20,080
like, yeah, how or if there's any way that they try to calculate or find ways to help people.

217
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:28,390
Well, so there is when you do so, there are statistical adjustments that are made with survey data.

218
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:38,410
I mean, there's a whole class on the statistics and survey methodology, but again, I can't remember off the top of my head.

219
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:48,040
But you should be able to access methodology of how that data is collected.

220
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:57,999
And you probably won't get it through the IRS. You'd have to go through the U.S. Census Bureau on its methodology of how it accesses you.

221
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,750
IRS might. But yeah. Yeah, that's a good question.

222
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:14,790
Yeah. So the nice thing about these reports is if you as a professional have to do any kind of presentation on food security,

223
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:21,480
they have nice tables and so forth that you can just use.

224
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:32,520
This is the pie chart for households with children.

225
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,850
So this is making a distinction here among households with children.

226
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:47,190
We see that food insecurity or food food insecurity is actually a bit higher in 12.5.

227
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,620
And I just want to explain the data here where it's broken down.

228
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,340
So it's a little confusing. I have to always go back. I forget year to year how this is always broken up.

229
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:08,760
But you see the statistic, food insecure adults, only a 6.3%, that is.

230
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:20,340
So in households that also have children, those households reported it was only the adults that experienced food insecurity.

231
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:23,930
The 6.2. Okay.

232
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:34,810
So the children didn't, but the adults did. In households with children.

233
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,819
6.29%. I said 6.2.

234
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,620
I met food insecure adults.

235
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:56,710
Only 6.3% is just talking about in households that have children in which the children, in addition to the adults, were food insecure at 6.29.

236
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:11,950
So it's almost half of the. And then of the 6.29, we see the breakdown of low food security and very low food security.

237
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:18,610
And so just to clarify how those stats are derived.

238
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:30,210
Or stratified. This just gives us a nice overview of the prevalence over time.

239
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:44,830
So you can see that. Food insecurity has been coming down over time, but we still need to break that 10% or 12.

240
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:57,920
So this is just for all households. And this, again, is households with children.

241
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:04,490
Yeah, I had a question about the earlier slide, but it also applies to this.

242
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,120
If I can go back to the pie, because I think the pie. You talk about this one.

243
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,390
No, sorry, I meant the graph. The first graph. Oh, this one. Yeah.

244
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:19,280
I was just thinking about COVID. I feel like a lot of the news I heard was just that food insecurity went up a lot during COVID,

245
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:26,390
so I'm a little surprised there's not more of a spike, especially when kids weren't in school and receiving school lunches.

246
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,810
So food insecurity went up for children. It did.

247
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,589
This is the one that is for all households. So we don't see that.

248
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:38,770
But if you look at the next one, I think it shows in this one right there, see where it goes.

249
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,120
So we see that sharp uptick over. Yeah.

250
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:54,470
And then we see the application, the various aid that came through in various manners from the federal government that ended up bringing down.

251
00:33:54,630 --> 00:34:04,430
Yeah. And that's why they break the stats up by all households versus households with children for that very reason.

252
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,900
Otherwise you would not have seen. Okay.

253
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:15,590
So that doesn't include marginal food security to the right, but for the marginal is lumped in with food insecure.

254
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:19,250
Yeah. That's why I'm saying marginal is not. That's what I'm saying.

255
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:22,720
That probably would have affected the trends within.

256
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,740
Right. If it had been. Yeah. Yeah.

257
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:36,510
So. Any other questions about these lines?

258
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:44,280
It's also important to note that food security status differs by groups.

259
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:54,850
Okay, so we see that households with children, we see a higher percentage versus if we just look at all households without that distinction.

260
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,930
Households with children under six years of age.

261
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:13,210
Households with children and which is headed by a female or a single mother, or it could be a single male.

262
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:20,560
So we see higher rates. If we see single caregivers is probably the best way to say that.

263
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:27,659
So we see higher rates of food insecurity with households with children in

264
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:34,070
which there's a single caregiver of women living alone and men living alone.

265
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:43,649
We see higher rates. We see higher rates in different ethnic populations as well as I think this makes intuitive

266
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:48,390
sense that households with income below a certain poverty cutoff we're going to see.

267
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:59,150
And given the fact that there's a specific publication out for veterans, I didn't get a chance to look at it,

268
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:05,120
but I'm assuming that's also one of our subpopulations that we're concerned about.

269
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,990
I wanted to just do a quick shout out for Feeding America.

270
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,730
This is an organization that it's all about.

271
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:27,200
Their mission is is improving food access, reducing food insecurity and equitable means.

272
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:37,670
And they they're also their partners are food pantries in many, many, many communities in the United States.

273
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,380
So this is a great resource. They have a research tab.

274
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:48,730
If you go all the way down to the very bottom of their website, you will see a research tab and it's useful.

275
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,229
There's a mind the meal gap,

276
00:36:51,230 --> 00:37:06,820
which has some great data that's in images on this map that's useful and helpful if you ever need a resource with food insecurity.

277
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:20,420
So and they have some really relevant reports, very timely reports, and they highlight some of the factors that contribute to food insecurity.

278
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:30,140
And you have one on your readings for today from Feeding America that was related to food insecurity at the county level.

279
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,150
So if you didn't get a chance to read that, please be sure to read it.

280
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:51,230
Okay. The next thing I just wanted to segway to is food insecurities, impact on health outcomes.

281
00:37:52,790 --> 00:38:07,100
So these are just some screenshots of articles on how food insecurity can impact both physical health and mental health in children and adults.

282
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:19,040
And there's also one, food insecurity and mental health status.

283
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:23,580
It's a global analysis of 149 countries. So it's not just in the United States.

284
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:31,460
I mean, this this this these links, these associations have been observed in other countries.

285
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:40,010
And then this is a table that this is their.

286
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:52,660
A nice kind of review of all the different health outcomes that are impacted by food insecurity.

287
00:38:52,670 --> 00:39:02,830
So on the far left or children and it ranges from asthma and behavioral, social, emotional concerns to,

288
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:14,140
you know, poor diet quality, it impacts educational outcomes, physical functioning.

289
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:23,500
It's a quality of life concern. And then we have adults in the center column and then older adults in the far right column.

290
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:30,040
So I don't think this is surprising to any of us. But anyway, I just wanted to put this up.

291
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,690
It's a nice resource also in terms of health outcomes.

292
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:50,469
So today you guys had a reading qualitative paper by one of our faculty member who just Cindy Logan was one of our faculty who just left this summer.

293
00:39:50,470 --> 00:40:04,330
She took a job at Harvard. But this is a very important paper because it it addresses the stress that children experience in food insecure households.

294
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:11,390
So what kind of. Of stress do children.

295
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:18,230
She has children experience that was highlighted in this article.

296
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:28,939
A lot of the children express that they are worried about their parents as well because it seemed like from reading it,

297
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:35,680
it seems like it's not fully talked about. Even so, kids like, I know it's going on and I'm worried.

298
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:40,790
Got a lot of anger and frustration.

299
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:48,820
A lot of anger and frustration. Yeah. Yeah. And embarrassment about their circumstances.

300
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:58,410
Yeah. Essentially it's it's heartbreaking reading these qualitative research papers on you.

301
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:07,290
That's true. Yeah. Just add on it. You know, I think there's also stigma when they compare themselves to their peers.

302
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:13,140
Yeah. Yeah. So stigma. Yeah.

303
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:21,250
So I got called like a 12 year old saying something like my like, what can I do to help?

304
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:26,380
You know, they felt like they have some responsibility in this situation.

305
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:38,360
They wanted to help. Now. I just wanted to read you a few quotes.

306
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:43,939
So they took the children's responses and then they broke them up into themes.

307
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:49,009
So there was worry about not having enough food, worry about the parent's diet and well-being.

308
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:53,270
So they were worried about their own parents diet and how the parents were faring.

309
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,300
Anger and frustration about not having enough food. Embarrassment.

310
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:08,610
The strain on the family dynamics. So, for example, the an example or a quote from one child said one time, I asked my mom, can she play with me?

311
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:13,830
And she said, not right now because she has work to do or she has work.

312
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:22,420
She has to work more than 12 hours a day. I feel like my parents are spending a lot of time with money and they can't spend time with us.

313
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:29,580
I feel kind of lonely and I just keep it inside. Sadness over not having enough food.

314
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:36,690
If the food runs out, I get sad a bit. Just sad. The kind of sad where you just want to try to be happy.

315
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:42,780
But you know, inside you're really sad about it. From the anger and frustration.

316
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:50,580
It makes me feel angry when I don't get food. I feel like an animal that's angry when he doesn't get food.

317
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:58,730
I feel like an animal that has to give food. When the fridge refrigerator is empty, there's nothing to eat.

318
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:03,360
I get really frustrated, especially when there's no ingredients for my sandwiches.

319
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:12,000
And then just worry about the parents. My dad doesn't look okay when he comes home from work.

320
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:19,990
He just looks tired. When my mom says she can't do it anymore work and hustling to put food on the table.

321
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,010
Sometimes I feel worried. And.

322
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:31,220
So what were some of the coping strategies that these children discussed?

323
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,700
In other words, how do they cope with food insecurity? I use like a lot of imagination games.

324
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:46,130
Yeah. Escape. Yeah. They use games and imagination to distract themselves from the situation.

325
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:50,480
You began normalizing it? Mm hmm. Yeah.

326
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:55,110
No. Plenty else.

327
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,070
Show appreciation to their parents. Yes.

328
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:08,780
So they show appreciation of what their parents are doing.

329
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:22,870
So there's some examples of. So children discussed appreciation they had for the parents in providing food and other resources for them.

330
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:29,880
Sometimes my parents just give me their food. I think it's actually kind of worth it.

331
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:34,600
It doesn't really matter which food you get. Let's just be grateful about it.

332
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:41,169
I don't care if I don't eat for a day. If I didn't eat for a week, that's when I would start saying stuff.

333
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:45,520
But 2 to 3 days is fine. We've been in rough times, but it's okay.

334
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:48,980
If it wasn't for my mom saving up food, I wouldn't be here.

335
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:57,900
I'd probably be in a grave. So, you know, this is, again, children appreciating what their parents are, you know, doing.

336
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:03,850
And in terms of children distracting or adapting.

337
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:12,280
This is one quote, I'm very adaptive. I just go along with whatever happens if I don't get dinner, it's fine because I know my mom is struggling.

338
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:17,349
My mom could afford lunch for me, but then she wouldn't be able to pay the bills.

339
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:34,200
And I'd rather have a home than a lunch. So this type of research is important because again, it wasn't known if children,

340
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:43,320
especially younger children, understood and how food insecurity impacts the children.

341
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:49,710
You know, we know that there is data out there in terms of it impacts their health.

342
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:54,870
We know that it can impact maybe their outcomes in terms of performance in school

343
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:01,590
and their perceptions and their knowledge and attitude about food insecurity.

344
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:05,819
So I think this is very illuminating of what these children are experiencing.

345
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:17,399
And it's you can imagine then the level of stress these kids are experiencing, whether it's just.

346
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,090
Leave it at that. Yeah, go ahead. I was going to excuse me I was going to say to you,

347
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:27,810
I think there's something to be said about having student or not students having kids kind of give their take just because

348
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:34,830
they're absolutely perceptive and maybe aren't necessarily feeling those social stigmas as much as parents might.

349
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:41,519
They're definitely feeling it in a different way about whether or not they can actually kind of like articulate the stigma,

350
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,970
I think is going to give a different perspective than a parent. Yeah.

351
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:55,860
Yeah. This made me wonder what are the long term consequences?

352
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:05,649
Kids, when they experience an adult at a young age, food insecurity with how they view food later on, you know, like what are the consequences?

353
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:12,100
Do they have disordered eating later on? Maybe food insecurity at a young age, you know?

354
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:18,010
Yeah, that's a really good question. That would be something worth, you know, just doing a search to see.

355
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,440
We know that there are some we know there are some adverse outcomes.

356
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:25,730
We just know that.

357
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:38,030
But in terms of like disordered eating much more, I thought, yeah, is this study just choosing to like mitigate like kids who don't cope with it?

358
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:42,829
Well, like, I feel like that's got to be a possibility where, like, they're not using their imagination.

359
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:51,409
They're not like, I don't know, like they're handling it worse then I feel like this is a very mature way to handle things.

360
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:55,610
I don't know if, but we don't know if all children have a way of coping.

361
00:47:55,610 --> 00:48:01,040
And that's what I'm saying. Like, this is a study to just find out what kids are experiencing.

362
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:05,810
Um, I haven't looked to see if Sandy's following up with, you know,

363
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:11,150
other research to, you know, given the outcomes from this, I wouldn't be surprised.

364
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:17,180
When was this published? This was published 2020.

365
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:20,600
So I am sure there's going to be a lot of follow up.

366
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:29,900
And for me, thinking about just, you know, what kind of interventions can be developed that specifically target the kids.

367
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,900
I mean, I think it's great that the kids can talk about it.

368
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:39,880
That to me seems like an important first step that they can articulate what they're feeling and.

369
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:50,620
But. I'm sure that's going to be some guidelines and recommendations for how can these kids be helped further?

370
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:59,670
Okay. I just wanted to also do a shout out.

371
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:08,810
Washtenaw County has a Food Policy Council and one of the working groups is this.

372
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:15,210
The Policy Section workgroup may address food security or food insecurity.

373
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:21,600
So for those of you that are really interested in policy, you can become active.

374
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:25,290
You can find one of the working groups and just volunteer your time.

375
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:32,160
We've had some students in the past that have volunteered their time in the Policy Council.

376
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:43,740
So we just wanted to do a shout out and just that this is an important group of individuals that,

377
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,940
you know, addressing some of these topics in nutrition.

378
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:52,740
So that's all I have.

379
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:58,530
Yep, that's all I have. Any questions or any comments?

380
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:05,520
Has anybody worked and any researcher in the community related to food security?

381
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:18,220
I think they're related to Feeding America. But in my hometown, we have the Northern Illinois Food Bank that directly gives the community.

382
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:22,680
Yeah. So most food pantries are going to be affiliated with Feeding America.

383
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:29,759
Yeah, I have absolutely no personal like I have not worked with them, but I wanted to plug them.

384
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,020
Is my sister's friend's friend.

385
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,520
Star, is it. Yeah. That's the shortest way to say it started a project called the Farm Link Project.

386
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,950
And what they did during COVID, which is something I never really knew too much about,

387
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:52,379
just because I don't have a ton of experience with like farm culture is they kind of like took

388
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:58,050
links between farms and either like food pantries or other groups like looking for food.

389
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:03,980
And they would kind of like bridge the link between all of the produce that was kind of just being thrown away.

390
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:10,620
And so all of that food that was being lost was now like found people that take it to places that would actually use it.

391
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:15,930
And I thought that was super cool. I also thought it was super cool that it's run by like a 22 year old.

392
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:20,940
But yeah, so they're and they, they kind of blew up during COVID.

393
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:25,919
So yeah, they're like a lot more of an actual organization than when I first heard about them.

394
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:33,090
They were like kids in a basement on their phones. So it's a really cool group and that is the case.

395
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:37,290
Well, it highlighted that some produce was just sitting in.

396
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:41,879
Yeah, you know, at farms because they couldn't take it or they had nowhere.

397
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,840
And, you know, it just it was, you know, we had all sorts of food chain issues.

398
00:51:46,860 --> 00:52:02,760
And so that really highlighted that issue segueing to that Monday, next Monday, before we get started on accessing data in the U.S. Census Bureau.

399
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:10,770
Sara and Michael Palmer from Bastrop Farm is going to visit the class virtually for ten, 15 minutes.

400
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:18,570
And so it's another wonderful volunteer opportunity. And we've got two of our second year students coming in to do a shout out.

401
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:28,200
And really just what made me think of it is Michael and Sarah are new to farming, which they will explain.

402
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:39,930
But in the short period of time that they bought a farm up in Fenton, Michigan, and are doing quite well, they are partnering with,

403
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:50,730
I think it's Trinity Health in one of the neighboring communities, and they're providing CSA boxes for low income individuals in that community.

404
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:59,920
So. The timing is perfect for us to be talking about this, given what we covered today.

405
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:09,069
You'll hear from Sterling Bowman Randall about urban agriculture, community gardens in Detroit.

406
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:14,590
And then Sarah and Mike will be talking on Monday briefly about their farm and what they're doing.

407
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:22,510
