1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:07,650
Right. That's a good, you know. Yeah.

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:15,210
Oh, right. From the fight to the polls and I look closer, like 130 in the morning.

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,840
Really? The lines like 6 hours. Oh, my God.

4
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:24,750
And where were you? Where did you hear the news? 6 hours.

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:31,680
I mean, it was super nice. Everybody was handing out food and cocoa and it wasn't snowing and freezing, thank goodness.

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,160
Well, it was really cold, but they gave us coats and blankets and.

7
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,700
Yeah, and it was. Oh, God, it was still so nice.

8
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:45,590
Wow. But it's. Very well.

9
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:53,490
Yeah. It's I mean, I think all the early reports are like it was very smooth voting overall.

10
00:00:53,500 --> 00:01:02,440
Like, I think it took a while, but it just also makes you think like anyway, well, that Proposition two, which was like the voting.

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:10,600
Yeah. In here seemed to pass like pretty widely, which I just think like, okay, let's just make it easier.

12
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,590
Yeah, like, let's just make it easier. So.

13
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:22,780
Yeah, I walked by, I did an absentee voting, and then I walked by our polling place, like, on my way home and, you know, saw some lines and stuff.

14
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:28,989
And I was just thinking, you know, I mean, like, it's awesome that you were dedicated enough to come off an airplane, you know what I mean?

15
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:35,500
But like, that is a really high level of dedication like that. Everybody has that or like that, you know, ability or all of those things.

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,370
So after a certain point, there was a lot of peer pressure. You can really, you know.

17
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:49,720
Oh, that's true. Right. They that's the same in like news came with a certain oh, you're so dedicated to my book.

18
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,450
You know, I like that's so funny but it's so funny.

19
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:04,240
Yeah. Yeah I can totally see that. I know some of these like, like, you know, like they'll really, really have to go after it on the news.

20
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,930
I mean, forever. Oh, my gosh.

21
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,260
Wow. Well, yeah, that's. That's. That's what.

22
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,870
Wow. Well, I'm glad. Yeah. So how was. What's the report?

23
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,900
How was APD? Guys for 30 seconds?

24
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,170
I think there are 50,000 attendees this year. 15,000.

25
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:34,160
Wow. So this. I think the more they try the complete convictions that are going to look like a building that.

26
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:41,260
What would you do? I was really happy that the Michigan.

27
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:50,880
There are 11 that exist within last. I it have to.

28
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,850
There were so many of them. They're all over that.

29
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,230
I wish I could. Simply significant fans.

30
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,690
Yeah. At the same time, they're interesting.

31
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,250
And then the colors are also super interesting to see when to be down.

32
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:31,280
What do your research. Mr. President.

33
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:39,700
It's like looking for happiness. But also it was amazing.

34
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,870
Amazing like looks does that everything was so good.

35
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:55,060
So I'm sure they also I don't know for everybody I knew that it was going to be really fun to play was.

36
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:07,300
No serious topic area. I want to read this book, but I.

37
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,989
The downside of the totally successful newsletters is no downtime.

38
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:27,270
No longer yet. And the posters are all covering the session in times like this.

39
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,990
Something. 616 poster sessions.

40
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:59,740
So depending on the. And what was the early investigators like?

41
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,260
And there was on this side they had stages and. We're.

42
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,980
To work with you as a patient is to be in that room.

43
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:32,770
So you just. So this whole time over here.

44
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:42,930
Something else that me. Kickstarter to.

45
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:56,720
Things, really. Because they didn't really know what to do about it.

46
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:05,920
And so that was like the one thing. Those two different squares as visit.

47
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:15,230
In at least the seven time. It's interesting to see from.

48
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,790
Computer. I'm not just interested anymore.

49
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:37,550
My point of view. All the company did in two years had to.

50
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,340
Yeah. I understand your. Based on.

51
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,930
And so. Prime Minister.

52
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:04,570
How? And it was very moving.

53
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,460
Professional. Right now, it's for you to give us money.

54
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:33,410
Director addressed that. Tennis players.

55
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:58,070
I think. If was their president.

56
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,340
But I think she's still. Because she's still. Classes can.

57
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,760
Because the. So I think maybe she.

58
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,650
They had that visual. At me. I mean, this is a huge compliment to New Yorkers.

59
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,960
She was out for seven years. Yeah.

60
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,570
It's interesting. This part time.

61
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:48,680
I mean that. But I know. MARTIN That's Twitter.

62
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,920
Which is also hard to find any minute. You're tired of hard.

63
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,430
But. Design the white round.

64
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,790
That's why most of my friends are so perfectly honest.

65
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,210
So it's time. I started being a manager and just.

66
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,490
It just keeps coming. It just keeps going like it's gone.

67
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:23,430
So, you know, you just get that, like, an appreciation for how much work you.

68
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:32,640
For lots of reasons. So. That's good. Well, I guess we can talk about peer review.

69
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,970
Actually, I was talking with my close up Sara,

70
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,479
who just so she had a has a post credit to the American Heart Association focused on like stress and trauma,

71
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,980
which is something that they are interested in. And they are like a little bit interested also in social determinants of health.

72
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:55,950
So if people have any kind of like outcome in that cardiovascular space looking at, they do some like training funding.

73
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:06,099
So if you're thinking like. F 31 and or you know, anyway, in her experience reviewing after we've kind of talked about NIH reviewing and things,

74
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:13,720
she just like I was a much harsher reviewer than like the people who are reviewing and they were discussed and she was reviewing trading grants.

75
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,440
And so she was like, I got to have more to say.

76
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,300
Like these things were like, not so good and getting scored really well.

77
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,219
So it was funny. This is like I had your voice ringing in my head about like, did they think about this?

78
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,580
Did they do this, that, that, that. So it was kind of a funny conversation.

79
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:37,780
And I was like, Yeah, like that's, that may be a good place to look for, you know, I don't know if we can, like,

80
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:46,210
spin anything, you know, just sort of it's another training opportunity and funding stream does do a lot of training funding.

81
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,330
So. Okay. So let's see.

82
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,470
So today Christie is going to come to us later. I think I said 1030.

83
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,930
She was like paranoid. She was like, wait, when is it?

84
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:09,100
So I wanted to just go through a little bit like assignment stuff just so we can think that through.

85
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:15,129
And then since the first one is peer review, it kind of fits well to talk about constructive criticism stuff.

86
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,140
So Christie, I'll talk about the prelim.

87
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:31,120
And then also, did you guys just get the email of like the Google doc version or the Google Drive version of the handbook?

88
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:41,280
Okay. So if if anybody has any kind of questions about that, I thought it seemed really good and helpful and like super accessible.

89
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:50,229
And but I think Christie, because she's the head of the doctoral committee, would just be, you know, there's questions about anything you can ask.

90
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:58,690
CHRISTIE So and I think that includes also, you know, the course selection questions that we had sort of before,

91
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,459
too, potentially so we can talk with her when she comes.

92
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:11,530
And then today what we'll do is we'll go over just kind of like peer review process, some examples and like responding to those peer review critiques.

93
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:20,469
And so again, I'm not sure if all of you have had the experience of meeting of doing that or leading those responses.

94
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,460
But I feel like there are some, you know, strategies to make it more manageable.

95
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:32,889
And then first, wanted to check in on the assignments. So I know this is like really wordy, but this is that your assignment?

96
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:41,890
And just to confirm for this group, we said that 1116, which is next week, we'll do a draft of the paper to your peer.

97
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:52,990
And then 1123, which is the day before Thanksgiving, and we'll send the review back to the peer and then the draft to me.

98
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,430
And I guess what I didn't put on here was also the peer review.

99
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:08,440
So like send me the day before Thanksgiving, your draft and your peers review of your draft and then I'll,

100
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:13,540
I'll look at those and you know, you can make comments too.

101
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,790
And this is just kind of a pasting in of the assignment stuff, but.

102
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,730
I just wanted to go through. These are kind of stories now up here.

103
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:30,160
These are like with regard to the topic. This is really like significance.

104
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,910
So what is the issue and why is it significant?

105
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:40,600
Like and I h style significance? Who is the population that you're thinking about?

106
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:49,870
And why is that important? And then this idea of what are the key variables that you'd be thinking about?

107
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:56,649
And I think the way a way to make them to think about like your your organizational

108
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:01,840
funnel of large to small is like the state the big question in the population.

109
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:10,480
And then you kind of like march through your conceptual model from left to right and person predictors to outcomes.

110
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:16,000
Or you could flip it and talk about the outcome first and why the outcome is so important and then talk about the predictors.

111
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:27,219
But it helps, I think just organizationally to kind of have like a paragraph on your outcome and

112
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,020
then kind of like click through each of the predictors that you're talking about.

113
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,930
And this is I think this is all on canvas. This is just a pre pasting.

114
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:49,540
Vis a vis criteria of like in niche terms I used to call it, and sometimes I think they still do rigor of prior work.

115
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,870
It's sort of like what if other people die? And like, why is it not a complete picture like that?

116
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,769
They measure things in a weird way. Did they not measure key?

117
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:07,750
Did they just not measure key variables that we think are important and then you want to kind of end with.

118
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:13,140
Almost abandoned with like, okay, because this work could have been better.

119
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:28,310
Here are the gaps. And then as a leader, thinking about like, okay, this writer has taken me through like the big picture of my public health issue,

120
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:36,380
who it's relevant for and what are relevant conceptual variables, you know, that drive this issue.

121
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:51,570
What's been done to date, like not exhaustively, but just some key big research papers that I've sort of done to date and where are the gaps?

122
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:55,650
And then this idea of leaving you as a reader with an understanding of like next steps.

123
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:06,160
Okay. And as your and so like as a reader, hopefully you can identify these pieces.

124
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,650
And then that idea of flow like just sort of being organized in the flow.

125
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,790
And then here I always talk about with that level of detail and like, it really depends on what you're writing.

126
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:24,909
Right. And so in this case, you want to have like a solid argument for why you should be looking at the variables,

127
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:32,340
you know, and look at and you don't need to say like all the exhaustive details of prior work.

128
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:41,829
But what I would say is that if we're going to point out gaps in prior work or like disadvantages or flaws or what they didn't do right then,

129
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,880
I would provide some detail on that because.

130
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:53,250
I think it's important to know, like, for, like, a more naive reader who not an expert in this topic, like.

131
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,969
You know, study X. Drew these conclusions.

132
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,560
But really, this is the only study in the field, and it's only based on 45 people, for example.

133
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,800
So I think that's kind of an area for like. Potential adjustment.

134
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,000
Like there's either way, too much detail or not enough detail. Like you're saying, it's a gap, but why is it a gap?

135
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,770
And then here, like just making sure you have references in between on that.

136
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:32,480
And then what I have people do is they like to name a strength and name an area for improvement, and that would be kind of a cross.

137
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,729
Any of those areas.

138
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:44,500
And then like one sort of suggestion or I think that suggestion can also be like a wonder, like, did you consider thinking about this or what?

139
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:52,510
You know. In a next step, maybe consider this like it can be kind of very broad and it's just the idea to kind of like

140
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,610
have someone else who's knowledgeable but not super topic knowledgeable give you that,

141
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:10,540
that type of feedback. Are there questions on that kind of flow?

142
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:23,560
That is a good question. I think that's what I've pulled up the canvas because I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

143
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:33,740
Sorry. So ignore these dates because they're now wrong.

144
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,960
Do I not have this here? Oh, I don't. But they don't have and I should have the page numbers.

145
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,500
Oh, but you know, it's because it's tied probably to the assignment.

146
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,090
So I'm guaranteed, okay, here. But I'm like, well, how does that line up with these numbers?

147
00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:03,150
So here's that final assignment. So 10 to 12 spaced, 10 to 12 double spaced pages.

148
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:08,510
So it's like really not that long. And it's kind of like a tight argument.

149
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:18,210
I would say that if you want to write more and like kind of have an outtakes version of like a bigger review, great.

150
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,990
But one of the goals for this is to make that type argument and not, you know.

151
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:32,020
Zach. That many pages. This final paper used to be a lot bigger and longer.

152
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:41,239
And I just feel like the goals. You can write a 30 page paper and it can be not that tight.

153
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:48,440
And then that's just sort of like you're filling 30 pages and that's kind of easier sometimes than making a tight,

154
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:53,450
good, clear, logical, organized argument, like in the short amount of time.

155
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:59,480
So that's why I just kind of shrunk it and were never given that much space like in the picture.

156
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,090
Right. Right. You're not like that. Yeah.

157
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:10,780
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And like, you know, when you're in a dissertations, it's going to be like the manuscript style.

158
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:17,029
So, you know, the whole thing, maybe 50 pages because you Methodism, all this stuff, you know, per paper or something,

159
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:22,550
because it's like going to be more comprehensive in dissertations than like for a manuscript, which is going to be even tighter.

160
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:32,990
But this is like, let's follow like one kind of core idea or research lead up to a more research question, and it doesn't have to be exhaustive.

161
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:44,300
So that is definitely the point. And these are also just kind of like prompting questions.

162
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:51,670
And I think the other important thing to note is like this paper is the literature review part,

163
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,270
this final paper, and then the presentation is like the methods part.

164
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,240
So that's why I guess that's another thing that I sort of split off because this literature review,

165
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,460
again, like if you want to take it further and make it like a,

166
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,120
you know, capital L Capital Hours literature review to submit for publication, I'm like, awesome, fantastic.

167
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,590
Like, that could take you in this direction.

168
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:29,730
And then I think every single person has made this final paper, that kind of foreground for their presentation, and that just makes sense.

169
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,850
They're kind of meant to go together.

170
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:43,780
So then I did want to also just say for the presentation and just I wanted to confirm these are the pairs, right, that you guys also have done.

171
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:57,640
I just want a picture. Okay. So and with the paper draft, I think that, you know, for the peer, you can certainly also put in notes like,

172
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:04,510
I'm going to review this, I'm going to, you know, but of course, you'll get better feedback the more complete it is.

173
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,160
And yes and yeah.

174
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,760
So the peer should be able to see that. What's the significance?

175
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:19,680
Why do we care and your population and then sort of like your general argument and what the gaps are going to fill, even if that's not all?

176
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,460
Totally. But like more than an outline.

177
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:34,200
Okay. Then wanted to just keep talking a little bit more about the presentation and

178
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,340
make sure that we are just sort of getting it cleared up where we're headed.

179
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:45,690
So in the presentations, you'll basically have kind of done this in the paper.

180
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:54,540
So as you guys all kind of did in the prior presentation, just give like an even briefer, like conceptual overview.

181
00:22:54,750 --> 00:23:00,000
If you have a conceptual model that you, you know, roughly walk through in your paper,

182
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,090
you can put that in the presentation to have us all get oriented.

183
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:11,120
Here's my variables. Here's like my question I'm going to do all this is like brief, you know, kind of like.

184
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:25,960
But in the presentation, this is all pretty brief. You do want to have like research plus the questions, questions and hypotheses if you have them.

185
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,110
I mean, it's like varies for everybody is everybody's piece, but that's sort of like the standard things.

186
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:41,010
And then what we really want to do, the presentations is might be able to have you present some ideas for how you would go about studying this,

187
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:52,589
what the method of research design would be, what the population is and like, what settings there in some type of measurement strategy.

188
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:58,379
Like I would measure these constructs with these measures that exist, which you don't have to do for your paper,

189
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:03,300
but like for premium, which is what Christina talked about, like you could stop.

190
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:11,910
It's both. So it's kind of like if you want to, you could do like this review paper, this presentation,

191
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:17,670
and those could be like a good basis for like pretty low if you are not like sick of the topic.

192
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:27,719
Or you could explore in this like two part series and then say, okay, I know now for prelim, I want to go over here and do it a different way.

193
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,320
So like, but just thinking about it, it's that same process.

194
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:38,090
It's like, what's the literature, what are the gaps? And then how can I study this in a reasonable, defensible way?

195
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,140
And then I think this will depend, like some of you guys might be like,

196
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,330
I'm going to I'm working on this study right now and I know I'm going to do it.

197
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:51,030
And I'm really going to just like use the measures that we have and talk about what's actually happening.

198
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,600
And for some people, it's much more like hypothetical and that's okay.

199
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:04,700
And I think this is why it's helpful to have more discussion time, because there's always multiple ways of doing a study.

200
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:11,800
There's never one perfect study. And I think that is like really hard for all of us to let go of.

201
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:24,470
But it's true. And so there's always going to be like an alternate way and sometimes usually in like an age grant applications and others,

202
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:28,520
you have to even put in a part that says like alternate strategies.

203
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,919
And, you know, their ultimate methods are something like that.

204
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:44,870
And you you basically say, like, I could have chosen to do an observational study of college student mental health across the nation to fill this gap.

205
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,000
But instead, I chose to focus on just using you as an example.

206
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:55,129
Like tribal colleges in Michigan and do a qualitative study because the gap is

207
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:59,930
around this funding for tribal colleges and they don't have this data to do that.

208
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,479
So like you could always go different directions.

209
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,940
And I think that's when we can all discuss and it's nice to have know a little bit about everybody's topics, you know,

210
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:13,370
do the peer review so that we can sort of generate ideas of a person who's like presenting,

211
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:19,250
you know, really can get to some extra thoughts about their topic.

212
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:25,880
And I say reality based as they think through the details and also reality based.

213
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:36,440
Reality based doesn't mean like you need to do this in six months, but it does mean like you don't have $25 million to do it right.

214
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:42,260
I know that this came up in my class too, but like they're doing an intervention study and I was like,

215
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:49,940
You're not going to go physically do this necessarily, but you could and so make it be something that you could potentially do.

216
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:57,389
And I do think it is good just always to have practice presenting the stuff and it's really

217
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,920
different to kind of present this background stuff I think compared to like the methods and stuff.

218
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:05,670
And so. A new data analytic plan.

219
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,620
I put that in there.

220
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:15,250
We're not going to get into like deep data discussion necessarily, but you want feedback like I think this might be a mediator or moderator,

221
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:25,290
but when I do want to talk about that too, and we could talk more broadly to say like, would you add a qualitative part to this?

222
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:31,590
You know, let's think, think what else is going to come up?

223
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:41,700
Yeah. Usually the discussion is like, Oh, you can do all these additional things. Um, yeah, exactly.

224
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,500
And then I think also, like all of you guys are kind of getting to know what is in your,

225
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:53,340
like, immediate grad school, like set of resources projects that you can be involved with.

226
00:27:53,340 --> 00:28:01,410
And then even if this is not necessarily on one of those projects specifically like thinking about ways,

227
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:09,540
I think in the discussion to be like these data are being collected or this project is happening and how could I,

228
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,880
you know, explore these ideas in the context of this project that's happening?

229
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:21,980
So it's kind of a good chance to like just brainstorm a little bit, which is fine.

230
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:33,800
Okay, so I know that's a lot of info and it's all on canvas and stuff and obviously just email me, but any particular questions?

231
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,800
Considerations. Presentation.

232
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:48,460
If we're presenting on the same day, how much time should. I might be in campus, but it's usually like around 40 minutes, 45 minutes.

233
00:28:49,330 --> 00:29:02,530
So then we can have discussions. So and I realize like we will have today and then I think we have a topic for one of the 13 science presentations.

234
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,490
Which is next week. Team science and data management.

235
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:16,870
I think it's kind of fun to talk about and play. And then we have Thanksgiving as a class and then we have reservations.

236
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:22,000
I know it's been a long time.

237
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,270
But. Yeah. But yeah.

238
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:36,170
So if anybody, you know, wants to check in for their updates, then, you know, just let me know.

239
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,720
We and we did confirm this. But you know what's going to.

240
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:58,290
First. James Yeah. Topics.

241
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:04,570
Assignment stuff. All right.

242
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,110
So I took away effect for free time up here. You.

243
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:22,640
Then. Right?

244
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:29,500
Yeah. Yeah. I don't. It's bound to get cold by Thanksgiving, I would imagine.

245
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,880
Every week like day. It's another day at home. Okay.

246
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:42,190
Yeah. Okay. For. How much do you want us to go to the process of that?

247
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,540
Oh, I. That's a good question.

248
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,440
I think for this, like, not at all necessarily.

249
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,420
Yeah, not at all.

250
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:59,550
Because you just want to kind of come out of that like the sort of like this is what is known as more of a standard research paper question.

251
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:06,640
Yeah. Yeah. But I do think, like all of your topics, like if you did want to.

252
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:12,500
I think all of them could to be like a systematic review, kind of not systematic.

253
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:19,330
But in her view, if you like, Kagan wanted to proceed on that debate.

254
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:28,250
I have one one of my friends and it's in psychology but at all of the students for their first dissertation chapter two meta analysis,

255
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:33,229
which I think is great and like sometimes I think it doesn't the topic,

256
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:41,000
it could be like a review, a general review, but they try to have everybody do a meta analysis because then you like emerge with like.

257
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,899
Rock solid knowledge of like this content.

258
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:50,930
And I like more than pretty much anybody in the field and I think it's a really it's a lot it's like a very heavy lift.

259
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,980
But I think it's really a cool thing because then like you really just guarantee like

260
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,110
this person is going to be expert in one block and that's sort of dissertation topic.

261
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:07,970
So you guys will become expert. But like I feel like it takes it to a different level where you're like,

262
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:14,900
I am writing this paper as a review to show that I have mastered the key elements of the topic.

263
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:20,390
So I think that's kind of cool. Okay.

264
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:27,139
So, all right. So I want to make sure we go through some of this peer review stuff.

265
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:32,600
So this is really like peer review in the context of submitting, getting reviews back.

266
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,450
What do we do? What are our strategies to respond?

267
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:50,960
And it is such a big issue because we know, like even in the best of times, this process is really long and can certainly take.

268
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,309
It just takes a lot. But this is kind of the process.

269
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:02,190
And so just to sort of unpack a little bit for those of us who are not in the editorial space.

270
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,440
So, you know, if anybody's had the experience of getting what's called a desk desk reject,

271
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,990
that's basically like the editor says, no, I'm not going to send this paper out for review.

272
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,930
And that's totally happened to me. That's happens to everybody. And we'll talk about, you know, why.

273
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:25,440
And so that's kind of at this stage. And then we send out for peer review.

274
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,579
This is right now like such a bottleneck.

275
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:37,100
It's often a bottleneck, but right now with just COVID and everything,

276
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:44,300
I think people and I think like quiet putting people in and following that term and like the popularity of a newspaper,

277
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:50,930
it's just so, so hard to get reviewers and so.

278
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,450
It just it's really problematic because it just really holds up the system.

279
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:59,730
And I. I definitely don't say yes either.

280
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:05,680
Look, I'm part of the problem. I don't say yes to every paper that I review, but I try to say yes to like at least 50%.

281
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:13,250
But as you guys got get going and feel, I don't know if any of it hasn't been asked to review anything like an email come to you.

282
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:22,610
Yeah. So like, you know, you get out there and then reviewer four editors are just like scouring around to like try to find new people.

283
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:27,800
So especially if you're in an area that like that, that having people publishing in or whatever,

284
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,440
you'll get papers that don't seem totally in your wheelhouse,

285
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,120
even in that they're kind of tangential, you know, like I see like an asteroid, you know, so I don't know.

286
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,220
Amy, have you done the reviews or is it like.

287
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:50,060
30 journalists from the press on Monday.

288
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:59,810
So if you're confident that the best way to. Every that I it her appearance.

289
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,340
Yeah. I would say yeah.

290
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:11,440
I would say if you can tell it's a pretty girl, then just say no, they're not minor in expertise or something.

291
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:20,060
What perhaps they dislike is one of those things that also in effect to log in and say, no, I just.

292
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:26,070
It's away, which is really bad behavior. But I'm like, I just can't log in.

293
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:38,660
Two of them. You know, you often get in tandem like you've got an account created in the journal of like nursing and chemotherapy.

294
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,190
And I'm like, this is not what I do at home, you know?

295
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,340
And then then the next email is like, Please do this.

296
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:51,260
And so then it's just like a whole process to just like, not to say no.

297
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:54,709
And I'm like, I would say no.

298
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:59,390
And then they always ask you, and we should all do this if we can suggest alternate reviewers.

299
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:06,800
And so I try to I try to spread the wealth of the alternate reviewers that I suggest.

300
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:16,700
But it's like a really tough issue because all of us summer when people think animal but then length is planetary

301
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:23,209
journals or even just tangential journals that are valid journals maybe like I can't it's so hard to tell at the time.

302
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:32,100
Like, you know, sometimes in the journal if it has a super specific title and kind of raises an eyebrow, like, are you really actually a journal?

303
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:36,320
Are you just like a hyper specialized? Colonel.

304
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:42,920
So I don't know how to get oneself on those lists. And you have the same amount, so.

305
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,200
But just. Probably at some point, maybe one in a second, like a just area.

306
00:36:50,130 --> 00:37:02,330
But I don't I don't know that that. So, you know, I mean, America, it's great to review and especially when you're our junior person, it's just again.

307
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:11,000
Experience to see what's out there. And I think the other thing that done is, is that as you review papers that are like not ready for prime time.

308
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:17,880
You're like, Oh my gosh, I can submit that that paper that I feel like it's currently not good enough.

309
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:24,060
I need to go ahead and submit it because people are submitting papers that are like not even.

310
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,650
Typos and lots of table. Everything can have a typo.

311
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,700
I always know that if I find it, you know.

312
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:42,330
But I mean, some papers are just like, oh, gosh, they thought this was funny to this, like, shocking way.

313
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,180
Sloppy and that I think is good competition to do it.

314
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:55,630
Oh, I'd be able to hurt myself and be able to like, you know, pretend to perfectionistic and I need to just put it out there.

315
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,370
So I think that's. Doing the interview process.

316
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:06,990
I then you get ideas about like better ways to present things or writing while writing style stuff.

317
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,800
So sorry. Did you end up doing something?

318
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:24,300
How did you how did it go? It was fine. And so, like I.

319
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:41,430
Being on the other side. You know, and I think that's one thing that might never be visible to each other.

320
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,049
It's helpful to produce stuff where you're like, I don't know anything about this topic.

321
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:52,120
And yet I'm so. I mean, and that people should be able to speak to.

322
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:57,340
Piper. Kind of right.

323
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,450
So yeah, so this is generally that process.

324
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:09,250
So we're like reviewing and then reviewers make a recommendation, an editor sends the manuscripts back and then we revise, etc.

325
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:23,290
So this process of like when you send it out to when you get it back, you know, definitely can be many months if not like well over a year.

326
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,280
And it's and I think I've mentioned before,

327
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:31,690
like we have this paper manager that we ultimately are going to submit to a different journal because it was like three years ridiculous.

328
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:38,319
So there's a lot. So how do we effectively participate as reviewers?

329
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:45,310
And then also how do we respond to reviews to increase the chance of our paper success in a timely fashion?

330
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,669
So I think those are two different things,

331
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:54,700
but it's something that we want to kind of figure out how to master and get a little practice that we can during grad school.

332
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:02,229
And so these are just kind of things that like, you know, come up in review.

333
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:11,709
So like is that person's paper citing the sources of like are they based in things or are they making massive leaps ignored?

334
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:16,570
Some literature analysis is like, like I said, there's always multiple ways to do a study.

335
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:22,870
And so like you look at what's in front of you and say like, is it reasonable that they did this analysis of the way they chose to do it?

336
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:27,129
But then also like, was this a good idea?

337
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:33,370
Like, that's sort of a deeper critique of the study and this like who can look at this like issues of confidentiality, right?

338
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:40,930
And so you get a paper to review or your advisor gets a paper to review and says, this might be a helpful one for Clara to review.

339
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:46,150
You know, let's talk about who can see that. And that is legitimate to do.

340
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,730
But then on the submitting side,

341
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:56,050
the person who was initially asked to review it usually need to like do a little checkbox saying I had help doing this review from so-and-so.

342
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:02,590
And then that's how you like account for sharing confidential information.

343
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:08,990
So you have to ask about some of the reason that you had to ask permission before you share.

344
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,650
Yeah, that's true. That's true, too. Yeah. Yeah.

345
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:20,630
So some of the journals that I've reviewed for a lot, I know they have that checkbox and when I'm asked, they say, you could just do the checklist.

346
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:24,790
Oh yeah, it depends on the journal, but that's a good point.

347
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:30,570
So you could, you know. They should probably ask first to make sure.

348
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:43,140
Yeah. And I think I. Let's see. So and the other thing is that like as a reviewer, I try to be like friendly,

349
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:51,749
especially if I have a sort of harsh review unless I feel like it's really, really sloppy and they didn't take the time to like make it presentable.

350
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:59,030
That I just say something like, you know, this paper is really too early to be to have been submitted, you know,

351
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:05,010
and I have said that a few times and like I try to I don't say it meanly, but just to sort of lay out like, you know,

352
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:14,309
so I would say like thanks for the opportunity to review and then like this idea of just sort of stating the key findings in the first paragraph,

353
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:23,520
you can also just say like this paper was about, you know, the role of race in doctor patient communication done.

354
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,480
And then you can just say like specific comments follow.

355
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:32,519
That's what I was saying. So then you may or may not need to summarize,

356
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:41,790
but some journals depending on the journal they want like a summary upfront and then basically you're just kind of taking through specific critiques.

357
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,450
Um, I was trying to number them.

358
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:51,299
That is helpful. I don't, don't always end up doing that because I try to do it kind of live like I have the paper

359
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,230
up and I'm trying to like put in my reviews and then if I'm really running on time,

360
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,160
I won't go back in number.

361
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:04,530
But I try to remember sometimes the papers have line numbers that you get to review, and that is helpful because that's very specific.

362
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:14,530
The other thing that I tend to do is I do go by section of paper and I think that's just easier to respond to.

363
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:18,140
Like you can say sort of like major critiques up at the front,

364
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:27,100
but then that's hard for the reviewer number speaker for the author to respond to because they're like, you know, the only in my opinion,

365
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:34,089
the only way to respond to like these big picture major critiques is either like a very long, detailed response to say,

366
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:41,499
like, here's all the ways we, you know, addressed your big picture critiques or to say, you know, thank you.

367
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:49,660
We have addressed this throughout our manuscript. Like, it's just the the critique is just too big then it feels very difficult to respond to.

368
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,880
I don't know if people have that experience. Okay.

369
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,810
So this is kind of like how to do it.

370
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:12,190
And then I'll show you guys some examples of like just different disciplinary type of reviews you can get back because that does vary by discipline.

371
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:22,569
Like some can be sort of incredibly like they feel kind of minor and picky and they're like blended in

372
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:28,120
with major critiques or they're sort of major critiques upfront and then like one like or critiques.

373
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:37,970
Okay, so what would I what would what, what would you want to as a reviewer, address in your review?

374
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:43,000
So some journals do have reviewer guidelines that are specific.

375
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,670
So I would say, like if you're reviewing for a particular journal, look at their website to see if they do have reviewer guidelines.

376
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:52,030
And if they do, that's helpful because it kind of structures it for you.

377
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:56,590
If they don't, then you can kind of we'll talk about what to do.

378
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:03,280
And then I mentioned that that's a reject thing. So generally speaking.

379
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:14,920
Yours. Your judgment of whether the paper is within scope for the journal doesn't matter as much because the editor should be,

380
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:20,810
you know, not not sending things out for review if they're not in the scope of the journal.

381
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:24,760
So that's like in the review process, that's not really your job.

382
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:33,930
Novelty and this kind of is. I think it's an important criteria because it helps.

383
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,230
It leads to like the weight of the paper, like,

384
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:43,490
is this paper really presenting something new or expanding in an important new way on something we know?

385
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:50,060
And I think this is where you definitely want to know your topic, because sometimes if you get a paper that's like,

386
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:56,090
you know, got a little review going, but it's not it doesn't feel very comprehensive.

387
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:01,160
That's when I start kind of going get a Google scholar and I'm like, What do we really know about this topic?

388
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:10,220
If I don't know the topic well or like the recent papers well, and that I feel like that feeds into novelty really badly in the past because.

389
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:20,910
You know, people could be sort of selectively reviewing literature that supports the research question or findings of their paper.

390
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:27,480
And you kind of want to know where does this paper sit in the broader scope of?

391
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:35,930
You know, the broader field, like, is it bringing something new or do we really already know this or are they kind of ignore?

392
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:44,450
I feel like this happens a lot in papers, so like not a little bit selectively ignoring literature that would actually be really relevant to pull it.

393
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:50,180
And that's where I feel like it gets to be like that's why expertise in a topic is helpful because then you're like,

394
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:56,269
what you're saying is accurate here, but you're kind of missing a few key things.

395
00:46:56,270 --> 00:47:05,460
And that's when you get reviews that are like, this person should consider citing these papers also for exploring this literature.

396
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:10,940
That's when you're adding to like both, I think, the novelty and impact of the paper.

397
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:16,760
And it's like that significance piece, like, is this paper worth having out there?

398
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:22,640
And then here, of course, there's like methods.

399
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:25,970
That's always the easiest section to critique.

400
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:35,120
And it's everything from like, you know, they talk about a measure, but then they don't give any psycho internet and psychometric information.

401
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:40,010
They should include alpha values. Like that's a totally valid critique.

402
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:47,480
Paper should do that. And sometimes you ask them to do that and they come back and they're like, Oh, the alpha notes are kind of low.

403
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:52,940
So that's why we didn't include them, and that's why we're now changing the design of the paper to not include those variables.

404
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:59,690
So like there are sometimes certainly reasons why people don't include things and it's always helpful to ask or to notes.

405
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:04,670
So methods is usually like give me more detail.

406
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:11,959
Like that is always a critique that you can probably make. Sometimes what I say is things like I defer to the editor,

407
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:18,200
like if I'm reading a paper that maybe is a brief report and doesn't have a lot of detail in it, I get it.

408
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,819
I get why they don't have all the detail.

409
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:28,190
But then I'll say like I defer to the editor, but these details seem important to include or I defer to the editor.

410
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:32,750
But something else that I think is important, but I realize the editor may not think it's that important.

411
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:44,390
Then I think the other thing and that's like really about soundness and reproducibility point, I think if you have any ethics concerns,

412
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:49,190
this could be everything like from like did they list the IAB approval number

413
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:54,709
which sometimes is in I would say increasingly required in definitely ethics.

414
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:58,760
I think concerns around like consent.

415
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:09,200
Did they report in the study how they obtained consent, that they obtained consent and like how they recruited their participants?

416
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:16,609
Because I am. Sort of surprise. I, like a lot of studies, will just sort of gloss that over and I'm like, Well, no.

417
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:23,389
How did you describe the study to the participants? Like what is it, a study about, you know, race and stress?

418
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:28,870
Was it described in that way? Is it a study described as like eating behavior or whatever?

419
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:34,400
Like how did you get the people in? And I think that is kind of an ethics issue if it's not in there.

420
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:38,920
And then this idea of organization and language and that's like flow.

421
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:48,770
One of the things I always comment on is. Do they talk about the variables in the same order throughout the paper?

422
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:52,219
So like. Or do they start switching them around?

423
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:59,630
And it's sort of a little thing, but it's really helpful to just remember in your own writing and reviewing.

424
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:06,380
And certainly grant writing like keep the variables in the same corner because it just sort of illustrates that you're,

425
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:09,469
you're walking through your conceptual model over and over.

426
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:17,630
And if you flip around the order of like in the tables and in the measures description in the introduction, like it just kind of gets confusing.

427
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:22,220
And I think it reflects like, you know,

428
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:29,120
you're in the earlier thinking stages about how all these things fit together and you don't have like a clear vision necessarily.

429
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:36,760
Okay. So those are like sort of big picture things. Okay.

430
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:45,819
Um, this idea of, like, it's kind of the flipside of what you guys are doing for your papers, right?

431
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:51,040
So, like, is this novel important? Is there a gap so that those two things relate?

432
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,110
These are like questions to kind of like prompt yourself to come up with those topic answers.

433
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,470
Are the methods rigorous? Do they provide info on ethics and consent?

434
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:04,540
And this is always a big one and I'm sure people have heard this 20 million times,

435
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:10,300
but like, are they making like causal claims in an or in an observational study?

436
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:14,379
Are they overstating the importance of their results? Right.

437
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,870
Everybody wants to overstate the importance of the results.

438
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:23,559
And that's always usually a valid critique unless you read it and you're like, wow, these guys really did a good job.

439
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,530
They have these results. They talked about them.

440
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:32,950
They talked about potential implications, but they didn't go over the top and say, like, we should change clinical guidelines based on the study.

441
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:38,620
Right? But there's always, often some causal language in there.

442
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:41,979
And I'm always like on the hunt for that because I think it's really,

443
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:50,530
really it's it's an easy error to make because we all have causal hypotheses in our head, but like our study designs are often not causal.

444
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:54,640
And so we get that opaquely, so we get that like mismatch.

445
00:51:55,690 --> 00:52:02,500
And I just think it's important to kind of keep the discussion sections and conclusion sections in particular.

446
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:14,270
Honest there. I think also it can come up in the introduction because people talk about the causal linkages,

447
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:24,860
but then sometimes those are debated and they don't like say it's possible that these things could relate in this right away.

448
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:34,580
Uh, what else about that? Um, okay, so the next, the next slide I have is just like a bunch of text, so I'll share it.

449
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:40,459
But this is just kind of like a good checklist of things to check over in your review.

450
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:48,050
And also as you're turning in a paper for review, these are just good, like triple checks to make.

451
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:52,700
And so like everything is going in order, like is the title representative of what it is.

452
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:56,570
Different journals have different preferences on that title thing,

453
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:01,730
so sometimes they like to have a title that like states the finding, sometimes they really don't.

454
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:07,340
So I would say like always check the journal you're submitting to also the abstract.

455
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:12,260
Like what often happens in writing and we may have all this is that like the

456
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:16,549
abstract is kind of written at a different time from the results and the findings.

457
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:20,180
So like it could be earlier, it could be later, but they don't like go together.

458
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:28,759
And I always double check that as a reviewer. So state the research up to date, look reviewed, knowledge gap objectives articulated.

459
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:33,290
Do they have hypotheses, solid methods, enough detail?

460
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,629
Do they state whether the objectives were reached?

461
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:40,520
So did they start out with a hypothesis over here and then they do their thing and then the results and then they're like,

462
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:44,750
their conclusions are kind of over here, but they never get back to their hypothesis.

463
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:52,159
So like that does happen, this issue of like interpreting your results in the results section, right?

464
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:58,340
So in that sort of like standard format, you're not supposed to overinterpret results for really interpret them in the results section.

465
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:02,990
You wait for the discussion section that can be really hard with qualitative research in particular.

466
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:09,500
So that's like more of a, I would say a quantitative kind of piece.

467
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:14,389
But I think qualitative is trickier, way trickier here.

468
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:15,950
Do they have less limitations?

469
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:23,810
I'm always jotting like, you know, all the measures or self-report, you know, or whatever it is, you know, this was an all white,

470
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:31,220
hetero, you know, homogeneous, wealthy sample, you know, just making sure that those pop up as limitations.

471
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:39,129
Conclusions justified. I think this implications this kind of depends on journalist.

472
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:43,870
So like if you're writing for like a clinical journal or a public health journal or an education journal,

473
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:48,879
like what are you going to put in your implications and conclusion section?

474
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,880
Like, how is this useful? References.

475
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:59,840
Causal language aspects. Is there redundancy between table and text formatting?

476
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:05,569
I haven't really talked a lot about tables, but tables are really important too to sort of look at.

477
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:12,710
And I think about it as like if I can look at the table and generally understand what they're talking about, that's okay.

478
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:15,740
But if I'm just like, wow, this table just.

479
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:23,910
It's like redundant or it's messy or it's like the variables occur in different orders, a comment on things like that.

480
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,210
And so again, look for yourself as you're turning something in,

481
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:36,120
looking back at tables and making sure they're good and formatting like typos on tables, you know, just like that, triple checking the moment.

482
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:42,570
And so those are just like that's a good checklist to to review as you go.

483
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:49,860
Okay. And so this is kind of part of that earlier piece about when should I review?

484
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:56,700
So I would say, like, if asked to agree to your review, if you feel like you have the expertise.

485
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:05,819
The other thing I would say is that like sometimes I've done a review and I know the statistics are like beyond my simple mind grasp.

486
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:17,010
And I will say that I'm say like I'm not I don't feel expert enough to review this, you know, complicated, longitudinal, multilevel, you know, model.

487
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:19,500
And I'll just say that so that I kind of like.

488
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:27,990
I'm not like passing it along as okay, but I'm just saying like I don't, I can't read that part of it and I that's legitimate.

489
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:33,299
Sometimes they'll have a box that says like this could benefit from a statistical review.

490
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,720
And then sometimes I'll check that box if I feel like the methods are super complicated.

491
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:40,740
Um, we've kind of suggested we've kind of said this.

492
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:47,310
I would say, like, have a list of alternative reviewers. I have definitely had people who think that happened on Twitter.

493
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:54,400
One of my colleagues was like, I just got to, you know, asked to review my own paper because they were suggested as an alternate review,

494
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:58,830
were like in a sort of small world of whatever it's doing. So that can happen.

495
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:05,159
And then this idea of like a conflict of interest in the paper to review.

496
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:16,020
So I think when I first got here I was asked to review my postdocs, postdoc mentors paper and I was like, that felt like a conflict.

497
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:20,940
So I emailed the journal editor and I was like, Here's the deal. Like, I was just like working with him a month ago.

498
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:25,080
Like, I'm not on this paper, but like I know all those people. And he was like, you could probably review it.

499
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:30,899
Do you think you can review it? You know, you know, without bias of like, I don't know.

500
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,440
So I can't remember if I reviewed it or not, but I remember like having that exchange.

501
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,499
And then I think this is another thing too. This is harder.

502
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:48,900
But like if you if you're in an area and you're feeling like you have a strong opinion about, you know.

503
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:57,160
You know how certain people are like interpreting your area or researching on your area, like so for example,

504
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:08,439
my colleague really focuses a lot on there's like a big area of like maternal feeding research and like from mother to child, like maternal feeding.

505
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:15,759
How do people feed? And there's a big assumption in the literature about like, you know, if you change maternal feeding,

506
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:24,040
you will like prevent infant obesity and there's like increasing knowledge that you actually that's not the only thing involved.

507
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,140
Right. So there's a biology in infant eating behavior.

508
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:32,530
And so I feel like sometimes there's like a little bit of ax to grind if people are saying like maternal feeding is the only thing there.

509
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:35,499
And I think it's important to point out. But like also keeping in mind,

510
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:41,739
like there are a lot of people about maternal feeding and that like they don't all need to incorporate both, but they should mention.

511
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:48,500
And so as we think. Being objective, being specific and constructive.

512
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:55,700
If you have changes to suggest it's good versus hostile, derogatory, which I'm sure nobody in here would be,

513
00:58:56,180 --> 00:59:05,060
but I've certainly gotten ones that are like less than pleasant, you know, and being timely just in deciding whether to review and not to review.

514
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:10,760
Okay. And then I just put in some links. Oh, they can't see.

515
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:17,330
But sometimes they do have these like guidelines for peer review available.

516
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,190
So I think again, as you're starting out,

517
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:26,580
I think what you would like to get but then also like those guidelines I think can be really helpful in terms of what to cover,

518
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,320
what's like valid territory to cover.

519
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:36,950
Okay. So then here's this peer review integrity.

520
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:41,700
And this is one of these like responsible conduct of research scholarship topics.

521
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:49,500
But this is like I would see like this space of confidentiality of the reviewer is really changing.

522
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:54,960
I think it's becoming in general more open. But.

523
00:59:56,310 --> 01:00:00,090
You know, this is it's a little tricky because often as a reviewer, you get, again,

524
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:07,800
asked to check a box like this, the contents of this review can be shared with another journal.

525
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:14,070
Like if this paper gets resubmitted again, but you share my identity or don't share my identity and I,

526
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:19,500
I tend to check, don't share my identity, but I feel like some journals don't let you check that.

527
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:22,950
And they just have you do have you sharing your identity.

528
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:32,670
So like Frontiers, for example, they publish the reviewer name with the paper that they reviewed.

529
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:39,060
And so I think that's probably generally good, but I feel like a little conflicted about it.

530
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:43,310
It's like, Oh, I don't want to necessarily have my reviews out there, but that would be fine.

531
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:50,110
I should probably just say yes to my identity, but sometimes when you're reviewing you also you,

532
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:55,679
you know, sometimes you see the authors names you submitted, sometimes you don't. But I think increasingly we do see the authors names.

533
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:03,100
So you just sort of, you know, privy to this special information that is not maybe ready for prime time that somebody submits.

534
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:07,120
So just keeping in mind that that is privileged information confidential.

535
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:11,750
Yeah. If it was blinded that's when those conflicts.

536
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:20,620
If you don't know who it is. Yeah, then you can't know, like you can suspect it.

537
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:28,269
And I think in that case, which, you know, you totally could reasonably guess or suspected that you know who it is.

538
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:33,339
And if you then feel like there's a conflict of interest that becomes apparent,

539
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:37,360
then I would say let the action ed now say email back and say like, Oh, you know what?

540
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:42,160
I started to review this paper, but I realize I have a conflict of interest that I didn't know because it was a double blind.

541
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:51,370
Good point. And like that? Yeah. Yeah.

542
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:56,150
That would be the thing to do for sure. Um, I think in general.

543
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,590
Okay. We talked about this as you do with your mentor.

544
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:04,100
Your mentor should also double check over your review at the end.

545
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:09,979
I think this is probably the biggest or one of the biggest things is like, you know,

546
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:13,879
you maybe review a paper and like part of reviewing papers is that you get an idea.

547
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:18,380
So it's a great it's like a little fuzzy, right. But we don't want to say.

548
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,970
Wow. I've never thought about it like this before.

549
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,299
Now I'm going to go run those analysis of my data and try to publish that before this

550
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:32,040
paper and give this paper a bad review because I want to publish my thing first.

551
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,980
Like that would be the worst, right? That would be super evil.

552
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:44,370
But sometimes this is really hard because you're like, once you've thought of something, it's hard to think right?

553
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:51,580
And if you're reviewing a manuscript that's really in your wheelhouse, you know, on the one hand, that manuscript,

554
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:59,229
if you've really never like done those analyzes in your own data or whatever, that manuscripts are probably going to get published before yours.

555
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:02,590
So I think that's a good like natural protection for this issue.

556
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:11,229
But I think that like the idea that I don't know and it's it's going to be less

557
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:16,930
true in our general fields because it's not like some new discovery necessarily.

558
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:24,069
But I think there are things that come up from time to time that you see in reviews and you're like, Oh wow, that's a really good idea.

559
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:26,140
I wish I thought of that, you know?

560
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:35,770
And then, you know, you can hopefully that paper will be published soon and then you can like look at the paper and then use it.

561
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:41,710
Then it's fair game both before it's published and it's not pretty.

562
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:50,100
So that privileged information piece. Let's see.

563
01:03:50,850 --> 01:04:00,329
Uh oh. I that's what I was going to say. So even, like, in night reviews, you know, not blind is all.

564
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:05,070
Grant reviews are not blind because they're reviewing the person as well as the project.

565
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:07,410
Here you're just reviewing the product so it can be blind.

566
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:17,310
But in NIH reviews, you're never supposed to share that you were the reviewer of that person's grant.

567
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:24,120
I feel like that is less regulated in the peer reviewed journal space,

568
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:33,870
but it's still probably good practice to not share that you were the reviewer of someone's paper, but I certainly heard heard people say that.

569
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:42,479
And I've you know, I know I've been a reviewer on certain papers and have extra insight into that paper.

570
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:48,210
And so it's just a little bit of a tricky, potentially tricky space, I think, once the paper's published.

571
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:55,060
It's probably okay, but it's not really regulated in the way the grammar doing is the final exams.

572
01:04:55,210 --> 01:05:00,310
So. Just keeping in mind it's all privileged information.

573
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,790
Okay. Okay. This is. So.

574
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:16,019
Okay, so now let's switch over and we'll talk about the responses that we would be writing possibly sooner than we'd be doing these reviews.

575
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:23,090
But I think it's always good to go through the reviews first. So this idea of dealing with criticism and we may really feel like that.

576
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:26,220
Yeah. Yeah. And just thinking about the checklists.

577
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:29,660
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Oh.

578
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:36,370
Filling in for quality that there's, like, a consolidated list kind of standard.

579
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:39,930
Oh, yeah. Mm hmm. Like internal.

580
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:44,150
I ask you to make sure you've checked all the boxes before.

581
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:51,280
I think there's something. Possible to have something like that quantitative.

582
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:58,120
Do they also have to. Yeah, that's true reporting.

583
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:04,600
I think you. Well, this.

584
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:13,480
Analyst for Politics Research. And this is it for my family.

585
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:18,129
Yeah. If it's from like a society or there are there are a lot of which I totally didn't talk about,

586
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:22,310
but there are a lot of guidelines maybe I should put in and start with that person.

587
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:26,860
I think this is this is one drug, Chrisman.

588
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:33,550
Consolidated criteria. Reporting quality.

589
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:56,600
From terrorism checklist. I wonder.

590
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:02,390
Yes, some journals I feel like this is certainly becoming more common for a journal to say like you have to have.

591
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:10,729
But there's the I know the acronyms are all going through my head, but there's like the PRISMA guidelines for literature reviews.

592
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:21,990
There's the strobe guidelines. Yeah.

593
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:28,860
So long as you close. Yeah. Yeah, that was pretty.

594
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:39,260
I wonder. What's the one that you were just saying?

595
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,610
Like the Christmas one? That's pretty common. I know. I've heard slightly different stories.

596
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,890
Oh, yeah. Yeah, but they have it.

597
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,540
Right. And that and concert? Definitely.

598
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:56,969
It used to be just. For like clinical trials.

599
01:07:56,970 --> 01:08:02,940
And that was kind of just this sense that increasing regulation of lots of different studies.

600
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:07,190
The other thing I didn't talk about, which we've not talked about too in.

601
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:14,500
You talk about writing, but. Is.

602
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:19,450
Yeah. So sorry. Karen took the same time.

603
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:27,420
I felt like I was in a corner. Desperate for. They're going in this.

604
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:35,730
Yeah. You know, I.

605
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:42,100
It was another guideline that I was just thinking that or another. Oh, I know.

606
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:52,030
Just transparency and open science by pre stating pre-registering your hypotheses or pre-registration analysis.

607
01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:57,070
And I just was I think I might have mentioned this. I think I was on it.

608
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:05,800
I'm on a dissertation that's doing a review and she pre-registered on open science like the literature review search.

609
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:08,900
Yeah. So I'm like, oh, my goodness.

610
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:16,740
Like, there's just like a lot more again, which is good, but it's sort of like there's all these regulatory things like,

611
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:21,560
but like and some journals require them and some don't.

612
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:31,040
And, and it's not 100% clear who's going to, you know, what is required in some of these cases, like clinical trials,

613
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:39,139
much more regulated, like your average observational research paper, much less regulated, but increasingly regulated.

614
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:41,780
And that really varies by field, I think.

615
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:50,060
So like psychology right now is very focused on because they've had this lot of this attention to the replication crisis.

616
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:55,760
They're very focused on registration, open science, register,

617
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,559
any paper that you might write and I would say that's not the case right now, that would help.

618
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,280
But in the clinical trials space, absolutely is the case.

619
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:17,370
So really depends on like the nature of your research but. But yet if you do, I would say that the best guideline is checking the journal.

620
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:23,590
For sure. And then. There's.

621
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:31,060
Yeah, there's always more one could do I'm sure with these general ones is stroke but what a stroke for again

622
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:35,890
and the did you can't I don't think that's clinical trials but I think that's just like a general.

623
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:43,810
Yeah. There's just there's a lot of reporting about.

624
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:51,579
Yeah. So that's the one that I, I see a little bit more now because it's not clinical trials.

625
01:10:51,580 --> 01:11:00,159
It's just like, again, like your sort of garden variety. Like we've asked this question and we found out whether these things are associated or not.

626
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:03,219
Like at a very basic level, that's the stroke guidelines.

627
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:07,710
So that's for like. Just basic observational studies.

628
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:13,439
Prisma is a lot more like the look review stuff. Yeah.

629
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:19,530
So that's probably worth unpacking a little bit. I know it's hard to keep up the Wiener Network.

630
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:28,860
Oh, that. Wow.

631
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:33,890
Well, here. So I kind of to the main.

632
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:41,220
I'm. Oh, that's a good resource.

633
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:46,850
I would never. Yeah.

634
01:11:55,730 --> 01:12:01,270
I think maybe I will. Is because it's really.

635
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:04,810
Yeah, it's. But.

636
01:12:06,290 --> 01:12:10,820
Okay, let's see what to my future.

637
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:23,060
Okay. I'll just kind of go quickly through like this responding to because and again, like I have info on all of these slides and some examples,

638
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:32,480
but I think one thing that's like just good to keep in mind is that the number one really people people's paper objectives and have the right fit.

639
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:41,000
And so that could come up like at that desperate stage, which hopefully is like fast and quick and you like aim high, get rejected,

640
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:48,950
have a second journal lined up and ready to go that is hopefully got the same formatting requirements of your first one.

641
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:53,239
So in terms of like page like, you know, number, word count,

642
01:12:53,240 --> 01:13:00,889
all of that if you're aiming high for a journal for a paper to a really high impact journal,

643
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:04,959
I would say like have a second journal that's got the same requirements.

644
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,390
And I'll probably be short because those high impact journals tend to be short.

645
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:17,450
And like if you get a desperate jack, just be ready to like take a half a day, reformat a teeny tiny bit and like reset that out.

646
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:25,220
Because once you get the rejection like it's and you sit on it, then it's like, Oh, it takes a lot more effort to get it out.

647
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:33,169
So and we talked about that Gene Journal site. That's always a good criterion to figure out where you want to submit to.

648
01:13:33,170 --> 01:13:36,140
So like what are you citing a lot as a friendly to you?

649
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:41,180
Also just checking the journal website like what of they publish this because sometimes there can't be

650
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:46,729
accepted or they take qualitative or they don't really like switched over and they used to do clinical focus.

651
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:52,309
Now they don't. So just want to check in there and then again like what style is sort of fits your

652
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:57,860
project of writing the best so isn't like super tight sort epidemiology brief report,

653
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:01,550
is it qualitative, longer, etc.?

654
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:06,260
Yeah. Like choose your journal or you start writing.

655
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,660
I try to at least think about that. Yeah. Like, as for sort of.

656
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:18,590
Figuring out the results. And like what's going to kind of come forth in the discussion?

657
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:24,889
What are the key messages of this paper? I think that's a good point to be like, all right, what's our journal?

658
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:32,780
Because it really shapes so much about how you write it and you just know where you're headed and you're like, okay, it's 3500 words total.

659
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:41,240
That's all we got. That's like pediatrics. You got to just say, like, you know, families use media more than they ever did.

660
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:48,860
Our study was about this. I mean, it's like so short, especially if you have long methods which are usually in those kind of papers,

661
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:55,970
the longest section, whereas, you know, like psych journal, you're like, I got 6000 words.

662
01:14:55,970 --> 01:15:02,209
I'm like going to just go on and talk. And they also want that like they want the theoretical basis.

663
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:05,630
Like this is how we got to this question. Here's the history of the research on it.

664
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:09,920
Here's the most recent research on it. And like, here's our study.

665
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:14,300
Like, you have to do much more like a longer funnel.

666
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:20,200
So I think that does make a big difference. I feel like often the qualitative,

667
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:29,210
whether or not journals take a qualitative is like kind of a good way to cut out journals because a lot of them don't.

668
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:38,590
Yeah. Yeah. So you've been, you know, just kind of investigate around in those journals and see, like, what, how how papers look in these journals.

669
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:45,420
Like, that's the best. I think it. But definitely have an idea of where you're headed, because if you write something that's like,

670
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,820
you know, and I mean, there's value to doing that and like getting your ideas, your logic,

671
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:55,920
like I'm right now trying to write this brand proposal that ultimately it's like it's like an internal thing,

672
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:02,340
but it's like got to be three, I think double spaced pages, which is like nothing, nothing.

673
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:07,350
But I probably have a nine page, single spaced document where I'm like working on my ideas, you know,

674
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:13,680
and then going to have to just do a like new document and like cut and paste my own into a few sentences, you know?

675
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:17,280
So it's that kind of like this is very valuable.

676
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:26,580
But like I wouldn't, I also would not try to like edit this down to fit into this because that's just too much pain.

677
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:35,020
It's like sheer pain. But I like to edit like I like to like it, but yeah, yeah, yeah.

678
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,790
Whatever you pronounced like revision.

679
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:47,200
I think one of the major things for a lot of the comments are very valid,

680
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:57,730
but also it was submitted to developmental studies and so they really honed in on what's the significance of that longitudinal that this whole.

681
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:05,150
Yes, this whole. But they're really looking at like, what about this time period of this transition is relevant.

682
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:09,220
What you're looking at. It doesn't seem that relevant in all this.

683
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:13,210
And the main impact of the project.

684
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:23,790
It's looking at socialism for. Why is that important to know that so the men need a role in the development of.

685
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,580
With technology. Oh, yeah.

686
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:35,110
So we're shifting to. Oh, sure.

687
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:41,290
Cultural diversity and ethnic minorities. Psychology and psychology.

688
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:45,389
And so some of that, it still needs to be reworked and things.

689
01:17:45,390 --> 01:17:49,330
But I think that was. Resolve a lot.

690
01:17:52,330 --> 01:18:01,300
Yeah, that's a great example. And for like if you feel like you've had a really good applied application message, you know, it's that.

691
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:09,460
The College Student Mental Health Journal or you know, what are your outcomes like aligning something perfectly with?

692
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:15,100
The Journal, the like. And I know that you didn't want to take your particular thing.

693
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:22,690
You don't want to do it out there like DeSean Jackson, you know, hey you know so and knowing that journal culture.

694
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:30,400
Tricky. So. Certainly.

695
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:38,130
And then we looked at the carrier that it submitted to. We know that.

696
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:44,910
So that reviewer was doing a good job for that journal.

697
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:51,130
Right. And even if and this is the other thing and I think I probably even have this on the next for some other some other slide.

698
01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:57,750
Oh yeah. It's this point that like if you get an R and R especially or if you get a reject.

699
01:18:59,190 --> 01:19:03,740
Don't sit on it for too long because then it can just all of a sudden become five years and you're like, Oh my gosh.

700
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,570
Like, I have one on my desk. Like, that's, like, embarrassing.

701
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:13,020
But the main a main thing is that, like, even if it's true, a different journal could go to the same reviewers.

702
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:21,240
Because it might be, again, like spent depending on like how focused or how like small of a research area it is, you know.

703
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:31,450
Or closely connected. Right. So even if you're sending it to a different journal, you may want to, you know,

704
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:35,680
like those reviews in that case seem like they're very particular to developmental psych,

705
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:41,200
but you might want to like throw them a bone to say this is the developmental period

706
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,589
we're looking at if it's college students because it's transitioning to adulthood.

707
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:47,260
And then like you can imagine, that's enough maybe for, you know,

708
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:52,930
but like situate it developmental because you might get those same reviewers were then asked to

709
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:58,120
review the paper again for a different journal and they might if they're an awesome reviewer,

710
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:03,130
they hopefully should be like, oh, what is like ethnicity and culture care about?

711
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:11,530
And I'll review with that hat on. But they might say and maybe they check the button that like my review can go to another journal,

712
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:15,399
but they might say like, I've seen this paper before, this is the same paper.

713
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:18,530
I'm going to pull up my review and like do it again.

714
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:23,260
So it's that's an interesting conceptual possibility,

715
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:33,130
but I do think papers too often go to the same reviewers depending again on like the the subtlety or the sides of the research area.

716
01:20:34,150 --> 01:20:43,840
So that's good to know. So it's always good to like if you can, you know, like depending on the level of intensity of the review and you know,

717
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:51,730
sometimes you'll really repackage the paper to like be more of a clinical audience or a different, you know, just a really different type of paper.

718
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:58,270
And then some of the critiques may not be as relevant, but if there are other critiques,

719
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:01,389
you know, it's a good time to be like, Oh yeah, oops, we needed to shore that up.

720
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:09,070
Let's, let's do that for this next submission. So there's always a little bit of something to do and I don't like, don't sit on it for too long.

721
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:16,390
Then this idea of like revise and resubmit, which many of us have done.

722
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:27,309
But I think hopefully these are the goals and nobody wants to have a paper out there that's like get retracted or there's something funky with it.

723
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:32,740
So like the peer review process is important and we want to have different eyes on it.

724
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:38,290
And I've definitely had that experience where I've done a review and I've said things over here and then

725
01:21:38,290 --> 01:21:42,309
somebody else's review the same thing and they've said things over here and they did not even overlap.

726
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:45,700
But I look at that person's comments and I'm like, Oh yeah, really good point.

727
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:50,350
So in that, so like that also happens. So that's why the multiple reviewers are important.

728
01:21:53,320 --> 01:22:01,990
Hopefully it's benevolent and your response will be to like, thank you for the requests for clarification on that.

729
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:11,709
You know, like a, it's like a conversation more than like, you know, so I don't know if people do this, but I have found this helpful.

730
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:15,640
Like when you get a review back, going back to your original document that you submitted,

731
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:21,070
which a hopefully that's findable and stored in a reasonable place and not on one's personal computer.

732
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:31,960
So you have like students who done so five original and you know, do a save as and then have to see if you can pull out each comment,

733
01:22:32,590 --> 01:22:39,760
each reviewer comment and like link it to a specific spot in the paper because that will just make it less of an overwhelming task.

734
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,250
I think you can it's like a good way to to shock at the task.

735
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:51,700
I also just do that thing where I like take it in and then I like take the reviewers comments and put them in a new document.

736
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:54,219
That's going to be the letter of response.

737
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:59,799
And I just sort of format, I just like Muse on it a little bit as I like formatting and I like put a little response,

738
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:04,570
response, response after each reviewer comment a number of them if they're not number two.

739
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:09,969
So I can like let it wash over me for a little bit and also kind of hack away at a task.

740
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:18,250
So those are like the two things I do immediately when I get a review. I think if this happens, it means probably you got really good reviewers,

741
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:25,630
like they're bringing up the key points that you really do need to address as you're writing your response to those reviewers.

742
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:28,689
You know, make sure you address it.

743
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:37,000
But then what I can what I have often done is said, like, as we said in our response to, you know, reviewer to comment for,

744
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:44,290
we've addressed this in this way and like sometimes I'll replaced in the response or I'll re paste in like the section of text that we changed.

745
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:52,299
But I will try to respond differently. I will just make it the same so that I can show this was the same critique.

746
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:57,130
Here's exactly what we did about it, because otherwise I can get a little confusing for the reviewers.

747
01:24:00,030 --> 01:24:07,200
Okay. And then I just, you know, I have some examples here to them so we can take a break before Christie comes, but.

748
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:22,030
I think these are important and it's kind of like it's so easy to feel just, like, hurt by reviews, more like angry or like these people are idiots.

749
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:32,640
They don't know what they're talking about, you know? But I think that if you can strive for, like, this tone of, you know,

750
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:38,020
thank you for bringing this up, I am excited to have a chance to respond to this critique.

751
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:46,779
That's just like a good way to go about it. And what's nice about peer review of journal articles is like sort of, I mean,

752
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:52,269
grant, grant review responses are sort of this, but they're much less direct.

753
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:58,450
This is really like that conversation of reviewers and author and so, you know,

754
01:24:58,450 --> 01:25:02,589
seems to every comment, maybe, maybe get a little like saccharine like too much.

755
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:05,559
But I think just sort of saying like, oh,

756
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:10,690
as a reviewer brought up that added to that and just sort of having that conversational tone I think is helpful.

757
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:16,629
And then this is like if they bring up something that's just like totally out of scope,

758
01:25:16,630 --> 01:25:22,330
you don't have the data to to answer that question, you can say, Oh, that is an excellent point.

759
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:27,550
Unfortunately, we just don't have those data. Thank you for raising this important issue, something like that.

760
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:39,070
This is more like if you get one of these reviews that's kind of like just really big and vague and like not directed,

761
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:43,329
then you can kind of derive your response to it.

762
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:49,750
You can be like, that's kind of like that alternate strategies idea like, well, we did think about doing a,

763
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:56,770
you know, whatever this analysis, but we elected to do this analysis because blah blah, we think it's better.

764
01:25:56,770 --> 01:26:04,000
And so I think that's a case where you can kind of just sort of remake your point of the original paper.

765
01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:12,790
And then, like I said, this just state your critiques and number them and respond to each one of them.

766
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:20,830
Okay, so why not? Christie should be here in a minute so we can take a little break.

767
01:26:20,830 --> 01:26:23,860
But I just I'll just click through these that are just like.

768
01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:27,940
Sample comments, which we've all seen, just so I'll just share the slides with you.

769
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:31,330
And that's like the example of a big comment.

770
01:26:31,690 --> 01:26:38,260
We think this reviewer and here's what we now see in the text on pasting in your response from the paper.

771
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:46,240
And this is like very specific in terms of it's located in the paper and they'll usually say like send in a track change expression or whatever.

772
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:53,780
You know, again, big and little comments, lots of response.

773
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:59,150
Little minimal response to minimal comment. Okay.

774
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:05,720
So let me post these up for you guys and then we can take a break.

775
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:12,580
And Chris, you kind of switch gears and think about people might share something about responding to.

776
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:17,450
Yeah. My wife and I have three children, about 5 to 1.

777
01:27:17,450 --> 01:27:21,230
And like a regular brother. Like a comment that we have.

778
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:26,280
Think about it. Thinking about for another paper. She disappeared here.

779
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:30,270
My mother was like, Wait, you might want to keep that in your back pocket. You talk about.

780
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:38,980
Personally. Very cynical about how much the Republicans would like.

781
01:27:40,150 --> 01:27:47,100
Dress everything. But you don't have to tell them. I fantasized about my wife being homeless.

782
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:54,040
What if I never got? Yeah. And so it's it's tough because when you get reviewers, you know, your study.

783
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,700
Do you want to buy the paper? And you're like, Yeah.

784
01:28:00,310 --> 01:28:03,250
You know? So I think it's a fine line, but yeah, it's really.

785
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:14,670
I think I lived leave at some point like paper planning, you know, like I think we trying to get mixed messages.

786
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:18,480
Like you need to be careful about trying to stretch this out.

787
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:26,910
No politics and none of the like. What is realistic in one big government?

788
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:33,390
Well, and how does it do to look like that? Good to hear something like this.

789
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:41,010
This results is bigger, but like you, it's just great for parties and that they, like, get it out.

790
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:51,000
But you know what this is? Or like with this really complicated model we're testing.

791
01:28:52,290 --> 01:28:59,600
It's going to be a lot to explain. You did not have to be too afraid to turn on that back.

792
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:03,300
He's been a devoted family leader to you.

793
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:09,870
Then you want to make sure it's a really rich. It's.

794
01:29:11,710 --> 01:29:18,990
She doesn't like the term. Yeah. And I like the strength of their results and their relevance.

795
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:25,730
I think it's. On the field, hands on.

796
01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:29,680
And life is pointed out that nobody measures this very well.

797
01:29:29,690 --> 01:29:35,760
And then they start. So I think that's that time frame.

798
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:42,790
Also. Piecemeal publication of it varies a little bit by.

799
01:29:46,930 --> 01:29:50,120
The other thing, like when I started publishing after.

800
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:54,390
Space. Surprised some have said there.

801
01:29:55,380 --> 01:30:04,790
You know, people still talk about me and Justin for these covariance like age, gender, race, income.

802
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:12,450
You know, and that's fine. And like everybody often controls for these areas, but like in some journals,

803
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:19,110
like science journals, you put the results from like those were in like your table and you say,

804
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:26,970
oh, it contributed this much variance and gender and this and that and it's in there sort of your primary thing, but you still did it.

805
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:33,540
Whereas like I, like most of the pediatric part is don't include studies like get it out of for it.

806
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:38,010
Look, we're not going to think about percent how much those things contributed.

807
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:44,640
And so for me, that was like a big adjustment in terms of what data, everything I did her.

808
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:51,970
So things like that just kind of. Publishing.

809
01:30:53,850 --> 01:31:00,500
Different things to. But now it's going to feel like me.

810
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:05,070
It's funny because sometimes I've done that writing.

811
01:31:05,570 --> 01:31:10,290
I'm going to write piecemeal publication too. Okay.

812
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:21,920
Where people. Let's see.

813
01:31:42,480 --> 01:32:32,380
Certainly there. Yeah.

814
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:36,810
Here you go. Three seven, five eight.

815
01:32:37,410 --> 01:32:40,620
Oh, I probably did that, but I don't think walking around me that long.

816
01:32:40,830 --> 01:32:44,910
What is that? Oh, shoot. Oh. Oh, I'm sure I said that.

817
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:48,390
Oh, I know. It is a good rule.

818
01:32:49,050 --> 01:32:55,760
Have. I am sure you know what I think it is to me, this is about one.

819
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:03,830
You know. Do you want to me? Did you send her a little. I'm sorry I sent you this.

820
01:33:04,190 --> 01:33:06,470
Yes, I can get them. I can get them.

821
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:13,970
I just need to make sure they always and this classes, I mean, like the topics have moved around on different weeks,

822
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:24,860
which is great, but then I never know what I should put together in a given three hour chunk.

823
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:33,500
Undergraduate life is literally. Class of 20 segment.

824
01:33:34,190 --> 01:33:41,979
But other than that, I felt. Because of voting or mental health.

825
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:45,180
How they think. Mental health.

826
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:49,910
Oh. I just don't know.

827
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:55,910
This next week. Wow. That's. I've had a few.

828
01:33:57,230 --> 01:34:00,350
I think it's because of slides. Okay. Sorry. You.

829
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:18,330
Mm hmm. Okay.

830
01:34:22,230 --> 01:34:35,530
No. Just check something.

831
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:44,560
Look at that. I couldn't remember.

832
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:57,130
And then it struck me. So we did these these sessions are recorded just so that you guys know that.

833
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:59,570
Did you guys on the net. Okay. See?

834
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:10,220
Okay, so that let me I'm going to go I'm going to go through because, you know, I do this for the 634 class and then I'd forgotten that.

835
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:21,160
I had signed up to, like, have them automatically record the sessions and I forgot to set.

836
01:35:22,230 --> 01:35:26,690
I know what I'm like most casual chatter.

837
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:30,570
But if you want these.

838
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:43,970
Their record. I think I've had a few.

839
01:35:45,090 --> 01:35:53,160
Because of that. Ten people were absent.

840
01:35:54,360 --> 01:36:01,620
We still have class, but it's just. It's just like we just have so many important things to.

841
01:36:08,370 --> 01:36:11,640
This class is my undergraduate class. And what are they?

842
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:54,490
Yeah. In terms of. Yeah.

843
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:59,530
I don't even have. Right.

844
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:13,260
Don't like the dinner. Yeah. The next.

845
01:37:20,610 --> 01:37:23,510
Yeah, I know. It's a kind of a it's a weird situation. I love it.

846
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:32,070
And so I'm going to talk about the creative process because we we talked briefly about this at orientation.

847
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:37,890
There was like so much coming your way that we'll do a deeper dive and then.

848
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:50,010
This is your first semester here. So again, a lot will also then be forgotten because there's so much going on.

849
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:57,980
But this way you can start thinking about it and planning for it. So this is our doctoral curriculum committee.

850
01:37:57,990 --> 01:38:03,900
You can reach out to any of them, I'm sure, which means that like pretty much everything comes to me first.

851
01:38:05,610 --> 01:38:11,320
And Barbara will be on sabbatical or. She won't be on the DCC next semester.

852
01:38:11,530 --> 01:38:20,590
I think she's all right. But this is our committee and folks can answer questions as well.

853
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:30,370
We as the committee are part of this process of the exam, which.

854
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:36,120
Okay. So first we could do brief introductions.

855
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:45,299
I do remember all of your names. Just in case you want to share something new and exciting.

856
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:52,440
That's happened since I last met you. I'm going to talk a little bit about our program components and courses.

857
01:38:52,770 --> 01:38:58,620
I will not receive one person from her to sort of make sure that folks are on track.

858
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:03,300
To be able to do prelim and advance to Canada. See once you.

859
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:11,790
I see that exact and then I'll talk about the structure of grading and timeline.

860
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:28,370
So I'm Christi, I. And a faculty member here, BHP, a big miss doctoral committee curriculum committee co-chair for a year and a half with Amy Schultz.

861
01:39:28,370 --> 01:39:35,060
And then she went on sabbatical. So I took that over last winter term and now this year.

862
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:43,110
Emerging as the chair. And so essentially it as many of you will come to find out what the chat with committee is,

863
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:50,159
there's a chair that sort of does a lot of the the primary work of the day to day

864
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:56,219
staff and then brings the committee together and helps her come to consensus,

865
01:39:56,220 --> 01:40:03,240
reach out for support and different pieces like that. So it's a new role to me in some ways.

866
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:11,700
And so if I don't have a question, my person that I always go to is Jackie and she's a great resource to you as well.

867
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:19,350
The amount of historical reference that she has for both our PGD program and our master's program is quite amazing.

868
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:27,700
So, so I do know all of you, but I'm just a quick how are you doing today?

869
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:43,120
But it turns out this is not the way everything is.

870
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:50,030
Thank you for reminding. I spent very.

871
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:57,820
Back late last night. I'd like.

872
01:41:00,170 --> 01:41:25,140
I saw so many great pictures of cell phone. I also have.

873
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:38,280
Is that ready to go? Listen, I am going to offer a fact finding.

874
01:41:38,610 --> 01:41:46,140
And I went straight to. I know.

875
01:41:46,820 --> 01:41:50,389
That makes me so happy. I went to soccer and there was no one there.

876
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:56,960
And I was like. But I went early, but like everybody was.

877
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:01,760
Yeah, well, not everybody. Clearly, people were earlier, but it was like, yeah, 6 hours.

878
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:13,100
Michigan is amazing with that support.

879
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:27,650
And I think a lot of the law school students that were out there in Lincoln using their dogs for us to have a good time to be involved and find out.

880
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:33,570
Actually, that's true. I think if she.

881
01:42:38,220 --> 01:42:45,670
But I think Michigan may be some of your school on the news like the last polling place for.

882
01:42:48,140 --> 01:43:03,040
Yes. Well, let's look at the absentee voting, which was good.

883
01:43:03,190 --> 01:43:08,080
It's good to get that done. My daughter just celebrated absentee voting day here in Michigan.

884
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:16,140
But then the other kind of. I think I would like the in-person missed opportunities.

885
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:28,970
To. Okay.

886
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:32,230
So program components. Yeah, yeah.

887
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:39,090
My schedule, this is just sort of thinking about the curriculum, but just knowing everybody in here has got, you know, different advisors.

888
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:45,300
Mm hmm. Part of the people thing is like figuring out how to fit your interests and that kind of thing.

889
01:43:45,390 --> 01:43:51,470
So we'll talk about that. But I actually hadn't planned on it, but I think that we can absolutely do that.

890
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:55,980
I think it's something that is a wonderful thing to start thinking about now.

891
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:59,840
Um, I think that's true.

892
01:43:59,850 --> 01:44:04,179
Like I've only been in this role now for, you know. What a while.

893
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:07,350
And he gets better. Yeah.

894
01:44:07,630 --> 01:44:17,010
Yeah. I think we can talk a little bit about that in your prelim planning process and creating relationships with people for sure.

895
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:24,229
All right. So now a caveat.

896
01:44:24,230 --> 01:44:28,969
The timelines can vary. I showed it to you on the first day.

897
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:37,940
Right. So our timeline really can vary. We really want students to complete their coursework by the end of this year.

898
01:44:39,130 --> 01:44:43,870
Some people take classes in the fall, and I think that there are some classes.

899
01:44:47,350 --> 01:44:51,680
And there are some classes that you absolutely need to take. Two advance to.

900
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:58,940
And so you really want to make sure at least those. Our taking care of our cause.

901
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:05,880
Students take their premium exam in the summer ahead of their second year at the end of their second year.

902
01:45:05,890 --> 01:45:16,680
And then they. And we have the timing set up such that you would be stopped for a penalty on your first year and then during

903
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:25,440
your third year you're working on your putting together the many perspectives and perspectives to fans.

904
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:32,300
I would say, you know, we say it typically at the end of the third year, but I will be honest what I have seen more recently.

905
01:45:35,940 --> 01:45:43,260
It often is, really. I've seen the summer like.

906
01:45:44,690 --> 01:45:51,730
Because it's just. And it might be. What I've noticed over the last.

907
01:45:53,250 --> 01:46:00,149
That led things down with the idea of defending your dissertation the end of your fifth year because it's a five year program,

908
01:46:00,150 --> 01:46:06,760
although the first there can be variability there. So one thing about the defense is that also like.

909
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:13,100
One had. It's been like that just past seven days.

910
01:46:13,530 --> 01:46:24,280
So just on the faculty side. Or email saying We need to put everybody on my committee and have this meeting by that stage.

911
01:46:24,830 --> 01:46:31,610
That's true. And that just seems. So we advanced that.

912
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:35,400
I know she. None of them are.

913
01:46:36,290 --> 01:46:44,860
Yeah. The prospectus defense. I think that is also true. Well, so we so our main concern Agassi is not tied to.

914
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:50,970
At all. The Department of Health.

915
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:55,120
Our advancement to candidacy is desperately required.

916
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:05,060
Yeah. See I had to do a I had to defend my dissertation prospectus to be a doctoral candidate.

917
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:14,300
But that's not the case here. So that's why I really want you to get that coursework done on a personal level.

918
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:17,650
Second, I want you to be a doctoral candidate.

919
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:32,030
But she would have. I mean.

920
01:47:34,310 --> 01:47:38,650
To stay out of. You know well.

921
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:42,979
Lived here for two years as a student. It's very, very annoying.

922
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:53,430
And so the tuition is just. But of course, if there's issues, just talk with us.

923
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:01,580
Chris actually, and I work on a lot of those pieces, but those are the real big reasons.

924
01:48:01,590 --> 01:48:11,550
But yeah, it is a little different than some other programs in terms of like the dissertation component that is typical in other.

925
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:20,910
All right. So just to recap, we've got you know, this is all in the handbook.

926
01:48:20,910 --> 01:48:23,910
We sent out the Food on US handbook as well.

927
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:29,280
We need you to complete your core curriculum and your needs prior to premium.

928
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:39,450
Feel left ends many times. Actually, students can exempt out of some of the electives because they're HP to type courses,

929
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:45,209
but those are the ones that you need to complete prior to prelim.

930
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:50,970
And those are including the ones that you you know, you're already signed up to take grade.

931
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:55,180
So this class. Structural Funds.

932
01:48:58,060 --> 01:49:04,910
I saw an email that you. You think you will listen to her?

933
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:10,090
Hey. Like table or a number inside.

934
01:49:10,090 --> 01:49:20,360
You might want to be extra. And they're not even invited these things and those are required for a particular person.

935
01:49:21,700 --> 01:49:26,380
And then that's interesting for any correction how the analogy.

936
01:49:26,790 --> 01:49:29,890
Information about children, parents, research.

937
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:40,810
And one of. We're not following.

938
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,320
Here. There is all of those things.

939
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:55,670
And then you're all. You're caught me. I'm not sure where you are in your tummy thinking, but you want to take courses in your cognate as well.

940
01:49:58,130 --> 01:50:07,160
And just as you are thinking about your cognate, one little thing that I have sort of started thinking a little bit about it.

941
01:50:18,790 --> 01:50:24,450
The University of Virginia. Lots of confidence. But as you're planning.

942
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:34,890
Knowing that there's. Sir.

943
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:42,700
Need to take. It has to.

944
01:50:43,690 --> 01:50:51,610
Air traffic. And so we have two.

945
01:50:51,620 --> 01:50:59,479
Wonderful. Like there's a lot of restrictions that Barack Obama puts on to that.

946
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:05,770
So I just. It's been reported that some students planning that I.

947
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:13,360
You know, I don't. I'm. Further cognate expertise.

948
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:20,700
But those are not. So I just put her out there as a.

949
01:51:20,710 --> 01:51:25,240
Yeah. Sorry. Sorry for asking, but I guess it's clarified for others.

950
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:30,830
Yeah. How many courses do they all need to be?

951
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:35,899
What a great question. I knew I shouldn't have that slide.

952
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:41,740
I knew I should. I don't know if you guys know, but I know we've discussed a little bit in here, Courtney, and like.

953
01:51:41,930 --> 01:51:51,530
Yeah, I have at the prelim. Do you think that my sister and I will speak to that?

954
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:56,570
Like I've been talking about so many people's dissertation research faculty members.

955
01:51:56,850 --> 01:52:01,140
Yeah, I had to try. Yeah.

956
01:52:01,150 --> 01:52:08,050
So your club day needs to be 9 hours of coursework in your selected area.

957
01:52:09,030 --> 01:52:15,040
Um, so psychology, women and gender studies, demography, I mean,

958
01:52:15,490 --> 01:52:28,360
r c 1832 a lot of students end up choosing demography if they're on that studies training program for all of our students.

959
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:35,339
She's advanced research methods. Yeah.

960
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:38,940
I mean, it has to be special, a little more specialized than that. But like.

961
01:52:40,290 --> 01:52:43,550
Yeah. So they can be super broad.

962
01:52:44,030 --> 01:52:47,910
When you start to get into specific, it gets which it used to.

963
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:58,790
But I would just think through. That could be your coffee.

964
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:05,320
On the committee. Who is? At the University of Michigan.

965
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:12,660
Jeffrey. It seems either gibberish to me or.

966
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:23,290
So they have to deal with a lot of our faculty, for example, and possibly.

967
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:34,740
Our region has a 15% or she has some appointment at ESR and some equipment there in each region.

968
01:53:35,250 --> 01:53:40,260
But I mean, she's 50%. You're an agent dude. So right on degree granted.

969
01:53:42,100 --> 01:53:50,000
So was. I took the pledge to write a.

970
01:53:54,250 --> 01:53:59,440
And I don't think so because they're not part of that. You can't really.

971
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:14,760
I need to inform them at least that 50%. So I heard the chatter.

972
01:54:14,830 --> 01:54:18,280
So now he's into human as well as social work.

973
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:22,200
And here I need to see. 100%, but.

974
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:29,500
Hosni Mubarak. In your introduction, for example, tonight you will have a social worker called me like that.

975
01:54:30,130 --> 01:54:35,550
I haven't seen you. Policy in nursing.

976
01:54:36,180 --> 01:54:43,730
Yes. Yeah.

977
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:52,730
One, one, one side. Attached directly to the speaker.

978
01:54:53,550 --> 01:54:58,410
Distribution. We?

979
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:11,930
Rachel has been reading somewhere, in fact, that when I realized that the only person that.

980
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:16,899
I retired as a research investigator.

981
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:22,560
Over. Coming.

982
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:32,400
You know, and so I just I put that out there, but there's so many faculty there that do exactly what I look like putting that out there.

983
01:55:32,610 --> 01:55:37,380
Think an elephant. I don't know.

984
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:42,150
Don't be somebody like. It's a totally different thing. That's completely.

985
01:55:42,390 --> 01:55:46,100
Yeah, it's. That's from sight. Yeah. Huh.

986
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:52,190
Like, I'm trying to think, like. And people have had people, like.

987
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:57,260
Yeah. I mean, because it's your company, it is not like, oh, I'm getting something in.

988
01:55:57,270 --> 01:56:02,339
For example, like it's Alison's primary. It's like on his apology, for example.

989
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:07,210
And somebody was really interested. I mean, with adolescent and elementary.

990
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:11,060
Or something like that. And that was a cognitive.

991
01:56:16,390 --> 01:56:24,900
Cognitive psychology, right? You know, that special resolution or.

992
01:56:28,530 --> 01:56:36,940
Food insecurity. Right. Somebody. A couldn't.

993
01:56:39,530 --> 01:56:44,450
Really nice. And they allow us to do a special operation and then have that.

994
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:55,260
Interdisciplinary. I guess just thinking through that and nothing has to be planned right away.

995
01:56:55,290 --> 01:56:59,280
Obviously, it's just something for you to keep in the back of your mind so you don't get stuck.

996
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:08,339
And you have your floor where you're like, Oh, the coursework is going for free.

997
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:13,410
Well, yes, I'll be taking nine classes in your cognate area.

998
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:21,060
Well, three, 9 hours. Which classes are typically three hour credits, so.

999
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:33,450
Um, so essentially, um, I hope that, uh, we get all of your exemptions so that you can really plan this out.

1000
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:36,120
I do think the. You really can.

1001
01:57:38,830 --> 01:57:48,520
And you can always revise your exemption if you have other classes like you did, like kind of the bare minimum that I mean,

1002
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:56,350
not to say that you should exempt out of classes, but you we you cannot exempt up to a maximum of 18 credits.

1003
01:57:58,210 --> 01:58:04,810
And you should really work with your primary faculty mentor to really think about which ones are the best ones,

1004
01:58:05,410 --> 01:58:10,840
which electives might make sense, and which research methods courses might you already have?

1005
01:58:12,910 --> 01:58:19,270
I know we have some scheduling issues with the biased ads and AP, but.

1006
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:28,110
Hopefully that's been resolved. Yeah, I mean, there's no question and I'm thrilled I have an exemption to the Nasdaq so that.

1007
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:44,540
Right? Right. So once you have that complete, the exemptions of petition form include the syllabus, any details that then gets being sent to me.

1008
01:58:44,540 --> 01:58:53,410
And essentially what I do is. Right, especially for science and epidemiology.

1009
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:56,990
I reach out to the faculty members who teach them the courses and have.

1010
01:58:57,790 --> 01:59:02,290
So let's see if there's any materials that might be missing.

1011
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:08,520
Does that mean that if there are some areas that might not have been.

1012
01:59:10,210 --> 01:59:19,070
You. And our goal is to try to get more into a more dance class.

1013
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:27,010
It's not to force things upon you that you've already taken, but making sure you have that foundational knowledge.

1014
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:33,090
And if any questions come up, the whole DCC reviews that the materials together.

1015
01:59:38,490 --> 01:59:49,220
I guess I only brought that up because I wanted to make sure you all had that on your radar to think through as you progress to next semester.

1016
01:59:49,850 --> 01:59:57,020
All right. So our prelim exam, we have a separate handbook which lives in the heights.

1017
01:59:57,920 --> 02:00:01,390
So if you go to the Heights, educate your resources.

1018
02:00:01,970 --> 02:00:07,110
There's a doctoral student handbook right under. It is in prelim handbook.

1019
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:12,110
We are working and this will happen over the summer to have all week.

1020
02:00:12,350 --> 02:00:16,130
So as you all know, we now have a handbook that is accessible to everybody.

1021
02:00:17,930 --> 02:00:20,160
It wasn't as accessible before.

1022
02:00:20,630 --> 02:00:30,110
So but now we are going to be consolidating the prelim into our larger handbook so that you're not going to millions of places to find information.

1023
02:00:30,590 --> 02:00:35,630
That's a work in progress. It's quite amazing how much time goes into.

1024
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:40,480
Just be safe. But it's there.

1025
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:46,420
All the information is there for you, and it will be consolidated, hopefully this summer and for next year when you need it.

1026
02:00:47,770 --> 02:00:50,860
So essentially when you go to the handbook, this is what you see.

1027
02:00:51,310 --> 02:00:59,500
It's the things I'm going to walk with you, walk through with you today so that if there are any questions,

1028
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:09,700
you can go to that for the handbook and click on any of these and see all of this information that I'm going to share with you today.

1029
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:17,980
So the premium purpose is both in its broadest sense,

1030
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:25,420
to assess our students ability to do independent research in health behavior and health education,

1031
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:34,180
and to evaluate people's abilities to creatively and rigorously apply theory, knowledge and research methods to real world public health problems.

1032
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:44,600
So that's the broad. When we break this down a little bit more, we're thinking about three different components.

1033
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:51,410
So this includes theory. So the extent and quality of your knowledge in social media,

1034
02:01:51,410 --> 02:01:59,899
real sciences to the inability to critically annihilate the scientific literature and synthesize

1035
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:05,840
and apply that knowledge to develop conceptual models and research questions and programing.

1036
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:15,620
The really big fan of conceptual models, and you probably have not really done one here, but though, you know, 85,

1037
02:02:15,620 --> 02:02:26,090
86 is all conceptual models and you're very limited one could a conceptual model and as you move forward in your career,

1038
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:31,040
you'll find there'll be times that conceptual models are really helpful and then

1039
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:35,990
sometimes when they're not as helpful but this it's to give you that foundation into.

1040
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:43,310
So the next part is methodological and analytic skills.

1041
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:50,390
So it's to critically evaluate, critically evaluate and select appropriate applications of research methods.

1042
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:54,230
So what is the best research design for the research question?

1043
02:02:56,300 --> 02:03:03,530
Provide full expectation of selected methods for really knowing that method that you've chosen, why you've chosen it,

1044
02:03:04,850 --> 02:03:13,100
and then the necessary components describe them as well as the analytic techniques to address those research questions.

1045
02:03:13,610 --> 02:03:19,430
So this is really the research methods and data analysis piece that you want to be thinking about.

1046
02:03:23,470 --> 02:03:26,590
And then the third is interpretation and application.

1047
02:03:26,590 --> 02:03:32,770
So your ability to draw upon your conceptual models, to interpret your findings for whether it be interventions,

1048
02:03:32,770 --> 02:03:38,020
research public policies that address specific public health problems.

1049
02:03:38,090 --> 02:03:43,180
So this is really what where the broader focus or the broader purpose.

1050
02:03:46,060 --> 02:03:49,270
All right. So the structure, there's two parts.

1051
02:03:49,770 --> 02:03:55,870
Part one is to develop a conceptual model based on your chosen public health problem.

1052
02:03:56,890 --> 02:04:01,600
And part two is to develop either an intervention.

1053
02:04:03,530 --> 02:04:07,360
Kind of a research study, but an intervention to research study tears.

1054
02:04:07,410 --> 02:04:15,290
I think it's always like struggle, but this one a little bit. It's more of an observational study which it found that builds on your conceptual model.

1055
02:04:15,290 --> 02:04:18,800
And I'll walk through this a little bit, but these are your two main components,

1056
02:04:19,370 --> 02:04:24,380
and I'm going to walk you through those in detail and at any point, stop me if something's not clear.

1057
02:04:25,940 --> 02:04:35,060
So part one, the conceptual model. You all have a lot of time developing conceptual models in 85 and 86 we've started here.

1058
02:04:36,770 --> 02:04:41,780
So your conceptual model, there's different ways that people think about conceptual models.

1059
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:45,810
In this one, what you're going to. Developing a conceptual model.

1060
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:50,000
The problem. So you're going to.

1061
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:54,840
Talk about why is this public health? Why is it a public health problem?

1062
02:04:56,080 --> 02:04:59,080
So I have a lot of HIV prevention and treatment.

1063
02:04:59,580 --> 02:05:05,560
That's why this HIV. Right.

1064
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:11,270
And then you're going to be developing a conceptual model of.

1065
02:05:12,010 --> 02:05:18,060
Who is disproportionately impacted and. I was determined, at least.

1066
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:24,280
The literature is telling. Of why this is of.

1067
02:05:25,460 --> 02:05:28,900
And you're doing this with. Also.

1068
02:05:29,210 --> 02:05:40,970
So you'll be learning a lot. Available for use in 55 for working.

1069
02:05:43,700 --> 02:05:49,060
Now Singer is starting to think a little bit about the fundamental cause.

1070
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:56,290
There probably is another series.

1071
02:05:56,840 --> 02:06:06,640
Disciplines that are exciting for you to pull from and you're going to justify each of those components, identify gaps or.

1072
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:13,880
And at the end talking about where the intervention in policy.

1073
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:26,410
It, sir, as the texture of what your you're are focusing on and really thinking through and really getting a

1074
02:06:26,410 --> 02:06:33,520
grasp of the literature and creating this conceptual model of how do you understand the problem?

1075
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:36,670
How do you understand potentially the solutions to this problem?

1076
02:06:45,450 --> 02:06:49,050
Okay. Now hurt too.

1077
02:06:49,650 --> 02:06:57,580
So also just to know. This conceptual model does not need to be in part one does not need to be fully testable in a research study.

1078
02:06:57,670 --> 02:07:04,270
You're really talking about that. The larger context, it's the big one, right?

1079
02:07:04,540 --> 02:07:09,640
It's all these things, right. But in one research, you have been able to tackle everything.

1080
02:07:09,810 --> 02:07:17,290
Okay. So then in part two, you will be narrowing it down potentially a little bit.

1081
02:07:17,410 --> 02:07:23,290
So you're going to develop an intervention or a research study, observational study.

1082
02:07:24,310 --> 02:07:29,680
Building on your conceptual models and the gaps that you've identified and developed in part one.

1083
02:07:30,850 --> 02:07:34,840
So this is where. Right, you know.

1084
02:07:37,370 --> 02:07:46,700
Take money, example and get poverty and economic vulnerability drives HIV inequities among trans women of color.

1085
02:07:49,520 --> 02:08:01,930
And so therefore, we but there's no programs that have been shown to increase financial well-being in these other places, as I am talking to them.

1086
02:08:02,480 --> 02:08:06,280
But we still have the kindness to translate. So I.

1087
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:11,490
To create an intervention. Jocelyn.

1088
02:08:11,540 --> 02:08:15,810
You're talking on the phone, right? That's. England.

1089
02:08:16,030 --> 02:08:23,890
I've been thinking about playing. But the goal here is really even though there's all these other things that impact lives like HIV in athletics,

1090
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:30,219
but your positives demonstrate your methodological competence in that area.

1091
02:08:30,220 --> 02:08:33,340
So let's do it and it's related to your conception.

1092
02:08:33,670 --> 02:08:39,280
So you're building a conception. You don't build on your conceptual knowledge that you did in the first one,

1093
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:51,520
and you're going to be either addressing an intervention related to one of those issues or addressing a gap in the literature or an unresolved issue.

1094
02:08:52,750 --> 02:08:59,020
And this is, you know, comprehensive in addressing conceptual and methodological issues.

1095
02:08:59,020 --> 02:09:03,009
But what the so you have two different options.

1096
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:06,970
You can do an intervention study with an experimental design.

1097
02:09:08,150 --> 02:09:12,040
And I just am going to make a note here. It has to be quantitative methods for this.

1098
02:09:12,050 --> 02:09:20,120
This has come up in the past. But you really are demonstrating, if you're choosing an intervention study,

1099
02:09:20,570 --> 02:09:31,700
that you can really think through the quantitative methods of a rigorous experimental design or a, you know, experimental design.

1100
02:09:31,700 --> 02:09:33,620
But it's a rigorous quantitative methods.

1101
02:09:36,190 --> 02:09:45,580
For Option B, if it is like a research problem that you're addressing with an observational study and this can be qualitative or quantitative,

1102
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:49,960
it cannot be mixed methods. And this comes up every year.

1103
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:58,060
And the answer to this question is always such that you would never have the space to be able to adequately

1104
02:09:58,060 --> 02:10:03,820
demonstrate your knowledge of both qualitative and quantitative within the confines of the page or.

1105
02:10:06,030 --> 02:10:14,370
Even though we know mixed methods are beautiful, you really have to showcase in this part your expertise in these methods.

1106
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:20,070
Um. Yeah.

1107
02:10:20,150 --> 02:10:24,740
So you were just talking about our senators on our segment and some parts of the.

1108
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:35,960
But it's much more times we think. But mainly because the.

1109
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:44,850
Presentation cards, right? But it should sound familiar and parallel.

1110
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:59,549
Make that, keep that link. Yeah. And I will say so the interesting thing that's going to happen for your cohort and

1111
02:10:59,550 --> 02:11:04,560
I'm so curious to get everybody's feedback because of our sequencing of classes,

1112
02:11:05,660 --> 02:11:11,010
is that you will all be taking our base pairs of 88, 86 and 85,

1113
02:11:11,010 --> 02:11:18,270
whereas the other cohort is taking 85 and 86 and then goes into the experimental design and intervention development.

1114
02:11:19,470 --> 02:11:25,530
And a very strange experience. And I'm very curious because we have to have enough students in the class.

1115
02:11:25,830 --> 02:11:28,260
We combine first and second year cohorts,

1116
02:11:29,130 --> 02:11:37,140
but it means that when I'm offering the classes every year and so in this class you're going to be developing an intervention.

1117
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:40,500
I would encourage all of you to sort of.

1118
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:49,190
Think through some of the conceptual model pieces that you're learning in this class and the theory underlying theory,

1119
02:11:49,190 --> 02:11:55,790
even if it's not what's happening in the research methods class that you take with her next semester.

1120
02:11:56,770 --> 02:12:03,860
Um, that makes sense because the sequence is just a little weird because intervention should be theory driven

1121
02:12:06,050 --> 02:12:11,810
or conceptually driven where we're not just coming up with an idea to change the world out of nowhere.

1122
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:14,810
We want to understand how it works, why it works, why we think it would work.

1123
02:12:16,100 --> 02:12:22,399
And so when you do table based class, as you're building your intervention in your research,

1124
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:26,420
then I just encourage you to sort of think through those pieces.

1125
02:12:26,430 --> 02:12:32,990
And I'm sure you all are, but yeah, I'm sorry other members of the classes or those numbers.

1126
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:36,410
So that's a good question. What is rebase class?

1127
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:40,580
It's great that I get to go to my favorite figure out with that.

1128
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:49,140
Uh. So. This class is 821.

1129
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:55,350
It's called intervention research design. And I think it shows up for people as 810.

1130
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:07,110
And then once you. Sorry.

1131
02:13:07,130 --> 02:13:10,500
Yes, it's listed under 18. I'm sorry. It is?

1132
02:13:10,650 --> 02:13:15,970
Yeah, it's 18, but it's. She left.

1133
02:13:17,190 --> 02:13:22,200
So I think so it's it's a 2810.

1134
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:29,960
But I think unfortunately what happened. Is it listed under special type?

1135
02:13:30,910 --> 02:13:34,170
This is because it's a new insert hat.

1136
02:13:34,450 --> 02:13:37,690
This will be the second year it's taught, the second time it's taught.

1137
02:13:38,290 --> 02:13:42,020
And then it will become part. Yeah.

1138
02:13:42,090 --> 02:13:51,550
So that's just to demystify this for you. So 710, which you may have also seen on the Internet, is like special topics here.

1139
02:13:51,980 --> 02:13:55,340
So your friend. Sometimes the first.

1140
02:13:55,960 --> 02:13:59,100
On her new revision or something impersonating this.

1141
02:14:00,640 --> 02:14:05,490
In the case of her face black. It's a newly revised force to be worked out.

1142
02:14:06,870 --> 02:14:10,700
So it's going to be ten. Next destination.

1143
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:23,120
I just want to make sure you're signing up for the session. 5710 5932 three.

1144
02:14:26,900 --> 02:14:32,040
Sometimes you just triple check the names of the person who.

1145
02:14:33,070 --> 02:14:40,840
Female. Because I think that remains class.

1146
02:14:40,990 --> 02:14:44,110
It was originally set for 21% experimental.

1147
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:50,100
The Nine. But it's a little more student oriented.

1148
02:14:51,020 --> 02:14:57,170
And then now it's. 35 years ago this week.

1149
02:14:58,020 --> 02:15:01,530
Yeah, it does. Yeah, it's designed to provide you with.

1150
02:15:02,790 --> 02:15:09,600
Nuts and bolts. Nuts and bolts of intervention. Development and evaluation and experimental design.

1151
02:15:09,810 --> 02:15:17,710
And. It was identified as a gap that former students and how in our training.

1152
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:25,070
And so it was a lot of like here's the theory here is like creating something that

1153
02:15:25,090 --> 02:15:29,510
like how do we actually have the research skills to do it in the real world.

1154
02:15:29,530 --> 02:15:32,890
So that was, so that's been instituted.

1155
02:15:32,950 --> 02:15:38,230
Um, and so yeah, it's under eight, ten special topics whenever they sign up for it.

1156
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:48,760
Um, but yet I only bring that up because in teaching 86, which is individual theories of behavior change,

1157
02:15:49,420 --> 02:15:53,350
some of our students had already developed interventions that they wanted to work with.

1158
02:15:53,350 --> 02:15:55,120
And it's a little tricky to work backwards.

1159
02:15:55,510 --> 02:16:02,650
Backwards when you've developed an intervention without a conceptual or a theoretical foundation, and then you're asked to sort of.

1160
02:16:04,580 --> 02:16:09,160
Come up with a theory. Designed. So I only.

1161
02:16:09,490 --> 02:16:14,260
I only ever. Yeah. Because our classes should be sort of sequential and building blocks.

1162
02:16:14,260 --> 02:16:18,110
But I just I put that out there. The. It's just acting.

1163
02:16:21,670 --> 02:16:24,909
Private meetings, and that's all. Mm hmm. Now, winter.

1164
02:16:24,910 --> 02:16:35,190
Next winter turn. So as you're thinking through an attorney romance class.

1165
02:16:36,670 --> 02:16:41,040
Run for your life thinking about which theories?

1166
02:16:41,970 --> 02:16:47,660
The Crown. Sounds like anything from race class.

1167
02:16:48,430 --> 02:16:58,550
You could do an intervention. Race class, you will do an intervention and it is by a level different classes.

1168
02:16:58,690 --> 02:17:04,730
You can be a model that multilevel. Absolutely. So that may be something.

1169
02:17:11,220 --> 02:17:15,360
I feel like there are not high level retirements which do very, very.

1170
02:17:18,930 --> 02:17:35,220
The type of intervention. And what you're most interested in, to be honest.

1171
02:17:36,870 --> 02:17:42,540
So I'm going to just dive a little deeper into each of the ones at each of them.

1172
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:47,040
So part two and choose to do an intervention or an experimental design.

1173
02:17:48,030 --> 02:17:52,530
You are going to create a consolidated, a smaller conceptual model.

1174
02:17:54,100 --> 02:18:09,149
You don't have to understand. If you haven't already been thinking about this, you will get training in advance.

1175
02:18:09,150 --> 02:18:14,160
But you live on my program is to.

1176
02:18:15,870 --> 02:18:21,590
Or do you think? He took an injury prevention treatment.

1177
02:18:22,190 --> 02:18:30,750
And this is going. Do.

1178
02:18:37,130 --> 02:18:42,440
Intervention increases resources and self-efficacy.

1179
02:18:43,940 --> 02:18:47,770
For all these things and people that.

1180
02:18:49,270 --> 02:18:54,370
Eric. So that's one idea.

1181
02:18:54,690 --> 02:18:57,750
You're really thinking through those links and you want to.

1182
02:18:59,470 --> 02:19:06,140
Your intervention. So you're showing the testable aspect of your proposal.

1183
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:11,530
When you go to write grant proposals in the future. This is really.

1184
02:19:13,800 --> 02:19:19,620
Stuff you want to link up the model you want to create.

1185
02:19:19,830 --> 02:19:25,650
Talk about the links to your model and our relevance to your long term public health objectives.

1186
02:19:26,190 --> 02:19:32,290
If you're creating an intervention, we want to know about your program and the design of.

1187
02:19:33,390 --> 02:19:38,690
So, you know, is this. What do you envision?

1188
02:19:44,250 --> 02:19:47,730
But the original content of topics that will be covered.

1189
02:19:48,150 --> 02:19:52,500
Is this a group based intervention? Original. Is it in person?

1190
02:19:52,530 --> 02:19:57,300
It is a telenovela, isn't it? How do you envision this make?

1191
02:19:58,670 --> 02:20:05,660
And a rationale for that and a rationale for your study design is how are you going to do a large scale?

1192
02:20:07,130 --> 02:20:10,370
Has been. You.

1193
02:20:12,810 --> 02:20:16,800
How are you going to ensure other's internal and external validity?

1194
02:20:17,310 --> 02:20:20,310
You want to talk through your sample selection in your criteria.

1195
02:20:20,310 --> 02:20:35,620
So who's eligible for the study online? You want to talk and really describe your measures.

1196
02:20:36,100 --> 02:20:39,140
Um, psychometric properties measures.

1197
02:20:39,790 --> 02:20:44,780
If it hasn't been validated. Let's talk.

1198
02:20:50,610 --> 02:20:58,390
But acknowledging that it hasn't been. The advisory board members together tend to look at that.

1199
02:21:00,100 --> 02:21:05,350
You're going to talk about your data collection methods and then your evaluation process.

1200
02:21:06,070 --> 02:21:09,490
You also want to talk about the feasibility of the study in your research.

1201
02:21:10,570 --> 02:21:13,840
The research attacks and then really go into detail on your data.

1202
02:21:14,310 --> 02:21:17,820
His plan and the security plan.

1203
02:21:19,110 --> 02:21:25,400
So, I mean, I look at this and I'm like, these are this is literally right.

1204
02:21:25,590 --> 02:21:29,970
But you get another you decide when you're ready. Like, this is the big part of this.

1205
02:21:30,450 --> 02:21:34,139
So that and I do mostly intervention experimental design.

1206
02:21:34,140 --> 02:21:46,970
So all right. So part two which to be research problem I put up here observation because the research research study is there is a.

1207
02:21:47,780 --> 02:21:55,180
I know it doesn't help, but. I have a language and I get some of it.

1208
02:21:56,020 --> 02:22:02,300
All right. So here, this is a very popular approach for our students.

1209
02:22:02,540 --> 02:22:08,080
But so you're going to publicly state the problem and the rationale.

1210
02:22:08,980 --> 02:22:15,610
You're going to have this be developed from the conceptual model developed in part one.

1211
02:22:15,610 --> 02:22:22,480
We were linking to the gaps in the literature or unresolved issues.

1212
02:22:23,610 --> 02:22:36,770
You're going to make a statement at the research question. Question, Detective, and you want to be explicit in how that links to your legal scholar.

1213
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:42,050
As well, because again, part one is really not.

1214
02:22:43,060 --> 02:22:47,260
It's a bit like disaster. You really [INAUDIBLE] through this problem.

1215
02:22:48,660 --> 02:22:54,040
Its entirety. Here is let's let's figure out what research question we can answer.

1216
02:22:54,220 --> 02:23:01,120
Department. Everything. So you'll be explicit about the links.

1217
02:23:03,130 --> 02:23:08,070
And it's quantitative. This is if it's a meltdown or.

1218
02:23:14,960 --> 02:23:19,940
And you'll have it all along the red lines again to monitor public places and.

1219
02:23:20,570 --> 02:23:22,520
Interested in this particular research question.

1220
02:23:24,090 --> 02:23:31,420
I want to be very clear in your research design justification over what the methodology that you're proposing.

1221
02:23:32,940 --> 02:23:38,680
Um. The reason that you need to do this study is.

1222
02:23:40,240 --> 02:23:45,930
I'm choosing to do a one time process. The survey because of this.

1223
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:52,910
Annotations of. This is why this is important.

1224
02:23:54,530 --> 02:23:57,980
We'll talk about again, the sweetness that follows the same.

1225
02:24:02,240 --> 02:24:05,620
Pieces that for the intervention or experimental design you're going to.

1226
02:24:06,530 --> 02:24:09,700
What selection criteria for you?

1227
02:24:10,880 --> 02:24:12,920
Our analysis of the quantitative.

1228
02:24:13,490 --> 02:24:22,720
I have not read a qualitative premium and this is not an them, but I would assume that if you're going to end up with a five.

1229
02:24:23,230 --> 02:24:27,680
But when she's a positive person, they're going to.

1230
02:24:29,350 --> 02:24:33,010
But you're trying to reach saturation or something?

1231
02:24:34,660 --> 02:24:39,879
I don't know, Alison, if you've had that experience, but I would assume I'm not also qualitative person,

1232
02:24:39,880 --> 02:24:48,970
even though I seem to have a lot of performative stuff, but term in terms of just the rigor.

1233
02:24:48,970 --> 02:24:51,190
And this is something you work with your graders on.

1234
02:24:52,420 --> 02:25:04,059
Again, key variables, your evaluation plan, but you'll also be writing an evaluation or an analysis plan for a qualitative study as well.

1235
02:25:04,060 --> 02:25:15,550
You're going to be very specific and clear about is this a fanatic analysis, phenomenological, grounded theory, consensus?

1236
02:25:15,670 --> 02:25:20,379
You know, there's there's lots of different and you're going to talk about those different components.

1237
02:25:20,380 --> 02:25:24,490
And it's as you're gaining really strong training.

1238
02:25:24,490 --> 02:25:32,860
And she's asking in a lot of. You know, ensure the accuracy of these.

1239
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:45,730
Thinking. And also and you're going to talk about their research, feasibility and ethics and the significance of this work.

1240
02:25:49,990 --> 02:25:59,560
Any questions? No. We get the story after?

1241
02:26:00,020 --> 02:26:03,120
Yeah, I'm happy. And I definitely can send them to all of you.

1242
02:26:03,130 --> 02:26:09,840
Absolutely. Yeah. Has there been a leaning towards?

1243
02:26:14,270 --> 02:26:20,810
I don't really know. I mean, the students that I've been a greater for have chosen this one.

1244
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:27,960
But there are several students that I work with who have chosen or mentioned study as well.

1245
02:26:27,970 --> 02:26:31,030
So I can't I don't really have a broader sense.

1246
02:26:33,220 --> 02:26:42,030
Last year, last cohort took in small and it's kind of been like an even split like small cohorts

1247
02:26:42,040 --> 02:26:46,990
make it hard to a cohort of two people or three people kind of make it hard to know.

1248
02:26:48,250 --> 02:26:53,020
And I think historically it has been a not so. This study and that idea.

1249
02:26:54,700 --> 02:26:58,150
Look at this space. Here's my portal.

1250
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:02,850
Here's the next step in that search. And I've never taken this specific place.

1251
02:27:02,860 --> 02:27:13,230
So much more details, but out. Remember what I said about, like, intensive care reviewing?

1252
02:27:13,510 --> 02:27:22,069
Simple. French. Just much more critical sometimes than theory or research question, that kind of thing.

1253
02:27:22,070 --> 02:27:25,490
And I think that that is one particular approach here.

1254
02:27:27,320 --> 02:27:36,410
But for an intervention. Like the actual program that people are proposing is also I think this is maybe why people tend to.

1255
02:27:38,100 --> 02:27:42,390
That's just a lot to pull together. Especially if you are working.

1256
02:27:46,420 --> 02:27:50,000
So I think. What needs.

1257
02:27:51,170 --> 02:28:00,500
In a previous. A very heavy lift I that I think that that's.

1258
02:28:01,260 --> 02:28:07,410
That's why the. Yeah, that's.

1259
02:28:12,930 --> 02:28:19,160
Yeah. And then my the students who I have been at said the ones that I see.

1260
02:28:19,170 --> 02:28:22,950
And so they were present in 100%.

1261
02:28:22,950 --> 02:28:30,990
And that being their dissertation by any means, lots happens, but it gave them a really strong foundation for thinking.

1262
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:36,920
But what are the what could I or possibly not do for a dissertation?

1263
02:28:36,920 --> 02:28:43,920
And like I will be honest like. I think this is phenomenal.

1264
02:28:45,150 --> 02:28:48,980
But let's just. For this ten year dissertation.

1265
02:28:52,220 --> 02:28:58,130
Used to, at least to. You know, you can pick up.

1266
02:28:59,310 --> 02:29:12,800
And really think through it. But our students. Support her dissertation and so with her to be it does allow you to start thinking through.

1267
02:29:15,320 --> 02:29:20,389
We want you to think bigger than your dissertation on what you really think through the methods.

1268
02:29:20,390 --> 02:29:30,180
But it does start to sort of generate. At the same time some people are.

1269
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:37,410
But to do an intervention where. Is 9% healthy because.

1270
02:29:39,250 --> 02:29:45,840
For your dissertation. It's just I just think of like, what is what we're asking for from.

1271
02:29:50,660 --> 02:29:59,360
Pretty steady then. I don't think Rackham has the funds to write to give you an idea of the grants.

1272
02:30:00,260 --> 02:30:10,219
But yeah, but I think that both regardless of which avenue you choose and you choose an intervention study for prelim,

1273
02:30:10,220 --> 02:30:16,700
but then end up doing sort of observational type of work or research work for your dissertation,

1274
02:30:17,470 --> 02:30:22,520
often times you're still pulling on what you've learned from developing that conceptual model.

1275
02:30:22,520 --> 02:30:30,469
So I think it's really where do you want to really where do you see the literature needing to go?

1276
02:30:30,470 --> 02:30:39,450
What are you interested in really focusing in on? To demonstrate also your your expertise,

1277
02:30:40,620 --> 02:30:49,799
because this is where we're trying to evaluate your ability to really think through theory, apply it to your own research problem,

1278
02:30:49,800 --> 02:30:55,920
and then really develop a research study, whether it be an experimental design,

1279
02:30:55,920 --> 02:31:00,950
an intervention, or an observational study that's really addressing a research problem or.

1280
02:31:00,960 --> 02:31:06,180
QUESTION. Yeah. All right.

1281
02:31:07,110 --> 02:31:11,850
Okay. So our structure. So this is why this can be challenging.

1282
02:31:12,270 --> 02:31:19,649
I know it seems like a lot to write, but when you start to think about all of the components of it, it's like kind of not so together.

1283
02:31:19,650 --> 02:31:29,250
Parts want it to be no longer than 50 pages, double spaced, one inch margins or tens of firms.

1284
02:31:30,900 --> 02:31:37,139
So part one and two must each be no fewer than 20 pages, no more than 30 pages.

1285
02:31:37,140 --> 02:31:47,010
So we want you to be spending an equal time on both the both this is inclusive of your conceptual model, which is big.

1286
02:31:47,970 --> 02:31:52,050
People have big ones. It's so much.

1287
02:31:52,620 --> 02:31:55,880
And we really need to be able to see it and read it.

1288
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:02,250
Your references don't count, but you cannot have appendices.

1289
02:32:03,330 --> 02:32:10,380
Setting an amount of times I've been asked that question is really fun and so is a no.

1290
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:17,850
And when we write grants or proposals now we can't put appendices here.

1291
02:32:17,880 --> 02:32:21,840
So it's kind of good practice for learning how to write really concisely.

1292
02:32:24,090 --> 02:32:36,270
The other thing that I wanted to know is that so you should be preparing during your to it's I

1293
02:32:36,270 --> 02:32:43,290
love coming here now to start putting this in your heads and to be working with your mentor,

1294
02:32:43,290 --> 02:32:46,830
especially next semester thinking about your topics.

1295
02:32:48,060 --> 02:32:56,820
I'm sure you already are doing this, but but once that exam period begins, you cannot consult with faculty.

1296
02:32:56,820 --> 02:33:04,740
Other students see stars, the writing center, potential mentors and even each other.

1297
02:33:05,910 --> 02:33:15,460
So even if you were like. You have to reach out.

1298
02:33:17,930 --> 02:33:21,360
I mean, even silly little things like it's an exam.

1299
02:33:21,980 --> 02:33:28,160
I think it's the honor system. But, you know, if there is a question of like.

1300
02:33:30,190 --> 02:33:36,790
We surely can't have appendices like ask it to me and I'll send it to everybody.

1301
02:33:39,580 --> 02:33:48,100
So prelim grading cell faculty graders, you'll have to faculty members assigned to grade your prelim.

1302
02:33:49,720 --> 02:33:54,340
The faculty graders review and committee comment on the grades independently.

1303
02:33:54,400 --> 02:33:59,230
If there is a tiebreaker needed, they will come at a third person will come in.

1304
02:34:00,490 --> 02:34:09,640
If a consensus can't be reached, the grading team will determine which faculty member sort of synthesizes that feedback.

1305
02:34:11,020 --> 02:34:19,060
And then both faculty members meet with the student if necessary, provide, agree and and give their feedback to the chair, which is me right now.

1306
02:34:20,200 --> 02:34:24,990
Um. I just want to make a note of that.

1307
02:34:27,160 --> 02:34:31,630
Next year. At this time I will inform them the chair, not the chair.

1308
02:34:33,230 --> 02:34:39,430
Will reach out to you. Interesting.

1309
02:34:42,280 --> 02:34:47,090
The paragraph justifying. I was.

1310
02:34:52,010 --> 02:34:56,480
But then what happens is. Or do you want to be a writer?

1311
02:34:57,710 --> 02:35:02,420
And we asked the doctor herself. Check in with that faculty that.

1312
02:35:03,190 --> 02:35:10,660
Available. You should have already done that. Right like.

1313
02:35:14,210 --> 02:35:23,390
Think great in terms of real love and. You don't want to see people always reading that.

1314
02:35:23,430 --> 02:35:32,059
It's just so. You're breaking them and, you know, certainly with them.

1315
02:35:32,060 --> 02:35:43,130
But students get to have an active role in who their grading team is and who their audiences and the team gets.

1316
02:35:44,180 --> 02:35:48,410
It is only tenure track faculty. So.

1317
02:35:49,550 --> 02:35:55,610
Yes. Exam. No clinical research and no research faculty.

1318
02:35:57,320 --> 02:36:02,700
Are. Huge, big, huge, big ticket traffic.

1319
02:36:03,450 --> 02:36:08,280
Yeah. Familiarize yourself with what's in it for.

1320
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:18,200
We know. Clear.

1321
02:36:19,300 --> 02:36:23,330
Yeah, I should say. My whole family.

1322
02:36:27,540 --> 02:36:36,190
One that. So the word.

1323
02:36:40,780 --> 02:36:44,660
As long as they're in that first stage, we keep. Okay.

1324
02:36:45,590 --> 02:36:52,900
So, yeah, I mean, I'm looking right now at our website as faculty and it says core faculty.

1325
02:36:52,910 --> 02:36:59,900
But when I look at this, there's a few faculty members who are on here who are research faculty or critical faculty.

1326
02:36:59,910 --> 02:37:03,790
So as an example, say that another it doesn't it's doesn't specify.

1327
02:37:03,800 --> 02:37:12,440
You have to click on to their profile. So like as an example, Mary tended to stand on their own daughter.

1328
02:37:12,460 --> 02:37:20,900
She's research faculty. She would not be able to do that. Bill Lopez, phenomenal clinical track, so wouldn't be able to do that.

1329
02:37:21,290 --> 02:37:28,609
You kind of have to click around, but the majority of our we have very few clinical and research faculty,

1330
02:37:28,610 --> 02:37:32,280
so the majority will be but you'll just want to click just to double check.

1331
02:37:40,330 --> 02:37:47,170
And your mentor should really be. And if you have a secondary mentor and he can really help you with that,

1332
02:37:47,740 --> 02:37:53,860
those decision making processes and thinking about who are the best people based on your interests and the design,

1333
02:37:53,860 --> 02:38:03,250
the methods that you're interested in. So yeah, good opportunity to sort of start to get getting to know our faculty.

1334
02:38:04,990 --> 02:38:09,569
All right. So the greeting is high pass, which I've never seen.

1335
02:38:09,570 --> 02:38:14,340
And I'm sure it's happened, but I haven't seen it pass.

1336
02:38:14,830 --> 02:38:22,239
Provisional pass with a rewrite or virtual faculty graders can encourage your prior students with

1337
02:38:22,240 --> 02:38:28,149
any grade other than a high pass to take additional coursework in an area deemed weak by graders.

1338
02:38:28,150 --> 02:38:35,560
And this is not a bad thing. This is like this is like, okay, you passed.

1339
02:38:35,680 --> 02:38:44,520
This was okay. But you know what? I really think he needs to get a little more training in, like you're going to do the quantitative methodology.

1340
02:38:44,530 --> 02:38:49,640
So you need to go like learn structural pattern modeling for your dissertation like you have.

1341
02:38:49,660 --> 02:38:54,370
Dale Right. And so it's not designed to penalize you by any means.

1342
02:38:54,370 --> 02:39:05,260
It's designed to make sure you have the tools for success and that will not delay your candidacy whatsoever.

1343
02:39:05,890 --> 02:39:12,850
You just had to finish that prior to graduation. So the timeline.

1344
02:39:13,330 --> 02:39:16,420
So early next semester you'll start developing.

1345
02:39:16,420 --> 02:39:20,400
A lot of students create a directed reading list with their mentor.

1346
02:39:21,490 --> 02:39:27,760
They will enroll in an independent study course sometimes where they really just focus on prelim with their mentors.

1347
02:39:29,200 --> 02:39:34,830
You want to start to begin to identify potential faculty members for your grading committee and

1348
02:39:35,110 --> 02:39:40,930
reach out to those faculty members to determine whether they're willing to be on your committee.

1349
02:39:42,010 --> 02:39:49,740
I keep a file that you want them to see at the faculty grading history because we chat,

1350
02:39:49,780 --> 02:39:56,139
you know, like we just try to make it so that like it's not like an example.

1351
02:39:56,140 --> 02:39:59,980
Like Allison has graded five years in a row.

1352
02:39:59,980 --> 02:40:04,540
Kirstie has it graded ever, right? Like we really want to make sure that.

1353
02:40:05,720 --> 02:40:10,380
Yeah. And then December 1st, I'll send you a reminder.

1354
02:40:10,390 --> 02:40:13,240
Submit a list of 3 to 4 potential faculty members,

1355
02:40:13,240 --> 02:40:19,750
a paragraph to justify why you feel like you should be on your committee and what skills and strengths they bring to you.

1356
02:40:21,460 --> 02:40:25,090
And that's when we as a committee review it.

1357
02:40:25,090 --> 02:40:31,930
Along with that file, we reach out to those faculty members to confirm their commitment to working with you.

1358
02:40:31,930 --> 02:40:35,110
And then we assign those grading teams.

1359
02:40:36,460 --> 02:40:50,590
So I you know, we say January 31st is typically a little sooner and that students and graders are in front of their committee in February.

1360
02:40:51,070 --> 02:40:55,450
So so students can have up to three meetings with third graders.

1361
02:40:57,250 --> 02:41:01,580
And this is an opportunity you can not in these meetings be like.

1362
02:41:02,630 --> 02:41:05,900
I dropped my. Right.

1363
02:41:05,980 --> 02:41:11,420
Like they can't read your mouth, but. You can have.

1364
02:41:13,230 --> 02:41:17,140
How do you walk people? Around 15,000.

1365
02:41:20,290 --> 02:41:27,579
A draft of your conceptual model. I strongly encourage like that February 28th meeting.

1366
02:41:27,580 --> 02:41:32,460
It's really. Be prepared for specifics because.

1367
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:43,190
There's not a lot of time. Feedback, sometimes different types of feedback and learning.

1368
02:41:44,120 --> 02:41:46,110
And so it's just nice to come prepared.

1369
02:41:48,010 --> 02:41:58,960
You're going to March 1st, complete our doctoral deeply analyzed for post-doctoral preliminary exam agreement and submit a copy to us.

1370
02:41:59,170 --> 02:42:05,290
And then you can have your second meeting with your committee and then a third meeting by April 21.

1371
02:42:05,740 --> 02:42:14,140
And it has to be done by April 29th because you'd be starting the exam in May, and that's the timeline.

1372
02:42:21,510 --> 02:42:24,960
Agree that that first meeting I especially now.

1373
02:42:25,830 --> 02:42:30,280
Bringing together faculty like me to work together. Sample.

1374
02:42:34,100 --> 02:42:38,170
Drive. I have some version of.

1375
02:42:39,150 --> 02:42:43,350
I think that this. And it will be a one.

1376
02:42:46,250 --> 02:42:50,720
Yeah. Longer than that. So just keeping in mind that.

1377
02:42:53,270 --> 02:42:58,370
So with this information, again, you know that you know.

1378
02:42:58,640 --> 02:43:03,530
Would you agree, Christine? Absolutely. I think that first meeting can be.

1379
02:43:06,950 --> 02:43:11,580
It can be overwhelming just because it's the nature of it being an examination, right?

1380
02:43:11,620 --> 02:43:20,890
And the nature of it being like there's just things about it that are anxiety producing and you're like.

1381
02:43:21,890 --> 02:43:27,760
You know, I it's this funny thing Cleveland said to me, something like, we have the best job in the world.

1382
02:43:27,780 --> 02:43:36,229
They were the best in the worst because it's also like we we have so much autonomy and get to do what we want is so great in so many ways.

1383
02:43:36,230 --> 02:43:41,090
But we're like constantly critiqued, like always left and right and rejected here and there.

1384
02:43:41,630 --> 02:43:44,900
And so in that first meeting, you might get a lot of feedback.

1385
02:43:47,870 --> 02:43:52,760
Because people are excited. Because people are excited. Right. And they want to like share their thoughts.

1386
02:43:53,750 --> 02:44:01,880
But it can be really overwhelming and not feel so great. And I'm not going to say that's always the experience, but it can be.

1387
02:44:02,240 --> 02:44:09,620
And to the extent that you have sort of this is what you're thinking, these are the areas that you have questions about.

1388
02:44:10,730 --> 02:44:15,710
Obviously open to other people, suggestions. Maybe there's something you're completely missing.

1389
02:44:16,790 --> 02:44:24,080
But the graders are really there to, like, help. They want to get you through this and watch you grow.

1390
02:44:25,040 --> 02:44:29,330
But yet. So that's the extent that you are sort of coming in steering the ship.

1391
02:44:29,450 --> 02:44:33,529
It's it's basically I don't know, that kind of thing.

1392
02:44:33,530 --> 02:44:41,420
But right now, I hear a lot of. I thought that over working on that.

1393
02:44:43,250 --> 02:44:53,650
Yeah. Who? Sometimes. They were only coming out in the had to have.

1394
02:44:57,010 --> 02:45:05,700
Is it kind of like. Well, they know that we.

1395
02:45:06,740 --> 02:45:14,660
It takes a we. I know.

1396
02:45:14,670 --> 02:45:23,000
And I felt. We will come in prepared and could the questions.

1397
02:45:25,190 --> 02:45:32,180
Just kidding? Well, not really. But I think to the extent that you can steer that ship out and what do you.

1398
02:45:33,380 --> 02:45:39,470
There has. Otherwise, there's the potential that it would spark some.

1399
02:45:41,400 --> 02:45:46,230
I had to face it. Well, I think what you should do is listen instead.

1400
02:45:46,290 --> 02:45:49,500
And all of a sudden, 45 minutes is spent on something that I.

1401
02:45:50,490 --> 02:45:55,490
It's some of the most. And then there is that.

1402
02:45:55,860 --> 02:46:00,630
Well, it's fun. And it's just a. I like.

1403
02:46:05,280 --> 02:46:09,290
But. And then like your question.

1404
02:46:13,940 --> 02:46:17,240
I'm not saying this, but I just think to the.

1405
02:46:17,690 --> 02:46:26,890
Extraordinary. But to the extent that. There are faculty who are very good parents like her answer questions and.

1406
02:46:28,900 --> 02:46:36,410
Roll in. They also know they can read your writing, but they can provide you with.

1407
02:46:37,250 --> 02:46:41,000
President. They might.

1408
02:46:42,710 --> 02:46:47,060
During the new body of literature. That is really important and that's great.

1409
02:46:50,070 --> 02:46:53,300
Question does not. Not. A very different.

1410
02:46:55,770 --> 02:47:00,410
Yeah. I just. I don't know. But my experience has been that it's nice.

1411
02:47:03,010 --> 02:47:06,320
It feels as a family for that.

1412
02:47:08,340 --> 02:47:11,630
Some structural adjustment. Another thing to say that.

1413
02:47:13,960 --> 02:47:20,060
Let's go forward and. But you better decorator.

1414
02:47:21,030 --> 02:47:24,050
So. You've been through that a lot.

1415
02:47:24,060 --> 02:47:28,510
And I happen to. We understand now.

1416
02:47:30,300 --> 02:47:34,740
Well, what I think. But.

1417
02:47:35,500 --> 02:47:39,400
Your mentor can be in another situation, Doctor. Has a lot of.

1418
02:47:44,910 --> 02:47:56,880
Yeah. And I'm just going to have. People that come together with their first hearing about the ideas that they might.

1419
02:47:59,070 --> 02:48:08,440
Different directions, which could ultimately be helpful, but. I may have your title on that question.

1420
02:48:09,580 --> 02:48:21,330
10 minutes. She's in the hands of my friend and then, like, make sure to stop.

1421
02:48:22,270 --> 02:48:26,740
And that's really seven. I know this sounds.

1422
02:48:28,290 --> 02:48:33,750
A summary of this discussion. You know, things that I heard that I should definitely.

1423
02:48:37,800 --> 02:48:40,960
Human intervention. What advice?

1424
02:48:43,290 --> 02:48:46,860
But he made his first point. We also discussed this.

1425
02:48:52,940 --> 02:49:01,210
I think that has been proven helpful. I know the real people who know and how to be useful for you guys.

1426
02:49:03,260 --> 02:49:08,780
Then if you do not like this, I think is it is it okay for student if somebody wanted to like summarize.

1427
02:49:10,990 --> 02:49:15,190
This is my takeaway from the meeting. The other thing that's.

1428
02:49:16,220 --> 02:49:28,440
Yeah. And I do know that. Some students have also asked when faculty permission can be recorded because some faculty cough really fast.

1429
02:49:29,970 --> 02:49:34,740
And it's really hard when you're getting a lot of feedback to like really like,

1430
02:49:34,740 --> 02:49:40,860
remember also just they just don't care their purpose, you know, just so that I know, you know.

1431
02:49:43,850 --> 02:49:49,850
Sometimes I see things that I think I don't remember very like and then, you know, it's important.

1432
02:49:51,890 --> 02:49:56,500
So. What is that, actually?

1433
02:49:58,160 --> 02:50:04,340
Yeah. Yeah. So just quickly with that, that DPA is online on the site.

1434
02:50:04,460 --> 02:50:11,000
There are typically four options for taking the exam. The grading dates are fixed once a start date is selected.

1435
02:50:11,840 --> 02:50:23,569
Um. You want to say that you want to be sure all the dates and meeting times are recorded in your calendar determine any guidelines for reminder.

1436
02:50:23,570 --> 02:50:27,649
So like some faculty are like really good at remembering things, others are not.

1437
02:50:27,650 --> 02:50:35,630
So calendar invites are always really great. So here are sort of the key dates and I'll walk you through with an example.

1438
02:50:36,170 --> 02:50:46,790
So this as a as an example, the start dates for the exam for 2022 for Anthony Mora Mermaid second, nine, 16th and 23rd.

1439
02:50:47,630 --> 02:50:55,850
And that is because of the timeline and meaning to finish able to be a really big wrap up

1440
02:50:55,850 --> 02:51:03,590
staff look at this in August so Jackie will email you an exam on the start date of that.

1441
02:51:03,650 --> 02:51:07,820
You're going to leave now and she'll be clear at 9 a.m. that day.

1442
02:51:11,360 --> 02:51:14,419
We'll send back the in 12 days after.

1443
02:51:14,420 --> 02:51:26,810
So you essentially have. Then, Jacki, the 76 faculty graders, the DCC is notified if there's a need for a tiebreaker.

1444
02:51:27,590 --> 02:51:41,710
The exam is sent to the tiebreaker eight after the grades receive the grades or integrated and so that readers have two weeks to grade the DCC chair.

1445
02:51:41,720 --> 02:51:44,990
We'll send you the graded feedback the following Monday.

1446
02:51:44,990 --> 02:51:48,110
If it's a pass. A provisional pass.

1447
02:51:49,760 --> 02:51:56,180
If. If you pass that down, if it's a provisional class or a revision the committee meets with.

1448
02:51:56,730 --> 02:52:00,270
The two discussed the feedback and the timeline for rewrites.

1449
02:52:01,350 --> 02:52:06,100
If it does fail, the. If the student and their primary returned in one week.

1450
02:52:06,110 --> 02:52:09,500
So I'll just walk you through that piece.

1451
02:52:10,880 --> 02:52:18,230
So the summary for rewrites. So you would have four weeks to do the revision.

1452
02:52:18,230 --> 02:52:20,870
So the faculty will tell you explicitly.

1453
02:52:23,010 --> 02:52:31,050
If you've ever worked on a paper before and submitted it to a journal, it's almost like a revise and resubmit.

1454
02:52:31,740 --> 02:52:36,750
Where they're going to send you a bunch of feedback and you're going to respond to each of their points.

1455
02:52:39,030 --> 02:52:41,730
Jackie will circulate that to the committee members.

1456
02:52:42,920 --> 02:52:49,040
Six days from that moment, if there's a tiebreaker that's needed, the exam will be sent to the tiebreakers.

1457
02:52:49,790 --> 02:53:02,359
And then 15 days from the receipt of the exam, all of the feedback is due to the DCC and then I will notify students of their grades if it's a fail.

1458
02:53:02,360 --> 02:53:10,160
At that point, the graders will meet with this student and their primary mentor to provide feedback and create a plan for retaking the exam,

1459
02:53:11,180 --> 02:53:21,290
including any necessary coursework. So this is just an example of like tentatively what, 2023 for our.

1460
02:53:22,990 --> 02:53:29,100
I was working on this the other day, so I thought I knew Jackie Chan like that.

1461
02:53:30,560 --> 02:53:41,200
And so this is an example of, you know, back here at Chelsea Leicester's start date.

1462
02:53:41,230 --> 02:53:50,800
So they would have these different start dates of Monday night and then the exam is due 12 days later.

1463
02:53:51,850 --> 02:53:58,300
That tiebreaker is alerted. The faculty graders must submit the grades to us.

1464
02:53:59,120 --> 02:54:05,220
We notify the students on Monday. Faculty meets with the students at their.

1465
02:54:05,570 --> 02:54:09,020
A rewrite needed. That rewrite starts on that same day.

1466
02:54:10,300 --> 02:54:16,990
You have 28 days to do that. The tiebreaker is I learned the grades are submitted.

1467
02:54:17,870 --> 02:54:22,430
We notify the student and if a meeting is needed, it occurs then.

1468
02:54:23,790 --> 02:54:28,320
It's plausible if they have these dates, right. There's definitely a chance that.

1469
02:54:30,970 --> 02:54:34,850
That there might actually end up being able to be a start in.

1470
02:54:37,680 --> 02:54:45,820
We haven't gotten an announcement yet. It didn't seem to go down typically as obvious.

1471
02:54:47,750 --> 02:54:50,920
Possibility there. That'd be an additional time.

1472
02:54:51,410 --> 02:54:56,930
If people travel for the summer, you want to make sure they're great or something.

1473
02:54:56,930 --> 02:55:04,550
Like They're going to want to look at this too. And you know, like, yeah, you know, I can breed during these days, you know?

1474
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:14,190
Make sure that. You can really just focus on writing.

1475
02:55:16,150 --> 02:55:23,270
And. The free rides are free.

1476
02:55:24,260 --> 02:55:28,430
Free rides can be common. Yes. So.

1477
02:55:28,820 --> 02:55:34,010
And reroutes, you know, it's our entire life. Revising this event is like.

1478
02:55:35,930 --> 02:55:39,620
And I believe that their revisions are really designed.

1479
02:55:50,640 --> 02:55:53,680
And respond to. But.

1480
02:55:55,590 --> 02:56:00,870
I would plan for it here, Summer. We wouldn't need it.

1481
02:56:00,870 --> 02:56:07,590
But I planned for it just in case. If you ever have questions about anything, you.

1482
02:56:07,700 --> 02:56:16,260
I'll have my email address. Jackie is phenomenal at answering sort of logistical questions and if especially when like links aren't working.

1483
02:56:18,090 --> 02:56:21,220
So those are our email addresses. Yeah.

1484
02:56:24,420 --> 02:56:28,820
I got the lot of me talking.

1485
02:56:28,830 --> 02:56:39,600
I apologize. I also recognize that it's it's definitely a lot of information and feels far away.

1486
02:56:39,600 --> 02:56:47,340
And that's good. So if questions come up as you're working on Netflix, then year in the town.

1487
02:56:53,150 --> 02:57:00,010
A lot of our soldiers. Restaurants based on their experiences and not.

1488
02:57:01,330 --> 02:57:15,250
Thank you for your. And I think.

1489
02:57:21,050 --> 02:57:25,370
Demonstrating how you filter down to an area you're interested in.

1490
02:57:28,150 --> 02:57:39,360
That public health problem, it's likely. Any other question, any questions that I.

1491
02:57:43,600 --> 02:57:47,129
So I just think, you know, because we're supposed. Interesting.

1492
02:57:47,130 --> 02:57:52,350
First this. Yeah, I went through.

1493
02:57:57,500 --> 02:58:05,400
Not eight make. Even in the fact that perhaps.

1494
02:58:12,970 --> 02:58:16,790
Six of life. And so it gets old.

1495
02:58:17,200 --> 02:58:20,240
And I just think we just. So.

1496
02:58:51,650 --> 02:59:11,960
I think. When you register to vote, I guess I have to.

1497
02:59:16,960 --> 02:59:32,480
That experience. It's kind of a dual code name.

1498
02:59:33,200 --> 02:59:54,440
Yes. It it's kind of it was like. Now some of the other persons here.
