1
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:10,369
The first unit of our course is focused
on understanding the structure and

2
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:15,055
function of healthcare,
public health and regulatory systems.

3
00:00:15,055 --> 00:00:18,595
We're gonna spend time discussing
how public health is organized and

4
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:23,385
structured, how the US healthcare
system works, and then we'll consider

5
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:28,185
the different regulatory systems that
are in place and how they're organized.

6
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:31,445
So in this first module,
we're gonna focus on the structure and

7
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:33,205
function of public health.

8
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:38,780
And I think the best place to start is
to really define what public health is.

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,010
So often times the public thinks about
public health as meaning different things.

10
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,050
It could be disaster response,
it might be healthcare for

11
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,060
the poor,
it could be behavioral interventions,

12
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,230
like limiting the types of food
you're allowed to consume.

13
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,180
It could be restaurant inspections for
cockroaches.

14
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:04,040
Or what we might commonly think of,
making sure everyone is vaccinated for

15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,460
an infectious disease like influenza.

16
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,220
To help us define this though,

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,580
I wanna look at some different
definitions that have been developed.

18
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,030
Let's take a look at some
of the core principles

19
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,260
drawn from a definition of
public health by CEA Winslow.

20
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,880
You'll see that Winslow defines
public health as the science and

21
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,710
art of preventing disease, prolonging
life, promoting health and efficiency

22
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,905
through organized community effort,
controlling communicable infections,

23
00:01:32,905 --> 00:01:38,285
educating individuals on personal hygiene,
organizing medical care,

24
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:42,785
developing mechanisms to ensure
everyone can maintain their health and

25
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:48,835
ultimately allowing every citizen
to realize health and longevity.

26
00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:51,105
So that's a pretty broad definition and

27
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:55,100
I think we should look at
more concise one as well.

28
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:00,150
Public health is the set of activity
a society undertakes to monitor and

29
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,690
improve the health of its
collective membership.

30
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:08,810
So that means we focus on
preventing disease and injury.

31
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,000
Instead of considering just individual
needs, public health is focusing

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,510
on the public needs and
how society can provide for them.

33
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,280
So a career in public health then, is
different from other health professions.

34
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,150
In medicine, nursing,
dentistry, pharmacy, and

35
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:31,150
social work,
there's often an individual provider, and

36
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:37,100
individual patient, an emphasis on
treating a specific illness or disability.

37
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,850
But in public health,
the emphasis is on societal benefit, and

38
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:47,230
how individual patients can collectively
improve their health status.

39
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,840
So let's take an example then
to think about the difference.

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,410
A dentist might treat an individual
patient for dental caries.

41
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,480
Now that really means they're treating
them for what we call a cavity.

42
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,280
Here, the provider is the dentist.

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,170
And the patient is the person
that's receiving treatment.

44
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,420
But in public health,

45
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:14,020
the government looks across all people to
help prevent dental carries for everyone.

46
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,760
So that means that a decision might
get made to fluoridate the water.

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,810
In fact,
that has been made throughout history.

48
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,660
Making fluoridated water available to
everyone in the community to try and

49
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,720
address this health
challenge collectively,

50
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,020
instead of one patient at a time.

51
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,430
So the mission then of public health
is all about focusing on activities

52
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:42,820
that society undertakes to monitor and
improve the population's health

53
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,990
so this process has been evolving over
time and we've seen a shift in the way

54
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,780
public health is approached
especially over the last century.

55
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,170
In the early part of the 20th century,

56
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,100
the focus of public health was on
infectious disease prevention.

57
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,610
How do we avoid contracting smallpox?

58
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,900
How can we protect citizens
from a flu pandemic?

59
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,000
But as technology and research advanced,

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,140
the focus shifted more toward dealing
with non-communicable diseases,

61
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,300
like obesity, and chronic conditions
like asthma and cardiovascular disease.

62
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,260
If you expand that even further,
injury prevention.

63
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,890
Should citizens be allowed to drink and
drive?

64
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:29,010
What are the regulations associated
with distracted driving?

65
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:34,840
This evolution is what we consider
new versus old public health.

66
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,880
Now as you can imagine, that's why it's
not really that easy to draw clear lines

67
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,630
around the exact definition
of public health.

68
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,970
So another aspect then of defining
public health is making the distinction

69
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,340
between public health and healthcare,
or more specifically medical care.

70
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,550
So I wanna take a few moments to
really think about how the two differ.

71
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,300
Public health focuses on industry and
environment.

72
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:08,050
On healthy individuals and systems
that we set up to keep people healthy.

73
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,440
So if we compare that to medical care,

74
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,520
medical care tends to
focus on sick individuals.

75
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,080
Public health has
a preventive orientation, and

76
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,340
medical care has a curative orientation.

77
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,620
Then if we think about the providers,

78
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,670
public health providers
are often health departments.

79
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:35,170
While our medical care providers
are physicians and hospitals.

80
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,470
Finally, if we think about who
the focus is on, in Public Health,

81
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,040
we're focusing on the public sector.

82
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,490
And in Medical Care, we're often
focusing on the private sector.

83
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,720
So if public health is focused
on the public's wellness and

84
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,970
the ability to remain healthy and
productive

85
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,290
what are some of the core values that we
can think of in terms of public health?

86
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,640
Well, one core value is
the idea of disease prevention.

87
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,400
So that means we're looking to
ensure that we can protect citizens

88
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,140
from getting sick in the first place.

89
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,350
At the same time,

90
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:14,010
public health has a core value of health
promotion making it easier to be healthy.

91
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,620
So that means promoting healthy behaviors.

92
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,010
And if you think about some examples,
maybe we're reducing pollution in a place

93
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:26,220
where large number of people have asthma
to help address that health challenge.

94
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,440
Another really important core
value is social justice.

95
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:36,410
We need to develop systems that allow
all citizens to receive equitable care.

96
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,850
Think about neighborhoods in a community,

97
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:43,310
people in one neighborhood might be
receiving one level of care, and people in

98
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:48,440
another neighborhood only 20 minutes away
are receiving a different level of care.

99
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,450
How do we make that
level of care equitable?

100
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,110
How do we prevent that
disparity from forming?

101
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,815
Public health also has a core
value of evidence-based practice.

102
00:07:00,815 --> 00:07:05,555
This means that interventions and
strategies that we're deploying every day

103
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:08,875
should be informed by the best
scientific knowledge.

104
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,645
So if you have the best scientific
knowledge in front of you,

105
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:15,175
that way you're working toward
having the highest likelihood

106
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:20,610
of success,using evidence
to promote success.

107
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,650
Finally, let's think about
the core value of accountability.

108
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,840
Public accountability is so important.

109
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,260
And when you think about communicating
findings to the community,

110
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,990
publishing data about
public health challenges,

111
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,490
sharing with citizens what is happening,
those are all critical pieces of

112
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:44,800
ensuring that public health is accountable
to the people that it's designed to help.

113
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,270
So while the core values
of public health provide us

114
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,640
with a really strong set of principles,
it's also really important to consider

115
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,210
that there are some tensions that
exist around all these core values.

116
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,710
So let's think about one of those
tensions in terms of public health role.

117
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,270
And I'd like to think about that in
terms of a really fundamental question.

118
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,680
What is public health's role in our lives?

119
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,690
And it comes down to a principle
known as paternalism.

120
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,140
Sometimes, we actually
call that the nanny state.

121
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,640
Well, what does that mean?

122
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,900
It means, we have to think about
who is responsible for health?

123
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,330
Is there some grand authority that
can tell you how to live your life?

124
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,980
Or is it your responsibility
to make a healthy choice.

125
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,640
To that end we can actually
start to consider the importance

126
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,590
of protecting the population's health but

127
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:41,940
at the same time that might actually mean
we're intruding into individual liberties.

128
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,980
So if you think about government and
its role, is the government's right

129
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:54,100
as an institution there to tell me
that I can't smoke in a public place.

130
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,750
Whose responsibility is it?

131
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,270
So as we continue our discussion then
of the structure and function of public

132
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,720
health, I want you to think about
some of these examples' intentions.

133
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,630
And really what I want you to be thinking
about is how you would actually define

134
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,760
public health.

135
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,050
How would you organize the core
values in public health

136
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:19,826
to make sure that we're getting
successful outcomes for everyone?
