1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,660
um let's see last week we did a um an exercise and

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,800
we came up with some priorities for

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,100
environmental groups and in groups for. whose

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,220
car you work for Fortune. yes my friends of course this

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:27,560
is for you. okay. for this one because they came up with

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,640
completing this person. you know shows

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,480
are involved. so anyway this is their list and um

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,520
it is quite extensive actually and although they didn't agree on

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,160
the reasons why it was a nice list that included climate

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,740
work twice. actually put one in scarcity so that's a different thing in in hydrology

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,893
we talk about water quality and water availability or pricing and things like this

12
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:04,973
those are different topics will and some other groups came up with waste management

13
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:10,013
since it's usually applied to land on one side in there as well. mass extension

14
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:15,073
other groups came up with fire diversity issues and deforestation issues. so I put that

15
00:01:15,073 --> 00:01:20,213
in there as well. habitat fragmentation another group came up with land use

16
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:25,413
which is really interesting classification because of the juxtaposition

17
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:31,133
of labs you know for residential industrial. so forth purposes.

18
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:38,333
I'm food and security other groups came up with crop failure is food scarcity. food quality.

19
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:43,333
's. they were one of the few that came up with human displacement. this is interesting as

20
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:49,613
well and environmental inner cities. so these are all

21
00:01:49,613 --> 00:01:54,633
very nice list of of risk the and I'll ask

22
00:01:54,633 --> 00:02:00,089
you to know that one of the seniors here is media. okay so it's their

23
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:05,249
border spoiled food. I mean it's just kinda distinct classifications

24
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:10,329
water and so forth and this in fact is a nice kind of segue to

25
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:15,509
meet because neighbor was originally envisioned side of a land use

26
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:20,809
policy or law and you know was concerned with Lance and

27
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:25,909
they did get two attributes that might include Lance. okay we'll talk about that.

28
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:31,029
service so that was the top ten from group for

29
00:02:31,029 --> 00:02:36,289
and then I went through all the other lists that you guys

30
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:41,349
provided in your groups and this is the remainder of the top twenty and

31
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:46,449
he's. well I guess I sort of put crop failure up with food and security. we had

32
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:51,529
some new ones here. natural disaster is really interesting as

33
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:56,669
well. infrastructure failure I'd like to know who came up with

34
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:13,273
that right down the bridge saying what we mean by resources

35
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:22,573
like damn sure.

36
00:03:22,573 --> 00:03:27,893
okay. okay that's interesting you consider that an environmental risk but

37
00:03:27,893 --> 00:03:33,313
certainly it's a crow it can be environmental in nature policy regulatory safeguards

38
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:38,733
maybe the same kind of categories maybe not very many wrist disease emerging contaminants

39
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:44,093
energy needs and chemical exposure through consumer products which is of one us as well.

40
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:50,153
so that's very interesting as well. so what I'm afraid to get in here is

41
00:03:50,153 --> 00:03:55,153
thinking about how to assess environmental harms and what you consider

42
00:03:55,153 --> 00:04:00,157
to be important and this really is the Segway for what is an

43
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:05,617
indicator which is one of the main take homes today. bye.

44
00:04:05,617 --> 00:04:10,817
okay so we're gonna talk about indicators slash. okay. any additions to this

45
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:16,097
boss or Thomas.

46
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:21,817
so I would say that your list here looks more like kind of the scientific

47
00:04:21,817 --> 00:04:27,477
rather than the general. you know public um and. 's

48
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:32,577
logical I guess so. okay. so I wanna turn

49
00:04:32,577 --> 00:04:39,957
to the PowerPoint

50
00:04:39,957 --> 00:04:46,497
with this recording is actually working for like here.

51
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:52,317
change hello because it

52
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:58,623
doesn't look like. alright maybe. 's

53
00:04:58,623 --> 00:05:05,063
okay so you have some readings and I want you to look at those and um

54
00:05:05,063 --> 00:05:10,123
as I said before there are there's a quiz and I want you to

55
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:15,183
prepare those readings. read them in advance with us and I think that

56
00:05:15,183 --> 00:05:20,203
will system facilitate things for you. we had talked

57
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:25,503
about you and sustainable development goals very briefly and he should be aware of those.

58
00:05:25,503 --> 00:05:30,703
I'm gonna talk for about probably at the very end of the class. um there is one

59
00:05:30,703 --> 00:05:35,823
reading not all of this. this is Geo for.

60
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:40,823
if the UN environmental programs summary of the state of the world in terms

61
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:46,863
of the environment. it's been superseded which is five and GEO six

62
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:52,203
and um these are wonderful readings. it's a little heavy to assign

63
00:05:52,203 --> 00:05:57,293
you to Geo six is like nine hundred pages I mean some slides

64
00:05:57,293 --> 00:06:03,013
of it three course. it's a very global actually building off of the environmental aspects

65
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:08,253
of this you know when I pick this up again and brought it down here it's

66
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:13,373
environment for development stuff but

67
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:22,113
I don't wanna raise your eyebrows. I

68
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:27,493
mean

69
00:06:27,493 --> 00:06:34,513
I don't

70
00:06:34,513 --> 00:06:46,113
know

71
00:06:46,113 --> 00:07:01,753
yeah

72
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:08,173
yeah. so this is really interesting perspective on anyone else

73
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:14,593
you think about like where

74
00:07:14,593 --> 00:07:20,553
you and went they might see the contents that this

75
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:27,033
was thinking and there were things like that

76
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:32,173
about. well I mean these things are published

77
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:37,173
in about half dozen languages and I think that they do understand the meaning of the words and

78
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:42,266
I think you're picked very careful so there

79
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:48,646
might be changing in the meeting development as possible but I don't I

80
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:53,706
don't think I think her regardless of what you know you

81
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:58,866
wanna so I think they strategically placed development and environment together

82
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:04,686
to explain that you can have both correct and even have development in a way that

83
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:09,706
is impact environment like the least amount possible. okay. brats

84
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:14,926
or break us a little video that explains us a little bit. okay. and

85
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:20,046
I don't think there's an answer here that's definitive frankly I think there's a lot of politics

86
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:25,386
involved. I think there's a picture of optimism that they wanna present. I think there is

87
00:08:25,386 --> 00:08:30,906
a reality underlying the whole thing which is really important to understand that

88
00:08:30,906 --> 00:08:37,326
you know two billion people don't have sanitation or drinking. so for him

89
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:42,606
but keep in mind okay as we go through some of these other things because something is missing from

90
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:48,466
the Sixers and where are you sitting right now.

91
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:53,486
don't tell in the me chair where are you soon school public.

92
00:08:53,486 --> 00:08:59,126
tell us something is next thing from this picture and it's helpful. right.

93
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:04,366
that was actually corrected. he deals right and so

94
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:09,566
that's like you know bring forth. okay I mean they finally got it out.

95
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:14,726
summaries. okay. but we still have issues and we'll talk about this. pump there are lots

96
00:09:14,726 --> 00:09:19,806
of ways to measure environment for people that you know are in their community and

97
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:24,806
there's a little collection the PowerPoint or different types of indices scorecards

98
00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:30,226
and so forth and you know if you wanna have a environmental organization

99
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:35,286
get people upset. failing score card for your community or something like that and

100
00:09:35,286 --> 00:09:40,350
sometimes that works well so here's one about environmental maps this is

101
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:45,390
old looking at cadmium releases. here's hazardous

102
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:51,010
air pollutant um walks or how close you are all friendly

103
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:56,670
your community is to walking and so forth. um Michael bole

104
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,730
something I care about air quality and these things

105
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,930
are really standard as data science people are taking over the world and

106
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:12,530
have all the status at their fingertips with respect to an x-ray

107
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:17,530
whatever they mean we don't know but it's a number and was posted up there. so if

108
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:22,790
something happens and information is powerful. this is an interesting day however because these are

109
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:28,010
the PM levels. um were

110
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:33,010
hourly measurements and there in a hundred and fifty I think and

111
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:38,540
two hundred and this is really high

112
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:44,080
yeah this is Cesar micrograms per cubic meter. okay we'll talk more about that.

113
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,140
and this was during some wild fire today which really

114
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:55,940
just sent a particular monitoring wholesale places

115
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:01,000
were starting the next couple of weeks and need those national vernal policy

116
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,120
act in a little while ago. EPA put together this their own

117
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,140
attempts at consolidating some of the databases and also goes to you

118
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:16,700
later but basically it's an online GIS and you can highlight the locations

119
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:22,040
of various types of environmental attributes. I click on here

120
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,560
and I said probably so you want website I don't never get through anything if I do all this so

121
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,800
you have to do on your own I probably need to give you exercise.

122
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,976
but basically you can click on yes.

123
00:11:38,976 --> 00:11:45,036
looking at me like why the hell 's

124
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:50,276
need for assistance and hopefully will it run on

125
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:55,536
school computers here and you

126
00:11:55,536 --> 00:12:00,816
have different maps of looking at different facilities and let's put in.

127
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:06,136
I don't know. give me a location. if you told really

128
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:15,296
where in Utah. why.

129
00:12:15,296 --> 00:12:23,956
well it's not just air quality here. so that's also look like you told us

130
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:28,976
did what I do. alright. and

131
00:12:28,976 --> 00:12:34,080
so how many of you have been to Utah Salt Lake City. well okay

132
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,520
so we can um highlight different things for example there's a tunnel schools and

133
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:45,000
you know that's not so interesting from our environmental aspects we might be interested

134
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,700
in knowing where water quality is monitored. not much water.

135
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:57,320
okay and PAs he got very little presence there.

136
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,780
if we look at transportation we've got some infrastructure. we look at water features

137
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:08,160
highlights the streams and there are lots of strange um

138
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,206
non- attainment areas what's best for this

139
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:18,266
is not a change in with the national ambient air quality standards so this is the clean air act which will

140
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:26,856
look at and November and which food does Utah have trouble with

141
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:31,876
news I

142
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:36,956
would guess. the new ozone standard is probably not always changed

143
00:13:36,956 --> 00:13:41,996
and it looks like

144
00:13:41,996 --> 00:13:47,016
it is a change you know the highlighted areas there. p.m. to five is it

145
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:53,116
issues in Utah and that's also

146
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:59,236
looks like it's not an issue there. okay.

147
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:04,836
yeah so I clicked the annual average and that is the

148
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:10,316
specifically the toughest standard to me. okay. if I zoom out and

149
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:15,596
if we look at this ready areas are not on the team and froze on.

150
00:14:15,596 --> 00:14:20,939
okay. and so just you picked a very clean year a couple of years

151
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:29,279
used for the team lost my location again.

152
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,279
so let's switch to another team down.

153
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:39,599
so that's get rid of the same issues or go to Denver and you know

154
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:46,699
given that we received institution to see things his wife is up so much time.

155
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:52,619
because you know so things. I mean if you know Detroit.

156
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:58,259
okay. um so if we look it's a team in in Detroit.

157
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:03,919
it is an non- a team and area. okay. four ozone cycle of selfishness

158
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:09,119
again is it's not got issues with the other students presents some

159
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:14,239
of the other things that are on here are things like soil surveys and

160
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:19,859
you can classify the types of soils that they have some critical habitats.

161
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:25,615
um and um

162
00:15:25,615 --> 00:15:31,115
there's you know all the water things and stuff like that. this is an example

163
00:15:31,115 --> 00:15:36,515
primarily over the administrative database okay where we're taking data

164
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:42,055
classes like yes no monitoring point. yes no places

165
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:47,295
transportation. it should yeah he seems like the toxic release

166
00:15:47,295 --> 00:15:52,495
inventory and other stuff like that locations of things yes. okay.

167
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:57,815
this is a good indicator. but you know in this class you'll learn to recognize.

168
00:15:57,815 --> 00:16:03,375
France so please information. anyway this is

169
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:08,555
kinda neat tool DJ screen is another one that's probably got a little more

170
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:13,675
sophistication process. okay. but at least

171
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:20,241
you know we're getting

172
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:25,661
in cities destroyed elsewhere. there are many indicators that are reviews

173
00:16:25,661 --> 00:16:30,961
and and cases were really concerned

174
00:16:30,961 --> 00:16:36,301
about making city sustainable livable healthy and so forth and

175
00:16:36,301 --> 00:16:41,461
so the European commission and many other organizations

176
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:46,521
come up with various toolkits and guidelines and these are essentially lists of indicators that

177
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:51,821
your city should be ranked on and the ranking is designed to pray archer

178
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:58,021
ice caps so you can fix the ball. okay. you can

179
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:03,381
manage something you can't measure is the philosophy here and so here is the list

180
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:09,121
of indicators for sustainable cities and climate here all the certification

181
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:14,541
and so forth. what to do about climate at global

182
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:20,885
level

183
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:25,945
put that in their care you

184
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:30,945
know if Detroit. eliminated their emissions. you think

185
00:17:30,945 --> 00:17:36,605
it would make any difference.

186
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:41,745
I mean I agree it's gotta start somewhere

187
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:46,785
but it's not gonna do much in the short term. when people are suffering heat

188
00:17:46,785 --> 00:17:52,185
stress or whatever. so this is all related

189
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:57,865
to the big words adaptation. okay. and resilience.

190
00:17:57,865 --> 00:18:03,185
hey you know. okay. which is how cities cope. we make Greenway

191
00:18:03,185 --> 00:18:08,325
wages we have cooling centers. we don't

192
00:18:08,325 --> 00:18:14,105
turn off water you know and we prepare for adverse event.

193
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:19,525
okay and then if something bad happens we try to recover faster and so those are some of the concepts

194
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:24,681
involved in resilience an emerging area. good

195
00:18:24,681 --> 00:18:36,021
area. if you're interested in government health.

196
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:41,481
there isn't Sarah iso standard for measuring

197
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:46,581
sustainability and city. okay you guys know what place those

198
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:51,901
international standards organization kind of a third party independent and Syria

199
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:56,921
organization designs primarily in the past for businesses

200
00:18:56,921 --> 00:19:01,981
benefit. so that you know we could have commerce and trade and you could been sure that

201
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:07,061
what you buy is actually gonna do what it's gonna do but they've gotten very much in

202
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:12,281
management systems and so forth and this is one for sustainability. why not there's

203
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:17,461
a market with move into it. okay. there's a lot of good

204
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:22,895
from efforts like this in terms of language and terminology and clarity

205
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:28,815
and so forth. anyway thirteen thirty seven one oh one sustainable development communities

206
00:19:28,815 --> 00:19:35,415
and it has benchmarks and guidance and so forth and

207
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:40,475
out there. the UN habitat program has

208
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:46,515
a prosperity initiative and some of their indicators for city prosperity.

209
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:51,975
CPR indicators are listed below where we have productivity infrastructure

210
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:56,995
quality of life equity environmental sustainability and governance.

211
00:19:56,995 --> 00:20:02,553
okay and um these types of indicators

212
00:20:02,553 --> 00:20:08,373
are supposed to be comprehensive okay holistic and you know

213
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:13,393
and meaningful and then they have to be and they

214
00:20:13,393 --> 00:20:18,413
should be sanctioned. so you should be able to do something with these. so we'll talk more about this. so

215
00:20:18,413 --> 00:20:23,593
this is a very big picture. okay. huge suite of indicators. when

216
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:28,853
we're talking about sustainability because it basically involves everything. maybe

217
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:33,913
not so manageable not so action. if you use this CD and

218
00:20:33,913 --> 00:20:40,593
your ranks it is at the top is Oslo in Norway

219
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:45,813
bottom of those are in Africa where

220
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:50,813
are we. New York is seventy four in the middle. I don't see Ann Arbor

221
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:56,893
or Detroit. there are others that are listed there for what it's worth.

222
00:20:56,893 --> 00:21:02,616
okay. I wanna change gears a little bit and get into more formal

223
00:21:02,616 --> 00:21:07,996
and more structured approach and talking about indicators and need. there are some

224
00:21:07,996 --> 00:21:13,176
resources here that I talked about the update on the G six. um.

225
00:21:13,176 --> 00:21:18,176
I tried to download it. most of it's like interactive on the web there is

226
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:23,396
all they did book for zero six nine hundred pages but the problem it's three hundred megabytes

227
00:21:23,396 --> 00:21:28,556
and my PDF programs crashed and to try to reduce the size. so I'm just giving people

228
00:21:28,556 --> 00:21:33,656
like we talked about risk

229
00:21:33,656 --> 00:21:39,476
perception and some of these other indicators. okay.

230
00:21:39,476 --> 00:21:44,896
so we have something that I'll call the environmental health paradox.

231
00:21:44,896 --> 00:21:50,076
okay. and and environmental health. the interest most

232
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:55,576
concern is where you are with respect to their health. but how do you get there.

233
00:21:55,576 --> 00:22:01,466
well this paradigm is for the same more or less linear system

234
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:07,246
I am in this case is focusing on one stress and that stresses say commission.

235
00:22:07,246 --> 00:22:12,666
okay and the idea here is that the pollutant emissions are released

236
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:17,826
from some source which we can just identify and understand there is transport

237
00:22:17,826 --> 00:22:22,846
transformation in the environment maybe in is here he gets lost it around the community and

238
00:22:22,846 --> 00:22:28,046
into your home and you agree that you have the potential for exposure at individual

239
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:33,546
community and population levels. you're breathing so it comes into your longings

240
00:22:33,546 --> 00:22:38,926
and me have the possibility of being monitored in various

241
00:22:38,926 --> 00:22:43,986
ways in your body. it changes something alters structure

242
00:22:43,986 --> 00:22:49,126
function. this may result in an adverse outcome and then we see

243
00:22:49,126 --> 00:22:54,506
that in terms of morbidity mortality or some other type of surveillance.

244
00:22:54,506 --> 00:23:00,446
this is not necessarily a critical perspective it's more or less the population by

245
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:05,540
the very linear system pretty fundamental stuff. this is the subject of

246
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:11,820
a lot environment for science.

247
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,000
we can look at multimedia types of things

248
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,280
and look at risk assessment or population

249
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,680
health assessment. and this picture is quite similar. we have a missions

250
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,760
up at the top left here. um they are resulting in in

251
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,920
this case. air quality. we have that picture that I just showed you

252
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:43,000
in this bar right here from the previous slide. however this is

253
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,140
also showing you some of the science behind dealing with multiple pollutants where we look

254
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:53,500
at concentration response and exposure response work those response relationships for multiple

255
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,980
pollutants and then we do some sort of assessments is there any issues or problems

256
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:04,910
and then that's only really contribution of this diagram is the arrow

257
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:10,610
over here which is the feedback loop. okay. management system

258
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:16,030
to actually do something about it. so we've already talked about non- attainment

259
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:21,170
a little bit in the clean air act. so if you have an air pollution problem. you would

260
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:26,170
measure that through really care quality measurement levels interpret

261
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:31,410
that decided some non- attainment area and then tried to do something in terms

262
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:36,550
of reducing. okay. I'll show you this picture a few times

263
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:41,850
in the course each with different kind of folks side. okay this is a very general

264
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:47,210
one problem with this picture is it takes knowledge

265
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:52,430
to recognize these linkages. it takes organization

266
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:57,530
administrative units and so and it takes a lotta time to go

267
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:03,226
around the slough takes ten years. okay so

268
00:25:03,226 --> 00:25:08,786
if who's a group of set emerging solutions is one of their partners. so

269
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:13,906
give me an example of urgent and defaults wind was to

270
00:25:13,906 --> 00:25:25,966
sauce starving service should be used for dessert to be used in.

271
00:25:25,966 --> 00:25:31,666
yeah phones water proofing things. so far it's been used for forty years.

272
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:36,946
we're finally getting to the point here. okay. that's a really bad example because that's a really long

273
00:25:36,946 --> 00:25:41,986
time. so you know but there will

274
00:25:41,986 --> 00:25:47,086
be action. so I mention the Geo

275
00:25:47,086 --> 00:25:52,126
four five six there was one two and three which I never looked at so much. GEO

276
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:57,206
six is interesting because it's a regional assessment they submitted in to different regions. the previous

277
00:25:57,206 --> 00:26:02,348
forms were global taking a picture to do it regionally but the previous ones

278
00:26:02,348 --> 00:26:07,508
were global. um and I do encourage you to look at them. there are some

279
00:26:07,508 --> 00:26:12,848
very nice pictures and graphics and analyses of the global and regional

280
00:26:12,848 --> 00:26:19,788
scale and like I said we will come back.

281
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:25,148
okay. so I wanna turn Sunday and this was your first meeting assignments

282
00:26:25,148 --> 00:26:30,468
I hope you've looked at this this was asked that

283
00:26:30,468 --> 00:26:35,568
was authorized and passed by Congress quite

284
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:40,804
a long time ago nineteen seventy was written

285
00:26:40,804 --> 00:26:46,244
in nineteen sixty nine which is what fifty years ago

286
00:26:46,244 --> 00:26:51,724
sixty years ago right

287
00:26:51,724 --> 00:26:57,364
sixteen years ago. this is the why not right.

288
00:26:57,364 --> 00:27:02,804
fifty years ago how many years ago fifty cents.

289
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:07,944
so this is when Woodstock was happening right. the Vietnam War was

290
00:27:07,944 --> 00:27:13,344
still on. whose president Richard Nixon

291
00:27:13,344 --> 00:27:18,504
water do not have the draft

292
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:25,484
was in effect. okay. send you to Vietnam. not women

293
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:30,704
very different time. alright. when

294
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:36,221
you read the language. it's wonderful to have historical perspective. 's. okay

295
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:41,601
because um it was a different period of time. okay. we had horrible

296
00:27:41,601 --> 00:27:46,701
things happening. we have wonderful. okay. polarization

297
00:27:46,701 --> 00:27:51,981
is nothing new. okay. and it's yes. 's and things

298
00:27:51,981 --> 00:27:57,001
of March. so um let's look at. good

299
00:27:57,001 --> 00:28:03,181
purpose. there's a clear national policy that won't encourage productive and harm and enjoyable harmony

300
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:08,601
between me and it is a requirement. there is a gender issue to promote efforts

301
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:13,801
which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment in biosphere

302
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:20,001
and carefully looking towards eliminating.

303
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:25,601
enjoyable harm stimulates the health

304
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:30,601
and welfare of man to enrich the understanding of ecological systems

305
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:36,643
and natural resources and into establishing now see choose a council

306
00:28:36,643 --> 00:28:41,843
okay. so this is just a preamble carries no real way but it does

307
00:28:41,843 --> 00:28:47,103
lay out the and fish

308
00:28:47,103 --> 00:28:52,203
other key phrases in the bar highlighted below responsibility for future

309
00:28:52,203 --> 00:28:58,043
generations. sounds like sustainability preserve and enhance

310
00:28:58,043 --> 00:29:04,183
it's not just prevent harm to preserve in the town. so there's a

311
00:29:04,183 --> 00:29:09,803
duty here to make things better preserve cultural historical material resources.

312
00:29:09,803 --> 00:29:15,743
no degradation and enhance quality renewal..

313
00:29:15,743 --> 00:29:21,123
so this could have been written two thousand

314
00:29:21,123 --> 00:29:26,243
and nineteen. okay. and it would look very similar to a lot of sustainability

315
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:32,323
with loss policies that we see. okay but this is fact.

316
00:29:32,323 --> 00:29:38,987
it's only fifty. I think

317
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:44,027
so mean but there's a lot of different things okay and we're gonna talk about it. it's defined

318
00:29:44,027 --> 00:29:49,047
what the environment was okay and the environment was defined as a

319
00:29:49,047 --> 00:29:54,947
physical social cultural economic factors that affect people and communities.

320
00:29:54,947 --> 00:29:59,967
okay and that ultimately defined form character relations.

321
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:07,767
okay. section one two of pretty broad definition.

322
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:13,067
if it is people censored. it's external factors.

323
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:18,207
it includes what may act on your mind as well as your body. okay. inning

324
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:28,587
foods community not just the individual

325
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:33,827
and then from the definition of environment. anything that false

326
00:30:33,827 --> 00:30:40,119
or the environment was defined as an environmental thing

327
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:45,179
and something that fell under the purview under the scope of me and so this is any

328
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:50,199
alteration environmental conditions for creation of a new set of conditions that are bad because.

329
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:56,819
bye. again we were primarily thinking about building stuff. okay.

330
00:30:56,819 --> 00:31:02,939
you know changing land use or something.

331
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:07,939
okay. what do you think about those definitions

332
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:13,079
did not talk about climate climate changes and not on the radar until

333
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:23,059
the eighties maybe a little of the seventies and sixteen.

334
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:28,619
you're okay with us

335
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:34,059
for gas again is help. but

336
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:42,735
you know food sort of fit into it. but it's just not exposed

337
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:51,735
yeah

338
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:56,815
well I mean the short answer is no because the neighbor has

339
00:31:56,815 --> 00:32:01,935
no control over anything. alright. and the key idea. need but

340
00:32:01,935 --> 00:32:06,975
is it's public information but and then the

341
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:12,175
goal is you know you need good information make with us

342
00:32:12,175 --> 00:32:21,015
but there's a great line separating information. so my status is.

343
00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:26,135
so I've given you the text and I wanted you to read it and some of it

344
00:32:26,135 --> 00:32:31,155
is listed here. it's not important or not appropriate

345
00:32:31,155 --> 00:32:37,283
for me to go to the text here. but the key things that were established

346
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:42,363
in the preamble and the introduction is that

347
00:32:42,363 --> 00:32:47,423
you had a right to a healthy or healthful environment and it's a role in

348
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:52,803
federal government to in short form. prior

349
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:57,983
to this point that was not stated role of the federal government or

350
00:32:57,983 --> 00:33:03,003
frankly any other to any degree me

351
00:33:03,003 --> 00:33:08,083
if I operationally set up the requirements for environmental

352
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:13,103
impact assessments and we're gonna talk about that and it set up to seek

353
00:33:13,103 --> 00:33:18,305
counseling and it also environmental

354
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:23,385
quality has had its ups and downs over the years and they used well they

355
00:33:23,385 --> 00:33:28,685
still do issue and your records and sometimes they're very useful

356
00:33:28,685 --> 00:33:33,845
in recent years. it's been under resourced and often very useful. so

357
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:38,945
I'm not gonna discuss those details. one other two of the

358
00:33:38,945 --> 00:33:44,665
readings that you have was developed by the CET and so plus you

359
00:33:44,665 --> 00:33:50,045
you know. so you'll see. degree of what they can do.

360
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:55,245
yeah yes this is the way people know and like I said last week

361
00:33:55,245 --> 00:34:01,405
probably the most famous environment and tax statement was for the Keystone XL pipeline

362
00:34:01,405 --> 00:34:06,425
and the supplemental environmental impact statement for that came out

363
00:34:06,425 --> 00:34:11,525
in twenty fourteen and I think I gave you the executive summary to look at

364
00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:16,654
it. it's not really the most exciting

365
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:21,754
vernal impact statements that I've seen raise tremendous controversy for a lot of

366
00:34:21,754 --> 00:34:26,914
different reasons. mainly because of the coupling to the tire.

367
00:34:26,914 --> 00:34:32,514
okay which we're seeing is a way to increase you know productivity

368
00:34:32,514 --> 00:34:38,134
of the Alberta province in Canada. by shaking up

369
00:34:38,134 --> 00:34:43,594
the tar sands or oil sands and you know this is scene is very response.

370
00:34:43,594 --> 00:34:49,014
you if. okay. so it's really fine action type and we can talk about that

371
00:34:49,014 --> 00:34:56,614
lost ups and I was just been involved in other pipelines was involved in the cycle

372
00:34:56,614 --> 00:35:01,674
but book idea at this point so is that we invert no impact statement and the

373
00:35:01,674 --> 00:35:06,774
DIA. environment the impact assessment process is supposed to be a systematic

374
00:35:06,774 --> 00:35:11,954
way to consider the effects of a project underneath them.

375
00:35:11,954 --> 00:35:16,960
okay. according to the definition of just hassle for Vernon

376
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,540
it should be anticipatory. okay and one of your readings.

377
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:27,580
Jay at all. talks about some of the pros and cons. okay. and so we

378
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:32,580
should do our best to anticipate what might happen

379
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:38,500
as a result of a project. alright.

380
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:43,560
so. twenty nineteen. can you guys anticipate where

381
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:57,120
you're gonna be. that's eight ten years down the road. please people know where they're gonna be

382
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,280
you know what state you know what your personal

383
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:09,740
status is. you know your health your income for

384
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:14,780
only ten years so we talk

385
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:19,860
about surprise rich scenarios and how our ability to forecast

386
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,860
for day usually you know founded you know confidence intervals business as usual

387
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:29,900
the best divorce outcome one of the lovely things and I'm assigned

388
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:35,400
to reading from the Geo five who pours his unanticipated

389
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,620
surprises and I'd love this because it's just so much

390
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:45,960
fun. people best have the intentions. it's really tough. 's

391
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:55,340
how we do it

392
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:02,960
possible which models. okay.

393
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,160
what are the impacts with the XL pipeline. just

394
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,366
a big French with a pipe in the ground

395
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:19,046
yeah yeah. look at historical events that are similar

396
00:37:19,046 --> 00:37:24,606
for different things. so yeah are these good ways of doing it. okay. there's other ways brainstorming

397
00:37:24,606 --> 00:37:30,306
scoping. that's what we're gonna talk to me but it's close to be consultative

398
00:37:30,306 --> 00:37:35,886
requiring public participation. okay. and it's supposed to be institutionally

399
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:41,046
embedded. okay so institutions like the pipeline authorities state governments

400
00:37:41,046 --> 00:37:46,706
and so forth need to have resources approved.

401
00:37:46,706 --> 00:37:51,726
so you know that pipeline would take oil sands 's

402
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:56,766
material which is processed in Fort and the empire on this

403
00:37:56,766 --> 00:38:02,186
and this is a picture of just some the of processing there are giant

404
00:38:02,186 --> 00:38:08,126
mud moving it would do you good friends through

405
00:38:08,126 --> 00:38:13,228
various plans a lot of farmland put in this thirty six and ensure thirty

406
00:38:13,228 --> 00:38:18,428
eight and for forty inch high which is actually pretty interesting civil engineering

407
00:38:18,428 --> 00:38:23,768
marvel if you're interested in that because the walls are an inch and a

408
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:28,908
bit sick and it's got like a thousand PSI pressure and. it okay.

409
00:38:28,908 --> 00:38:33,948
and so it's really pushing the oils pretty rapid but

410
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:39,088
it's just and it's buried in the ground and

411
00:38:39,088 --> 00:38:44,128
cover it up and you

412
00:38:44,128 --> 00:38:50,668
know it may have to cross some rivers and things like that but it's just it's

413
00:38:50,668 --> 00:38:55,748
probably safer than twenty three. so anyway

414
00:38:55,748 --> 00:39:00,968
you'll read more about does

415
00:39:00,968 --> 00:39:06,128
have some environmental consequences and the readings talk about something.

416
00:39:06,128 --> 00:39:12,298
so if for example of any I guess very different type of example of any NIS

417
00:39:12,298 --> 00:39:17,458
is what's called a programmatic as compared to eight projects EIS like

418
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:22,578
a XL pipeline and programmatic one was for fuel

419
00:39:22,578 --> 00:39:28,378
efficiency standards for this case medium and heavy duty engines and vehicles.

420
00:39:28,378 --> 00:39:33,398
so if you guys by you know not very likely to buy heavy

421
00:39:33,398 --> 00:39:38,458
duty. okay. but if you know truck comes and does a delivery or something like

422
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:43,638
that it could be a heavy duty vehicle they have to meet this is emission standards. fuel efficiency

423
00:39:43,638 --> 00:39:48,778
standards. that was considered to be a major federal action with constancy on

424
00:39:48,778 --> 00:40:00,132
the environment and therefore required DIS

425
00:40:00,132 --> 00:40:05,612
hello another DIS was required just down the road in Detroit

426
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:12,192
for the Gordy Howe international Crossing. okay which is a new bridge

427
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:17,452
which will cross into Canada and the original

428
00:40:17,452 --> 00:40:22,592
EIS was approved in two thousand and

429
00:40:22,592 --> 00:40:28,232
eight. we original thing the final yeah I guess and

430
00:40:28,232 --> 00:40:35,492
kind of in the past or something like a brooch on the. environment

431
00:40:35,492 --> 00:40:47,832
's

432
00:40:47,832 --> 00:40:52,932
right. so this bridge carries a life. nine ten thousand heavy duty diesel trucks

433
00:40:52,932 --> 00:40:58,255
to bring I know their own faxes and the [INAUDIBLE] rounds softness

434
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:03,275
and so forth and yeah there is displacement and if you've

435
00:41:03,275 --> 00:41:08,335
gone to this force in southwest Detroit. there's about a square mile

436
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:13,555
now which is totally as building the custom here.

437
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:18,695
so. okay this is a four billion dollars investment

438
00:41:18,695 --> 00:41:23,935
by the. committee they're going to take

439
00:41:23,935 --> 00:41:29,115
a processing fee. it's gonna

440
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:37,315
be a money maker. like five years.

441
00:41:37,315 --> 00:41:42,855
you can get me started on this project is very involved with and it is.

442
00:41:42,855 --> 00:41:48,095
this is a whole side there. this EIS was approved

443
00:41:48,095 --> 00:41:53,475
in two thousand and eight to construction started kind of this year.

444
00:41:53,475 --> 00:42:00,127
eleven years later is the EIS

445
00:42:00,127 --> 00:42:09,387
the question people

446
00:42:09,387 --> 00:42:14,767
as a result of some issues regarding these impacts

447
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:19,987
the EIS was completed in a separate and parallel processing we should probably offer

448
00:42:19,987 --> 00:42:25,387
a course on this was pay currently and fifty five million

449
00:42:25,387 --> 00:42:30,547
but there is will be increased to sixty five. community benefits agreed

450
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:36,207
to try to provide some funding system for community concerns

451
00:42:36,207 --> 00:42:41,347
related to the prescription and part

452
00:42:41,347 --> 00:42:47,147
of this is also because this is a private public

453
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:53,587
as well which makes it even more complicated. okay and less transparent

454
00:42:53,587 --> 00:42:58,701
and then it's also with the sign fooled operation which

455
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:04,241
means that in fact the final details weren't released

456
00:43:04,241 --> 00:43:10,741
so this was an award okay which means that

457
00:43:10,741 --> 00:43:17,481
everything dealing with the environment was confidential.

458
00:43:17,481 --> 00:43:22,681
okay that did happen in two thousand eight. that was last couple. so becomes very

459
00:43:22,681 --> 00:43:28,641
very complex with the state international elements governors

460
00:43:28,641 --> 00:43:36,181
premieres and so forth very involved in process this community groups to

461
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:41,381
him. know I that type of VIS. also transportation

462
00:43:41,381 --> 00:43:46,441
related in the area that was quite controversial was that the trade intermodal

463
00:43:46,441 --> 00:43:51,501
freight terminal project. what is an intermodal terminal. it's

464
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:56,561
where you take free from friends or

465
00:43:56,561 --> 00:44:01,579
boats or trucks and move it to another modality okay and

466
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:07,759
these are absolutely essential for commerce and it's basically

467
00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:13,839
something of report and there are three

468
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:19,059
rail socials three private rail companies that converge in and have two

469
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:24,299
different intermodal facilities and straights. this would have provided

470
00:44:24,299 --> 00:44:29,319
some consolidation another GIS. this

471
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:34,479
one is still assigned you guys because I think it's nice and acceptable and stuff a lot of

472
00:44:34,479 --> 00:44:39,679
green compares all the brown from construction is the Kalamazoo

473
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:44,939
River. okay and. this one is also a programmatic

474
00:44:44,939 --> 00:44:50,159
one because it's dealing with a number of different activities not just a single project.

475
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:55,419
all along the river slot and some Kalamazoo West. we're actually

476
00:44:55,419 --> 00:45:00,513
used for this and so we're gonna read that here

477
00:45:00,513 --> 00:45:08,633
look at that more.

478
00:45:08,633 --> 00:45:14,273
this is a web shot from

479
00:45:14,273 --> 00:45:19,653
a landfill in South Bridge. I think it's Massachusetts.

480
00:45:19,653 --> 00:45:24,893
and just promoting the activities. you if go

481
00:45:24,893 --> 00:45:30,193
to zero waste and so forth. part of this is

482
00:45:30,193 --> 00:45:35,453
related to the fact that they are involved also in border project

483
00:45:35,453 --> 00:45:42,733
that the city where they're replacing water pipes.

484
00:45:42,733 --> 00:45:52,233
they don't have to do any I guess

485
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:57,233
another EIS which is active right now you can comment on

486
00:45:57,233 --> 00:46:02,773
it. is also supplemental one if you drive in Detroit remember where

487
00:46:02,773 --> 00:46:08,333
ninety four gets pretty congested rush hour. this is a plan

488
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:13,393
to widen the highway at

489
00:46:13,393 --> 00:46:18,553
additional lanes this is he from I ninety six to Conner and

490
00:46:18,553 --> 00:46:23,873
so it's basically right in the middle of the city and take the four lanes and out a couple

491
00:46:23,873 --> 00:46:28,893
things stretch phenomenally expensive money I guess is

492
00:46:28,893 --> 00:46:34,111
required. obviously traffic impacts and things like this

493
00:46:34,111 --> 00:46:40,371
I was thinking about using this as a case study but I don't know how much you guys are into

494
00:46:40,371 --> 00:46:45,391
this is very urban oriented uh there is vernal

495
00:46:45,391 --> 00:46:51,371
impact statement database so you can tried e 's by

496
00:46:51,371 --> 00:46:57,331
location toward age four phase and

497
00:46:57,331 --> 00:47:03,331
this does not provide good links to supplemental

498
00:47:03,331 --> 00:47:08,471
projects. okay or supplemental EIS is so in fact they this. I ninety four

499
00:47:08,471 --> 00:47:13,571
white name is not listed in the database. okay. except when it was

500
00:47:13,571 --> 00:47:19,231
approved like twelve years ago seniors. the supplement was not.

501
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:24,911
I searched it last week and these are the ones that were passed

502
00:47:24,911 --> 00:47:30,271
most recent ones that were filed. so we have fisheries

503
00:47:30,271 --> 00:47:35,500
stuff going on in the Gulf of Mexico we have some Arkansas forest land

504
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:40,860
management. we have roads in Arkansas we have the ship channel work

505
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:47,360
in Texas and so forth. so you can go here click on the links and see what's around you.

506
00:47:47,360 --> 00:48:03,020
but like I said it's not that's comprehensive. this.

507
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:08,460
yeah we're gonna go through the mechanics now but I absolutely okay this is a federal law so they have to comply with

508
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,980
that and um there are mandatory requirements for

509
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:20,120
informing holes.

510
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:25,340
so we talk about indicators and you know a broader way of looking at the certain points and very middle

511
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:30,740
impact analysis and we could use the sort of chemical physical stress from WHO

512
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:35,903
where they had showed you the picture of the globe and they had noise and air pollution so

513
00:48:35,903 --> 00:48:40,903
for I'm we could look at human health we talked about that a little bit I'm gonna make the point that's

514
00:48:40,903 --> 00:48:47,982
really important. I do also answer that occupational health what happens on the workplace

515
00:48:47,982 --> 00:48:53,302
ecological systems we could look at Pio 's biosphere agricultural productivity while

516
00:48:53,302 --> 00:48:58,562
lance aesthetics equity. so movies are all things came up in that exercise that I ask

517
00:48:58,562 --> 00:49:03,723
you about. and there are many many others. but what neighborhood did was

518
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:08,883
prescribe the things that you have to look at and those are listed here. okay.

519
00:49:08,883 --> 00:49:14,203
and then food pollution impacts noise hair water soil solid waste

520
00:49:14,203 --> 00:49:19,502
radiation and they broke out hazardous vegetative financial

521
00:49:19,502 --> 00:49:25,703
resource impacts on habitat save your productivity.

522
00:49:25,703 --> 00:49:30,762
they broke ground energy separate and this is

523
00:49:30,762 --> 00:49:36,360
actually historical you know this is near the time of the oil embargoes

524
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:43,420
and things like this is a lot of attention to we oil we thought we're gonna run now

525
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:48,640
the included natural hazards things like run off and so forth

526
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:54,100
land use and land management 's and they put interesting we climate water resources

527
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:59,120
together under that recreation surrounding land uses and

528
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:04,120
then they have the social environment and you can see the things that are listed there. so if you look at

529
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:09,240
any I asked and it doesn't include one of these things. it

530
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:33,100
would be administratively incomplete and not acceptable. you have to cover these things. yes

531
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:38,116
to California no we're gonna talk about

532
00:50:38,116 --> 00:50:43,556
that. so California uses what we call them any need process in case. okay

533
00:50:43,556 --> 00:50:48,736
and so there are triggers. okay. Bernie sucks

534
00:50:48,736 --> 00:50:53,936
and we'll talk about them it has to be a Federal actions. okay. with the potential to adversely

535
00:50:53,936 --> 00:50:59,496
affect them. otherwise you do have this whole system

536
00:50:59,496 --> 00:51:05,236
going on for all these actions that one. the cost effective to look at because you're

537
00:51:05,236 --> 00:51:11,216
putting resources in place

538
00:51:11,216 --> 00:51:17,496
for small projects like yeah. good question.

539
00:51:17,496 --> 00:51:23,576
great for us. okay. knee but does not

540
00:51:23,576 --> 00:51:28,836
depend most of the landers project server locally administered. if you're gonna

541
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:33,896
put a well the ground. okay. that is a certain depth that maybe a

542
00:51:33,896 --> 00:51:39,212
state if it's a short that maybe County. okay.

543
00:51:39,212 --> 00:51:44,612
and if it's a whole back yard maybe you know bye.

544
00:51:44,612 --> 00:51:49,712
we're talking about me but it is true with these larger action

545
00:51:49,712 --> 00:51:54,932
request. just going

546
00:51:54,932 --> 00:52:02,192
off. you

547
00:52:02,192 --> 00:52:07,992
absolute you know um and there are lots of examples of yeses for

548
00:52:07,992 --> 00:52:14,432
you know facilities that are fine within the state.

549
00:52:14,432 --> 00:52:20,392
okay. key point here is these are the impacts of the phone requires an assessment

550
00:52:20,392 --> 00:52:25,552
and to measure these. we used indicate and formally

551
00:52:25,552 --> 00:52:30,572
on the finding indicators for you here as a matter measure marker surrogate board

552
00:52:30,572 --> 00:52:35,618
metric if you like exposure or impact and then if we're

553
00:52:35,618 --> 00:52:40,978
talking about solutions we could say you know it's an air quality thing but you can talk about other stressors

554
00:52:40,978 --> 00:52:46,058
as well. so in fact it's quite broad in the state or Mister Ken in the two thousand

555
00:52:46,058 --> 00:52:51,058
and eight and we redefined it there. but the

556
00:52:51,058 --> 00:52:57,418
key thing is it tracks environmental conditions and typically there's a change

557
00:52:57,418 --> 00:53:02,438
before the project and after the project. we wanna make sure we're not making things

558
00:53:02,438 --> 00:53:07,452
worse. so just kind of longitudinal analysis is really important there are

559
00:53:07,452 --> 00:53:13,112
lots of different types were gonna talk about that they can be qualitative quantitative relevant practical

560
00:53:13,112 --> 00:53:19,122
so they're not always easy to communicate um you look in the system

561
00:53:19,122 --> 00:53:24,542
you know we looked at it came in very quality what is that really need in terms of air quality.

562
00:53:24,542 --> 00:53:29,742
take some technical understanding and their number of other issues that are raised hello

563
00:53:29,742 --> 00:53:34,962
including valid reason. so we're gonna talk. 's

564
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:40,242
now I like to use this picture from US EPA. where we separated

565
00:53:40,242 --> 00:53:45,682
administrative versus environmental indicators. any idea here is that we started

566
00:53:45,682 --> 00:53:50,922
here with very simple things to measure like how many permits did we administer. also

567
00:53:50,922 --> 00:53:56,062
arise. really is not a very good measure of our mental impact. maybe the best thing

568
00:53:56,062 --> 00:54:01,302
is what's the actual help of people 's but it's very hard to get. to so we have

569
00:54:01,302 --> 00:54:07,042
just kinda hard working with level one being administrative to being more administrative

570
00:54:07,042 --> 00:54:12,401
things three my state for example missions or loading certain nutrients

571
00:54:12,401 --> 00:54:18,001
or something like that it's really not telling us what's the health of that system but least at it's an important employer.

572
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:23,161
we might measure concentrations. that's what's. air quality and training they are

573
00:54:23,161 --> 00:54:28,181
we in team that's not services. environmental measurements. we might look at

574
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:34,561
body burden I can take blood samples from each of you sometimes I do request last

575
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:39,661
um and measure your body burden or we might do some sort of health survey. so we have

576
00:54:39,661 --> 00:54:44,741
this hierarchy here. CPA has a

577
00:54:44,741 --> 00:54:50,201
description here you can reach out that is a nice

578
00:54:50,201 --> 00:54:56,001
single stress orientation. we this is something like the Geo

579
00:54:56,001 --> 00:55:01,201
five GEO and sex frameworks. it's much more complex.

580
00:55:01,201 --> 00:55:06,521
it's not just that these things act on people but people act

581
00:55:06,521 --> 00:55:13,113
on the stress. so if you know it's a polluted area. maybe he'll move away

582
00:55:13,113 --> 00:55:18,553
okay. but maybe your demand for the good life.

583
00:55:18,553 --> 00:55:23,913
makes you increase the stress somehow when you visit. bad exotic

584
00:55:23,913 --> 00:55:28,933
location with all the greenhouse gases to get you there. so and so there is

585
00:55:28,933 --> 00:55:34,713
a network of drivers which the Geo five in Geo sex

586
00:55:34,713 --> 00:55:40,473
use any idea here is that we have development as a major driver.

587
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:45,913
okay. which produces pressures on land and resources and omissions

588
00:55:45,913 --> 00:55:51,293
and this affects the environment and changes us but we also then change

589
00:55:51,293 --> 00:55:56,493
our responses as well. and so it's not a linear system it's very complex and multi

590
00:55:56,493 --> 00:56:02,393
layer and multi level and so and smoking

591
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:07,433
and so it's a much more sophisticated approach him

592
00:56:07,433 --> 00:56:12,931
this picture. even takes it to a local level. you could get to regional

593
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:19,791
and global level as well. and so you can just see how complex this time frame

594
00:56:19,791 --> 00:56:24,831
right but that's the world that we have to operate. so it's important to recognize

595
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:29,891
it's it's complex take one or two

596
00:56:29,891 --> 00:56:35,011
more slots and we'll take a break. I mention the issues of foundry is how

597
00:56:35,011 --> 00:56:40,091
many of you have had a course in life cycle assessment. okay.

598
00:56:40,091 --> 00:56:45,111
so this is a technique where we're looking sort of the environmental impacts

599
00:56:45,111 --> 00:56:51,071
of a product or process and some years ago.

600
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:56,171
this is Elsie a life cycle assessment was done for a vehicle. I

601
00:56:56,171 --> 00:57:01,251
mean do all foods. okay and how many of you

602
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:06,301
have you're gonna do okay so you think about

603
00:57:06,301 --> 00:57:11,701
your car and you know you're you're happy driving it and you're in this operational mode here

604
00:57:11,701 --> 00:57:17,221
and you don't maybe think about the upstream a fax how the car was produced

605
00:57:17,221 --> 00:57:22,321
in the downstream fax where the car is no longer use phones dismantled

606
00:57:22,321 --> 00:57:27,861
and so forth and all of this is part of the vehicle lifecycle. if you were okay.

607
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:33,201
and then take each one of these boxes for example producing the steel

608
00:57:33,201 --> 00:57:38,461
fabricating the car. assembling it is

609
00:57:38,461 --> 00:57:43,461
requirement for energy requirement for aluminum plastic oil

610
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:48,541
electricity. okay and it generates waste and air pollution and so forth and the idea

611
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:53,781
of life cycle assessment is to to find the product system boundaries

612
00:57:53,781 --> 00:57:59,221
here and I have some resource extraction to dismantling sampling

613
00:57:59,221 --> 00:58:04,437
and recycling to to find the inputs and outputs for each one of those phases

614
00:58:04,437 --> 00:58:09,577
how much steel is needed how much energy and manage CO2 sulfur

615
00:58:09,577 --> 00:58:14,597
downside is it is okay and then put them all together and then think about the

616
00:58:14,597 --> 00:58:19,897
environmental impacts and so forth. so it's a very engineering oriented approach very modular

617
00:58:19,897 --> 00:58:25,417
approach. alright. so you all have cars.

618
00:58:25,417 --> 00:58:30,657
I'm assuming you didn't build them from scratch. I'm assuming you're not gonna smoke the metal down.

619
00:58:30,657 --> 00:58:37,817
okay. we're mostly environmental impacts associated with life cycle of a car

620
00:58:37,817 --> 00:58:52,037
which one of these phases.

621
00:58:52,037 --> 00:58:57,475
uh-huh yeah

622
00:58:57,475 --> 00:59:02,515
let's not get into too much detail here but I mean the batteries have certain issues

623
00:59:02,515 --> 00:59:07,855
I agree but even those would not be different in terms

624
00:59:07,855 --> 00:59:13,255
of. so what you're suggesting is though the waste

625
00:59:13,255 --> 00:59:21,235
phase here is it is important. sure.. yes

626
00:59:21,235 --> 00:59:28,355
okay. yeah.

627
00:59:28,355 --> 00:59:34,535
in the production phase here. okay. what you do say.

628
00:59:34,535 --> 00:59:39,615
yeah. okay well I

629
00:59:39,615 --> 00:59:46,055
don't agree with you. okay. operation

630
00:59:46,055 --> 00:59:51,095
is responsible for most of the impact by like

631
00:59:51,095 --> 00:59:56,265
factor ten times because you have proceeded with you.

632
00:59:56,265 --> 01:00:01,365
okay. cars last a long time and then fuel you has to come from somewhere and not saying

633
01:00:01,365 --> 01:00:06,525
there aren't in here with the extraction raw of materials and disposal. but

634
01:00:06,525 --> 01:00:11,865
it's a life cycle phase of operation which is responsible for so

635
01:00:11,865 --> 01:00:17,005
much of it I can go into a lot of detail here but this certainly applies to greenhouse gases

636
01:00:17,005 --> 01:00:22,225
conventional pollutants health and packs so forth. okay it's a life cycle phase

637
01:00:22,225 --> 01:00:27,245
of operation telling a point really

638
01:00:27,245 --> 01:00:32,245
this diagram was to talk about what's local what's regional and what's global more

639
01:00:32,245 --> 01:00:37,345
than the faces but here we defined system and the finding system is really

640
01:00:37,345 --> 01:00:43,165
important because now it's tractable for analysis. I can look at it

641
01:00:43,165 --> 01:00:48,205
and if I do find the globe is my whole system as I do and the Geo five.

642
01:00:48,205 --> 01:00:53,792
it's really a challenge to analyze things develop alternative

643
01:00:53,792 --> 01:00:59,012
is much less simple and any of those mitigation steps and means just to make us something

644
01:00:59,012 --> 01:01:08,372
small thanks small thing right or whatever.

645
01:01:08,372 --> 01:01:13,372
okay. three or four five minute break that's okay I'm gonna start

646
01:01:13,372 --> 01:01:23,632
a video in about two minutes..

647
01:01:23,632 --> 01:01:28,872
okay poor learns. I was bad.

648
01:01:28,872 --> 01:01:34,492
yes. yeah yeah do you have a solution. okay so that's also

649
01:01:34,492 --> 01:01:40,892
the size of the attack

650
01:01:40,892 --> 01:01:46,312
from services. okay. a about

651
01:01:46,312 --> 01:01:51,332
half. yeah yeah see you have

652
01:01:51,332 --> 01:02:00,188
that's today's service oh okay yes

653
01:02:00,188 --> 01:02:05,308
okay you're not I don't know I mean

654
01:02:05,308 --> 01:02:10,388
I mean archer yeah I mean if everyone is a mile or I would make the money right yeah

655
01:02:10,388 --> 01:02:15,528
yeah I see I e-mailed you the Thursday about getting

656
01:02:15,528 --> 01:02:21,468
the weightless. bye. I didn't do anything but

657
01:02:21,468 --> 01:02:28,048
that's okay. okay here's Davis. this is not correct.

658
01:02:28,048 --> 01:02:33,708
it's all how many were. so um your

659
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:43,168
students easy. so you

660
01:02:43,168 --> 01:02:49,128
many guys in LA are and a friend from LA or

661
01:02:49,128 --> 01:02:55,010
high statement. so

662
01:02:55,010 --> 01:03:00,090
canvas good what's what's your interest

663
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:05,990
general question when they changed ago yeah.

664
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:11,070
sorry sure prepared and we're usually so that's what I guess you know he said

665
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:19,310
I guess I just like where have another

666
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:25,210
guy fair amount of incredible health issues. choose you know protected a lot of

667
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:30,430
the other side. yeah I'm in terms of like natural disasters or

668
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:35,970
well depends what kind of but it's very

669
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:41,370
yeah yeah. thanks and have a

670
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:46,470
big issue with transportation yeah

671
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:52,530
that's true well also you have a governor now senator

672
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:57,734
we had to stand disinterested yeah

673
01:03:57,734 --> 01:04:03,034
I guess we're all republican so we don't even have any day

674
01:04:03,034 --> 01:04:09,334
was disappointed is interesting I didn't get it

675
01:04:09,334 --> 01:04:17,094
positive of experience is going. yeah they're. yeah.

676
01:04:17,094 --> 01:04:23,134
oh well this winter I would

677
01:04:23,134 --> 01:04:28,294
yeah you know

678
01:04:28,294 --> 01:04:35,014
that's what I

679
01:04:35,014 --> 01:04:41,334
yeah the keys are very biologically debris 's place.

680
01:04:41,334 --> 01:04:46,394
I mean so. you know

681
01:04:46,394 --> 01:05:24,164
I develop okay good for them know you

682
01:05:24,164 --> 01:06:29,978
mhm

683
01:06:29,978 --> 01:06:35,138
well I thought I had the struck right. five five. again and so I don't have a movie

684
01:06:35,138 --> 01:06:42,678
right now but his thing best about informatics production

685
01:06:42,678 --> 01:06:47,798
but I did wanna show you from sort of the same series. one of the

686
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:52,818
pictures that's kind of the more innings picture that you six

687
01:06:52,818 --> 01:06:57,818
and they identify drivers. basically

688
01:06:57,818 --> 01:07:02,958
environmental stresses and you have um population

689
01:07:02,958 --> 01:07:08,038
development technology park brownish color

690
01:07:08,038 --> 01:07:13,098
climate change of urbanization. and we

691
01:07:13,098 --> 01:07:18,378
didn't talk much about urbanization. this is really important and then we have a earth system

692
01:07:18,378 --> 01:07:23,998
biodiversity lan first quarter here and emotions and it's kind of medium oriented. okay.

693
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:29,397
and then the idea is that we have policy choices

694
01:07:29,397 --> 01:07:34,477
that we can manage and on the left you have sort of the

695
01:07:34,477 --> 01:07:39,517
dynamics sort of where we're going business as usual with all

696
01:07:39,517 --> 01:07:44,817
kinds of things and it's an ugly gray color and then we could

697
01:07:44,817 --> 01:07:49,937
have transformations that provide clean energy a circular

698
01:07:49,937 --> 01:07:55,497
economy where waitresses utilize and so forth. where cities speak on the status

699
01:07:55,497 --> 01:08:00,677
polluting and scrolling they become livable sustainable food and we adapt to climate

700
01:08:00,677 --> 01:08:05,717
change and then you can see how this is kind of their healthy planet.

701
01:08:05,717 --> 01:08:11,697
hope you people compare to on healthy planet on healthy people.

702
01:08:11,697 --> 01:08:16,877
and this is the difference also to some extent between incremental

703
01:08:16,877 --> 01:08:22,517
transformations kind of what we're basically doing now with systematic

704
01:08:22,517 --> 01:08:28,733
transfer right. and this is kind of a paradigm

705
01:08:28,733 --> 01:08:34,433
shift for us. however the historical

706
01:08:34,433 --> 01:08:39,513
precedence and making systematic transformations literature that

707
01:08:39,513 --> 01:08:47,013
experience is very small government stuff to for thirty

708
01:08:47,013 --> 01:08:52,193
but in general. where incremental and there's a lot of

709
01:08:52,193 --> 01:08:58,833
parables with incremental was okay and everybody knows

710
01:08:58,833 --> 01:09:04,113
boiling pot with the towed and right and so forth doesn't be out

711
01:09:04,113 --> 01:09:09,693
realize what's happening with slippery. okay. we need

712
01:09:09,693 --> 01:09:14,833
just sinks in the transformative. I'm

713
01:09:14,833 --> 01:09:21,693
not gonna focus on this but this is really important for us.

714
01:09:21,693 --> 01:09:27,213
so anyway we start to see more radical ideas at the global level

715
01:09:27,213 --> 01:09:32,549
and this notion of healthy people and healthy planet

716
01:09:32,549 --> 01:09:39,629
does bring help help to the forefront and so that's tremendous.

717
01:09:39,629 --> 01:09:45,229
okay. thanks incremental is not really I'm

718
01:09:45,229 --> 01:09:50,709
one of the concerns we're when looking pollutants and we're looking at media specific

719
01:09:50,709 --> 01:09:55,849
types of roles or indicators is the importance

720
01:09:55,849 --> 01:10:00,849
of cross media transfers and this picture which is old

721
01:10:00,849 --> 01:10:07,269
is talking about for example how agricultural application of pesticides

722
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:12,969
can move into the soils and to the

723
01:10:12,969 --> 01:10:18,409
ground water into the runoff get into the water bodies fished

724
01:10:18,409 --> 01:10:25,269
basis and become contaminated some of the pesticide residues making

725
01:10:25,269 --> 01:10:30,781
and so forth so there's a loss of movement through the informed

726
01:10:30,781 --> 01:10:35,941
this kind of concern of multimedia transfers and pathways is recognized

727
01:10:35,941 --> 01:10:41,201
in the superfund program. super was assigned us under circle all

728
01:10:41,201 --> 01:10:47,161
way the to clean up grossly contaminated sites analysis

729
01:10:47,161 --> 01:10:52,401
options to clean up these sites required a multimedia session and

730
01:10:52,401 --> 01:10:57,981
for example you might have a super fund site located honestly and

731
01:10:57,981 --> 01:11:06,361
what was super was potentially worse

732
01:11:06,361 --> 01:11:11,481
from somebody down room or drinking or bathing

733
01:11:11,481 --> 01:11:17,101
fish have to have systems figure out

734
01:11:17,101 --> 01:11:22,461
what was worse. so it's not just what's on the slide on the sides

735
01:11:22,461 --> 01:11:27,641
are but it's so super

736
01:11:27,641 --> 01:11:34,159
close program

737
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:39,159
different than our allies to come

738
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:44,579
up maximum wage exposed the

739
01:11:44,579 --> 01:11:50,559
and so the Sixers are selling Bibles that where you have

740
01:11:50,559 --> 01:11:55,899
kids playing in the soil that's like Sam and the hotter shooting

741
01:11:55,899 --> 01:12:01,699
eventually eating game like raise oxygen soils.

742
01:12:01,699 --> 01:12:07,919
again the drinking water pathway fish to

743
01:12:07,919 --> 01:12:13,139
produce or whatever that might be contaminated from the irrigation

744
01:12:13,139 --> 01:12:18,239
pulled out of. how do you figure out all of

745
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:24,279
these types of scenarios and this is what we talked about this before.

746
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:29,733
I yeah asked should consider these different types of scenarios this is a picture

747
01:12:29,733 --> 01:12:35,093
from the textbook honey I guess where a power line allowed

748
01:12:35,093 --> 01:12:41,193
transmission of a toad warm and some other factors to move along that the. service

749
01:12:41,193 --> 01:12:46,633
okay. sort of leapfrog it's migration.

750
01:12:46,633 --> 01:12:51,793
we call this process and this is where we use

751
01:12:51,793 --> 01:12:57,053
stakeholder in first broadly consider the range

752
01:12:57,053 --> 01:13:02,133
of and known potentially unknown or nontrivial environmental

753
01:13:02,133 --> 01:13:07,495
impacts and think about what should be assessed

754
01:13:07,495 --> 01:13:12,855
okay. so this process called spoke

755
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:19,275
the omission of environment on packs can be a major

756
01:13:19,275 --> 01:13:29,295
gas deficiency. any I guess so scoping is really important.

757
01:13:29,295 --> 01:13:34,495
any of you ever participate in the schools across from

758
01:13:34,495 --> 01:13:40,295
like brainstorming. okay. what could happen and the

759
01:13:40,295 --> 01:13:45,875
immediate outcomes are sometimes pretty easy but then what we call the secondary colors

760
01:13:45,875 --> 01:13:50,915
which happens is result of something can be quite challenging but those could

761
01:13:50,915 --> 01:13:55,955
be really. so we have

762
01:13:55,955 --> 01:14:01,335
need of that requires EIS is well we have a lot of other needs

763
01:14:01,335 --> 01:14:06,575
and so the next couple of minutes I wanna talk about why we do this kind of work.

764
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:11,726
okay and you know the first might be the fact that we need to make good

765
01:14:11,726 --> 01:14:16,846
decisions because there are a lot of potential breast and so we might

766
01:14:16,846 --> 01:14:22,446
use a risk assessment type of framework for evaluations

767
01:14:22,446 --> 01:14:27,466
and formally risk assessment is the process of determining the short and long term

768
01:14:27,466 --> 01:14:32,786
adverse consequences to use the technology or particular decision

769
01:14:32,786 --> 01:14:38,046
and risk assessment. told you this last week I would teach

770
01:14:38,046 --> 01:14:43,106
okay. if these five stuff. first question is

771
01:14:43,106 --> 01:14:48,406
this process and so is some sort of scoping

772
01:14:48,406 --> 01:14:53,906
process. the second the step services house offices

773
01:14:53,906 --> 01:15:01,006
and stuff. so I need to have those sponsor

774
01:15:01,006 --> 01:15:07,426
services. 's just to work

775
01:15:07,426 --> 01:15:12,650
children stand and I wanted one of

776
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:20,550
where and how often understand

777
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:30,130
very quick to go to those are small exposure since those

778
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:35,370
those and I are

779
01:15:35,370 --> 01:15:40,650
typically the hardest expresses the problem. sort of

780
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:45,890
first. so

781
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:51,570
although he's older and almost all the you have cars. I did ask on the

782
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:58,430
truth but I guess where else you're

783
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:07,094
sleeping some since Benji fanzine carcinogen

784
01:16:07,094 --> 01:16:12,314
the gas station market for increasing

785
01:16:12,314 --> 01:16:18,734
your cashews and if I saw user is five

786
01:16:18,734 --> 01:16:29,514
one the million you care.

787
01:16:29,514 --> 01:16:44,974
once a chance if you are a general first.

788
01:16:44,974 --> 01:16:52,234
so for additional list if you care

789
01:16:52,234 --> 01:16:58,454
care. usually involves.

790
01:16:58,454 --> 01:17:03,794
so anyway versus management status was. okay. and this is a policy contextual

791
01:17:03,794 --> 01:17:09,358
sociological so you're just holding your hair so you do nothing

792
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:14,898
other people go to

793
01:17:14,898 --> 01:17:20,318
take some of this anyway

794
01:17:20,318 --> 01:17:26,778
environmental impact assessments is very similar to this first management cycle

795
01:17:26,778 --> 01:17:32,358
we can go through similar sorts of stuff for logical versus a major

796
01:17:32,358 --> 01:17:38,098
difference here is that we're not doing

797
01:17:38,098 --> 01:17:43,618
greater specific wage scenarios

798
01:17:43,618 --> 01:17:48,898
she environments. yeah. otherwise

799
01:17:48,898 --> 01:17:54,518
we end up the same sort of

800
01:17:54,518 --> 01:18:00,218
er melon impact assessment is done for life cycle assessment. I talk to you about the car load slower

801
01:18:00,218 --> 01:18:10,038
from extraction. understand the steps involved

802
01:18:10,038 --> 01:18:15,358
instances in this also defined the three major steps

803
01:18:15,358 --> 01:18:20,378
of LCD where I do need inventory. so I defined find a boundary and

804
01:18:20,378 --> 01:18:25,438
then for each one of those blocks like inventory of

805
01:18:25,438 --> 01:18:30,498
the emissions for example. I figure out what those emissions means in terms of health

806
01:18:30,498 --> 01:18:35,898
or environmental consequences. I tried roofing. 's this is one of the contributions

807
01:18:35,898 --> 01:18:40,918
from else area which is not just an assessment process but it is designed to

808
01:18:40,918 --> 01:18:48,998
help you make things better

809
01:18:48,998 --> 01:18:54,498
for me here is the US EPA and other agencies established or utilize

810
01:18:54,498 --> 01:19:00,258
a risk reduction research for policy strategy and the idea is to

811
01:19:00,258 --> 01:19:06,808
shift from end of - control. you know what I mean

812
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:12,088
for example your car has a kind of converter on the tailpipe

813
01:19:12,088 --> 01:19:17,648
to reduce those toxic gas. okay ward power plant puts on us forever over

814
01:19:17,648 --> 01:19:22,808
to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. okay those are into pipe controls.

815
01:19:22,808 --> 01:19:28,308
so use and honest to the process. the idea was to ship from this kind of approach

816
01:19:28,308 --> 01:19:33,328
to preventing pollution in the first place. key to prevent to

817
01:19:33,328 --> 01:19:38,488
figure out whether this was better than the in paper controls. again

818
01:19:38,488 --> 01:19:43,748
we had to go through an internal process 's. the other big

819
01:19:43,748 --> 01:19:49,766
one which which is important to understand and this error 's with from

820
01:19:49,766 --> 01:19:55,086
sixteen RNC stuff is from the the through the nineties maybe

821
01:19:55,086 --> 01:20:00,546
all it's is this commander control strategies where we have

822
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:05,606
potentially strong state agencies to say

823
01:20:05,606 --> 01:20:14,206
what are the emission limits. what's your so top down the military.

824
01:20:14,206 --> 01:20:21,946
we're now into something much more complex

825
01:20:21,946 --> 01:20:27,166
schedule here this command-and-control control

826
01:20:27,166 --> 01:20:32,226
hazard assessment is something which is done by communities to

827
01:20:32,226 --> 01:20:37,266
deal with. um typically accident sex all

828
01:20:37,266 --> 01:20:42,946
acute impacts it could be a storm six would be explosions and so forth.

829
01:20:42,946 --> 01:20:47,967
this hazard assessment goes through a number different steps where you

830
01:20:47,967 --> 01:20:53,427
have a facility to where our toxic materials stored.

831
01:20:53,427 --> 01:20:58,627
um you develop scenarios. what kind of event might happen and

832
01:20:58,627 --> 01:21:04,987
what kind of release might've been for each of those scenarios.

833
01:21:04,987 --> 01:21:10,567
excuse me. um estimate the concentration exposures.

834
01:21:10,567 --> 01:21:15,867
um the probability of these events of the toxicity the information those that responsible

835
01:21:15,867 --> 01:21:20,887
put it all together. you come up with estimates of impact and you look at the answer

836
01:21:20,887 --> 01:21:26,147
's. this is non- call is required under the actually

837
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:32,167
the fair act and this kind of planning is done for facilities.

838
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:39,927
large amounts of toxic substances and so

839
01:21:39,927 --> 01:21:45,012
for planning and engineering purposes for fun gnostic modeling for the decision-making

840
01:21:45,012 --> 01:21:50,172
we all want to have these kinds of tools available for us and

841
01:21:50,172 --> 01:21:56,992
then finally. so getting down to reality. we do the since because we

842
01:21:56,992 --> 01:22:02,032
were not okay. that's where most of these things are now

843
01:22:02,032 --> 01:22:07,092
there is a trying to use these kinds of assessments in situations where

844
01:22:07,092 --> 01:22:12,092
they're not required by law but they don't just on Saturday.

845
01:22:12,092 --> 01:22:17,672
's.

846
01:22:17,672 --> 01:22:22,952
alright. yes get that.

847
01:22:22,952 --> 01:22:27,952
guess. 's about three

848
01:22:27,952 --> 01:22:33,112
six maybe through. we talked about let a lot in the last couple of years as a result of women

849
01:22:33,112 --> 01:22:38,271
and one very interesting scenario that sometimes we look

850
01:22:38,271 --> 01:22:44,302
at for air quality and for GIS application says town

851
01:22:44,302 --> 01:22:49,322
call for Kim Laney and Missouri and they have

852
01:22:49,322 --> 01:22:54,602
a big lead smelter was a door on facility and

853
01:22:54,602 --> 01:23:00,142
the lead just poured out of that and he contaminated soils and cents.

854
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:05,542
in fact even have your headset or contamination should be allowed in

855
01:23:05,542 --> 01:23:10,642
and they put signs up saying don't play in the streets and so. okay. this is probably

856
01:23:10,642 --> 01:23:15,902
not what you would consider to be an acceptable remediation approach you know. 's posting signage

857
01:23:15,902 --> 01:23:22,042
and so forth and in this case

858
01:23:22,042 --> 01:23:30,142
part of the cleanup boys to evacuate some of the community

859
01:23:30,142 --> 01:23:35,462
replaced topsoil and so forth. that's a small town if you're going

860
01:23:35,462 --> 01:23:40,984
further out west you have sometimes gigantic lead and

861
01:23:40,984 --> 01:23:46,124
you know even in Ann Arbor here we have a superfund issue that's been boiling for many

862
01:23:46,124 --> 01:23:51,144
years because we have a bill and the question is whether or

863
01:23:51,144 --> 01:23:56,264
not to compare the city is super fund site because this would bring in additional

864
01:23:56,264 --> 01:24:01,364
resources but on the downside it would give us a bad name

865
01:24:01,364 --> 01:24:06,624
and so nothing and a lot of the assessments that should happen don't

866
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:11,724
happen so anyway this is scaled up in here. you know

867
01:24:11,724 --> 01:24:17,744
lead from this mining company was used for many different purposes.

868
01:24:17,744 --> 01:24:22,944
one of the purposes was to added to gasoline as a hand type

869
01:24:22,944 --> 01:24:27,964
now. components and most of the license termination in many areas as a

870
01:24:27,964 --> 01:24:33,504
result of us burning about two hundred thousand times the year of

871
01:24:33,504 --> 01:24:38,864
lead in gasoline for many many things

872
01:24:38,864 --> 01:24:46,069
don't too much on the changes

873
01:24:46,069 --> 01:24:51,649
so anyway this is a giant super fun site and then with a glance. we have even more

874
01:24:51,649 --> 01:24:56,789
awareness now because this was utilized in lead service

875
01:24:56,789 --> 01:25:02,169
line seasonal pipes that connect your home to the water main.

876
01:25:02,169 --> 01:25:07,669
so they're underground and they're typically longer whatever and the border

877
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:13,169
travel surgeries lead pipes. why was late used this for purpose.

878
01:25:13,169 --> 01:25:19,109
we know what those expenses to do

879
01:25:19,109 --> 01:25:24,309
and I mean the first published article about toxicity land was like

880
01:25:24,309 --> 01:25:29,729
eighteen so or. okay. why was less used

881
01:25:29,729 --> 01:25:35,549
just

882
01:25:35,549 --> 01:25:40,829
she's adorable last

883
01:25:40,829 --> 01:25:46,779
forever basically okay. services function and so in fact

884
01:25:46,779 --> 01:25:51,919
you know there are an estimated six million or so homes and service

885
01:25:51,919 --> 01:25:57,199
lines of the country in Europe it works but nobody talks about it.

886
01:25:57,199 --> 01:26:03,040
in some countries all the lines are led

887
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:08,199
and you know this came up in the last couple of years and influence

888
01:26:08,199 --> 01:26:14,619
and sure you've all seen the story of children with elevated blood lids.

889
01:26:14,619 --> 01:26:20,219
after as a city switched to with different supplies and save

890
01:26:20,219 --> 01:26:25,331
ninety seven or eight dollars a day not at hand type race

891
01:26:25,331 --> 01:26:30,451
kind of self service resulted

892
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:35,551
in a small but statistically significant change in elevated

893
01:26:35,551 --> 01:26:41,011
blood blood levels and this picture shows four to ten percent

894
01:26:41,011 --> 01:26:46,011
portions of Detroit twenty five percent of

895
01:26:46,011 --> 01:27:00,271
kids exceed CDC the got.

896
01:27:00,271 --> 01:27:05,271
yeah this hello is probably the dominant pathway especially when the pain in the

897
01:27:05,271 --> 01:27:10,411
housing is deteriorated and then children like the taste of chips

898
01:27:10,411 --> 01:27:17,651
as well. 's called flavor I've not tried it.

899
01:27:17,651 --> 01:27:23,125
I have my late exposures a kid too old for that now. um

900
01:27:23,125 --> 01:27:28,385
so anyway but this is a waterborne thing in the last couple of years I've gotten pretty

901
01:27:28,385 --> 01:27:34,305
heavily involved with several cities and also the state of Michigan on the testing

902
01:27:34,305 --> 01:27:39,964
and we have a major flaw in our blood testing regime. because this is regulated

903
01:27:39,964 --> 01:27:45,225
under US EPA under the lead copper and

904
01:27:45,225 --> 01:27:50,424
this learning copper requires municipalities to test the first

905
01:27:50,424 --> 01:27:55,524
liter of water after stagnation. so if you let your water

906
01:27:55,524 --> 01:28:00,725
sit overnight. please take a liter bottle you fill it up and that's the water that's

907
01:28:00,725 --> 01:28:17,064
tested. what's the problem.

908
01:28:17,064 --> 01:28:23,928
it's in the furnace and plumbing what we call the fossil. however

909
01:28:23,928 --> 01:28:29,269
currently new faucets say no more than. two five percent of what

910
01:28:29,269 --> 01:28:34,289
um ten years ago was eight percent and twenty or thirty years ago wasn't

911
01:28:34,289 --> 01:28:39,448
controlled. so your forces also have water. I've been told happened

912
01:28:39,448 --> 01:28:44,749
actually it was back in the eighties. um the industry the water 's movie industry

913
01:28:44,749 --> 01:28:50,008
and this is another conspiracy theory and told him that you know they really

914
01:28:50,008 --> 01:28:55,508
was not a problem with that service lines the problem was the false. so that's design

915
01:28:55,508 --> 01:29:00,888
testing we need to book false. so they took the first week

916
01:29:00,888 --> 01:29:05,988
anyway and Missus we got the law changed last year 's and now they're looking at the first leader and

917
01:29:05,988 --> 01:29:11,588
assist leader and assist leader is wrong from the service line and this is a picture

918
01:29:11,588 --> 01:29:16,849
for me. typically I mean it's a good size high goes through which

919
01:29:16,849 --> 01:29:22,208
happens. service lines. stop and this house

920
01:29:22,208 --> 01:29:28,475
and this portion and um

921
01:29:28,475 --> 01:29:33,515
what I'm showing here results of the first leader and then typically a fourth or six

922
01:29:33,515 --> 01:29:38,614
concentration higher. certainly the upper percentile some recent moves and

923
01:29:38,614 --> 01:29:43,634
then if I feel let your water run for say five minutes lead level. so we

924
01:29:43,634 --> 01:29:48,854
in fact gave everybody the wrong advice by telling them to work toward

925
01:29:48,854 --> 01:29:53,915
get hold and then see if you when you did that you got water that

926
01:29:53,915 --> 01:29:59,694
was in the service. so you need to let for another couple

927
01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:05,114
that will have. lower anyway

928
01:30:05,114 --> 01:30:10,955
here is a relationship. bye. the psalms for Edwards

929
01:30:10,955 --> 01:30:16,035
for the face showing for example that it's related fifteen micrograms per liter which

930
01:30:16,035 --> 01:30:21,955
is current code off. you'll have an elevated blood lead level of about two to three

931
01:30:21,955 --> 01:30:27,464
CDC cut off right now is fine

932
01:30:27,464 --> 01:30:32,484
right. so um you're gonna need additional exposure to get that

933
01:30:32,484 --> 01:30:37,484
level but like I said in Detroit twenty five percent

934
01:30:37,484 --> 01:30:42,644
of kids have elevated blood lead levels about five. 's because

935
01:30:42,644 --> 01:30:49,164
they do have that service lines of mostly country. 's

936
01:30:49,164 --> 01:30:54,384
another long besides herself but the interesting

937
01:30:54,384 --> 01:30:59,664
thing is for us is that that lead exposure is really just one of the stresses

938
01:30:59,664 --> 01:31:04,704
that occurs and these are some Monahan Natisha 's

939
01:31:04,704 --> 01:31:09,804
lives where she's looking and some of the stresses that are imposed and

940
01:31:09,804 --> 01:31:15,324
the interesting thing here is that you know she's arguing

941
01:31:15,324 --> 01:31:20,444
that there's kind of a pure here mates. mechanisms and at the bottom

942
01:31:20,444 --> 01:31:25,524
we have bad first child experiences like the stress and trauma money in your family to recognize

943
01:31:25,524 --> 01:31:31,242
that you don't have safe order and this fact leads to a

944
01:31:31,242 --> 01:31:43,842
sequence of health related adverse effects

945
01:31:43,842 --> 01:31:49,302
end of life for materials that are

946
01:31:49,302 --> 01:31:54,362
contaminated might be in something called a confined disposal facility. these

947
01:31:54,362 --> 01:31:59,583
are basically giant landfills. this contains Rach

948
01:31:59,583 --> 01:32:05,203
seven minutes that is contaminated typically with PCP 's metals.

949
01:32:05,203 --> 01:32:10,542
I don't wanna spend too much time on those puppies are all over the Great Lakes and

950
01:32:10,542 --> 01:32:15,762
they have environmental consequences as well. 's

951
01:32:15,762 --> 01:32:20,822
fax any need both required

952
01:32:20,822 --> 01:32:26,362
an assessment of those environmental impact

953
01:32:26,362 --> 01:32:32,208
solution to plan use. so for those classification

954
01:32:32,208 --> 01:32:37,509
system was developed by the seek you and others and that's what I wanna

955
01:32:37,509 --> 01:32:43,669
spend a few minutes each of those environmental impacts had to be classified

956
01:32:43,669 --> 01:32:49,629
as to whether they were primary impact that means directly related to the action

957
01:32:49,629 --> 01:32:55,529
or if they were secondary impact indirectly related to the action

958
01:32:55,529 --> 01:33:00,669
as some examples. I discharged. I total suspended solids

959
01:33:00,669 --> 01:33:05,701
and the water produce pollution that's a primary and

960
01:33:05,701 --> 01:33:10,781
secondary impact might be for example I'd feel the bridge and

961
01:33:10,781 --> 01:33:16,000
then as a result of that I have accelerated developments. this requires additional shopping

962
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:21,381
center housing cost taxes go on practical so like

963
01:33:21,381 --> 01:33:26,441
those are all secondary. so it's another example. I

964
01:33:26,441 --> 01:33:31,461
remove soil. this call abrasion. I have excess of them in less

965
01:33:31,461 --> 01:33:36,921
sunlight gets into a watershed less oxygen because

966
01:33:36,921 --> 01:33:42,261
lower levels of photosynthesis for water quality and fish turns

967
01:33:42,261 --> 01:33:49,801
out we have been done. so those are all secondary impacts of this

968
01:33:49,801 --> 01:33:55,601
point here it is primary impact needs to be assessed secondary infections Steve says

969
01:33:55,601 --> 01:34:00,621
but it's really challenging sometimes to understand all the second. but they

970
01:34:00,621 --> 01:34:05,718
might even the most some other examples of

971
01:34:05,718 --> 01:34:11,178
secondary impacts our stress on traffic on infrastructure calls in traffic

972
01:34:11,178 --> 01:34:21,138
and air pollution diminished for supplies social changes so

973
01:34:21,138 --> 01:34:28,578
how do we predict what are the secondary and plus

974
01:34:28,578 --> 01:34:36,318
scoping back to school.

975
01:34:36,318 --> 01:34:41,578
okay. beyond primary and secondary needs the required estimate

976
01:34:41,578 --> 01:34:47,238
of the magnitude or severity of the impact duration duration so to declassify the

977
01:34:47,238 --> 01:34:54,938
short and long or short and long term.

978
01:34:54,938 --> 01:34:59,998
the timing and season. this is loss a for exam water

979
01:34:59,998 --> 01:35:05,461
pollution in the summer for severe winter once

980
01:35:05,461 --> 01:35:10,801
blowing faster oxygen is more prevalent.

981
01:35:10,801 --> 01:35:16,021
some newer concepts came out with respect to the reversible team.

982
01:35:16,021 --> 01:35:21,241
reasonable commitment of resources. if you are approaching this maybe from

983
01:35:21,241 --> 01:35:26,602
an economic factor you might think about opportunity cost. what are you giving up

984
01:35:26,602 --> 01:35:32,122
and so these are things that cannot be brought back and they might include cultural

985
01:35:32,122 --> 01:35:37,261
or natural resources or endangered species this

986
01:35:37,261 --> 01:35:42,341
needs to be line laid out six and

987
01:35:42,341 --> 01:35:47,521
then impact Center for and reversible. so for example you know if

988
01:35:47,521 --> 01:35:53,082
I put sentiments in into the stream it'll fall out eventually

989
01:35:53,082 --> 01:35:58,521
come by. okay so that's an example Percival sports here for you.

990
01:35:58,521 --> 01:36:06,087
so again people wanted each of the impacts to be classified. 's

991
01:36:06,087 --> 01:36:11,107
they want to know which impact can be mitigated. alright. so if I put

992
01:36:11,107 --> 01:36:16,188
in a simple rules and controls fast punch hay bales. maybe I can keep some of

993
01:36:16,188 --> 01:36:21,327
the mugs and getting you know reduce the amount of of serenity and

994
01:36:21,327 --> 01:36:26,807
so forth. 's me but requires

995
01:36:26,807 --> 01:36:32,007
an estimate of scale local curve regional to global and the foundry

996
01:36:32,007 --> 01:36:37,427
the in system. and this is really in part for practical for analysis and

997
01:36:37,427 --> 01:36:42,728
then overall measure which they call the significance to summary measure taking

998
01:36:42,728 --> 01:36:47,728
into account the duration scale. you're

999
01:36:47,728 --> 01:36:53,407
retrievable ass facts and so forth and it's so important

1000
01:36:53,407 --> 01:36:59,847
because if you find a project has a significant

1001
01:36:59,847 --> 01:37:05,764
message for egg and you have her work and if you find primarily

1002
01:37:05,764 --> 01:37:13,384
and significant impact then you can work some

1003
01:37:13,384 --> 01:37:18,684
questions on

1004
01:37:18,684 --> 01:37:25,023
iced

1005
01:37:25,023 --> 01:37:31,424
so for each impact was to be classified according to those standards.

1006
01:37:31,424 --> 01:37:36,644
so I talked about the duration. and this is the first

1007
01:37:36,644 --> 01:37:42,184
time bit of differential calculus assistance wake you up in the morning

1008
01:37:42,184 --> 01:37:47,444
and we talked about half life for an impact and it's just concept

1009
01:37:47,444 --> 01:37:52,764
and basically for looking at a concentration of the contaminants in the body or in the ecosystem

1010
01:37:52,764 --> 01:37:57,804
whatever. we look at the concentration of time sheet as compared to save the

1011
01:37:57,804 --> 01:38:02,894
initial concentration of times zero and I ratio

1012
01:38:02,894 --> 01:38:09,774
is one the of beginning and then if the decline declines exponentially we call the

1013
01:38:09,774 --> 01:38:14,874
half-life exponential decay and basically the idea behind

1014
01:38:14,874 --> 01:38:19,874
this is that after half life passes the concentration induced

1015
01:38:19,874 --> 01:38:24,874
by have. five ratio and drop down and it's about

1016
01:38:24,874 --> 01:38:30,274
four days. so when this particular picture. I have five four days

1017
01:38:30,274 --> 01:38:35,394
after another four days I asked what I said. half so of the houses

1018
01:38:35,394 --> 01:38:40,474
and border and so I'm out to be a save point and sixteen

1019
01:38:40,474 --> 01:38:45,654
days I two more half lights on and so forth. basically and

1020
01:38:45,654 --> 01:38:50,954
ten half lives point one percent remains twenty half lines. point zero zero zero

1021
01:38:50,954 --> 01:38:55,994
one percent women and so this is a concept which is

1022
01:38:55,994 --> 01:39:01,354
obvious you know very simple but many times we'll characterized half-life

1023
01:39:01,354 --> 01:39:06,379
with the substance and this is actually operationally important because if the substance

1024
01:39:06,379 --> 01:39:11,859
has half life center wall. we call that persistence and

1025
01:39:11,859 --> 01:39:17,600
particular organizations like I say see the international joint commission or EPA

1026
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:23,000
would consider substance and have half slides of very sweet or so to be

1027
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:28,279
processed and this is important because persistent chemicals

1028
01:39:28,279 --> 01:39:33,520
often via with you. not always but often the more talks

1029
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:39,600
just what's in example for system.

1030
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:44,609
you should be down to DC many of the plane

1031
01:39:44,609 --> 01:39:49,709
returns and so here's the mass and you can look at it but the

1032
01:39:49,709 --> 01:39:55,229
key idea here is that we're changing the expression here

1033
01:39:55,229 --> 01:40:00,529
for the change of the racial time. is the first order. okay. half life

1034
01:40:00,529 --> 01:40:05,649
for a rate equation with hosting times the concentration and then you can solve

1035
01:40:05,649 --> 01:40:10,769
that based on some boundary conditions and get the results. the other thing that matters

1036
01:40:10,769 --> 01:40:15,949
for us now is that you can look at the half life and the finest point six

1037
01:40:15,949 --> 01:40:21,169
nine. s here to be honest today

1038
01:40:21,169 --> 01:40:26,309
I don't feel like

1039
01:40:26,309 --> 01:40:31,489
questions from an atmospheric standpoint

1040
01:40:31,489 --> 01:40:36,769
half-life is also really important. and this is showing you different pollutants in their half lives

1041
01:40:36,769 --> 01:40:42,035
and so for a lot of the conventional foods like sauce and awesome on p.m.

1042
01:40:42,035 --> 01:40:47,355
maybe hours to days when we head off to focus. whose um

1043
01:40:47,355 --> 01:40:52,555
and we get to some of the greenhouse gases would have a lifetime in

1044
01:40:52,555 --> 01:40:57,775
years or even centuries and this is also for free because the airports move around

1045
01:40:57,775 --> 01:41:03,495
very much and so these short half lives are really typical

1046
01:41:03,495 --> 01:41:08,755
the local local concern. well it's the half life increases

1047
01:41:08,755 --> 01:41:13,795
a disperse over the troubles here. they can

1048
01:41:13,795 --> 01:41:19,235
become global and. so the half-life also influences the geographic

1049
01:41:19,235 --> 01:41:27,815
distribution of these contentment.

1050
01:41:27,815 --> 01:41:32,855
alright. so I already asked you this how do you determine the impacts for future projects you might

1051
01:41:32,855 --> 01:41:38,525
look at historical experience with comparable types of sites you might use predictive models

1052
01:41:38,525 --> 01:41:43,585
there are many types of protective models we can use and they would include things like

1053
01:41:43,585 --> 01:41:48,985
correlations or physically based models and in

1054
01:41:48,985 --> 01:41:54,685
this class will look at a couple of the physically base models that might be

1055
01:41:54,685 --> 01:42:00,705
the parameters outcomes that should be considered well if we just work through all this discussion of indicators

1056
01:42:00,705 --> 01:42:06,425
and so that's a good place to start and then you need to develop criteria for objectives

1057
01:42:06,425 --> 01:42:11,665
for each of those indicator.

1058
01:42:11,665 --> 01:42:17,085
need to obtain the EPA and be water action so forth. does a lot of

1059
01:42:17,085 --> 01:42:22,105
this for you. you know starting from a blank slate here as examples of some

1060
01:42:22,105 --> 01:42:27,465
of the indicators for water quality air quality and noise. please

1061
01:42:27,465 --> 01:42:32,465
differ in surprising ways for example and water quality I might

1062
01:42:32,465 --> 01:42:40,250
have some concerns this soft almost wide awake here about the song

1063
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:45,550
hello this is all tossed she goes to love what happened. 's based on

1064
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:50,570
yeah. alright so we have some fairly hard numbers that we might use

1065
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:55,790
in terms of this kind of physical parameters and measure air quality. I might

1066
01:42:55,790 --> 01:43:00,990
look at a particular or something like that. again above a certain thing we have

1067
01:43:00,990 --> 01:43:06,030
expectations adverse. however when I

1068
01:43:06,030 --> 01:43:11,250
get this invoice. I can measure sound pressure levels.

1069
01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:16,450
but sometimes what's more what's much more important is in fact any assessment of

1070
01:43:16,450 --> 01:43:25,210
the bother you and how many people. so it's more subjective.

1071
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:37,041
just dissolved oxygen. so there's all kinds of things

1072
01:43:37,041 --> 01:43:42,321
what I haven't done on the slide is these are different indicator and then maybe

1073
01:43:42,321 --> 01:43:49,621
I need to add a call on the same maximum minimal supplement level. that's the crates

1074
01:43:49,621 --> 01:43:55,381
now when I do that something happens this process becomes

1075
01:43:55,381 --> 01:44:02,461
scary and it's these days

1076
01:44:02,461 --> 01:44:08,341
and we'll talk about that a little bit. but when you look at in easy I guess is that quantitative MS

1077
01:44:08,341 --> 01:44:14,481
and they tell you that update guess that your concentration that's allowable seventy parts per million

1078
01:44:14,481 --> 01:44:19,921
or billion I'm sorry. Andy the and the other supporting statements.

1079
01:44:19,921 --> 01:44:25,341
we achieved it is sixty nine point nine seven. I have to

1080
01:44:25,341 --> 01:44:33,421
shake slide.

1081
01:44:33,421 --> 01:44:39,277
but is it with you I can't tell you home in any case

1082
01:44:39,277 --> 01:44:45,277
I've seen. we work if we use the standard set

1083
01:44:45,277 --> 01:44:50,657
as a goal. we figure out what it takes which

1084
01:44:50,657 --> 01:44:56,957
really is the attention of this loss. but it's also.

1085
01:44:56,957 --> 01:45:04,797
I'm sure you've seen stuff get paid more for

1086
01:45:04,797 --> 01:45:09,977
other indicators and criteria would pertain to wildlife habitat and health

1087
01:45:09,977 --> 01:45:15,117
and stuff. so wrap this up. these indicators

1088
01:45:15,117 --> 01:45:20,297
are really important to you need to understand physical basis. need to understand how relevant

1089
01:45:20,297 --> 01:45:25,397
they are more concerned about need to understand how you got to this point and

1090
01:45:25,397 --> 01:45:30,677
their strengths and limitations. they typically are related to primary impact

1091
01:45:30,677 --> 01:45:39,021
me but has a broader mandate. to look at secondary impacts is

1092
01:45:39,021 --> 01:45:44,301
so again some summary language here. we do want these indicators

1093
01:45:44,301 --> 01:45:50,421
to be relevance wants to be markers one sense

1094
01:45:50,421 --> 01:45:55,421
measures of indicator injury and sometimes public responses all

1095
01:45:55,421 --> 01:46:00,481
different types but we want them be to scientifically justified communicated. you know

1096
01:46:00,481 --> 01:46:06,041
your way. measurable last today

1097
01:46:06,041 --> 01:46:11,261
by the works before I let you go. if you're interested in improving so our

1098
01:46:11,261 --> 01:46:16,281
seminar on Tuesday and Thursday seven fifty five is home

1099
01:46:16,281 --> 01:46:22,748
renovation and how this affects and by

1100
01:46:22,748 --> 01:46:28,508
setting up and you that's doing so

1101
01:46:28,508 --> 01:46:33,708
we can look at and ask for example voice levels pollution levels

1102
01:46:33,708 --> 01:46:38,729
or whatever and we can measure this over time and we can say okay here's

1103
01:46:38,729 --> 01:46:43,948
what happens when the project is built. here's what happens without the project. this difference

1104
01:46:43,948 --> 01:46:48,988
is the portion of it for people to assist difference is very

1105
01:46:48,988 --> 01:46:54,148
small maybe there's an equity. so this is one approach to do it

1106
01:46:54,148 --> 01:46:59,548
over the line. second approach might be to look at impact

1107
01:46:59,548 --> 01:47:04,608
station. if I'm dealing with the water system like to look upstream unaffected by the

1108
01:47:04,608 --> 01:47:09,729
project. we're downstream. okay. so that's kind of another approach look at it and

1109
01:47:09,729 --> 01:47:14,928
then I can use the cross sectional comparisons and affected area versus pristine area. so these

1110
01:47:14,928 --> 01:47:23,462
are always try to validate ourselves

1111
01:47:23,462 --> 01:47:29,102
I'll leave you with this think about the slide to your quitters.

1112
01:47:29,102 --> 01:47:36,562
if you have issues with the quiz let me know. you have two shops before I

1113
01:47:36,562 --> 01:48:02,035
guess
