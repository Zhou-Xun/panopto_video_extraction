1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:16,750
It's to this.

2
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:40,410
Yeah. You want to see care reform?

3
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:53,470
I don't know if you want me to ask about it.

4
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:28,170
You don't have to be. You shake hands with your sister in law, which I'm sure you will have at one of the great times.

5
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,260
Yeah, I know that.

6
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:44,330
We already have our first snow today. So the midterm has been great for the most part.

7
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:53,300
It's a weird distribution. We have quite a few more scores, which is great.

8
00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:00,520
And on the other hand, we also have some, you know, unsatisfactory scores as well.

9
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,160
So we're going to host the race later today.

10
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:17,450
And after some discussion, they structure from the other session and we have decided to curb think we know the rankings are going to be the same,

11
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,860
but they're going to agree with some formulas.

12
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,180
So you will see the grades later today.

13
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:36,970
And I would encourage those who didn't got very good scores to chat with me and you can email me,

14
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:44,440
try to schedule an appointment, particularly if you don't that they are both employees.

15
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:55,580
Get in touch with me. Okay, let's figure out what's going on and how we can help you to improve your performance in this course.

16
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:06,650
All right. And also for your homework is going to be assigned today is due next Thursday.

17
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:24,430
This is. You know, and also, if you if you want, you can come and take up your exam in my office next week.

18
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,610
Okay? So I'll be in my office for the office hour next week in person.

19
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,330
So come and pick up your exam. Okay.

20
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:40,260
Any questions? All right, good.

21
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:50,280
So let's continue where we have left last week before the fabric of the place.

22
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:57,360
Talk about the normal distribution and having got to the the proof that this PDF actually.

23
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,390
That's where we lost the last time.

24
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:11,940
So just as a reminder, the normal distribution is one of probably the most important distributions that we can learn in mathematical statistics.

25
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:22,530
So the preparation of normal origin from this approximation of this are some of many small deviations.

26
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:29,490
And the PDF for a normal distribution was mean mu and various sigma squared is given in this formula.

27
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,100
Okay.

28
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:42,510
And I do expect everyone to memorize this formula, you know, because this is the most important formula that I can ever learn from this, of course.

29
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,190
And. Or Staten Island distribution.

30
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:55,420
It has means zero variance one which has a simplified PDF of this form and it has a about L-shaped curve.

31
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:06,400
If you draw it and because of this symmetry we have seen that the city, after you follow this stuff,

32
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,950
have this nice property, it's a city of any value, it's going to be equal to one minus.

33
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:22,450
Let's evaluate negative X and we also do some derivation to show that the median is actually a meal and the variance has actually Sigma Square.

34
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,710
And so those are the two parameters that defines a normal distribution.

35
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,930
And we also talk about a leaner transformation of the normal.

36
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,590
It's also a normal distribution. For example, any distribution you can always center it is going to make.

37
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:45,270
It's not a normal or undo. It is a very appropriate part.

38
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,880
Is the standard normal distribution multiplied by a standard deviation plus?

39
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:56,050
I mean, you got a new normal distribution with the virus.

40
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,650
Okay. And this would be very useful later on when we talk about, you know, some topics.

41
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:14,250
So where we out is we want to show that actually this PDA function integrates a one and that actually is not very trivial.

42
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:23,130
In particular, we can just focus on a standard normal PDA because any normal distribution,

43
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,230
you can always apply this linear transformation and make it a standard normal distribution.

44
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,380
But that is to say, if we can show for the set of normal distributions the PDA anywhere,

45
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:42,750
one line for any normal distribution model is all you need to do is to first apply some linear transformation to your argument,

46
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,890
and then you're going to become exactly the same configuration.

47
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:56,160
All we need to show is that by the standard normal this time integrates the one and then solve all our problems.

48
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:10,680
So that's how we can prove that. So we denote this, this, this integration to be I and we don't know what high value is.

49
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:21,120
We want to show that high is equal to one. But now let's just write out the constant height and the the trait that we find here is we take the

50
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,239
square of high so that and we have a multiplication of two integrations along with the risk factor.

51
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,649
And the other especially one is the multiplication of two.

52
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,550
Integration in this case is equal to the double integration.

53
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,990
So you can combine the term inside this integration to get this equivalent expression,

54
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:53,820
and now you can say why we want to introduce X and Y, because it's a two dimensional coordinate system in the Canadian space.

55
00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:04,410
And once you take a look of the term inside this integration, you notice that you have this term X squared plus Y squared,

56
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:19,890
which with some experience, you would be able to notice that that typically reminds us of the polar coordinates.

57
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:33,780
The other words you can read represent any data point x y on this plane in space by two coordinates from the polar coordinate system.

58
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,990
One is this radius R and the other is this angle theta.

59
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:51,510
From the x axis. So any x y on this planet can be equivalent represented using this new pair of parameters on theta.

60
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,310
And in particular, there is a 1 to 1 relations. You can always express y equal to our times sine theta.

61
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:11,850
And actually the quality of our times cosine theta with theta being from 0 to 2 pi basically the entire circle and r from zero to infinity.

62
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,330
So this is a 1 to 1 transformation of the original random variable.

63
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:24,690
Sorry, the original parameters x and y. So this new barrel parameters are that theta.

64
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:33,120
If we could just change our quantity or we can also view it as a change of variables for this double integration.

65
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:41,120
Your change from the x y coordinate to this, our theta coordinate and this aren't theta coordinate is called the polar coordinates.

66
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:51,570
And once we do that, you can say y that simplify that the the calculation in particular, if you think about this term inside the integration,

67
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:58,500
you have this X squared plus y squared that is equal to what in terms of this new parameters are theta.

68
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,020
But it's X squared plus y squared are square.

69
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:13,840
Right. Because you can see that this is just a.

70
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,989
The triangle is not perpendicular angles of x squared plus y squared is just r squared.

71
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:30,070
So you only have one parameter locked inside this integration.

72
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,570
So that could simplify this integration.

73
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,469
More specifically, if you do this change of variable,

74
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:47,830
you also need to take care of this on the XD UI term and from calculus we know that if you change the x y to the r d theta,

75
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:56,560
you need to multiply this chookagian in front of this, this, this, this terms.

76
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:04,390
So the Jacobean is defined as the partial derivative of acts of our wild are excellent theta wide over theta.

77
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:17,860
If you take recall that at this point your r times cosine theta y is equal to our sine theta it do these partial derivatives.

78
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:26,950
This is the matrix that I'm going to get. And then you take the determinant of this matrix and take the absolute value of that, right?

79
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:37,330
So that gave us art. So that is to say the origin of the d y is now transformed into this r times, r d theta.

80
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:48,520
Okay, so now we can put everything together. So the original square now becomes this new integration with respect to our theta.

81
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,210
Inside we have this e to the neck.

82
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:59,240
They are square over two over two pi and then we have our CRT theta.

83
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:05,300
You first integrate theta from 0 to 2 pi and they integrate R from zero to infinity.

84
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,540
That's the range for this on the new parameters.

85
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:15,380
Okay. And again, this, whenever you are integrating does not involve theta.

86
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:21,410
So the first part is just, you know, it's just a constant function with respect to theta.

87
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,700
And the second part is it becomes this one.

88
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:35,380
And you can get a read of the first integration with respect to theta by noticing that the function actually is a constant function,

89
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:42,560
respect that theta. And then you got this single integration and that one, you actually can directly solve it.

90
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:49,010
The function is this and to evaluate from zero to infinity that give us a one.

91
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,010
If I square equal to one that I must be equal.

92
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:01,660
I don't trust the problem. So again, the trick here is read Chavez first.

93
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:12,280
Instead of directly solving this by solving this original integration of the PD out, we follow it.

94
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,380
We multiply it by itself.

95
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:23,800
So we have a double integration and then we use a change of coordinate from the original Euclidean coordinate to this polo coordinate.

96
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:31,020
And then. We can use the calculus to solve it.

97
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,670
Yes. What is the trick for you?

98
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:43,720
So the Jacobean is. These are short derivative matrix.

99
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:51,010
And so if you do a change of variables from one set of coordinates to another set of coordinates,

100
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:57,880
you always have to take care of this part of derivative and that probably verbatim is called Dr. Calvin.

101
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,170
So that that's from calculus, multivariate calculus.

102
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:12,820
And now we need to change this DST UI in our original Tableau integration into our new coordinates.

103
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,350
The are these data right. But they are not exactly equal to one another.

104
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:24,210
The relation between these two quantities is that yes, the Y is equal to that.

105
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:31,540
Jacobi In this determinant, the absolute value of the determinant of the Jacobean times, the r be fair.

106
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:38,530
And in this case if you write out that Jacobi, you can find the absolute value of the determinant is equal to R.

107
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,730
And if any of those.

108
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:58,400
So right now the absolute value of the determinant by just the determinant of the Jacobean that in need to multiply in front of this PR indicator.

109
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:10,460
So if any of this is familiar to you, make sure that you find that you are helping us both take a close look at the multi barrier calculus part.

110
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,460
And are we going to definitely need that for the next part of that of the next chapter?

111
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:23,780
All right. I'm going to use multivariate calculus heavily for the next chapter.

112
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:34,250
So it's a good time to familiarize yourself with this derivations and any other questions.

113
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:48,770
Right. So the normal distribution, as I said, it has a lot of utilities.

114
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:56,990
One of the utilities is to approximate a binomial distribution by approximating the binomial.

115
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:01,700
I mean, if a recall of a binomial is a discrete distribution, right?

116
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:07,970
A novel is a continuous discrete distribution. But if you think about the binomial.

117
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,500
With this parameter and the p m being the number of trials.

118
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:24,310
PB and the probability of success if an.

119
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,600
Goes into it goes to infinity. All right.

120
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:36,500
And if you draw the piano out of this binomial, let's say, and it goes to infinity.

121
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:45,170
Now that's fixed p to be point five for now, and meaning you'll have an equal chance of success on a theater trial.

122
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:52,130
Then if you draw the PMF, it's going to be approximating this.

123
00:16:53,770 --> 00:17:00,920
I it with this entries being zero one, two, three and all the way to it.

124
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,090
Okay. So it only takes now zero is the piano function.

125
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:09,140
All it takes now zero about is at this integer point from zero to it.

126
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,160
And if you look at the overall shift of this piano function, it looks like about it.

127
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:25,520
And that actually you can use a normal distribution with appropriate manner bearers to approximate the this binomial

128
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:37,520
distribution in the sense that you can generate a normal distribution with mean being n times P various B,

129
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,150
end times P, times one minus p. All right.

130
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:48,290
And that's going to look like. So it has this MP in the center.

131
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,100
So that's the relation between those two distributions.

132
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:11,620
All right. And in particular, if you want to calculate the probability of if you run a variable as far as the binomial distribution,

133
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:28,610
if you want to calculate the probability. Acts say equal to 15, for example, make up a number that is approximately equal to the probability.

134
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:34,460
Let's say you have another one American life, all in its normal approximation, our normal distribution.

135
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:54,520
But why? You can find you can verify that that probability of actually 15 actually is very close to the probability of Y between 14.5 and 15.5.

136
00:18:55,270 --> 00:19:03,400
In other words, you can divide this p function by this integer values.

137
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:09,580
And just to look at the area under the curve, it put an average two unit or about.

138
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:17,260
It was between every editor or minus plot point five not area going to approximate

139
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,010
the probability of a binomial random variable taking that integer about it.

140
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:30,970
So that's what this approximation means. Or more commonly we can have this relation.

141
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,590
So for acts following a binomial distribution. This acts.

142
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:53,830
Minus nine times p over N times p times one minus p square root.

143
00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:05,140
You calculate this one, this going to approximate in normal standard normal distribution with 010 unguaranteed part one.

144
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:12,760
Okay. And this is convergence in distribution, which we will introduce later in the semester.

145
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,710
So that's what this approximate approximation means.

146
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:29,170
And the usage of this is in practice. If you have a large and people 2.5, the probability from this binomial may not be very easy to calculate,

147
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:34,750
but these provides you alternative way to calculate the probability for actually quite of antibody.

148
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:40,900
I can just to use a normal C the F to tell you what the approximate probability is.

149
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,620
What is binomial? Questions.

150
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:55,170
Right. So as I said multiple times,

151
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:02,730
normal distribution is very useful in many settings and play a very important role in sampling distribution in large samples,

152
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:08,820
which we will cover in chapter five in particular, it's the foundation for the Central Limit theorem,

153
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:14,880
and there are many other distributions that actually is derived from the normal distribution.

154
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,500
For example, the T distribution, RF distribution, chi square.

155
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,450
We are going to introduce next and the city of.

156
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,209
We're just going to be talking about the city, about those distributions.

157
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:37,390
But later, all the other courses you will see about how this normal distribution actually can be used for sampling of this.

158
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:42,800
Additional distributions are used to build a connection with those distributions.

159
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:50,450
Okay. All right. So now it's coming up is a tea distribution.

160
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,610
As I said, it is closely related to the normal.

161
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:03,060
So the T distribution is defined by one parameter that is the degree of freedom, so denoted by K.

162
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,360
So we use this t subscript k to denote the teacher should be the same as k degrees of freedom.

163
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,290
Okay. Must be a constant. Must be a integer.

164
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,680
Positive integer. One, two, three, four, five, etc.

165
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:24,360
And with any fixed it or k the PD out or this t distribution is expressed in this way.

166
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:31,650
Okay. And the support for a T distribution antiviral is on the entire space.

167
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:36,900
In particular, the gamma function is defined in this way.

168
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:44,279
And for any value, a sama a is equal to the integration of zero in infinity.

169
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,830
As to the minus one e two, it adds the X in particular.

170
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,210
If it is an integer, then this gamma function has a close form.

171
00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:02,940
Otherwise it does not have a close mark. All right, so gamma, a integer is always equal to a minus one factorial.

172
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,030
And that also tells us some properties about the function.

173
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:24,450
For example, Gamma A plus one is equal to what, a battery of six, which is eight times three minus one factorial.

174
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:32,650
And then we know a minus one factorial is a so that is eight times chi.

175
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:39,840
So that's a very, very important property.

176
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:50,430
Not actually this relation not only applies to integers but also applies to nominators or any a readers at zero.

177
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:57,240
We always have comma eight plus one equal to a hard guy.

178
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:15,600
Okay, so that's one property of the gamma function and another property is that you can verify gamma one half is equal to a square root of pi.

179
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:23,610
So I'll leave this to you. You can think about how to show that nominal one half is equal to the square root of high.

180
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:30,450
And a you can try to use try to do change of variables and take advantage of the

181
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:35,790
PD out for normal distribution to show that I'll leave it as an exercise for you.

182
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:44,130
So those are about all the common functions and this CDF for the T distribution is defined

183
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:50,550
using the summer functions and we want to show that it actually universe one which is,

184
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:55,320
you know, not very difficult to show.

185
00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:05,370
You just need to do the integration. Noticing that you have a term with squared, it was a change of variables and then the constants while cancel out.

186
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:12,870
And so the T distribution is closely related to the normal.

187
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,160
It's beyond the scope of this course, how they are related.

188
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:26,940
But essentially this T distribution, you can think about it as having our tail version of the normal distribution.

189
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:33,690
If you draw the actual form of this PDA, it also looks like a portion.

190
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:50,729
And the only difference from a normal distribution is that if you draw standard normal on the same part of the normal, look like a very similar.

191
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,730
But the difference is mainly on the tail.

192
00:25:54,390 --> 00:26:08,820
So the normal of lighter tails and this t having to take over the smaller that the about freedom is, the heavier the talons.

193
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:18,960
In other words, the tail going to be higher with more probability on the tail and k goes to infinity.

194
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,620
This T distribution has got to approximate a normal distribution.

195
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:31,740
Right? So that's the relation between the two. So next y is the distribution.

196
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:47,940
Here is a PDF pretty complicated. You probably have learn and use this after your bush and your expecting us and see how it's related to the normal.

197
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,810
So here is a PDF or the top. Distribution is defined by two parameters two degrees of freedom.

198
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:58,050
A one actually two. Both are positive.

199
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:03,390
Okay, so here is the definition for that and the support is from zero to infinity.

200
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:09,690
So again, these are just for just a very brief intro to this distribution.

201
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:21,360
Another one is a Chi square. If y follows the Chi Square distribution, then you know, support is from zero to infinity.

202
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,990
Has a PDF in this form, right?

203
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,960
And Chi Square also has one parameter that is our freedom.

204
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:39,910
One, two, three, four, five, etc. And the relation between Chi Square and a kind of standard novel is that.

205
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:54,500
Y is equal to the sum of say they want a straight square.

206
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:00,950
Is the standard normal?

207
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:11,839
Then why Chi Square wants to different from the other words a chi square distribution

208
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,920
is can be viewed as a sum of squares of a standard normal distribution.

209
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:25,730
If you just take the square of a standard normal, you got a chi square, one containing two independent standard normal.

210
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:32,809
Square them. Add them up. You got a chi square of two, square the normal.

211
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:37,220
You know, the support is always from zero. So that's a chi square.

212
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:45,080
And if you draw from all the up, it looks like nine zeros.

213
00:28:50,500 --> 00:29:00,530
Looks like this. And as he becomes the larger, it just gradually shift to the right.

214
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:09,270
Right. That's what the pdf.

215
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:22,260
Any questions still unanswered.

216
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,330
Parameters under which does that fit into this PDA? So that again, interrupt.

217
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,950
We learn about a non centrality parameter. Mm hmm. So where does that fit into this PDA?

218
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:37,740
You know, that's a good question. So Chi Square also have several variants.

219
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,820
One is you have a noun, such reality parameter.

220
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:55,440
Um, so you have to modify this PDR to take into account that non-security parameter, essentially a ship, the entire distribution horizontally.

221
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:02,250
Yeah. So that's additional parameter or additional degree of freedom that I had to this distribution.

222
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:08,130
Again, recall that for each distribution is a family of distributions.

223
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,960
Right. And the families is controlled by some parameters.

224
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:20,130
So Chi square, the static chi square only have one parameter that is that the graph trade on.

225
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:30,200
But if you allow some flexibility by adding a non central ity parameter, then you can you can have a more flexible,

226
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:35,240
bigger family of distributions essentially that is related to the sum of squares

227
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:40,320
up now centered on a normal distribution announcement or a normal distribution.

228
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:45,000
So that's where the and trying typically.

229
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,530
Any other questions? All right.

230
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:57,610
So. Move on to the next one.

231
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:07,510
So the next one is just a very important distribution as well as that is exponential distribution.

232
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,760
It has a simple form, but it's widely used in practice.

233
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:22,330
Later on, we will see why that is. So this distribution again has one parameter laminar, and the support is from zero to infinity.

234
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:30,970
And this from the lambda has to be greater than zero.

235
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:40,110
And the PDR is defined in this way. One over one of the times e to the negative one over number is y greater equals zero.

236
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,480
Thank you. Draw it. The pdf looks like this.

237
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,590
So I start at one over lambda.

238
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:59,200
8.0 Y for a zero.

239
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:08,200
This PDA function is equal to one over lambda. And then you notice that as y becomes larger, it decreases.

240
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,390
Is the decrease in function and decay exponentially to zero.

241
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,840
That's what the PD application. All right.

242
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:24,390
So first, another one we want to ask is what is a city of functions?

243
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,720
In this case, actually, it has a close form expression for the city.

244
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:35,620
Just to give you maybe one minute, try to derive the CDF from this PDA.

245
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,490
Hey, you all got it.

246
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:48,530
So we just plug in the PDA and solve this integration.

247
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:56,630
The original function is active heat with an active max over lambda to evaluate it from an active affinity to lambda.

248
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:03,590
You got this close for expression for the CDF one minus E to the active y overlap.

249
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:09,920
And these is for Y. We're not part of zero zero.

250
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,000
It's always zero zero.

251
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:21,530
They start to go up and then that y y approach infinity.

252
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,370
And so that's the city of function.

253
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:36,700
So in practice, actually this S.D. of we can also with the city app,

254
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:44,320
we can also have the quantification of this quantity, the probability of y greater than anything.

255
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:50,599
Why y right. From the definition we know that's one minus the probability of this rhinovirus.

256
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:58,670
All last are equal to this constant y, which is why minus a compulsion.

257
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:05,260
And in practice, people call this the survival function.

258
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:21,530
And for that exponential distribution, the survival function as the expression of the narrative e to the narrative y overlap.

259
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:30,600
All right. So the survival function and the reason why it's called survival is really originates from the

260
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:36,300
survival analysis where people care about the probability of surviving beyond some kind of one.

261
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:43,350
So that is to say, we care about the probability on the other side of this of this constant.

262
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:50,790
The city of just gave us the probability to the life of this constant survival analysis.

263
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:56,490
More commonly, we care about the probability on the other side, just one -30.

264
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,470
That's why they give it a new name.

265
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:09,500
Although this two functions are very closely related to one another, it's just the one minus four exponential.

266
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:15,150
The survival function is that e to the next take a while not find out why we don't go to zero.

267
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,560
All right. So some moments for this exponential distribution.

268
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:29,460
Again, let me put the PDF here and I'll give you a couple of minutes to derive this moment.

269
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:53,950
They use different ways to derive the moments. PDA or are they exponential try to divide this mean and parents or this exponential distribution.

270
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,780
Right. And you got it. And so let's take a look at this together.

271
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,290
So here I proceed with the moment generating function.

272
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:45,720
Once we have this expression, we can use it to evaluate any order moments.

273
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:52,950
So by definition, the moment generating function is defined as the expectation of E to the t y.

274
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:59,429
So we just plug in this PDA. Here is what we have and we have the E to the t y.

275
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:03,360
And we also have this another exponential term in the PDA function.

276
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,730
And one point that we can notice immediately is that this two exponential can be combined.

277
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,870
Once we combine them, it becomes a single exponential.

278
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:23,790
In the power term, there is a Y, there is a constant, which reminds us of the same of the PDA or the same distribution,

279
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:29,220
which has a different parameter with some manipulation of the constant eventually.

280
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:34,800
And you can get rid of this integration, or alternatively you can directly solve this equation.

281
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,730
And the final result is a one over one minus T.

282
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:46,320
Now the moment generating function or exponential or T in the neighborhood of zero, right?

283
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:54,960
And once we have this moment generated function, we can take the first order of derivative T on a zero and got the mean.

284
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:59,280
And now we take it to the second derivative state of zero.

285
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:04,830
You got the second order, Moreland. And then we use the formula to get the power.

286
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:10,680
So I'll make the calculation. I'll leave it to you. But the result is here.

287
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:22,740
The ME is Lambda Barrens, Islam, the square. That is to say, if Lambda Gas larger, you have larger, mean larger reference.

288
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:28,110
And that actually can be seen from this the sketch of the PDA function.

289
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:38,160
Right. So if a lambda becomes larger, this point always goes out, right?

290
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:44,700
If that becomes larger, you will have this point moving downward.

291
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:51,120
So I say this is the important one. This is lambda to.

292
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,100
So this is Romney 4 to 3.

293
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:08,400
For example, as lamb knuckles becomes the larger this point where this pdaf function with the y axis actually goes up and flatter,

294
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:17,310
I think becomes flatter. The median, which is the average of all possible values, this random animal, they would move to the right.

295
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:26,969
So that's why the mean gets larger, louder, louder. And also you can say this, Brad is also wider, although the support is the same.

296
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:31,770
But the degree of redness becomes higher.

297
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:40,380
A lot of. And so that explains why it's so visual.

298
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:55,470
That tells us how me and a balance change with increase in actual mean for this distribution Islam the various Islamist questions.

299
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:10,280
All right. So one of the reasons why exponential is so important is because of this memory loss and this property of the distribution.

300
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:17,780
We actually have seen this the property by this called distribution, the geometric distribution.

301
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:28,640
I recall when the memory loss in this property is geometric, it just means the probability of the random arrival,

302
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,760
which is geometrically greater than certain value,

303
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:41,210
is equal to the conditional probability of that around a variable greater than not particular value.

304
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:50,000
Plus where is an account set plus that particular value given now the right amount is greater than the constant.

305
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,340
The other words two distributions are equivalent.

306
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,940
One is the marginal distribution. One is a conditional distribution.

307
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:05,060
The conditional distribution is conditional upon that the right amount was beyond some constant.

308
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:14,270
Then the probability of a quarter is greater than some counts that some some value remain the same.

309
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:18,590
The probability of that remains the same. So that's why it's kind of memorized this.

310
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:24,530
Once the conditional form is greater than the constant, then it almost starts.

311
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,440
It starts fresh as a new geometric right environment.

312
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:36,350
And that's why it's called memory lossless. It does not have a memory before that condition.

313
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:45,800
Similar here for the continuous distribution. The macro is not as defined this way and it why is exponential.

314
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:56,100
With friend alumna. Then we have this equality the probability of y greater than us,

315
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:05,580
which as a consent to one is equal to the conditional probability of y greater than as plus t gave a y is greater than.

316
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:13,910
Right. So what that means in this. PDF.

317
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:33,530
What is if you have the. It comes in here on the right hand side, the probability of y greater ask this in this area I guess the question.

318
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:41,120
So our Markov in models based off then the exponential or the geometric distribution not necessarily a

319
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:50,840
makeover model actually is assumption is you do not have memory beyond the one type point ahead of you.

320
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:59,480
That's one of the assumptions for the multiplier. But they have nothing to do with the distribution with exponential distribution.

321
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:10,800
All right. So. The right hand side is just the area, the sit in area in this piece, in this figure.

322
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:19,710
All right. So we can also have another is to draw another finger with the same distribution.

323
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:26,010
And this is so this is as if this amount is us.

324
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:36,090
If you have another constant here and you have same distance as the left hand side.

325
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:48,970
But the right side means. Is the ratio of this area with respect to.

326
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:09,790
This area. So let's say this area is a cross shaded area.

327
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:16,260
That's the problem. And that's why we don't equal that's why greater that has positive.

328
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:25,510
If you are conditional upon that. Is greater than t then that gave you this total shaded area.

329
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:31,389
Right. So the conditional probability of Y greater than as opposed to you gave a y greater than

330
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:38,260
t it just the ratio of that cross shaded area with this to this overall shaded area.

331
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:47,950
And what they say question tells us is that that ratio is going to be exactly the same as this blue shaded area in the regional distribution.

332
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:55,090
Again, the and this property means conditional upon that a Y is greater than T.

333
00:47:55,660 --> 00:48:03,630
If we've got everything that happened before t, it starts fresh as a new exponential distribution with the same problem go up.

334
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,559
Now what is another way to express this?

335
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:15,790
Is y cable y greater than t has the same distribution with y.

336
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:41,640
That's what it what it means. So the more rigorous Y minus T has the same distribution as Y, and the proof is just following the definition.

337
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:47,490
And following the definition, we kind of show a lot of anxiety is equal to the right hand side.

338
00:48:48,300 --> 00:49:03,050
So the left hand side. By definition, that is the probability of life within the House plus T and y greater than T there is y.

339
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:12,590
Greater than t. Right. And the intersection of y greater now has plus t and a y greater than t.

340
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:15,860
It's just the y greater than that positive.

341
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:21,210
Because that's a smaller set, right? Why?

342
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:25,790
Great teeth. They plug in the survival function into this case.

343
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:47,710
So you got into the. And after simplification, you got e to the negative as the logo.

344
00:49:48,390 --> 00:50:00,760
And we know that it's over and we know that is the survival function for my reader.

345
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,330
That's not complete approval. Just follow that.

346
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:09,660
The definition we can show this. What's more important is what it actually means.

347
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:16,860
What this is property actually means. It just means conditional upon this y greater than the constant.

348
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:23,550
If we get everything that happened before that, we start fresh as a new exponential distribution.

349
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:31,260
And in this case, since there's a continuous, continuous distribution,

350
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:38,160
we do not have to be very careful whether we use glitter or we are not like that geometric things where this

351
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:45,839
equal sign actually matters or continuous distribution equals and does not matter because for any number,

352
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:51,120
any value, the probability of random variable taken that particular value is always zero.

353
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:58,230
Any questions? Okay.

354
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:27,380
So let's take a break and come back out to the public policy issue.

355
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:55,840
And what do you make of all of this?

356
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:14,219
Yeah, sure. You know, it's not that little box.

357
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:32,880
The only thing that I know that I can almost actually give you up market research,

358
00:52:35,520 --> 00:53:03,570
foundation institutions did for people 000 you know you distributions to our different generations

359
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:38,850
because you have to also say that essentially or not you are is shocked at how much knowledge that you.

360
00:53:44,360 --> 00:54:47,990
Know. What do you think we need to do to know why you have not been released a mental illness in your life?

361
00:54:49,010 --> 00:55:02,790
I thought you were going to show me husband all the time.

362
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:43,360
You go over the past year and a half, which includes 615 states.

363
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:50,600
That's something we should not be watching.

364
00:55:51,470 --> 00:56:10,660
Is it some percentage? It's not serious because you said it was presidential in terms of how close the zero

365
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:31,310
six found prominence over the course of the second year without more accountability.

366
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:48,740
So how do you like? My understanding is that the ratio of professionals they work for the smaller houses is greater than the Spanish.

367
00:56:50,250 --> 00:57:34,090
So if you look at this problem and, you know, the North Korean score doesn't tell any of the military functions which are for the rest of the world.

368
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:45,720
Oh, I didn't bother.

369
00:57:47,900 --> 00:58:05,350
That's fine. So I think, you know, I think at some point, you know,

370
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:45,010
there is something I kind of think I'm like a scientist or something to tell us how well the government was able to.

371
00:58:51,180 --> 00:59:04,110
But that's usually because of her facilities and schools and those, you know,

372
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:28,420
where she was because, you know, you don't want to accompany your husband.

373
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:39,870
Sometimes when I get out, you have to do something.

374
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:55,420
I didn't want to get involved because it wasn't just like a high turnover.

375
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:06,930
What do you like about smoking juice or something like that?

376
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:15,320
You just got to make it so.

377
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:20,270
And that's distribution that we're going to talk about is gonna distribution.

378
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:31,520
I know there's a lot of distribution that recovers in this sector that's part of this lecture, but essentially you can say that.

379
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:37,160
So say nothing to you, right? So all this stuff as we have seen it,

380
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:47,749
the only thing you as though a claim you call it a particular PDF some name some families up distribution that's that's all and the

381
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:55,430
derivation of the mean the Barron's see the PDF these are all from definitions or from other traits that we have learned so far.

382
01:00:55,610 --> 01:01:01,850
So you just treat it as a, you know, exercise and not that no more.

383
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:07,640
And after class, try to complete all this derivations as much as you can.

384
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:14,880
Um, if I didn't provide the mean the barons or even the third owner more than four and try to do it.

385
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:20,420
So I followed that definition or use a moment generating function or some other traits

386
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:26,120
and try to verify whether the PDA integrator one those are all going exercise,

387
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:32,719
especially if people feel like they didn't need extra exercise for countless.

388
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,450
These are all perfect examples. All right.

389
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:43,100
So we don't have time to go over everything in great detail in class, but those are definitely those two places to start.

390
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:49,549
All right. So let's look at this distribution of distribution, which is defined by two parameters.

391
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:54,020
And a lot of the support is from zero to infinity.

392
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,890
And the formula the PDF is in this way.

393
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:04,730
When you look at the PDF function for a family of distribution,

394
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:14,930
the most important things are the terms that involve this kind of error about why the counts that

395
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:19,610
it doesn't really matter IntelliSense if they're mainly to make the integration equal to one.

396
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:26,990
So we pay close attention to this, to the terms that are involved.

397
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:33,920
Why in this case, save for the commas, distribution, you can say there are two places where Y shows up.

398
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:48,380
One is even in this exponential term, in the power term, there's a first order Y and there is a power term of y y to the power of a minus one.

399
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:55,610
So next time we are trying to solve some integration, somehow inside the integration,

400
01:02:56,210 --> 01:03:06,440
you can reorganize your formulas as the multiplication of X closer term is Y in it and a power term with Y being the base,

401
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:12,530
then, you know, maybe you can take advantage of this comma PDA to simplify that integration.

402
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:25,400
So that's how you got that, this intuition, this by just paying close attention to the terms that are involved in this PDA functions.

403
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:31,100
And the same goes for all the other distributions. All right. Okay.

404
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:41,060
So recall that we have defined this comma, comma function when we talk about the T distribution.

405
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:47,840
So comma function again and that recapitulate what we just said.

406
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:56,130
Comma A is defined as. Seeing the creation from zero to infinity X to the one E to the next Acts x.

407
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:04,219
Now the of distribution, which is different from this common function, is defined by this two parameter.

408
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:17,900
And clearly if you do this integration, it's not hard to find the integration from zero to infinity is equal to one because of this common function.

409
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:32,110
And. And in terms of the Syria in general, there is no closed port unless this first parameter aid is aimed as an integer.

410
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:34,710
And then this common common distribution,

411
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:44,890
I tend to have very close relation with exponential distribution and we just talked about the only has close form, clear function otherwise.

412
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:49,870
I do now have a close one similar with the normal distribution.

413
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:58,450
And even when a is an integer, a close form expression is not very easy to derive.

414
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:02,050
You can try it, but not it's not very obvious.

415
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:04,870
And all right.

416
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:18,370
So when we talk about the form, we talk about the relation with the with the before we talk about the relation with the exponential distribution,

417
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:23,080
let's first take a look out there. The me on the varies for this common distribution.

418
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:30,370
So the mean is equal to eight times the lambda variance equal to eight times a lot of the square.

419
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:38,950
Again, you have two ways to derive that either directly in the region or you can use the moment generating function.

420
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:48,220
So why don't you take a couple minutes either derived in either way and derive

421
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:53,710
directly using the integration or you go from the moment generating function.

422
01:08:26,630 --> 01:09:04,400
It's. I think.

423
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:03,830
All right. So let's take a look at this together.

424
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:10,670
So here I'm your deriving the moment generating function for this distribution.

425
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:15,230
You can write out the definition of moment generating function.

426
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:17,630
This integration is what do we have?

427
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:29,510
And by combining this e to the t y with the exponential term inside this PDA function, we immediately got another two terms that involve y.

428
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:36,260
One, again, is a exponential term with Y in the power.

429
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:40,190
And another one is the power term with the Y in the base.

430
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:46,700
And that's what I mean. You need to focus on this terms that involve y.

431
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:53,210
I look out as to terms. You should be reminded of the pd l function for a common distribution.

432
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:59,300
And by noticing the parameters or the constant involved in this two terms,

433
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:09,170
you can say that's the essential part of a comma distribution with parameter A and a new lambda, which is lambda over one minus T.

434
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:21,200
And all that's left to do is to figure out the content that you need in order to make it an exact PD function or that new gamma distribution.

435
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:31,910
With these two new parameters, what do we need in the denominator so that it becomes a complete PD function?

436
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:36,950
It's got eight times it's alarmed over y minus two lambda to the power of.

437
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:41,540
Okay. And what's left is this lambda over y minus two.

438
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:48,440
I'm not to the eight over lambda to the. And this is a concept that is irrelevant to y.

439
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,990
So you can take it outside of this integration.

440
01:11:51,320 --> 01:12:01,010
And even thought inside the integration is exactly how pd l PD how about some new gamma distribution with a new set of parameters?

441
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:13,550
So that's how we can simplify this. So the end in the end, we have this moment generated by being one over one minus t long, not to the power of it.

442
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:22,190
And then you can take the derivative evaluated, take on a zero and got this mean a balance and a mean being any time.

443
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:35,880
So lambda variance being eight Times Square right on turn to where you can derive directly derive this expectation.

444
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:42,380
And Vera's using the integration but the same trait applies there.

445
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:55,430
Right. So a couple of remarks or this comment attribution first.

446
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:58,910
If you said this prominent A to B one,

447
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:12,410
then exactly reduces to an exponential distribution which from the left must take a comma, a comma, a lambda is.

448
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:29,250
Says the PDF is this right?

449
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:31,349
So you set a goal to one.

450
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:41,640
Then this terms goes away, base becomes lambda this common one recall that a common one is one minus one factorial, which is what?

451
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:47,490
Right. So this goes away. So the PDA function, I'm going to be e to the negative y over lambda,

452
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:59,220
over r one over the times e to inactive y while with the support being zero to infinity, not exactly the periodic distribution.

453
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:03,810
Right. So that's the first remark.

454
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:18,390
And another one is that if you draw this figure for this PDA, for your comma distribution, naturally as very flexible shapes.

455
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:32,170
So depending on how you serve your area and lambda, they can take different shapes.

456
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:38,590
The PDR function can look like a decreasing function, for example, is or any to be one.

457
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:41,680
It's definitely going to be a decreasing function with respect to Y,

458
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:51,460
that's how the exponential period looks like or was known as a being greater than one.

459
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:57,550
You may have a mode showing up somewhere in the positive axis.

460
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:01,870
We have a peak somewhere for y greater than zero.

461
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:08,230
Okay. So you've got different, different shapes depending on how you decide you are an alumna.

462
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:18,620
In particular, this a sometimes is a record to refer to as a shape parameter because it really control the shape of this,

463
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,720
um, the various shapes of this function.

464
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:36,000
Another very important note is that the common distribution actually, especially for a constant foreign foreign editor,

465
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:41,750
a time be viewed as the sum of a independent financial distributions.

466
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:48,890
Right. So if it's let's say a is a positive.

467
01:15:53,800 --> 01:16:05,490
Integer. Then.

468
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:18,990
Gonna run a marvel always a and lambda and be viewed as the sum of.

469
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:35,270
Of I independent exponential runner barrels a VR equivalent in terms of the distribution.

470
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:40,630
And that actually we have seen that kind of relationship before.

471
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:55,670
But this great rhinovirus hysterical. What are the pairs in this great run of our goal is the sum of a bunch of independent variable has a

472
01:16:55,670 --> 01:17:04,070
same distribution as another random variable is the negative binomial and the geometric very good.

473
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:14,870
So the sum of independent geometric random variables has a negative binomial distribution right here is almost the same.

474
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:20,420
A sum of independent exponential random variables follows a common distribution.

475
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:29,670
And now I see many connections between this two pairs of distributions.

476
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:34,710
Recall that of both the exponential and the vaginal matter distribution.

477
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:42,210
Have this memory with this property. They both have the similar shapes in terms of their on PDA.

478
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:47,190
Right. And now they have this similar relations with another distribution.

479
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:52,500
So there are many connections between the two. All right.

480
01:17:53,190 --> 01:18:01,320
And another property, is that a special case of the comments that you're using is actually a Chi Square distribution that we just learned about.

481
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:14,100
In particular, if you said you are should parameter to be an over two and lambda to be equal to two four and be at an integer,

482
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:19,560
then that is actually a chi square distribution with ten degrees of freedom.

483
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:30,630
In other words, this comma one over two two.

484
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:37,640
Is it Chi Square, this distribution?

485
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:46,880
The Chi Square distribution was to grow out of one and a comma one two is a chi square distribution was to operate on two.

486
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:55,139
So on symbols. So that's. Another very interesting note, all the other words,

487
01:18:55,140 --> 01:19:01,860
Chi Square distribution is that a degree of freedom is just a special case in this common distribution family.

488
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:16,050
Questions. You can probably also see that from the shape of this PDA.

489
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:20,870
Right. As I mentioned, the shapes can be very flexible, although they aren't infinite a wrench.

490
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:28,020
Obama also has the support from zero to infinity, and it has a particular one peak ship.

491
01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:34,410
So you can imagine that there is a special case of this more flexible family.

492
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:42,330
Okay. All right. Next one, the wave of distribution.

493
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:58,290
We've all distribution is a you can view it as a slide variant of the exponential distribution as well with two parameters or three parameters.

494
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:10,110
Um, it is useful in survival analysis and let's start from the CTA and then goes to the PDF because the CTA,

495
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:16,650
you can see it is more closely related to the exponential distribution.

496
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:25,530
So for the city of is defined this way. The city has functioned for a wave all around.

497
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:30,170
Malmo is one minus. This financial term inside exponential.

498
01:20:30,170 --> 01:20:42,860
That's a power term like y minus V over alpha to the power of theta, and the range is from V to infinity.

499
01:20:43,850 --> 01:20:48,680
So there are three parameters. This V is alpha and beta.

500
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:55,280
And so this V controls essentially that shift of this distribution.

501
01:20:55,820 --> 01:21:06,290
The alpha concept of the alpha defines the scaling of this distribution, and beta is an additional power parameter.

502
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:12,920
In particular, if you've got rid of this V and beta, I said in beta be zero beta to be one.

503
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:22,880
That exactly reduces to exponential. So it's just to add more flexibility to the exponential pseudo.

504
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:32,040
So the special case is one special case. You can set a V to be zero, so there is no shift.

505
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:34,710
Then the support is going to drop zero to infinity.

506
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:48,150
And then in that case, you can you can view it as just the ratio of the exponential distribution by using this term event.

507
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:59,070
And from this idea, we can also divide the PDF by taking the derivative and areas that the PTA is more tedious.

508
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:09,570
But one more note about this Weibo distribution, that is.

509
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:19,400
This is. If B is equal to zero.

510
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:26,570
An ax follows. Exponential distribution.

511
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:30,540
This parameter alpha to the power of theta.

512
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:56,120
Then we can show that if you said y to be asked to the power of one over baton, it follows a wave of distributions with two parameters alpha and beta.

513
01:22:58,090 --> 01:23:06,080
Okay. So that's another priority so that we will distribution and why that's okay.

514
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:14,140
So maybe I'll leave that proof to you and think about how to prove this v is equal to zero.

515
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:17,360
X has this exponential distribution with parameter output.

516
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:27,540
The beta this transformation of x acts to the power of one over beta actually follows this way by distribution to compensate us.

517
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:32,020
That's another relation between the exponential and the wave on distribution.

518
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:44,580
All right. That's one coach distribution. We sort of have alluded to this situation where we introduced the expectation,

519
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:52,740
the one major use of this culture distribution is to construct counterexamples.

520
01:23:53,250 --> 01:24:03,180
So it looks a pretty regular distribution, but in fact, it caused a lot of trouble in statistics because of its heavy tail.

521
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:12,540
Okay. So previously we have said that this distribution does not have a mean, does not have an expectation,

522
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:18,630
so it can also be used to construct other examples compared to the normal.

523
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:26,760
The CDF takes this Formula one over pi times one over one plus y minus theta squared.

524
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:32,400
So the theta it just the the center of this distribution.

525
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:39,420
Whereas this is symmetric around theta and.

526
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:47,530
If there is zero, the shape of this play out look like this again.

527
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:57,770
It looks like a battleship. But compared to the standard novel, it has a much heavier tail, much more heavier than the T distribution.

528
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:04,490
We know that T distribution already have a heavier tail than the normal distribution.

529
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:10,790
So there's closer distribution of even even heavier tails than a T distributions.

530
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:19,820
The T distribution you can still calculate the mean by the Kochi says it's a tail so heavy that you cannot even calculate the mean.

531
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:26,870
All right. So everything that happens here on the tail, so that's for the culture distribution.

532
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:38,680
So the formula, if you compare it with the T, it corresponds to the T with one degree of freedom, right?

533
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:45,410
So essentially, T one and one of the property does not have a mean.

534
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:56,150
So we have already shown that before. Questions.

535
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:03,450
The next one is an important one. It's payroll distribution.

536
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:13,070
So far, most of the distribution that we have seen so far, either the support is from Infiniti or Infiniti or from zero to infinity.

537
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:18,870
It's all a component of this one. It's better distribution as a family support.

538
01:26:19,650 --> 01:26:26,370
So so far, we probably have only learned to continuous distribution with family support.

539
01:26:26,370 --> 01:26:31,500
What is that uniform? Is the very simple distribution.

540
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:38,430
Now, the other one is the speed of distribution. So that's why it's one of the important ones.

541
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:46,260
Okay. So the support is on zero one or I can extend it by adding additional parameters.

542
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:49,890
But for now, let's look at the static case, which is from 0 to 1.

543
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:55,680
The pdf file. This support is defined this way.

544
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:01,830
One over this greater function with two parameter and b times.

545
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:06,450
Y to the power of a minus one one minus Y to the power of B minus one.

546
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,040
Both A and B are positive accounts.

547
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:25,920
And this baby is a later function defined in this way as an integration from 0 to 1 X, minus one Y minus X to the power of B minus one.

548
01:27:26,490 --> 01:27:32,190
You can see it's very similar to that to the term that involve Y in this PDF function.

549
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:41,730
All right. And that also corresponds to what I just what I said before accounts that it just being there making this integration equal to one.

550
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:48,960
That's how the you know all the what the constant does in the PDA function.

551
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:59,880
So you cannot exactly evaluate you cannot explicitly evaluate a beta function and it does not have a pulse formed.

552
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:04,280
So that's why we define it as a beta function or different AB values.

553
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:09,090
You can plug it in, refer to a table to get the actual beta function value.

554
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:12,810
There is no close form expression of this beta function.

555
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:20,460
And the only exception is that APIs are both integers.

556
01:28:26,430 --> 01:28:31,560
So the beta function and the gamma function also has a relation that is beta.

557
01:28:32,010 --> 01:28:40,530
And B is equal to from A to B over A plus B and here is the gamma function.

558
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:45,239
And for integers, gamma function has a close form.

559
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:58,490
So beta function also. Some useful moments for the beta function.

560
01:28:59,150 --> 01:29:07,490
The mean is equal to a over a Cosby virus, equal to a B over eight plus B square a plus be possible.

561
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:26,300
Hey, I can take a few moments to try to derive this city, whether you want it now for the period here.

562
01:30:06,170 --> 01:30:12,710
Think about whether you should function or should you some other race.

563
01:30:52,390 --> 01:32:34,310
It's. She?

564
01:33:01,850 --> 01:33:07,010
Okay. So serious moment January in function. Where did you evaluate the moments directly?

565
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:13,070
Right. Right. Very good.

566
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:17,380
And why is that? Yes.

567
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:23,120
And we use the same trick with the kernel that we should be doing, you know, so that we.

568
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:32,540
Very good. So it all boils down to this ideal function.

569
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:38,750
The functional form of this PDA functions, right? Previously, for the past few examples,

570
01:33:39,230 --> 01:33:48,170
I use the moment generating function because we always have an exponential term which is a line in the power of those PDFs.

571
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:58,760
Right? So when you derive this moment at any function, you can combine your E to the t y with that exponential term in this power,

572
01:33:59,330 --> 01:34:02,600
in this PDA function to simplify the integration.

573
01:34:03,050 --> 01:34:11,720
But that's not the case for this particular example. We do now see expansion is that we do say power terms, right?

574
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:20,450
So the power times should remind us of directly evaluating the answer at our moment because the inside our moment,

575
01:34:20,450 --> 01:34:23,150
by definition, that's the integration.

576
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:30,920
That function is why it's the power overhead which can be defined with one of these power terms in this PDA function.

577
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:38,160
So in this case, if think go with the moment on an probably you're going to have a hard time finding a solution,

578
01:34:38,490 --> 01:34:44,750
but it would be much easier if you go directly deriving this as moment.

579
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:58,770
And so let's say you want to evaluate the ends order moment or this random variable that's going to be integration from 0 to 1 Y to the end.

580
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:10,160
Went over the speed up until they got a minus one B minus 1ey.

581
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:21,680
And this is the concern that you can take outside of this integration and this Y to the Y to the end and Y to the A minus one can be combined.

582
01:35:30,510 --> 01:35:37,230
Now you have a plus and minus one and E minus one.

583
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:44,550
So now from here, there are two ways to proceed.

584
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:50,430
One is that noticing that this is directly the form of this theta function.

585
01:35:50,970 --> 01:35:55,770
Right. That's how beta function is defined as as A and B are positive.

586
01:35:56,190 --> 01:36:02,130
You can always directly apply this theta function. So we know is positive.

587
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:16,500
So a plus and it's also positive. So we can directly use the beta function that give us a plus and B over a B, right.

588
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:19,019
So that's one way to do it. Alternatively,

589
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:30,990
you can also notice this is a central part in this in the PDF of a beta distribution that actually is the central part of the beta distribution.

590
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:41,820
This parameter and plus M and B that I need to do is to figure out what is the constant needed for that PDA function.

591
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:46,920
And there's also this a B, this beta A plus, and B.

592
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:55,250
And you can further simplify this because this is a concept.

593
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:59,120
All right. And this is an integer. It's a positive data.

594
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:09,169
We know that for positive NBA players, the karma function actually has that nice connection with another common function.

595
01:37:09,170 --> 01:37:28,880
So we can further simplify this to be a plus change, be over A plus B plus A, right over a, B, over eight plus.

596
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:33,500
And we know this common eight plus and is equal to.

597
01:37:54,540 --> 01:38:00,870
You know, karma a plus and is equal to a comma, a plus minus one times E plus and minus one.

598
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:08,670
And you can use this iteratively to cancel out or to to on the explicit form of the first term.

599
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:12,960
Similarly, on the second term. You can also evaluate it explicitly.

600
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:17,909
In this case, for an equal to one.

601
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:30,120
You got the mean which gave you. There's a over a USB and for an equal to two.

602
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:49,850
Got this eight times a file over these must be times mean USB plus one all right and if anything called a three you can similarly around.

603
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:56,310
And with this two moments, you can derive the variance as well.

604
01:38:57,070 --> 01:39:02,900
Right. Any questions of this moment?

605
01:39:03,230 --> 01:39:07,640
Calculation. All right.

606
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:14,180
The beta distribution is a very flexible distribution on this bounded interval from 0 to 1.

607
01:39:14,780 --> 01:39:19,970
It include this uniform distribution that we have learned before as a special case.

608
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:28,700
In particular, we can say that it we said A to B, O's and B to B one.

609
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:34,489
Then this is going to be a constant. And that's actually a constant.

610
01:39:34,490 --> 01:39:37,790
Equal to what both A and B are equal to one.

611
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:42,770
This of distribution reduces to a uniform distribution.

612
01:39:55,180 --> 01:40:04,360
And A and B are not equal to one. Then you can draw this PDF function on this interval depending on what the value of Amby is.

613
01:40:04,690 --> 01:40:12,490
They can take a you know, of you, a ship or another ship.

614
01:40:12,550 --> 01:40:19,720
And they could also have. Also be non symmetric.

615
01:40:19,930 --> 01:40:27,890
So it could be very flexible on this interval and take in various shifts in this 0 to 1.

616
01:40:31,670 --> 01:40:35,550
And depending on how it is that business.

617
01:40:38,650 --> 01:40:45,320
All right. Any questions before we move on? All right.

618
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:57,390
Two more and we're done. So the next phase of the normal distribution of normal is, as the name suggests, is related to the normal distribution.

619
01:40:59,070 --> 01:41:05,160
If a lot of access follows a normal distribution, then acts follows that along a normal distribution.

620
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:14,790
So if the log acts is normal, then what is the support of acts?

621
01:41:23,170 --> 01:41:26,410
No, no. It's from Naftali Bennett, who is sitting right.

622
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:37,970
What is a part of us? You get it because you can only take the law on a positive note.

623
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:43,550
Right. And you take the log on a positive number from zero to infinity.

624
01:41:43,850 --> 01:41:47,030
You got this around negative infinity, 20 variables.

625
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:55,759
So by just thinking about the support for normal, you should be able to derive the support for this log and I'll all run a variable.

626
01:41:55,760 --> 01:42:02,240
So it's from zero to infinity. And the pdf is given.

627
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:10,490
In this way, you should be able to derive this PDF directly from this definition.

628
01:42:10,910 --> 01:42:17,120
All right. Because it's said so, it's a 1 to 1 transformation from the normal distribution.

629
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:25,370
From the normal distribution. If log access novel actually logs the other words, if that is normal, then.

630
01:42:30,670 --> 01:42:36,460
Why is normal business e to the y?

631
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:44,590
There's a lot of problems. Nice.

632
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:48,000
That's a same expression. That's an equivalent expression.

633
01:42:49,110 --> 01:42:53,080
Last fall, this novel asked a lot of novel. Why the novel?

634
01:42:53,100 --> 01:43:03,780
E to the white novel. So that the PDF or ads is essentially the pdf or E to the power of the Y transformation

635
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:12,300
of the Y you should be able to derive is by just based on how the log novel is defined.

636
01:43:14,970 --> 01:43:24,680
And for the log novel, there are some useful moments. Again, we won't to it in class, but please do this exercise after class.

637
01:43:25,590 --> 01:43:32,520
You don't have to seem to be e to the power of middle class sigma square over to the parents to take the moment,

638
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:37,250
pause and think about the shortcut to God.

639
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:42,090
This is you can take advantage of the moment, generate a function for the normal distribution.

640
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:50,800
Alternatively, you can do right by derive it, but the shortcut is think about the moment,

641
01:43:50,830 --> 01:44:03,600
the January function or normal distribution and think about how you can take advantage of that to derive this meaning about directly.

642
01:44:07,810 --> 01:44:12,160
So the shape of this log normal distribution is very similar to the common distribution.

643
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:19,930
It all start out zero as a peak and then decrease to zero with that very long tail.

644
01:44:19,990 --> 01:44:29,440
So it's skewed to the right and it's often used to model random variables where you have to have

645
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:35,170
some prior knowledge for something that if you take the lock for something that's positive.

646
01:44:35,530 --> 01:44:41,470
If you take the log, if you believe the log of that particular quantity is normally distributed,

647
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:49,600
then you can model the original random variable, original positive number by this along normal distribution.

648
01:44:50,410 --> 01:44:55,060
For example, the income income is that is positive.

649
01:44:55,780 --> 01:45:02,830
And if you believe that, if you take the log of the income, it roughly follows a normal distribution.

650
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:08,680
Then you can directly model the original income with this log in all the distribution.

651
01:45:09,610 --> 01:45:16,360
So that's how it's used. But to be honest, I mean, since it's so close and I related to the normal,

652
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:27,850
I rarely see people use a log and all directly you can just, you know, still model log income as normal and go from there.

653
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:32,800
It's the same thing as normal is so well and it's so well-studied.

654
01:45:33,730 --> 01:45:38,830
So now you don't even need to bother thinking about the properties of this log.

655
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:50,490
All right. So last one. Double Spanish distribution, also known as the La Paz distribution.

656
01:45:58,930 --> 01:46:01,950
So the formula is is very simple.

657
01:46:01,970 --> 01:46:08,050
It's just to exponential back to back. And the PDF has this form.

658
01:46:08,530 --> 01:46:18,820
If you just take half of it. So in particular, you have this meal, this segment is C, these are three parameters.

659
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:27,790
In fact, these are only two properties. C is a function of MU and sigma.

660
01:46:28,230 --> 01:46:32,650
Now the words once this muons sigma are fixed, C is fixed.

661
01:46:33,670 --> 01:46:39,450
All right. So essentially only two parameters. And for simplicity, you can think about a meal as zero.

662
01:46:39,460 --> 01:46:42,490
Then it's just going to be centered out of the zero.

663
01:46:42,850 --> 01:46:55,570
AMU is just a shift, the horizontal shift. If you take a look at this form and only restrict on one side of this distribution that is greater than me,

664
01:46:56,440 --> 01:47:05,380
then you can see that the actual form, the functional form of this PDF is essentially very similar to this, and that's our distribution.

665
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:10,950
The only difference is this constant, and that's where the name Double is special.

666
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:27,250
Uh, this is orange. Okay, so if we assume mu is zero, then why it looks like this and it's symmetric for each side is exponential,

667
01:47:28,510 --> 01:47:34,720
but its potential multiply one half so that the the area under this entire curve is equal to one.

668
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:50,770
All right. And this last distribution or exponential distribution is actually invented earlier than a normal distribution.

669
01:47:51,070 --> 01:47:59,500
It was first invented trying to model this. Some of the derived they were some of the relations from this.

670
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:12,520
Some of this. Our terms. In other words, this double exponential was first developed to model what is later on model by the normal distribution of.

671
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:20,980
Some people find that this is not a good fit. So the actual avatars rise to these somewhat small derivations.

672
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:32,170
That's why Coulson actually does eventually develop this Coulson distribution to better model what this some of the smaller revisions are.

673
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:39,550
So this is the US is the teacher, of course.

674
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:48,850
Right? Anyone know the history of that? So this stuff only comes earlier than the normal distribution.

675
01:48:53,320 --> 01:49:03,820
So useful moments mean this meu variance is two sigma squares again very center derivation that you can do after clause and this is not [INAUDIBLE].

676
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:09,110
The difference now is not in the tail, but rather in the hat.

677
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:13,960
Right? So it's very pointy compared to the normal distribution.

678
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:22,210
And also the key is that as a point of view, which is A and B, using a central function.

679
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:30,520
So it's the mode is an ad actually for use.

680
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:36,130
All right. So that's all I want to cover for the continuous distribution.

681
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:43,120
So next time, we're going to move on to the next chapter, which is the multivariate analysis.

682
01:49:44,070 --> 01:49:48,610
Again, this is a good time to review the multivariate calculus.

683
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:54,820
And if you haven't taken that, I haven't done a multivariate supplement.

684
01:49:54,910 --> 01:49:57,400
So while this is definitely the time to do it, a quick.
