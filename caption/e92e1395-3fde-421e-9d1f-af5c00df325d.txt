1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,120
Ted. Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,420
I hope you had a restful or fun Thanksgiving holiday.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,590
We were just talking about how it's kind of like we're barreling toward to the end of the semester here.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,900
Just a few administrative announcements.

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,610
First, is that your your next version of your outline is due this Sunday.

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:37,040
So that is your fully written introduction section and a more detailed outline than you turned in previously.

7
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,700
This is just to keep you moving along in the process.

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:47,160
At this point, I think I've okayed basically everybody's topic and seen that you're on the right track.

9
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:55,220
But again, feel free to email me if you want to talk more. The second thing is that course evaluations are now open.

10
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:01,980
I know a couple of you have turn it in. If you just, you know, save the screenshot that says you fill this out for 592.

11
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:11,610
There's an assignment where you can upload the screenshot and you'll get a bonus ten points towards your participation to help round it out.

12
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,549
I think that's all I have for the admin. Chloe Oh, for the introduction.

13
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,880
When you get feedback on it like are we able to change it. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

14
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:31,470
So, you know, everything that I give you feedback on, like nothing is set in stone until you turn in the final one.

15
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,930
So even if I give you feedback on the introduction and then you have like an epiphany like

16
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,159
three days later that you hate this topic and you want to write something totally different.

17
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,860
You can just note that I feel like I didn't see it, but you know, to each their own.

18
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,710
So yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Did you all enjoy doctor gives lecture.

19
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:02,910
Yeah, he I so he's been my mentor since 2014 and I had the pleasure of being in the last

20
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:08,190
class that he taught before he decided to move into like higher administration.

21
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:16,049
I've taught many trainings with him and usually when we are doing trainings together,

22
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:23,280
I have to be in the back and I have to go like this because he always keeps talking and goes overtime,

23
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:31,829
but I think he always has fun stories and for how knowledgeable and experience he is.

24
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,660
I feel like he's pretty down to earth.

25
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:44,099
So I would say as a side note, I've had the benefit of having really good mentors and he was like one of the main ones.

26
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:51,510
And I feel like you kind of learn your mentoring style from mentors that you've had in life.

27
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,270
So definitely like he's always taught me, like give credit where credit is due.

28
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,510
So even when I didn't have a masters degree yet, they let me like first author papers and, you know,

29
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:10,950
do all these kind of things and take a chance on take a chance on me and learning some things and expect that, you know, I would rise to the occasion.

30
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,300
But he has tons of other cool stories. PAGE Yes, what kind of topics he can work on.

31
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,780
So I was a research assistant for the Nebraska biocontainment unit.

32
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,200
So we would do like program our programmatic activities together.

33
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,530
And through him I learned what industrial hygiene was.

34
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,540
I didn't know what it was until after the first year of my master's degree.

35
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:40,739
And then for four years I managed the biosafety and Infectious Disease Training Initiative.

36
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,920
So we would either go around the country together, I'd go around myself doing those worker trainings for folks,

37
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,650
or I'd watch him do trainings and then learn kind of like by proxy.

38
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:01,709
And then we still do all our contract work together for a national disaster medical system and these like joint exercises.

39
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:07,500
So it's been nice. Yeah, to continue that relationship in a professional sense.

40
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:16,020
And you know, he still mentors me in my career now even though we're not at the same place, which is very nice.

41
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,550
So if you have a mentor like that and reading all of your of.

42
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,290
Career interviews.

43
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:31,209
Actually I see some of you interviewed some people used to work for which is nice and actually dovetails into what we're going to do next.

44
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,080
Before we get started with the lecture is that I'd like to give you all an

45
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:41,200
opportunity to kind of like chat amongst yourselves about who you interviewed.

46
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,650
So it's kind of like I think pair share, but just turn to whoever is nearest to you.

47
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:57,040
So to share with the other person like number one, who did you interview and like what modality like zoom, phone,

48
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,369
email and then what was the most interesting part of the interview were like,

49
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,740
what you feel like the biggest thing you got out of it was, so let's go and turn around and do that.

50
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:18,460
Okay? 35 Really?

51
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:24,460
Yeah. I was like, you was here. Yeah.

52
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:33,219
And I was like, I want to do that. And I was like, I want to do it.

53
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,510
Dave I got it right now.

54
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,600
I. But I was like. Yeah.

55
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:49,400
How do you want your life? There think a lot of.

56
00:05:53,130 --> 00:06:00,710
I think I like a deficit as bad as it is.

57
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:17,820
It's a very small business owners and players and.

58
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,880
Yeah. No, it was something like this, but I feel like I can really do it.

59
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:41,750
Really? Yeah. Yeah, I know, I know.

60
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,500
But that's not the case in the country.

61
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:56,270
But I don't know.

62
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,490
I mean. Yeah.

63
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,700
Yeah. I like. I think.

64
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:27,770
I think that I'm frozen, like, you know, when you're like, you know, you don't have a lot to do with that for a little bit.

65
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:55,280
And then we go through and other than that way, as a lot of those guys like, they were trying to make a sport, is there is it you know, you have to.

66
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:10,080
Yeah, I'm just trying to. But I started to get excited about it.

67
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:16,110
But I also noticed that there were there were there was like.

68
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:26,360
Canada and Hungary saying that it was actually considered collective equity.

69
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,000
Interesting, because I was. But actually,

70
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:44,120
it's really hard for us to believe that he was being talked a bit about how to

71
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,520
manage the balance between being the county executive and filming everything.

72
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,260
Yeah. And I know he had never said that was okay.

73
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,420
I kind of hear conversation dying down.

74
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,219
So not asking you to share for yourself.

75
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:18,780
But if you talk to someone and thought they had an interesting point, would anyone like to share what their partners said?

76
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:33,409
Adam is talking about how she interviewed the director of emergency preparedness at Wayne County and how even though Detroit is a big county,

77
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,569
it has its own health department.

78
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:43,190
So when talking about like the differences between how the Wayne County Health Department is separate and how do they work together,

79
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,340
and then going to the state level, which just sounds like a bureaucratic nightmare.

80
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,390
So I thought that was really.

81
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:55,390
Interesting because like, how do you it's like more pieces of the puzzle that like, you have to like I get why they should be separate.

82
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:03,370
Yeah. At the same time, it's like. Oh. How do you make it work so that everyone is getting health care?

83
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:10,989
For sure. Anyone else in that kind of building up with that as well?

84
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,440
It's interesting because we've talked about before went before we interviewed.

85
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:22,959
And I felt like the answer that my person gave me was kind of like she avoided the question, didn't really answer it because it was just an email.

86
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:31,930
I didn't really get the chance. Oh, I see. Yeah. MPH had a similar thing where they didn't really answer the question about was it emailed to page?

87
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,230
No. Mine was over the phone. Okay. Yeah.

88
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,670
She asked me to like rephrase the question and I did. And she was like, yeah, it's fine.

89
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:46,930
Just a like, you know, actually reading out of like the 13 interviews that I read,

90
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:58,390
I think only three or four said they thought there were equity issues, which is not surprising to me, actually.

91
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,640
I think because we're here in school, public health and especially in Michigan, not all schools are public health.

92
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,250
In the country are like this. We're very much focused on like that equity issue.

93
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:16,680
So it's always front of mind for us. But it's interesting to see that some you know, some of you interviewed physicians,

94
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:23,709
some of you interviewed infectious disease people, some of you interviewed emergency response people.

95
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:30,070
And some people do consider them public health and some people don't consider them public health like public health adjacent.

96
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:36,999
And a lot of your folks come into this from like a very circuitous or different ways.

97
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,720
So they don't necessarily have a formal education like a MPH or even like a bachelor's in public health.

98
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:50,109
So you they prob never thought about it until you posed the question.

99
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:58,810
Right. So I think for the common theme that I noticed a lot of the responses, especially for emergency response,

100
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:06,370
we just respond to who has the need and because we respond to who has the need,

101
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:12,370
therefore it is equal was kind of the the impression that I got reading across the interviews,

102
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:20,290
but perhaps some of you stimulated some conversation because as I was like going through your assignment,

103
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,159
I tried to like highlight like where the answer was.

104
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,660
And I think had I maybe your person was the only one that said racism, right?

105
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,100
That's what you left do. Yes, yes, yes, yes. So interesting.

106
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:38,020
But hopefully you find that a useful exercise, right?

107
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:44,020
Because like I said, like it's you can hear my stories or you can hear like Dr. Hurst age stories or whatever.

108
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,999
But like I mostly know academics or people who work in like high level government.

109
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:58,090
So I think it's an interesting take to hear folks who are definitely like boots on the ground and what they think are the issues.

110
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:07,240
Okay. So picking up where we left off last week, so Dr. Gibbs was talking about some gaps in responses.

111
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:16,690
We're going to talk about a few more case studies and then talk more about past and present and then national capabilities.

112
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:25,839
So here's just a timeline of some notable infectious disease outbreaks in the U.S. We're going to you know,

113
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:33,220
we've talked more or less about the ones in Orange, and we're going to finish talking about some of these today.

114
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:40,780
But, you know, how things work here in the United States is very much the disease,

115
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:45,280
disease, or if you think about the soup du jour, soup of the day, disease of the day.

116
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:53,680
Right. So we always have significant investment in short term projects only to address the disease at hand.

117
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:59,200
But we're not necessarily thinking about longevity and sustainability,

118
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:07,690
and we still often treat infectious disease in emergency response as if it can only receive a tertiary response rather than primary,

119
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:13,060
and especially during periods of peace. Right funding is cut.

120
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:24,310
So if you look here from 1962 to 2020, funding for that for the CDC has remained relatively stable.

121
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:31,750
And while that stable seems like a positive word, inflation, the cost of everything,

122
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:37,810
increasing population right size and the rise of chronic diseases.

123
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,349
And that if you look at the National Institute of Health,

124
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:46,990
so this is the chunk that it takes from the congressional budget every year when they allocate the funds.

125
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:53,980
Look at National Institutes of Health from the 1960s until 2020.

126
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,190
So funding has been cut significantly in terms of research.

127
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,760
So that makes it extremely challenging.

128
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,989
To obtain funding in order to conduct like cutting edge science.

129
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:17,879
And NIH is very much the same to where they fund whatever is like popular or sexy at the time.

130
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,130
Like Dr. Neitzel and I, we both do occupational health and sometimes we joke with each other.

131
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,750
We like should it. I'm cancer because there's a lot of money in cancer.

132
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:34,049
Right. So it's it's kind of it's a challenge both on the population side, the receiving end,

133
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,880
but us as researchers because I have colleagues who are like 70 and you know

134
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,620
they when they were getting ARO ones as an assistant professor like slam dunk.

135
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,929
Right. But now as research progresses, the gaps are closing.

136
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:56,850
So you have to get very, very, very narrow on what's like innovative, what's new, and then it's even harder to get it funded.

137
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:03,990
Yes. Page. Um, so has it gone up since 2020 and everything that happened, or are they still kind of working with what they have?

138
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:11,850
So HHS, the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC, they definitely boosted their budgets during COVID.

139
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:19,880
And then when President Biden came into office, he like regards OSHA,

140
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:27,810
CDC in their budgets from when the Trump administration had cut it, but it's still kind of at the same percentage levels.

141
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,190
Yeah. And defunding public health in particular,

142
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:42,899
if we look at the dollars per capita and the percentage of each year which I it is escaping my mind what that stands for.

143
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:51,240
So that's not really helpful to you. But so this is of showing the increasing public health problems but less investment in public health.

144
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:58,469
And in the last decade, local health departments have been hemorrhaging personnel left and right,

145
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:03,900
not because they don't need them right, but because there is no budget to hire everybody.

146
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:09,000
So I think one of you interviewed Washtenaw County epidemiologist.

147
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,160
Was that you, Swati? I was really surprised the county had their own, honestly.

148
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:19,050
Yeah, yeah. Because most of the time you just have epidemiologists at the state level.

149
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:27,570
Washtenaw is a decently sized county, but I mean, I might expect one for Wayne, for example, or Oakland, but I was surprised Washtenaw has its own.

150
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:37,680
Yeah, so I have a short video to show you on rethinking public health funding when a pandemic is our biggest threat.

151
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,870
And then this video was just two years ago during the pandemic.

152
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:49,920
At the start of the pandemic, about 24 bucks.

153
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,020
It's the cost of a modest takeout order.

154
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,870
It's also what states receive per person and grant money from the Center for Disease Control Programs last year.

155
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:04,290
That's according to Trust for America's Health. But if you were in Canada, you'd get more than enough, right?

156
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:12,060
It spends about $7,000 per person be a public health funding, and that's like 300 chicken patties.

157
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:20,970
While the disease overall budget increased in fiscal year 2019 and 2020, its core budget has been essentially flat for the last decade.

158
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:32,180
On Capitol Hill. That's led to exchanges like this. The CDC budget is $11 billion, 1.5% of our defense budget now.

159
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:38,490
Correct. Do you think our country would have been safer if let's say we had twice the CDC budget for,

160
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,590
you know, decades, we've underinvested in the public health infrastructure of this nation.

161
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,870
This year, the greatest threat to American safety has been the public health crisis known as COVID 19,

162
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,220
killing more Americans in every war since the Korean War combined.

163
00:18:54,060 --> 00:19:02,760
So we wanted to know how many lives could be saved and what were the impacts be if our nation's budget treated public health like national security?

164
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,280
The defense budget is $738 billion.

165
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:21,140
This past year, the Trump administration budgeted for 79 F-35s and the cost of one is $144 million.

166
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,400
The Cato Institute says that's the same as 2800 ventilators.

167
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,490
The White House also asked for three and a half billion dollars for two Arleigh Burke destroyers for the Navy.

168
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:35,660
One destroyer equals nearly 15,000 hospital beds.

169
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:42,650
The budget also made room for modernizing 89 M-1 Abrams tanks for $1.5 billion.

170
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:50,030
For the record, the Army didn't even want this. The cost of one tank could buy 70 million N95 masks.

171
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:56,720
So what would this public health as national defense mentality do for virus fighting firepower?

172
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,850
We ask Dr. Anthony Fauci. Hello. Hello, Dr. Fauci.

173
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:09,620
How are you today? I'm well, thank you. How are you? Is there room in this country to develop a more robust biological defense system?

174
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:21,200
Why or why not? Yeah. I mean, we have a program that we started some time ago and was fortified by the threat of a pandemic flu.

175
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,760
When we had the bird flu, that jumped species, killed people.

176
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:31,610
Luckily for us, it never developed an efficient capability of going from person to person.

177
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:37,880
But it was a threat and it triggered what's called pandemic preparedness program,

178
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:43,730
which is just what you're referring to, just as you would put money into the Department of Defense.

179
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:52,490
We put money into developing the infrastructure, the stockpiles, the preparedness, the platforms, the vaccine.

180
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:59,180
We are at war right now, and we need to be able to make these really significant year in and year out investments.

181
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:04,640
It's DA Lieberman's job to lead a public health advocacy strategy with Congress and the White House.

182
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:14,330
A tough task in 2020. How do you respond when someone proposes what if we prioritized public health funding like national security?

183
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,809
Well, we truly believe that health security is our national security.

184
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:25,820
And we are seeing that this pandemic has significant an impact on our economy and on our lives,

185
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:30,470
on the mental health and the physical well-being as any war, any terrorist attack.

186
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:35,120
And while public health isn't expecting a Pentagon sized budget anytime soon,

187
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:41,570
Lieberman wants to see less reactive spending and a more proactive approach to bolstering the infrastructure.

188
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:49,370
Now, with looming very large boom in public health while the optimism of a vaccine.

189
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,110
So we are spending billions and billions of dollars on developing federal permitting for COVID 19 vaccines,

190
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,120
but we have not spend any money on the actual distribution.

191
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:10,580
The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials estimate vaccine distribution to cost $8.4 billion.

192
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,670
The organization says that money is urgently needed to strengthen federal, state and local health departments.

193
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,440
We're holding our health department together with dots and duct tape, and it's so inadequate.

194
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,830
You wouldn't expect this from a local hospital.

195
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:31,520
So why is it acceptable for a local health department to function this way?

196
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,360
Jeannette Wallack has seen what could go wrong when a pandemic hits as the former

197
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,620
commissioner of health for the city of Milwaukee at the outbreak of COVID 19.

198
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,360
We knew that we were understaffed. We knew that our systems were antiquated.

199
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,030
I mean, we didn't even have an electronic health record.

200
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:56,270
The other thing is looking at other types of support services and health department, such as the communications department.

201
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:02,269
We literally had one person if you invest in public health the way that you should invest in it,

202
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,250
then you're not going to spend as much money down the road.

203
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:11,870
And then there's the option where opportunities have a better quality of life because you address things before they get out of hand.

204
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:16,190
A notion the nation's top infectious disease doctor agrees with.

205
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,460
When this is over and it will be over,

206
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:30,259
we won't forget the threat that we faced and continue to put significant resources into preparedness for the next outbreak,

207
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:40,490
which inevitably will occur. So I think you made an appropriate analogy just as you would want to build up a defense against physical threats.

208
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:51,010
We have to have a defense against biological threats. Okay.

209
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,020
Any thoughts or comments to that video, Abby?

210
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:03,990
Fun fact. Darren Lieberman is actually a grad was a grad student at U of M and before.

211
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,680
Cool. Oh, very cool.

212
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,830
I was in real life. I talked to an adviser who gets lecture for a class.

213
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:19,890
I was like, Hey, I'm doing the thing. And I was like, Yeah.

214
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:25,200
So it was actually just very cool. Very different than the school.

215
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:33,690
As in when exists, like connecting you to a loan.

216
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:41,000
They even have like a sign up thing where you can sign up and oh, like every week there's like, here's a conversation with someone doing that.

217
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:46,560
Interesting. Did. So she's now at Trust for America's Health, right?

218
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,980
So did she. And was it a very direct path for her, do you know?

219
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,809
Um, yeah, it was. You know, I was like, right out of the porn school starting.

220
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:58,470
I was like a health, um, or government relations analyst.

221
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,300
And now she's like the director of government relations at the Trust for America Health.

222
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:13,649
Yes. I was surprised by I mean, I guess I'm not surprised by how much they invest in military funding.

223
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:22,650
But wow, are some of those things very expensive? And essentially, like most of our military, are 18 to 22 year olds.

224
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:31,140
So it's like interesting where they continue to prioritize funding.

225
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:40,710
Yeah. Any other thoughts or comments on that video? I thought it's funny that they said the military even more.

226
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,960
The things. Everybody. Yeah. It wasn't even a need for them.

227
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:53,399
Yeah. Yeah. A lot of times people are very confused about I would say I don't know who these

228
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,440
directives are coming from because I'm not part of the Department of Defense.

229
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:06,059
Right. But some of these things just to me were like, so before this, I was living in Bloomington, Indiana,

230
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:11,910
and I don't know if y'all paid attention to it, but we had a local farmer's market, kind of like the one you have here in Kerry Town.

231
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:20,550
And we made the New York Times because one of the farm stands was actually like white supremacists,

232
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:27,150
where they were known to be affiliated with neo-Nazis and, you know, swastika stuff.

233
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:32,400
And so they they kind of got ousted as, like, white supremacists.

234
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,760
And Bloomington is another very progressive town like this.

235
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,139
So then there started to be like boycotts and protests of this stand.

236
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,790
And people were like, you can't renew this vendor, blah, blah, blah, blah.

237
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:51,630
And then, you know, like people were getting arrested for like peacefully protesting at the farmer's market on Saturday.

238
00:26:52,530 --> 00:27:09,210
But what the police department decided to do was to get one of those really big armored vehicles, I think it's called like a Bayer cat or a.

239
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:18,500
Me and bear pit. No, that's for myself. But, you know, one of those really big armored police vehicles for like.

240
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,990
Like it's it's smaller. Like that city is smaller than Ann Arbor.

241
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,530
So could you imagine, like,

242
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:32,419
needing that level of police force and that people were upset about it because that was paid through tax dollars and it cost a pretty penny.

243
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,159
And they were like, what are we doing?

244
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:43,160
Like, we have a significant population here of like unhoused people like this could be devoted to like building up infrastructure,

245
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:51,530
like giving them like a tiny home community. So it's very interesting to see how these things even pan out on the the local level.

246
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,430
And then in health care in particular,

247
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:04,430
there's still a lack of physical capacity and workforce capacity to address pandemic level situations for an extended period of time.

248
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,999
So, you know, earlier in the semester,

249
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,770
we kind of talked about like the bed capacity of high level isolation units here in the United States versus in the European Union in your own head.

250
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:24,980
And during COVID, a lot of mobile wings had to be set up in like parking garages of hospitals in California.

251
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:31,160
I have a friend who's a physician assistant. They set up an outdoor tent just because there wasn't enough bed capacity.

252
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,650
And then a lot of the health care workforce actually died during this time.

253
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:44,960
So I wrote a short think piece kind of on like Asian American and Pacific Islanders in particular in the workplace.

254
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:58,250
And so. Filipino Americans make up about only 2% of the U.S. population, but there's about 30% of registered nurses in hospital facilities.

255
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:06,260
And Filipino nurses, compared to other races and ethnicities, had higher death rates during the COVID 19 pandemic.

256
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:14,600
And that's also something that hasn't super been addressed. Filipino nurses were brought over from the Philippines historically.

257
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,549
They were trained in like American health care and they continue to like bring them to this day.

258
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:25,220
So like nurses from the Philippines were brought over here during COVID to kind of help with capacity.

259
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:34,030
But in a way, again, you know, through that implicit bias or even racism, seeing people of color,

260
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:41,839
people from abroad as more expendable then, you know, people who live and work here in the United States.

261
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,540
So there's still a significant need for nursing, student nursing and health care facilities.

262
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:52,589
And then, like we've talked about throughout the semester, backup readiness for scenarios.

263
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:58,999
So kind of weighing the daily cost and function versus extreme scenarios like how Dr. Phil Smith,

264
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,090
who, you know, stood up the Nebraska biocontainment unit.

265
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,659
Basically, we didn't use that for regular patient care.

266
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:14,209
It kind of only exists for these extreme scenarios and for exercises, but they found funding from other sources to kind of sustain that.

267
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,700
But a lot of hospitals don't have that capability.

268
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:24,710
And then federal funding given to state and local entities to prepare for health emergencies have been cut back over the past few decades.

269
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,760
Differing levels of care's across facilities across the nation.

270
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,890
So if you look at medical deserts, for example, or like shortages in rural areas,

271
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:40,700
you know, the kind of care that you might get in, like Orchard Nebraska, for example,

272
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:46,099
is very different than the kind of carrying might get in Washington, D.C. And then, like we've talked about,

273
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:52,040
infectious disease scenarios are not regularly exercised, trained or retrained among health care workers.

274
00:30:52,040 --> 00:31:00,370
How to do that. So like the video clip that we just watched, oh, you never actually, like, set a number.

275
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,600
I think at the end of like what they were saying,

276
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:12,259
this much would prevent this might like are there other clips that like break down how they would calculate that or not that I saw because they said,

277
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:18,110
you know $24 on average per person here in the United States in terms of public health.

278
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:21,410
And then then in Canada, they spend $7,000.

279
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:27,860
But probably that that number came from cost for America's health in one of their reports.

280
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:33,710
So I'm wondering if they have a breakdown in there, because even thinking about the $7,000 in Canada,

281
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:41,510
that's taking into account that they have a universal health care system versus $24 here in the United States,

282
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:48,380
I'm guessing that would account for like things like public health, communications and marketing,

283
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:54,530
because even things like free vaccinations, that's more so due to the Affordable Care Act.

284
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:01,850
So I don't I don't yeah. I just was like, oh, it would be more interesting to see how is that $24.

285
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:05,090
Yeah. In dollars being used in how.

286
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,670
Let me and how does that translate to like how many people are saying. Because they talk to.

287
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:13,920
How many people died during COVID 19. Lives lost during the wars.

288
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,209
Not like how. Because that would be a really strong argument.

289
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,520
And I was like, Wait, that argument wasn't Yeah, let me investigate.

290
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,129
Let me see if I can investigate that.

291
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:31,830
And then if I find it, I'll post an announcement on canvas because at least for like occupational health and safety,

292
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:39,540
we always talk about return on investment because no, no employer does anything unless it's good for them and good for their bottom line.

293
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:43,440
So like when we have prevention programs like for example,

294
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,719
there was a total worker health intervention that had like onsite health clinics and

295
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,230
like these preventative care activities for nurses at assisted living facilities.

296
00:32:55,530 --> 00:33:00,450
And they were able to calculate like $4 back for every $1 spent.

297
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,340
But I'll, I'll look into that. Yeah. And she mentioned that at the end.

298
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:10,880
Right. The more you invest in like preventative care, the less you spend in the long run.

299
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:14,520
Yeah, yeah. But that's still not enough. There's no, there's no number.

300
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,340
I get that. Yeah. Let me look into that and get back to you.

301
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:22,830
And then as we've talked about before, public health and science is becoming increasingly partizan.

302
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,040
So this increased mistrust in health care, public health believe in science,

303
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:35,699
and there's like a type of type of person or political affiliation rather than objective measures,

304
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,480
like rather than just being a person who believes in science and public health.

305
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:44,909
Now, if you believe in science and public health, you're kind of affiliated with a certain political party.

306
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:53,940
And it used to not always be that way, but now so more than ever, politics, science and public attitudes are becoming more and more intertwined.

307
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:59,670
So I want to talk about 2000 stars.

308
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:09,389
2002 stars. So back there now, you know, nowadays, Toronto, Canada has a population of about two, almost 3 million.

309
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:12,390
So it's about 2 million in the early 2000s.

310
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:16,740
And this is the capital city of the province in Ontario.

311
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:23,180
This is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America.

312
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,819
So like after like New York City and Los Angeles.

313
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,650
So Toronto is huge and extremely diverse.

314
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:45,540
And during this time outside of Asia, where SA's Kobe one began, Toronto was one of the hardest hit places.

315
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:57,060
So during this time there was 438 suspected cases, 44 deaths, including three health care workers between 2003 and 2004.

316
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,950
So the phase one of this SA's outbreak in particular,

317
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:10,890
it was this index case of this woman and her husband who had vacationed in Hong Kong at the end of February 2003.

318
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:22,050
They came back to Toronto, Canada, where she died in her home on March 5th, but she infected family members, particularly her son.

319
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:31,320
And so the son went to the hospital, to the emergency room and presented they're trying to seek treatment.

320
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:40,050
And that is when nosocomial transmission began, because then he started to spread it to other people at that hospital.

321
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:52,230
So this phase one resulted in 19 cases of stars where 18 stayed in Ontario, and then one person went from Ontario to Vancouver and spread it there.

322
00:35:53,330 --> 00:36:03,500
So then by two months later, all hospitals in Toronto were activated this code orange level.

323
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:07,390
So this is considered that emergency plans were activated.

324
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:14,810
There was a plateau of 140 probable cases, 178 infections and then 24 deaths.

325
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:24,109
So in this phase two, all hospitals discontinued SA's expanded precautions for non SA's patients.

326
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:30,310
But by June there was 79 new cases of SA's that resulted from this.

327
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:37,610
So together they quarantined more than 27,000 people from both phases.

328
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:43,750
I was pretty young when this was happening.

329
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,310
Do any of you remember this at all? I was in elementary.

330
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:59,509
I was in middle school during this time. But I do recall in hindsight with the quarantine, it was a pretty peaceful quarantine, actually.

331
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:08,060
There wasn't as much resistance as the sheltering in place and stay at home orders that we had here in the United States during COVID 19.

332
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,919
Most of those quarantined were in the vicinity of the hospital where health care

333
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,510
workers or families or people who came into close contact with health care workers.

334
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:25,100
And the plan that they implemented was health care workers who were working to treat stars in this facility,

335
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:31,159
were allowed to cohabitate with each other and then do transport with each other.

336
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,460
But otherwise, they kind of stayed within their their bubble.

337
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:43,280
And at this time, in 2003, no Toronto Hospital had a regional framework on how to manage this kind of outbreak,

338
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:48,860
and they had no plans on how to coordinate response across hospital facilities.

339
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:56,629
So after, you know, the dust settled on all of this, finally the provincial and federal agencies, because they don't have states,

340
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:03,950
they have provinces, started focusing on more efforts on making infectious disease mitigation and management a priority.

341
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:11,059
And that is when they established the public health agency of Canada in the next year and the Public Health Agency of Canada,

342
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:16,970
I believe all of you used their pathogen safety data sheets for a homework assignment, number one.

343
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,459
So that comes from their institute,

344
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:28,310
where essentially they put in a significant amount of resources to make public information about essentially creating like safety data,

345
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:33,440
sheet type things for pathogens in particular that are updated as needed.

346
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:38,990
And for the first phase of SaaS that primarily affected health care workers.

347
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,910
So they took, like I mentioned, stringent measures to curb the spread amongst themselves.

348
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:55,879
But Canada's universal health insurance plans allowed the 28 hospitals within Canada to function semi autonomously.

349
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,240
So they were more or less all kind of like doing their own thing.

350
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:06,260
And there was not necessarily any jurisdictional agreements for sharing public health and clinical resources.

351
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:09,980
So like if one hospital was short staffed and one hospital was not,

352
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:15,500
they didn't necessarily have agreements in terms of like how that would work in terms of staffing,

353
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:22,639
switching folks or rather moving folks from like less affected provinces like Saskatchewan,

354
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,920
for example, or like Prince Edward Island to Toronto to help kind of do that.

355
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,909
What is it like, goodwill or care? Like, for example,

356
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:43,399
here when we have we know major power outage is coming sometimes gets linemen from other states like Georgia or like North Carolina, for example.

357
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,129
And we kind of do the same when we know there's a hurricane. They send Michigan linemen out to Florida or whatever.

358
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:54,950
So Canada did not have at this time any kind of agreement like that for their health care workers.

359
00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:01,870
Yes. And this is all, again, similar age at the time of start,

360
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:14,260
wasn't it all seem like it was a much more severe like illness than it is to with people less presented, asymptomatic or was less likely to.

361
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:21,930
Like spread in the way Kobe did because people would, like, fall ill in that way, like the cases were.

362
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,280
I'm just trying to think of like the differences between. Yeah.

363
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:32,079
Yeah. So. So they're all within, like the Corona virus family, including Ms.

364
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,170
Cody, too. So this is Sars-cov-1.

365
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:43,179
The main difference with one versus two now is that two was extremely, I guess we say,

366
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:49,149
smart in the sense that in the way that it attached to the body and that it not only affected the lungs,

367
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:55,690
but started to attack other systems within the body like you could get sepsis, for example,

368
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:03,879
whereas sars-cov-1 was a pretty well severe as in the name severe acute respiratory infection,

369
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:09,470
but it more or less stayed to you the respiratory system. So you didn't have people getting sepsis, for example,

370
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:17,740
or chronic body pain or like migraines or like losing their sense of like taste or smell like we did with SARS-CoV-2,

371
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:23,440
but also because it was more or less restricted within Toronto.

372
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:31,690
And once they figured it out, except for that one person who wandered over to Vancouver, they were like, You all cannot like leave this proximity.

373
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:39,220
Whereas here in the United States, in hindsight now we know it's been here as early as November, December 2019,

374
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:47,770
and we had four months of of basically like unmitigated community spread that it just went like wildfire.

375
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:58,510
Yeah. So if any of you have watched the movie Contagion with like Kate Winslet and Gwyneth Paltrow,

376
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:07,540
who dies early but is kind of based on a hybrid of of stars and then like an avian influenza.

377
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:14,860
But that movie actually is one of the more accurate ones about pandemic response.

378
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:26,979
Does that answer your question? Okay. So so now I want to focus on New Zealand, who did a fantastic job during the COVID 19 outbreak.

379
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,730
So New Zealand has a population of about 5 million.

380
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:35,230
So this whole country has half the population of Michigan.

381
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:45,670
So their population density is is pretty low, but they are an island nation of two land masses and then 700 smaller islands,

382
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,690
but they do have universal health care for all residents.

383
00:42:51,610 --> 00:43:04,689
So for this lessons learned on COVID 19, the Ministry of Health had developed a pandemic planning guide in 2006, but it was for like a mass influenza.

384
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,810
It did black specificity. Okay, but they had one.

385
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:16,780
But, you know, with their prime minister, Jacinda Barrett, Jacinda,

386
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:26,500
they really quickly acted and they spent over five weeks in a level four lockdown that was declared by the government.

387
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:33,070
And the contrast is that rather than government officials informing the pandemic response,

388
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:40,420
they let the guidance of the pandemic response be informed by epidemiologists and scientists in particular.

389
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,150
So their Prime Minister consulted with the public health community in the health care community,

390
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:52,330
and they had very explicit communication go home, stay home.

391
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,020
So the top goal was eliminating community transmission.

392
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:03,399
They had super stretched border control and they shut down all non-essential services, businesses,

393
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,880
education facilities, closed, they rationed supplies and they really prioritized medical services.

394
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:16,570
So like they're, for example, like, you know, how here were they had pick up at restaurants.

395
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:23,860
No restaurants. The only place you could go. Gas station, grocery store, pharmacy.

396
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:30,160
That's it. No. None of this business we had here where you could still go to the golf course outside.

397
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:38,530
You know, none of this pick up kind of thing, none of these some leisure activities that we could still enjoy.

398
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:46,450
And with them in particular, they were only allowed one person who was allowed outside of the house.

399
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:55,030
So if you live in a house, whether that is a traditional like nuclear family or you live with like roommates or whatever government said, guess what?

400
00:44:55,060 --> 00:45:01,180
Only one of you gets to be the person that goes outside into the world to go get the groceries,

401
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,360
go do the things, go get what you need, and then come back.

402
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:08,950
And then even for a time they restricted outdoor activities.

403
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,760
So you can even go walk around it like the park or something.

404
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:23,830
You could only like walk around your neighborhood. So with this it was super duper strict compared to what we had here in the U.S. and a lot of.

405
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:27,640
Other states, but because they were able to, like, nip that in the bud.

406
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:37,840
If you remember, we had several rounds of like stay at home order attempts and then like New Zealand pretty early on was like, we're returning back.

407
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:42,819
We can have like football games, soccer matches again and all these kinds of things.

408
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,460
But it's not to say that that was all perfect.

409
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:56,200
They did experience issues with PPE, shortages, testing, contact tracing, but they did have one of the lowest COVID 19 death rates in the world.

410
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:05,160
Swati I think one of the biggest. Things are things that work for their families because they were an island nation.

411
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:12,820
It was easier for them to shun foreigners. Yes. Because they were already isolated in a certain way.

412
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:22,710
So and New Zealand, I think one of the main sources of income for their economy was also tourism.

413
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:27,390
So I think that that industry was probably the only thing that was affected.

414
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:39,909
Significantly, but otherwise they were, um, uh, I guess economic, on an economic standpoint, a very well secure nation.

415
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:50,200
So they, uh, in many ways and because their health care system was pretty good, they were able to manage with the resources that they already had.

416
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:59,580
Yes. Yeah. I feel like, uh, if we compare this to maybe other smaller island nations that aren't that,

417
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:06,490
uh, financially well off, I think they might struggle with for sure great points.

418
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:14,800
Australia, a giant island nation, didn't did not fare as well.

419
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:21,160
Right. They made similar choices to the U.S. in some ways.

420
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:26,820
Japan, another island nation, did very well. Right. Indonesia, another island nation did very well.

421
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,350
Vietnam, not an island nation, but a coastal a coastal nation fared pretty well.

422
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,300
Maybe the not to put the four people on.

423
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:43,149
You know to colony or anything like that. But I from a sociological standpoint,

424
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:53,320
I also think is interesting that I was reading that comparison about nations with women in leadership and how early in the pandemic in

425
00:47:53,320 --> 00:48:00,639
terms of restrictive public health measures and being able to make like policy decisions and public health decisions to curb the spread,

426
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,250
like in Germany, for example,

427
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:13,000
with Angela merkel or in New Zealand with Jacinda or like Suites countries in Scandinavia that had female presidents or female prime ministers,

428
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:20,260
those countries acted much quicker on public health guidance and evidence than like countries like,

429
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,430
you know, when we started the pandemic, we were at the Trump head of the Trump administration.

430
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:31,120
And then Brazil, for example, had Bolsonaro, which is also a very conservative, you know, leader.

431
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:36,670
But yeah, I don't know. Did all talk about that at the Ford School at all?

432
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:43,720
How about. Well, there is the first two articles that I hear with.

433
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:48,850
Yes, not articles, but like the reports about the different the different countries.

434
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:59,799
And the main thing that we discussed in class was the ways citizen will be used against in the government in order to trust the responses.

435
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:06,040
And also, I think the ways people think about like their responsibilities to the community to kind of like.

436
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:16,620
We've talked about that in this class. A lot of people really think you just already were wearing a mask that was in the way like that is here.

437
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:21,660
So I think that I am seeing a lot of very much.

438
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:29,770
Better response because of the Treasury, the government. Women often just like conscientiousness in the community.

439
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:33,790
Yeah. No discussion, though, of like male versus female leadership.

440
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:37,360
Okay. Yeah, I think I read some like think pieces on that.

441
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,839
But, you know, I always think that's interesting because they're always like,

442
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,930
women can't be in power because we are emotional and get periods and stuff like that.

443
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:55,209
It's like. Yeah. Page didn't have a lot of like 3 p.m. like stay at home orders like we did or they did it re-issue them.

444
00:49:55,210 --> 00:50:01,330
But when they did, like folks really barreled down on, like Swati mentioned, like tourism is a huge thing there.

445
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:09,459
And actually the film industry films a lot there too, just because they have seen all these beautiful, all these beautiful landscapes.

446
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,340
I think it was like Lord of the Rings.

447
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:19,750
Yeah, I think Tom Hanks was in New Zealand when he got Corbett in the MC, had to come back because they were like, That's the Tom Hanks.

448
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:31,090
But you know, yeah, it's they did shut down a couple of times, but for the most part, like, you know, they did not reopen their borders.

449
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:36,370
And like Japan only very recently it was like, Ah, l can come back here again.

450
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:42,520
So this is here is from John Hopkins COVID data.

451
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:55,180
So if you look at the cumulative confirmed COVID 19 cases per 1 million people, this is as of July 11, 2021 versus in the red is deaths.

452
00:50:55,180 --> 00:51:00,549
Right. So the darker the color, the more deaths or cases there are.

453
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:16,420
So, you know, you see a lot of countries in Europe, North America, South America severely affected, but less so in Africa and Asia.

454
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:25,990
Why do you think that is? Well, you know how to said, you know, for the Asian, you know, cultural practices but Africa why Ian.

455
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:30,190
I would say one of my first confirmed cases.

456
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,490
Mhm. And there's a lot of testing capacity in many of these other countries.

457
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:40,749
Yes. Yes. There's, there's a couple reasons for this other that's harder for a lot of those countries.

458
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:49,600
Infectious diseases are endemic and so people are already aware with the protocols that you need to be doing to protect yourself.

459
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:52,960
Yes, for sure. Are there other thoughts?

460
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:05,120
Are much younger populations there in Africa as well, where most folks are.

461
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:15,470
You know, you have some young children, but they don't have as nearly as many folks over the age of 65 compared to not as many potentially it was.

462
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:19,700
A lot of people are, you know, lacking proper nutrition and things like that,

463
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:30,770
but they're not necessarily suffering from other co-morbidities like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, COPD, asthma, those kinds of things.

464
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:36,640
But also because certain infectious diseases have been endemic there,

465
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:44,899
their immune systems have been working pretty regularly throughout most of their lives.

466
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,170
So many factors that can contribute to this.

467
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:53,660
So are we doomed to keep repeating history?

468
00:52:55,970 --> 00:53:02,460
Here are some interesting. I had to dig through some news archives to find this.

469
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:11,600
So just to contrast you on the side. This side is from the 1918 influenza and this side is obviously COVID.

470
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:15,960
So here we see some messaging in newspapers. Fight the flu.

471
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:21,740
Rigid quarantine rules established. You are asked to aid in enforcing them.

472
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,299
And then flu masks ready to check the epidemic.

473
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:32,390
And then influenza gives impetus to home study work conducted by mail.

474
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,430
So these are basically a 100 years apart, right?

475
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:45,920
This one here then and now. Same thing Anti-mask meeting tonight, Saturday, January 25th.

476
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:50,600
Dreamland Drink to Protest Against the Unhealthy Mask Ordinance.

477
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:57,380
Extracts will be read from the State Board of Health Bulletin showing compulsory mask wearing to be a failure.

478
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,820
Eugenie Schmitz and other interesting speakers admission is free.

479
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:05,510
This is from San Francisco in 1919.

480
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:13,970
And then protests in Huntington Beach in California, same kind of thing in Huntington Beach in particular, if any of you.

481
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,559
So I know a lot. I know you're from California, Adriana,

482
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:26,930
but Huntington Beach is in SoCal and it's actually a very conservative area just because a lot of wealthy folks live in Huntington Beach.

483
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:31,879
So this is kind of like a hot spot in California of Anti-mask sentiment.

484
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:41,420
And there was one of the restaurants there where they actually said people eat for free if you're into not masking here.

485
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:47,960
And then this is again, this is from the Department of Health Collection, the New York City Municipal Archives.

486
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:59,180
And then this one is, you know, obviously the no COVID vaccine murder ink, but that was a job rule record label.

487
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,750
But okay, here is your proof. That is correct.

488
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:08,510
Okay. Here is your proof. No proof. The gang promoting the vaccine have no proof.

489
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:11,680
The Salk vaccine must not be licensed.

490
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:22,550
Every U.S. senator and U.S. congressman owe it to you, the public, to demand an immediate, open hearing on the truth about inviting doctors.

491
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,120
And my vision is not great.

492
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:35,839
And then it says, Any public health official who hesitates to stop the licensing and use of, quote, fake vaccines is not fit to serve the public.

493
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,470
And this was in March 25th of 1955.

494
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:51,830
So as we can see here, like it's not like the language or the rhetoric that they use around anti-vaccine is harsher now than it used to be.

495
00:55:52,460 --> 00:56:01,040
I would say it was pretty blunt back then, too, but the difference was that now with social media, it just seems it is.

496
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:06,979
And it seems like these messages are much more rampant and pervasive because before that, if you didn't,

497
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:14,690
like open the newspaper to read this kind of stuff or you didn't happen to see this flier, you're just like living your life, right?

498
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:19,790
But now I feel like you can't, like, go anywhere without encountering this sometimes.

499
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:25,190
You know, just as a masochist. Want to see some crazy stuff?

500
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:31,220
Go to any live article that they post online and read the comments underneath.

501
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:36,770
And it is a wild time. Mira was just wondering.

502
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:42,540
Like what? Like the CDC and local health departments and stuff do to try and address.

503
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:46,070
I feel like a lot of the anti-vaxxers have a lot of misinformation.

504
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:51,290
Sure. The majority of what it is, you know, and there's obviously the topography of freedom of choice, whatever that is.

505
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,150
Yeah. Only do they kind of just respect like are.

506
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:58,540
That will do it. Do you do?

507
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:03,880
Or do they, like, try and talk to these communities and go in there and try to figure out why it actually is very important.

508
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:09,160
So the answer to most, like most things in this class, it depends.

509
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:16,540
So the CDC, of course, they like we showed earlier and a couple of weeks ago in the Public Health Communications lecture,

510
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:25,420
they tried to just do their messaging and have different types of like messaging, infographics and posters to try to like target specific audiences.

511
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:33,820
And then they'll have like their press conferences. But I don't think those have been effective because people's trust in the CDC has wavered so much.

512
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:38,720
Local health departments decided to take their own approach because they know their communities best.

513
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:48,160
Right. So some local health departments will be more aggressive in terms of like their messaging and trying to get people to get the vaccine.

514
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:53,800
And some are very hands off. So I was just in Nebraska this past weekend for the wedding.

515
00:57:54,100 --> 00:58:02,920
And in Nebraska in particular, like masking has been low for most of the pandemic because the whole state has a population of 2 million.

516
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,559
1 million of them are concentrated in like the Omaha area and like another 500,000 in Lincoln.

517
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:12,020
Right. So they're like, Oh, we're so spread out anyway.

518
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:17,919
Why does it matter? But even at the airport, like, hardly anybody was wearing their mask.

519
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:24,040
So a lot of the local health departments don't necessarily take that approach of trying to get people to you.

520
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:29,169
You should get the vaccine. They'll give the information in a more passive way like we have it.

521
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:36,500
This is why you should get it. But the people you see more so pushing it are like the School of Public Health, for example,

522
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:48,339
Nebraska medicine folks that don't necessarily it's a it's a it's a tricky chess game to play because you are reliant on state funding,

523
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:52,510
so you don't want to [INAUDIBLE] off essentially the state funders.

524
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,339
So sometimes that's why, you know,

525
00:58:54,340 --> 00:59:04,570
you partner with your coalitions or your stakeholders to push out the messages that would be politically unwise for you to do, if that makes sense.

526
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:09,690
Yeah. Yeah. So it totally depends. Washtenaw County, for example, very aggressive, right?

527
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,089
Huddah. What is the source for the picture on the right?

528
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:18,370
Just because it's very confusing, like they're all over the map, first of all,

529
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:25,070
and then it's like a also a racially diverse group, which is me just like showing my own like implicit biases.

530
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:37,650
But. Shutterstock So like, did someone just like change things on a protest to like now say like no COVID vaccine, but that's not very helpful.

531
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:45,850
Yeah. Shutterstock So it's insider tip, all the pictures that are captioned the, you know, the School of Public Health,

532
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:50,920
their instructional, our instructional design team here pays for a license to Shutterstock.

533
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:56,710
So if I don't specifically say like I want this photo, use this photo,

534
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:03,489
they'll just put something applicable in there because there was another slide where I want,

535
01:00:03,490 --> 01:00:16,059
I, I wanted a picture of Trump throwing paper towels into the audience and we could like credit EPA for some reason we couldn't use that.

536
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:20,770
So the instructional designer replaced it with something more benign.

537
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:28,180
So yeah, she chose this photo also. So I just was like, This just doesn't feel real, but maybe it's real.

538
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,580
I have no idea. No one, people look really kind of, like, happy.

539
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:36,820
Just they don't look out sorry. They don't look as incensed as you.

540
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:41,050
Like, he kind of looks like they look like they're smiling under their masks, right?

541
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:46,660
Yeah. Yeah. This is a stock photo. This isn't a real freedom of choice.

542
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:50,320
Anti-vax. Yeah. Yeah, this is a stock photo.

543
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:54,010
I'm sorry. It really is.

544
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:58,960
Yes. So what's in the future disease X?

545
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:04,000
It's interesting because this is Bill Gates favorite disease to talk about.

546
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:11,379
Now, Bill Gates, obviously founder of Microsoft, has no really training or background in infectious diseases,

547
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:14,890
but he has taken a vested interest in infectious diseases.

548
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:22,300
And when he and Melinda Gates were still married, where he had the affair and all that, and now they have separate foundations.

549
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:30,310
But when they had their foundations, they did fund a lot of infectious disease research and efforts, especially abroad.

550
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:36,760
But disease X is kind of like the the moniker they use for the next unknown pandemic that might strike.

551
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:41,260
And they generally think of this as being like a super influenza.

552
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:47,020
But now, you know, we're kind of seeing a confluence of everything happening.

553
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:52,480
So RSV, which is going around right now, usually you only see RSV in kids,

554
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:59,589
but now it's hitting adults as well just because for the most part as a community,

555
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:04,900
in terms of like population immunity, all of our immune systems are not as.

556
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:08,559
Robust as a collective as it once was.

557
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,680
A lot of folks are still suffering from long COVID as well.

558
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:16,540
So constant assault of like colds the first time some people are getting COVID

559
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:19,960
the second time and then they're getting the flu and now they're getting RSV.

560
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:27,820
Your immune system hasn't had a chance to go back up to 100% yet before you're hit by something else.

561
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:31,540
So we as a community in general are just down for the count.

562
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:37,750
So disease actually, I wouldn't be surprised, honestly, if it showed up in the next few several years.

563
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:48,610
We'll see. So in the future, technology to advance, infectious disease forecasting, to manage outbreaks in particular,

564
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:52,989
of course, people would have a cow if this happened here in the United States.

565
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:59,110
But in China, for example, they track your phone even more than we are being tracked now.

566
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:07,180
And folks had to scan in regularly at locations with QR codes to literally track like your

567
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:13,149
day by day movements so that if you were in an area with a known potential exposure,

568
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:19,030
you would get an immediate notification on your phone. I signed up for the Michigan COVID 19 alerts.

569
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:23,590
Never got a thing in the last two and a half years. Have any of you you did in.

570
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:29,670
Oh, when? Twice. It's been a while. But this summer I think I got.

571
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,130
What was it like after a particular event or anything?

572
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:36,910
You could have gone to Walmart. Okay. The only thing I can link it to.

573
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:40,299
Okay. Yes, Mira. I didn't get it through that.

574
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:43,540
I got it through my phone. There's like a oh, it's called.

575
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:47,899
It was like a service that like in my settings, like so that we have updated notifications for you.

576
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,860
It is that you have been exposed. Oh, the iPhone. Yeah.

577
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:55,749
And it was when I got home, I was over here tested positive but oh it, it was from the Wisconsin.

578
01:03:55,750 --> 01:04:00,220
I live in Illinois. Oh, Wisconsin Department of Health. It they notified me somehow.

579
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:04,059
Interesting. And I haven't gotten it since that I haven't got COVID since then.

580
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:13,000
So I don't know how they do. I, I only got a call from University Health Services and that was after a conference I went to.

581
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,870
I didn't get it at that time, but other people I knew had gotten it.

582
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:21,040
So I haven't gotten those alerts. Biomedical Development Breakthrough.

583
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:25,840
So now they're also trying to produce a vaccine for RSV.

584
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:29,470
This has kind of been in the news in the last few weeks as well,

585
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:37,299
utilizing some of the many technology that they've refined through COVID, enhanced tracking and surveillance.

586
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:40,420
As we talked about, maybe the AP folks can give us greater insight.

587
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:48,270
But like things I from what I'm aware of, mostly like digital tracking in other countries, they use CCTV a lot.

588
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:55,690
We don't necessarily have that here in the United States. CCTV is like they have it in the UK and some other countries.

589
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:02,200
So it's just basically like surveillance cameras that are placed around the cities of for example,

590
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:07,239
you have ever watched like Mission Impossible or like Fast and The Furious or whatever,

591
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:11,889
and they try to pull up footage of like when somebody is on the street and like, what are they doing?

592
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:16,600
That's that's CCTV. We don't have that kind of infrastructure in the United States.

593
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:22,450
And again, people would have a cow if they knew they were being surveilled to that level.

594
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:27,700
Did you all know if they're doing anything more in terms of enhanced tracking and surveillance and AP?

595
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:34,390
How? Just collect data. So we're still working on that, right.

596
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:39,880
And then ensuring everyone has basic adequate infrastructure to control infections.

597
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:45,730
Now sustaining national capabilities and international relationships.

598
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:54,370
So generally, these are the six steps outlined invest, develop, sustain, plan, coordinate and protect.

599
01:05:56,890 --> 01:06:01,230
Let me see if it's on this slide. Okay.

600
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:04,930
I think I get it too later. All right.

601
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:11,560
So the first that being invest as we talked about investment in primary prevention and health care infrastructure.

602
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:21,790
So obviously, if we have a more robust system, it's more capable of managing challenges to pandemic response development in terms of new vaccines,

603
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:27,050
drugs, rapid diagnostics for novel pathogens on an accelerated timeline.

604
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:31,420
Again, emphasizing that things are not rushed or sloppy.

605
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:36,190
Right. So the RNA vaccine has been in development since 2003.

606
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:39,069
So almost 20 years in the making,

607
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:47,800
but rather this time we are cutting out the administrative red tape that generally takes two years to kind of get this paperwork pushed through.

608
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,309
That's the kind of messaging that needs to be communicated to the public.

609
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:55,420
Right, because they don't necessarily have an understanding of how all that went down.

610
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:58,780
Sustaining strong global health security systems.

611
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:05,919
So Dr. Kirstein, who gets lectured a few weeks ago of Nebraska Med Center and Hopkins in particular,

612
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:10,569
has one of the few global health security centers in the United States.

613
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:16,630
As that video clip we watched talked about kind of treating health security in the same way as military security.

614
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:23,200
So that's something that those centers are aiming for and then creating deployable clinical capacities

615
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:30,410
and capabilities for infectious disease emergencies that are centralized planning in particular.

616
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:35,230
So with me tag the National Emergency Pathogens Center.

617
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,969
What they did was they essentially tried to do an assessment, so they did site visit.

618
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:45,790
So Doctor, her site and Dr. Gibbs actually went around to these different ATCs throughout the United States,

619
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:50,619
including in like random places like Idaho and did walkthroughs to try to kind

620
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:55,599
of create a repository to understand what are our hospital capabilities,

621
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:04,780
our high level hospital capabilities. But we still don't have a highly infectious disease care network beyond the regional centers.

622
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:14,620
Okay. And then coordination in terms of open information, best practices, evidence based sharing, knowledge repository.

623
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:19,660
So many things currently exist behind academic journal paywalls.

624
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:25,390
Now there's more of a push for open access. But let me tell you my biggest gripe as a researcher.

625
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:32,380
Academic publishing is a scam. It is like the biggest scam ever because we don't get paid to write.

626
01:08:32,830 --> 01:08:38,350
We don't get paid to peer review. Associate editors don't get paid to be associate editors.

627
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:42,279
Only editor and chiefs are in most.

628
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:47,620
Open access fees now are anywhere between 2000 to $4000.

629
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:54,330
So thankfully, like I work here at the University of Michigan where they give me a pretty healthy discretionary account.

630
01:08:54,340 --> 01:09:03,760
But in the last year, I've published three open access articles for a total of $9,000.

631
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:11,710
And the reason that I decided to do that, because I felt like they were topics that were particularly important for practitioners to read.

632
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:19,780
Since most of my work is translational and I care more about like people who work in public health reading it than other academics reading it.

633
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:26,859
I don't care if other academics read it honestly, but it is so expensive.

634
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:31,720
It is so, so expensive. And all that money just goes to the publisher.

635
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:36,610
Yes. I don't know if this is just like spaces I have them in,

636
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:44,950
but I feel like there's also a push towards open access to the research project that will be done on all of our publications.

637
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:48,210
Have to be open. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

638
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:52,480
So now like NIH is pushing more towards that and there's like grants and stuff

639
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:57,249
where like if you're in what you consider like a lower resource country,

640
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:59,620
they might give you a discount on the fee.

641
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:10,120
But it's like obviously they're pushing open access for knowledge, transparency and like equity reasons, but oh my God, it's so cost so much.

642
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:14,019
And it's for like what? Like journals don't even publish hard copies anymore.

643
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:23,049
It's literally like a pdf online. So fernyhough and then protect national security community.

644
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:29,650
Are we actually ready to protect, detect and respond to infectious disease emergencies?

645
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:39,530
Yes. A lot of stuff we may not actually know about what's happening.

646
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:46,190
And in the similar vein, this morning, when I was getting ready for work, I was listening to a podcast.

647
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:49,290
CONAN CONAN O'Brien needs a friend to you.

648
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:59,659
Listen to that. Anyway, Stephen Colbert was on and he was talking about how he went to go visit these troops that seldom get visited.

649
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:11,210
And they're at a very high security clearance facility in the northern hemisphere, kind of close to Greenland, where they manage nuclear threats.

650
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:19,790
And so Stephen Colbert was talking about how he talked to some of the officers about like, you know,

651
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:28,219
how fast like if a missile were to come from like North Korea, for example, like how how long from there would it be in like New York City?

652
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,350
And it was like half an hour or something like that.

653
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:37,580
And so he was asking them like, so when would we, the public, be notified in advance that it was coming?

654
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:40,640
And they were like, we wouldn't notify you.

655
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:48,470
So to a certain extent, some things again, like definitely above my security clearance or pay grade.

656
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,440
Not sure to the extent to which we would know about these things.

657
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:57,320
Like I said, for those of us who work in the field of infectious disease research and response,

658
01:11:57,590 --> 01:12:03,470
we knew about COVID in January, but nothing was really done until March.

659
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:09,620
Right. And we I don't I don't I myself, Aurora, don't have the power to to necessarily do anything about it.

660
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:19,339
But, you know, with the CDC, they have a global health security and prevention unit where they aim to prevent avoidable pandemics,

661
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:23,780
including naturally occurring outbreaks and then bioterrorism in particular.

662
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:28,610
And then other nations have their own version of that. So Public Health Agency of Canada.

663
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:38,240
And then you have the Robert Koch Institute in Germany. And like Dr. Hurst, I'd mention the World Health Organization in the Gore Network as well.

664
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:47,270
United Nations has played a key role since 1948 in terms of public health efforts like smallpox eradication,

665
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:55,880
near eradication of polio, the development of the Ebola vaccine, HIV AIDS, vector borne diseases in particular.

666
01:12:56,270 --> 01:13:03,110
So the United States provides voluntary contributions to the W.H.O.,

667
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:08,780
and we use that term in a loose way, voluntary, because it's kind of more like you're obligated to it.

668
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:19,310
But we do provide 22% of the chose for budget as one of the wealthiest nations in the world.

669
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:25,670
And so 21 centers collaborate with the W.H.O., including CDC at night.

670
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:34,159
But if you all remember, there was a brief blip back earlier in the pandemic when the Trump administration

671
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:39,400
decided in April of 2020 that it wanted to cease funding with the W.H.O.

672
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:49,340
How many remember that couple you. So they wanted to withdraw from the W.H.O. because they felt like we're putting money into the W.H.O.

673
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:56,540
What is that really doing for us? A lot of, you know, like nationalistic sentiment again.

674
01:13:56,810 --> 01:14:03,049
But thankfully that was, you know, so during that time between April and July, when they were like,

675
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:11,720
we're going to withdraw from the W.H.O., a lot of the funds were redirected to the US rather than global health priorities.

676
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:17,389
And this did create a strained relationship with other members in the United Nations.

677
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:21,920
Right. So that's like not us. Yes. I just have a question about the budget.

678
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:30,460
Yes. I'm not trying to no nurse in that video we watched earlier with the saying the CBC's budget is $11 billion.

679
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:35,780
Yes. And 22% of 120.5 million for the whole world.

680
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,660
Like that's nothing. It's very smart.

681
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:43,140
Yes. Yeah.

682
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:51,479
Sorry. I think that times five times five is 500.

683
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,870
600 million. Assignment. Assignment, billion dollars.

684
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:59,900
No, that's depressing, right? Yeah, a lot of those cases.

685
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:10,620
But, yeah, this obviously created a lot of strain between other United Nations like France and the UK.

686
01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:13,860
I mean, Boris Johnson was wild, but even he was like, come on.

687
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:22,589
And there is also long term global implications of withdrawal from the WHL be on financial and we also you know,

688
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:27,959
we think about like people are our expats who live abroad or live in other countries.

689
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:32,730
But there may come a time when the United States needs assistance from other nations.

690
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:36,780
And, you know, with these kinds of actions, because we're not proving good.

691
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:46,079
Well, they might not necessarily want to provide it, but thankfully, this was halted when the new administration turned over.

692
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,850
But that's kind of it's wild.

693
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:58,320
It will be like if the United States decided to withdraw from NAITO, for example, or, you know, we withdrew from the Paris Accords.

694
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:11,520
Any who I think I will pause there for today and and finish this portion on Thursday there's only three more slides and then get to Thursday slides.

695
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:17,520
Uh, but just a reminder to get it on your radar with your outline.

696
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,080
Think that's and do your course emails. They're anonymous.

697
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:27,060
I think that's all I have for now. Okay, thanks, all.
