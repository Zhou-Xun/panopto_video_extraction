00:00:02,729 --> 00:00:13,019
Hello, everyone. My name is Mislael  Valentin-Cortez, and I'll be talking to you today about things that considering graduate school,

2
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:21,959
particularly when to go to grad school and what you consider when you're deciding where to go for graduate school.

3
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:33,839
So just to introduce myself, I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Michigan and my PhD is in epidemiologist.

4
00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:40,769
I'm particularly focusing on sort of the intersection of social and environmental epidemiology,

5
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:52,769
particularly on the health impacts of climate change, environmental disasters and other natural hazards.

6
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:56,579
I'm also a past participant of the Future Public Health Leaders program.

7
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:07,439
So I haven't participated back in 2015 and I'm always excited to help out with the program and to talk to current students.

8
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:16,099
So I'm happy to help with however, I can be a resource for you.

9
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:23,329
So starting off about what you should consider when you're deciding where to go for grad school,

10
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:30,649
some particular things to take into consideration if you're deciding about where you

11
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:36,229
should go to graduate school right after undergrad or if you should wait a little bit.

12
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:43,969
The first thing that I'll note is how certain you are about the program or area that you're focusing in.

13
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:51,799
So are you sure that you want to study epidemiology, health behavior or environmental health,

14
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:59,149
or are you considering several options so you can between epidemiology and environmental health?

15
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:07,879
So I think it's really important for you to consider that thinking that graduate school is a lot more specialized than undergrad.

16
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:14,389
And it's also a lot shorter. So you'll be there for two to three years, whereas an undergraduate there for four to five years.

17
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:21,649
So it's important that you start off really understanding your program,

18
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:29,149
your focus area so you can make the most out of your time in graduate school.

19
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:35,889
Another thing to think about is if there are any expectations in your field, particularly when you're applying.

20
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:43,219
So, for example, some disciplines expect you to go for to work for a number of years before you going to graduate school.

21
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:48,739
An example of that is masters of nursing programs

22
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:57,169
A lot of times I expect you to have two years of experience working in clinical settings before you apply to graduate school.

23
00:02:57,169 --> 00:03:04,849
The same can be said about some master's programs, particularly in some schools compared to other schools.

24
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:07,009
This can this can really vary a lot.

25
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:15,619
For example, the University of Michigan is a school that does not necessarily expect you to have a few years of work experience before applying.

26
00:03:15,619 --> 00:03:22,369
But I know that there's other schools that do so that's something that you should definitely be clear about.

27
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:26,749
And that can also vary within universities, but also within programs.

28
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:34,639
So there might be like, for example, social behavioral science can have a requirement and then epidemiology can have another requirement.

29
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:41,359
So it's really important for you to have that understanding and then sort of in the same line,

30
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:47,359
you may not be considering a Masters, you may actually be considering a PhD.

31
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:53,769
And again, depending on the year program.

32
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:58,539
Some doctoral programs expect you to have a masters before you apply.

33
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:08,649
And then others you can apply straight from undergrad. So that's really important for you to consider whether you want to take one route or the other.

34
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:14,259
Another thing that I think is very important, and this is not to discourage you,

35
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:22,199
but I want to assure that you get the best chance possible when you're applying to graduate school.

36
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,909
And then I also want to assure you that you are all more than capable of applying to and getting into graduate school,

37
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:32,109
especially if you're taking part in the future of public health through the program.

38
00:04:32,109 --> 00:04:36,099
This is not an easy program to get to. And if you're already here,

39
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:39,609
then that means that you have all the experience and all the skill set that you

40
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:46,359
need to be successful in applying to grad school and being in grad school.

41
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:54,039
But applying to graduate school is very time consuming. And there are a lot of important factors that can complicate things.

42
00:04:54,039 --> 00:05:02,759
So usually it is recommended that you start preparing to apply to grad school around eight months prior to the deadline.

43
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,229
And this does not mean that you have to like write your essays eight months in advance,

44
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:15,849
but rather that you want to start thinking about graduate school about eight months before you start applying.

45
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:22,029
And this means, you know, talking with your mentors or advisers about what you're thinking,

46
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:27,969
it can mean looking into different programs and creating a list of places that you

47
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:34,569
might want to apply to. Doing informational interviews with programs or students,

48
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:43,959
Especially if you're like in between you know different majors or a focus area.

49
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:54,759
And then also it's important to think about things like transcript verification process, letters of recommendation,

50
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:05,379
And then in public health, the SOPHAS processing can take about I think it's four to six weeks.

51
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:11,949
So it could be about a month or so before your application is processed.

52
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:19,299
So sometimes, even though the deadline is in December, you have to complete your application and submitted by November.

53
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:26,539
So it's really important for you to consider all these factors because you don't want to get overwhelmed

54
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:31,449
plus the deadline. And then two additional things, are personal life

55
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:37,539
are there any important things that are happening in your life in the next few years? Graduate school is a definitely a big commitment

56
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:41,699
And you may or may not want it to get in the way of your personal life

57
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:48,449
It can require a lot of sacrifices. And then something that is definitely very important for a lot of students,

58
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:53,799
particularly first students and students from underrepresented backgrounds.

59
00:06:53,799 --> 00:07:02,789
Is that applying to graduate school can be expensive. And then also going to graduate school can be very expensive.

60
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:14,789
So this is extremely important to consider whether you feel financially prepared to apply or if you want

61
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:26,109
to gain more work experience and potentially save a little bit of money before going through that process.

62
00:07:26,109 --> 00:07:34,039
And so. That was a mistake, sorry.

63
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:41,799
So what it is the right next step.

64
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:49,929
I want to emphasize that this is a very personal thing and the right next step might mean different things for different people.

65
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:58,749
There isn't just one path to graduate school. A lot of students think that they want to go into graduate school or want to go into graduate

66
00:07:58,749 --> 00:08:04,569
school because they want to further their skills and stand out in the job market.

67
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:10,059
But there can be many different reason. This is a very personal choice.

68
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:17,409
You can also, you know, graduate school is not necessarily for everyone, but you might not end up going to grad school, and that's OK.

69
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:27,099
We can all be public health leaders or leaders in our own field without necessarily going to graduate school.

70
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:30,699
And then also thinking about if you want to go again,

71
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:35,349
like right after undergrad or if you want to gain some experience of forehand, there's a lot of options.

72
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:43,539
There's postgrad fellowships. For example, PHAB, AmeriCorps, Peace Corps, and a lot of other ones.

73
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:49,189
These can be amazing experiences and can provide you with unique perspectives in graduate school.

74
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:56,709
I think this is particularly important when you're unsure about what you would want to pursue in graduate school.

75
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:01,629
Having that on the ground experience can really give you a really good understanding

76
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:06,159
of what like different community needs are or what skills you need to develop,

77
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:15,669
and then that can really inform what exactly you pursue or where you go to in in graduate school.

78
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:25,189
And so that's a good transition into our next segment, where to go to graduate school and then what you should consider.

79
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:29,599
I really want to emphasize this particular slide.

80
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:41,409
I think this is really for me at least, this is the most important consideration about what you're considering in terms of a graduate school.

81
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:49,889
And so thinking about school fit, how you fit with the particular school and program that you're applying to.

82
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:57,259
And so this can be a lot of different things, thinking about degrees even within public health.

83
00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:03,399
There's a lot of different options. So there's MPH degrees there's master of science and public health

84
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,779
there's master of science that focuses on a particular area of public health

85
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:16,699
there's master of Health Services Administration, and there's a lot of different options.

86
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:21,019
So it's really important for you to know what those different degrees are

87
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:29,509
and then what school offer a particular degree that you want to pursue.

88
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:32,719
Also, thinking about programs a lot of schools have

89
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:38,989
like a specialization in epidemiology versus other schools, can have more of an emphasis on community health

90
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:43,009
other schools can have more of an emphasis and health administration.

91
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:55,069
So it's really important for you to have that understanding and how that sort of school focus fits in with your own focus and your own goals.

92
00:10:55,069 --> 00:11:04,999
And then there's the disciplines consideration. So I think this is also particularly true with a lot of students who want to do interdisciplinary work.

93
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:13,519
For example, in my own case, when I did my master's, I pursued public health and social work as a dual degree.

94
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:20,629
So if you want to follow a similar path or if you want to have sort of that interdisciplinary approach to your career,

95
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:27,799
it's important for you to have that understanding of whether that university that you're going to has a public health program.

96
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:30,979
And then also has a good social work program,

97
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:39,169
a good public policy program, a good environmental sciences department or whatever your focus area might be.

98
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:44,299
Another piece to all of this is the curriculum and the coursework.

99
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:50,879
Obviously, this is an important part in you're pursuing your degree. And so

100
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:59,749
I like to suggest that you really think about what classes are offered and that what skills in particularly you can gain from those classes

101
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:04,819
and then how can that support your personal and professional development.

102
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:12,289
That's, I think, something that a lot of times isn't necessarily thought about as much, particularly the skill building component.

103
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:19,779
But that's definitely something that is especially helpful when you're going into the job market.

104
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:25,759
And so the next piece is the school and department culture. So is it at a community based university.

105
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:34,629
Is it a research focus to research intensive university? Is it more in the administration than health care management piece of it?

106
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:42,409
And then how does that really fit in? And I think this is something that you might get a sense from, like looking at university website

107
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:47,599
but I would always suggest that you really talk with people who are involved

108
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:52,669
with the school and who really have an understanding of that school's culture,

109
00:12:52,669 --> 00:13:04,519
because sort of that feeling that you get from talking with those people can really give you a good sense of how your personality,

110
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:09,169
how your goals and how who you are fits in with that culture.

111
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:19,459
And I can say that, for example, when I was applying to doctoral programs, there was a couple of schools that I talked to several people

112
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:27,859
and I felt like the culture and sort of the resources and sort of the people that were there and

113
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:34,939
their interests and their goals were not in line with my personal values and my personal interests.

114
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:40,369
And I felt like I wouldn't be supported in the way that I wanted to be supported.

115
00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:46,189
And so I decided not to apply to those schools. And I think that's something that's important to think about,

116
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:57,289
because graduate school is such a big commitment and you want to make sure that you are in a place that feels good and welcoming for you.

117
00:13:57,289 --> 00:14:05,449
And then also, obviously, faculty and research centers are available and particularly in the research areas that you're interested in.

118
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:15,649
So if you're more focused on mental health, is there a faculty that specializes in mental health, if you're more focused on chronic disease

119
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:18,709
Is there a faculty or research center that focuses in that area?

120
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:23,629
That's definitely important because you want to make the most out of the opportunities that you might have,

121
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:30,899
both in terms of classes you take, but then also research and practice in that area.

122
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:40,629
Another piece to all of this is definitely funding and I think as students, this is something that we think a lot about.

123
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:46,869
And then obviously, there is this cache of opportunities, and I think when you think about funding, that's the primary thing that we think about.

124
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:57,009
But there's other also important funding considerations I want to encourage you to think about. Student assistantships is one of them.

125
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:05,039
And so that's essentially a lot of schools offer you the opportunity for you to work,

126
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:16,119
like teaching a course or supporting a professor and teaching a course or being a fully funded research assistant.

127
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:24,279
And then a lot of time that includes healthcare benefits and includes a lot of important benefits to the university.

128
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:29,229
And so that's definitely a big advantage that you want to think about.

129
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:35,109
Are those things offered it in the particular school that you're applying to. And then also

130
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:37,959
are there a lot of student employment opportunities?

131
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:48,489
Again, one of the most important thing out of graduate school is not as much the coursework, but what you do outside of the coursework.

132
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:57,039
I think it's a little bit different than undergrad in that sense in terms of it being more practice focused and skill-based focused.

133
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:05,349
So the networking that you do with the extracurricular activities that you do are a lot of times much more meaningful and

134
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:12,999
much more important than the classes that you're taking. So take advantage of the student operate employment opportunities that are available.

135
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:20,589
And then a final piece that I think is extremely important, especially within public health.

136
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:26,979
A lot of times you require to do a summer program or a summer internship.

137
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:35,059
But then there may or may not be funding available to fund the time that you're spending in your internship,

138
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:44,179
or you might have a special interest during the semester where you found an opportunity to do research abroad or something.

139
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:47,869
And so are those special projects, are those internships funded?

140
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:53,289
Is there a travel expenses that can be covered? Are those things off bridge?

141
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:55,039
That's extremely important.

142
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:04,169
And I know for in my case, that's not something that I necessarily thought about when before applying to graduate school.

143
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:09,689
The next piece is location and setting, and so this may or may not be of importance to you

144
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:14,999
but I think I wanted to really emphasize the community resources piece.

145
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:24,629
So the city and the location that you're living to, you can have a lot of important resources that may not necessarily be tied to the university

146
00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:29,519
and that's something that's really important to consider because you can take

147
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:37,079
advantage of those things even if they are not necessarily offered in your campus,

148
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:40,739
but can still be offered within the broader community.

149
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:49,879
Cost of living, obviously tying back to the financial piece, weather and climate and proximity to family.

150
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:53,809
And then sort of thinking more broadly about the university resources,

151
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:59,579
which sort of ties into the idea that I was talking about with with funding and other considerations.

152
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:07,159
So the infrastructure there might be computer services, there might be library services that you can take advantage of.

153
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:12,199
Faculty and staff that goes back to what I was talking about previously with the fit.

154
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:17,539
Are there housing opportunities? A lot of times university housing is cheaper than off campus housing

155
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:18,349
and more convenient.

156
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:27,319
So in that important to you. Culture, sports, student org, a lot of you know, obviously we're human beings and we have needs outside of schools.

157
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:35,629
So is there that sort of space for you to do things outside of school and then health and wellness resources.

158
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:42,919
I think, particularly in graduate school mental health is sometimes a concern for students and so are the resources available so that

159
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:49,989
you can be seen when you need to be seen and be taking care of. Professional development resources

160
00:18:49,989 --> 00:18:55,839
so mock interviews, resumé feedback and all those things.

161
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:01,389
And then finally, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, especially for students from underrepresented backgrounds.

162
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:05,199
I know that it's important for us to feel heard and feel included in everything.

163
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:09,549
So what's the school approach in terms of that?

164
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:19,239
So an important thing that I wanted to provide in terms of all of this, is that you should definitely consider doing information interviews with faculty,

165
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:24,489
staff and students from the school that you're applying to really ask about what resources are

166
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:30,129
helpful in addition to any other of the questions that you might have in terms of program fit

167
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:41,569
and a lot of other things. And then sort of finally closing out some important factors that you should also be taking into consideration.

168
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:47,789
Ranking is something that students often think about. In my opinion, that is not necessarily the most important thing.

169
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:57,869
However, it can be bad thing to look at, especially considering kind of tying back to the whole idea with university resources.

170
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:07,439
A lot of times universities that have higher ranking can have more resources because ranking is a lot of times tied to things like research

171
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:11,909
money and resources that are within the university.

172
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:17,069
So that may be something that's important. So it's not necessarily about going to the number one school,

173
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:23,939
but going to the school where you feel like you're the most supported and have the most resources available to you.

174
00:20:23,939 --> 00:20:34,859
Accreditation is particularly important. I think in public health, for example, we have the CEPH accreditation.

175
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:41,239
So is the school that you're applying to and thinking of going to accredited in the program accredited by CEPH?

176
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:45,539
That's important when you're thinking about going into the job market.

177
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:56,699
And then I'll also mention that especially when you're looking into what schools to apply to the CEPH Web site is a particularly useful resource.

178
00:20:56,699 --> 00:21:05,579
That's what I used to identify a lot of the schools that I was interested in applying to.

179
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:10,579
And then some final things disclose online versus in person.

180
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:17,229
And are you more of an online learner or an in-person learner and then time commitment

181
00:21:17,229 --> 00:21:24,129
I think especially thinking about is university in the semester system is in a quarter system.

182
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:31,139
How are semesters divided up? Is a program two years versus three years?

183
00:21:31,139 --> 00:22:03,329
And all of that can be an important consideration, especially given your particularly needs.

184
00:21:38,979 --> 00:21:43,599
But really, this is all very personal, so think about what it is that you need to feel supported.

185
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:52,449
And so you can be successful in graduate school. So that's everything for this presentation.

186
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:59,319
Thank you so much. Ill leave here my contact information. And again, I'm happy to help and be a resource for you

187
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:03,329
However I can.
