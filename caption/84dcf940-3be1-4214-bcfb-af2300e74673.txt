1
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,520
Okay. Good morning, everyone. I hope that you had a great weekend.

2
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:36,240
We are going to post that our link to this lecture about the evolution of the brain size and also the extensive tissue hypothesis,

3
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,210
because today there is an obvious to the presentation.

4
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:55,320
Then what I am going to do is to the first half, talk a little bit about how our brain that was able to show what are the implications for that.

5
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,010
And in the second part of the lecture,

6
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:09,570
I will we will discuss the papers that there's been 52 hypotheses die within in favor and against all the hypotheses then that is the plan.

7
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:21,330
Also, I posted someone you asked me to do both the homeworks before the lecture.

8
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:29,850
Then you are able to see the questions. Then maybe during the leg you can see that what are the questions for the homework?

9
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,880
And then maybe you can ask, do you have any any doubt?

10
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:44,550
Okay, then I want to introduce this topic that is called altimetry to describe the growth of body parts,

11
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:53,550
because that will be important to understand where the evolution or the size of the brain in humans.

12
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,870
Now, these are these are fetal crop from the Atlantic.

13
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:06,330
In the left you have a female to the right you have that the male.

14
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:20,010
And what do you observe the difference between both sexes in this fetal crop fighting the male or the big get the male have this big,

15
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,660
uh, o'clock who is called killer.

16
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,299
He just he does one or the other.

17
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:45,209
Crawl is big. The already. Yes. Is small usually is tend to be one of the clogged up in preferentially for example, the left compared to the right.

18
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:51,720
But also they are some cases rather be the right one, the last one and on the left one the small one.

19
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:59,460
But the important point I want to make here, I think that we have young males for these fetal craft, this large killer.

20
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,310
The female has only that to a small killer in in males.

21
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:14,060
The functions for these are large killer. And you see usually to attract females and also to fight all their mates.

22
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:20,130
And there is some sexual dimorphism here and also there is some sexual selection in the fetal crop.

23
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:28,560
You will see why these are related to double upstream.

24
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:41,280
Now, if we are in this graph, we have in the x axis that this had again in the same period crops.

25
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,900
We have that weight to the body in milligrams for these crops.

26
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:54,090
In that Y-axis we have the weight of the large killer that are all 40 milligrams.

27
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:08,040
Then we can see the large da da da da da large killer equal reach up to almost 60% of the body's body weight in in in males.

28
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,950
Then you can imagine that in some of these fetal crops,

29
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:19,980
more than half of the body weight is this black that in the these are proportionate growth of these killer.

30
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:34,020
Now these are this first type of figural graph or the growth of body parts altimetry was described by the biologist Julian Huxley.

31
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:44,660
Now ideal candidates are little site here you probably were the one that is quite these

32
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:49,979
are growth of these killer industrial crops he was a biologist flat that very direct.

33
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:59,550
What I even ask the United Nations Organization for for children and culture was grandson of Thomas Huxley.

34
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:09,930
Thomas Huxley was are also my daughter was contemporary of Darwin's what if I was called Darwin spoiled dog because you can

35
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:19,770
imagine when Darwin's property or the human species for natural by natural selection there was a in popular culture there was.

36
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,000
A fight. Okay, what are the implications of that?

37
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:32,240
Because then that will imply or rather the one would the conflict or the consequence of that bubble theory is that we are related to other animals,

38
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,350
that we are in fact a evolved from other organisms.

39
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:46,520
Then there was a big fight on and Tom actually was was one of the value alleles that at that point for that theory for Darwin's theory,

40
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,320
they were friends then. He was a very good debater.

41
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:57,740
And then that reason is called Darwin's bulldog because one was one with that popularizers for the Darwin Theory,

42
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:09,350
another grandson of Thomas usually they thought in said I put it some he are some saying these in from from

43
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:19,760
British and the other thing is I'll give you what I write in I philosophize philosopher and wrote this book,

44
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,940
The Brave New World in 1932.

45
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:30,740
Had you read that book? I read it in English in class was a requirement in philosophy class.

46
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:43,640
And the book is about was writing that that year in 1932 was about in fact about genetic engineering was a science fiction book basically.

47
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:51,170
Was that history? Is that in some kind of future humans were going to have genetic engineering and

48
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:57,950
we are went to look a every 35 society based on genetics there would be some

49
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,089
person with better genes than other with or with buddy and what that same

50
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,860
picture book and then what are philosophical and cultural implications of that.

51
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:16,790
Wow. But it is happening now. The cloning is is soon after that cloning cloning, cloning.

52
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,830
Yet now that we are able to clone is with having clone any human they have.

53
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:31,490
But yes, there are several ethical considerations to take into account that we are able to arm to modify our genome.

54
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:39,400
Oh, yeah. Now then if you have time, I recommend this we get reading that this bill,

55
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:49,690
this book in that you see this movie Gattaca that I think is that in fact is basically the same story based on words from 1997.

56
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,440
I a good movie. You have time to look into that movie. Yeah.

57
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,420
Your free time when you are not doing homework done is done in four days.

58
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:06,580
Okay, then let's continue with our killers. Yet that was our safety story.

59
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,700
Okay, this is important. Don't worry here about the equation here.

60
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:18,760
What a wonderful way to understand the concept, because that will be important to understand the evolution of our brain size.

61
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:25,930
Now, again, they say that the male fetal crop here, we had that development.

62
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,310
Then what happens is that when they are born, both kill us.

63
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,930
They are small killers, small claws. However.

64
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:49,170
When they start to grow during development, one of the pillars grow faster than the rest of the body.

65
00:08:51,450 --> 00:09:03,180
And that is called and that's that that trait, the wound up part can grow in a faster pace, even at slower pace we will see.

66
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,710
But is that difference of growth of parts related to that body?

67
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:17,759
Then if we graph these again in the X-axis, we have the body size, logarithmic scale in that white axis,

68
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:28,380
we have the size of the La Chela that if they grow to the same rate, then we will respect the size of that killer to be in this line.

69
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:36,030
This is assuming that that killer and that of the body growth rate and this is what is called when we have an adult.

70
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:43,200
And again, don't worry about this question too much. You have to look in this part of what we call the elementary coefficient alpha.

71
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:52,170
Then if alpha is equal to one, then we have what we call isometric growth because they grow to the same rate.

72
00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:00,240
Now in this particular example, for the large killer alpha, if in fact higher than one,

73
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:09,390
and this is called hyper elementary growth, because we grow into a faster rate compared to the rest of the body.

74
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,350
Also, it's possible that we can have cable elementary growth rate.

75
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,960
That is the part put off to a slower rate.

76
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:31,080
Okay then just remember what is the elementary coefficient and what means half having isometric height, problematic or hyper isometric?

77
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,500
Girls, do you have any question?

78
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:39,710
Please stop me anytime. In humans.

79
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,310
In fact, we hear about two organs.

80
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:51,280
Our heart broke to that same rate, that rest of our body.

81
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,420
Here again, we had the body size, you know, global human scale.

82
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:06,370
We had the organ size and grams. And again, you know, nobody's doing a scale import, but we had our heart in red.

83
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:14,800
We had, in fact, the head. You'll see that the heart grows more or less at the same rate at that rest of the body.

84
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,920
The heart is growing as a isometric organ compared to the rest of the body.

85
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,910
I work head out and we are born.

86
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,810
We are born with a big head relative to the rest of our body.

87
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:36,160
But when we grow, our head is growing slower compared to the rest of the body.

88
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:47,590
Then you will see in the adult, the size of the head is relatively smaller compared to the head of a baby relative to the rest of the body.

89
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:58,430
Okay. Then we use this time of off comparisons of animated comparison between the species.

90
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,550
Then here we have different species of butterflies.

91
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:11,720
Then in the in the left size, we have two species if species A and a, species B,

92
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:22,399
and you'll see that they say What we are comparing here is our wing size to the rest of the body than what you observe in the field,

93
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:29,660
that if you're comparing a species, A and B, how it is the size of the wings compare to the rest of the volume.

94
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,600
You think there's a log on? The log is linear.

95
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:48,030
Is linear yet because we're conforming to the log in scale. But proportionally, which species had that lagers flies.

96
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:55,630
Sorry. That I guess we. What is proportionally proportionally?

97
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,550
Which species? A or B has the larger wings?

98
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:14,019
A Exactly. You see, if I for anybody size proportionally the wings of it because eight are going to be bigger than that.

99
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,450
Wings of this piece of meat. Hmm.

100
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:29,470
Now is possible that we cannot defend this lobes then in this case for ethnicity that is showing hypothalamus regrowth of that wings,

101
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,630
you'll see that slope is higher than one. The dramatic coefficient higher.

102
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:44,070
Higher than one. Then guess because the the larger the body size, the larger proportionally the wings.

103
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:52,240
And then, for example, maybe for the small body size that wings are going to be, let's say just 25% of the body size,

104
00:13:53,050 --> 00:14:01,870
but for a larger body size, that wings are going to be 50% or 60%, then they proportionally grow faster.

105
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:12,930
Let's see that hyper isometric growth like anything because e here are that you'll see that proportionally that wings are getting

106
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:21,220
smaller compared to the rest of the body because that wings are growing in a slower rate compared to the rest of the body.

107
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:29,080
Then the larger the body size, the smaller that wings relative to the rest of the body.

108
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:36,700
Yes, Professor, it's like a chicken. The body is become bigger, but the wing, they cannot fly like regular birds anymore.

109
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,660
The chicken could be that if they get to this ball in proportion to the body that

110
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,230
we know able to fly and what actually control in a genetics like the speed.

111
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,140
Yes, that's a good question. There are some genes that are golden.

112
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,090
There are several genes. They are some genes are called the whole meiotic.

113
00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:08,260
Genes that they regulate are where you put them part of the body, for example, in the fruit flies that people have virtually nothing in fruit fly.

114
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:15,670
In fact, you can modify these genes and you can make that rather to have, for example, a wing,

115
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,809
you can have a leg up in the system that we think your hormones that fight the

116
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:28,690
gene the that the mutations are for the PCC you will see that the wings they will

117
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:33,820
be they all were they had that same proportion of body size to the body because

118
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:41,640
we have a isometric world of basically adding what is ice altimetry coefficient.

119
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:48,130
Mm hmm. Okay, now let's see what why this is important for that.

120
00:15:48,250 --> 00:16:04,630
What are we on with our brain? Now here, if you we are comparing brain size or different mammals that age hog the you got Lego and you want humans.

121
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,100
During human evolution in February during mammal evolution.

122
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:22,750
Danielle Cortex The the most older part of the brain have been growing the part that had been growing more.

123
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:30,330
We have been now an expansion of Daniel Cortex and then in the Delta neocortex,

124
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,410
then we are going to have this kind of folding to allow for cortex growth.

125
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:42,310
Then view you're using in humans that are we have this kind of folding to allow for that.

126
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:52,350
We're also Daniel Cortex. And again, these are comparing activity in primates, say Mary, macaque, chimpanzee and humans.

127
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:58,880
And you'll see that we have the growth of the neocortex leading to folding now.

128
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,920
Okay. We will discuss that, the implication of this a little bit later.

129
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:15,790
Now. But what is quite interesting and this is comparing the growth or the different parts

130
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:22,320
of the neocortex that gray matter and the white matter compared to that brain size.

131
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,060
What do you observe here? In this line, we have that white matter.

132
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:34,260
In this line, we had that gray matter pool growing faster relative to the rest of the brain.

133
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,950
White matter. Think white matter? Yes.

134
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:43,350
You see the hybrids. One reason that is a gray matter is outside.

135
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,290
We will see that right in in a few slides.

136
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:55,680
Then you'll see that the white matter has a high isometric role of coffee table 1.24 compared to the rest of the brain.

137
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:03,930
Then that white matter is growing faster compared to direct with that of the brain during hemoglobin.

138
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:11,940
And that gray matter has to more or less isometric isometric coefficient.

139
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:17,400
You'll see that alpha is close to one is growing more or less to the same rate at the rest of the brain.

140
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:19,830
Then this.

141
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:31,080
Then what are the implication with these that than your cortex expansion during our evolution as being mostly due to expansion of the white matter.

142
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:46,660
Okay. What that is important and this is related to what is great and what is white matter.

143
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,710
Okay? This is a neural this is the cell body.

144
00:18:52,160 --> 00:19:01,360
We've got these long axons where they communicate with their neurons across these axon terminals.

145
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,400
Now, also, we are going to discuss their myelin damage.

146
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:10,090
These are proteins.

147
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,830
It's a complex plotting around the are the axons.

148
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:21,490
And they allow for passive communications of individuals impulses for faster communication.

149
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,610
We are going to see after these goals today the growth of the myelin.

150
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:36,820
Then if we do a transversal cut across the brain, like in these figures here,

151
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:44,860
then that gray matter is just the other part and the white matter in that internal part.

152
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:55,050
Now remember that white matter at the accent are communicating with other neurons.

153
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,299
Then an expansion of the white matter. What do you think?

154
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,920
What that would imply? What that means. Oh, faster.

155
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,470
More communication. Yeah, more communications among newsrooms.

156
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:22,200
When you hear the neurons more firing and then put on there more complexity because we are going to have our here are complex networks of neurons.

157
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:31,070
Then again, remember that gray matter is that body, that a body that neurons and white matter are the axis.

158
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:43,480
They are communicating with other neurons. Now you fact this is comparing humans she found as small monkeys and humans.

159
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:56,860
I went white mother. You saw about 40% of the total brain volume compared to that chimp, like just about maybe around 25%.

160
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,010
20%. And it's more monkeys less than that.

161
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:09,730
Then you see that in humans again during evolution, comparing with against primates,

162
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:17,620
the expansion of that brain as being in May of part due to the expansion or the white the matter.

163
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:37,230
Q Yes, yes. Inhumans are the expansion or the brain size as being mostly due to the expansion of white matter.

164
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,960
No. Of course you're going to let primates. They have been weak for you.

165
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,240
These are fears here. Also, they had been expanding their brain.

166
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:58,360
They had been expanding white matter. But in humans, this is still a higher growth.

167
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:16,570
This. Then to summarize these parks being, as we said, would be brains like the great apes, great big our chimpanzee gorilla would on down.

168
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:29,960
We also humans the cortex becomes and remember the cortex the the other part of the brain becomes larger,

169
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:36,720
the proper family larger as compared to that rest of the brain. Now what?

170
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:42,799
Except for some comparison, that undisciplined the the the overall cerebral cortex comparing, for example,

171
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:51,440
mice and humans in humans, the cerebral cortex is about 80% of the brain size compared to mice, only 40%.

172
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:00,900
And the point I made before that this process of growth of that cortex for neo

173
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:08,520
cortical ization is mainly due to the expansion of the actual mass or white matter.

174
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:21,150
Remember, because these actions are communicating between neurons, that is going to facilitate what we call global communication across the brain.

175
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:26,730
Then we can have neurons in different parts of the brains communicating with other neurons.

176
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:46,990
In fact, the iPhone theory does say that our of consciousness is just a function of the ability of our brain to do these global communications.

177
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:56,930
Professor. Mm hmm. You're saying that when people part of the brain is damaged and that over time we notice that that part,

178
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,680
some other part of the brain started to do what? That part that was damaged.

179
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,190
Hmm. Is. Is doing the functions. Yeah.

180
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,570
There could be some routing to the external communications.

181
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:16,590
Yeah. I don't know anything about that with yet, but I have read that when some parts are damaged or that part and take the function.

182
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:28,080
I don't know how severe or for example, is the most severe cases or cerebral damage does severe damage that can't be done.

183
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:32,940
The function is completely missing though, is like a cut off or somehow.

184
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:39,900
But that child start to show functionalities of what that brain supposed to do that that's missing.

185
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:45,170
Hmm. Question So far, no.

186
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:55,410
Okay. Here, then. What I want to make clear is that, again, the expansion of the brain at all is mainly due to the expansion into cerebral cortex.

187
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:00,180
That inside the cerebral cortex is mostly due to the white matter.

188
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,260
Now let's see a little bit about more about this expansion of the prefrontal cortex.

189
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,860
Right. The neocortex.

190
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,410
Yes, neocortex. Neocortex is a part of the cortex, sometimes cerebral cortex.

191
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,160
Is that part of the series? It's part of the cerebral cortex.

192
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:31,310
Now, I think as Daniel Cortex has been expanding, of course, the cortex also has been expanded.

193
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:43,740
But then the neocortex is where we know that the function is mostly related to cognitive capabilities, emotions and speech.

194
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:54,120
Then I get that neocortex part of the cortex, and now we're going to talk more about it specifically, more about the prefrontal cortex.

195
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:59,550
I think the part that is more related to our cognitive abilities.

196
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,520
Now, these are a few you'll have to show you some parts of the cortex.

197
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,230
Oh we have the the in green here.

198
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:22,300
No rider in blue is a blue wall. And I don't this part of frontal cortex in green.

199
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:30,760
We don't know exactly that potential in these part. And yellow these are related to are frontal two motor functions movement.

200
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,440
And here in the back is the primary cortex.

201
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:47,620
Now the prefrontal cortex, the prefrontal cortex is, again, the part more related to cognitive functions.

202
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,840
Yes. Now.

203
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,010
Okay, these graphics are a little bit busy, but Lamy is venue.

204
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:07,840
What is happening here? Now what they do here, they compare sizes of the comparing.

205
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:13,990
For example, you see here in this graph we had a primary cortex, visual cortex.

206
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:20,350
Yeah, we had a pre-frontal cortex. And they compare different sizes in different primates.

207
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:27,300
Then the whites here, they represent humans that, Gray said, but they represent great apes,

208
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:34,060
primates, orangutan, chimpanzee and gorilla, and the black circles they represent again, primates.

209
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:39,490
But is more. No, no, no. Great ape, not what we saw.

210
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:49,780
What we see here is that prefrontal cortex compare to either primary or fixed or motor areas.

211
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:55,540
They are growing in humans and also in great ape primates.

212
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:07,990
Now, what I want here to just to make the point and again, don't don't maybe get worry about this particular graph,

213
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,300
but by comparing these sizes that different parts of the cortex,

214
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:20,740
we are able to estimate a period of times when the prefrontal cortex,

215
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:29,110
how squirrel's beki feels based on this analysis that the prefrontal cortex has several times during evolution,

216
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:37,690
then if there was a first expansion between 30 to 20 million medium to use that well and this is

217
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:47,740
more or less with that origin with uprisings without you feel that there was another expansion

218
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,639
around 1915 millions millions of years ago and you see more with the line planet that the line

219
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:03,880
leading to great apes and humans remember great apes our chimpanzee gorilla an orangutan.

220
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,510
Then there is another expansion between 8 to 6 million of use that well.

221
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,380
And this is the line connecting humans and chimpanzees.

222
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:22,879
And after that you feel that there is another expansion that is just particular vacuum

223
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,740
cleaners between six and we don't use that well that's starting 6 million years

224
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,389
ago up there that the emergence of that human lineage and that chimpanzee then you'll

225
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:39,140
see here that really has been this round of cerebral expansions in the primates,

226
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:43,249
not only in humans, but also other primates. They have been this expansion.

227
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:47,270
But in humans, the only thing you do humans have have more expansions.

228
00:29:50,380 --> 00:30:05,450
What question? Now, again, if we compare that defense prefrontal cortex, remember the prefrontal cortex,

229
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:09,559
is that part related to cognitive function compared to primary cortex.

230
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,590
You'll see that in humans and these are different species of brightness.

231
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,450
And the and we have that the our species,

232
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:29,150
we have chimpanzees and you'll see that in humans the frontal cortex is larger compared to the visual cortex, also compared to the motor areas.

233
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,069
But the motor areas and the visual cortex,

234
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:42,890
the at about the same in humans are not to another primate then that part that is being growing in the frontal cortex again,

235
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:50,660
that part more related to cognitive functions. Questions.

236
00:30:54,950 --> 00:31:03,380
Now I want to talk this about this in my reality myelination in the we found that human Neal neocortex.

237
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,679
Now remember again,

238
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:16,070
I want to go back to the people that myelin are this complex problem that are surrounding the axon to allow for faster communications.

239
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:34,350
However, are our neurons when we are born or during that brain development are that we start without myelin.

240
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:41,130
Myelin, the myelin is that too far to do that?

241
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:46,830
My initial starts also keeps going during development.

242
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:58,470
Now let me explain this in more detail. Here we are comparing myelination in humans, as you can see,

243
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:06,630
and the fitting ages are this study was done throughout, trying to compare at different ages.

244
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,440
Then for humans we have an infant bitten by one year.

245
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:20,489
These are cuts section of the brain that would be more or less if we try to compare

246
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:25,230
to the same age and development will be at chimpanzee frequency around two years.

247
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:35,459
At B we have juvenile between three and I use chimpanzee would be about 5 to 6 year C is an

248
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:45,120
adolescent for human between they defined 13 to 2314 for chimpanzee about 9 to 11 useful.

249
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:50,670
At the end we have adult both in human chimpanzee.

250
00:32:51,390 --> 00:33:00,510
What do you observe here? I don't know whether it is clear from the back, but if you compare the bottom part,

251
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:07,470
the of chimpanzee a human, you notice any difference of these pictures.

252
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:18,750
It's a density. The density is of the color here that quarter by quarter because the accurate could be misleading.

253
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:30,640
Misleading. I guess I don't know whether that figure is clear, but I think in this part, for example,

254
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,010
let's focus on that in this column that one day suddenly you see your you're

255
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:42,310
thing and you see that chimpanzee analyzing whether you can hear and hear.

256
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:48,640
Do you see any different but above the lines.

257
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,960
Exactly the lines you see there in that chimpanzee. We have this line here.

258
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:58,000
Yes. That they are they are in humor. We have some. But I don't know if they're completely for them.

259
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,420
And what do you think? Are these lines? Are those crinkles?

260
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:05,019
I'm not sure. Oh, nerves. Yes, they are.

261
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:08,160
Smiley leaves. Remember, mayonnaise? Yes.

262
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:20,290
Represent the actual round in the sense. Then what we are observing here is that the end chimpanzee that Madeleine Maria indignation

263
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:27,340
is starts early in life and he feels that during adolescence is completely stopped.

264
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:33,130
All the male initiation is had ready for him and that is not part of myelination.

265
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,460
However, in humans we see that we are born with just a few myelin.

266
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:47,620
We have some formation of myelin by still as an adult adult we don't have complete myelination.

267
00:34:51,080 --> 00:35:02,480
What do you think are the implications of that? Any suggestion, any guests that we asked John about our foreign mining?

268
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:10,890
Shannon Mullen. It's like, isn't it like that and that kind of like.

269
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:20,440
It surrounds the acquisition. Mm hmm. If we have less myelin, then we're going to have greater signaling compared to.

270
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:26,780
A chimpanzee. Right. Like, if we have less money, it would have less because we have less myelin, right?

271
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:34,910
Yes. These are stages that are. Yes. Compared to a chimpanzee, we have less myelin, so we're going to have greater signaling compared to them.

272
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,150
Okay. The myelin, rather, helps for faster communication.

273
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:51,890
Yeah, that's what I get. Yes. However, however, if we still don't have myelin that allows for formation of connection between neurons,

274
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:56,780
this is out then because we already have myelin somehow dumb.

275
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:04,610
I didn't really see the more mature and connection that already form when we don't still have myelin.

276
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,560
It's like the neurons are still making connections.

277
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:12,430
It's not in connection with the neurons. They know their work.

278
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:19,890
Yes. Professor, can you can we take take a step back what the adult for human is?

279
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,749
I mean, how long do we live compared to chimpanzee? Are we?

280
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:31,040
You know, we went to longevity, but we live much more than a year before our development phase is stretched out.

281
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:38,930
Exactly. Yeah. We have another lecture about developmental plasticity, how our the stages of our life have evolved,

282
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:45,140
including life shall hold, you know, even longevity, older life.

283
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:55,430
Another question the speed of development of myelin is encoded in DNA or by stimulation of the environment.

284
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:02,750
Hmm. Good question. I think both. Again, I don't know a lot of about brain development.

285
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:09,890
That's not my expertize, but I imagine that would be in part genetics.

286
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:18,890
And I think that the environment would be so much better mental factor that can be part of this growth or related or rather accelerated.

287
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,500
Okay. Again, then the implication of this is that our growth,

288
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:31,850
our brain is map use is still in development even as an adolescent, as an adult compared to a chimpanzee.

289
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,980
Now, let me explain. You live here.

290
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:45,350
These are different regions of that will die cortex. Comparing again my administration inhumanity.

291
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:51,890
You can see them different colors.

292
00:37:53,270 --> 00:38:01,600
Red, black with what we call that to my sense or somatosensory these are more the

293
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:12,440
the related to the touch to the type of or signaling related than motor parts.

294
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:21,890
Yellow the front of the frontal cortex and and blue part and you see on humans and you see a chimpanzee.

295
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,620
Now again, what do you do if it engages and if it engages?

296
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:34,590
Just look into the. What getting at.

297
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:40,460
What is your impression here again comparing humans and chimpanzee regarding the developmental.

298
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:54,920
My own decision. They think peak at like ten years old.

299
00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:00,890
Exactly. We see that and we see then chimpanzee like our ten year old, more or less.

300
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:05,690
They look at the flat. They are no more mired in recession humans.

301
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:13,260
If you saw Peter Chiarelli say you'll flood bye bye after that, as an adolescent, it started to grow.

302
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:18,140
My administration, you see, they see that there is modernization going on.

303
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:28,640
So now they're saying, you know, these are like in the percentage of maximal modernization, comparing sympathy and humans and if hitting ages.

304
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,100
And again, the adolescent and adolescent and young adult in humanity in this bar.

305
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:44,090
As you can see. Adolescent. Yes. You'll see that as chimpanzee, as an adult is in almost 100% or majority said it's done and.

306
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,640
As a human, only about maybe a little more than a half, 50%, 50%.

307
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,510
We still have my niece still going on a summer doing a lot.

308
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,510
And again, that is going to help for making more connections between neurons.

309
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,710
Mm hmm. Another question. When do they mature?

310
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:11,630
Like mating? Where. Where is the chimpanzee?

311
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,990
Yeah. Where they are fertilized. Fertile.

312
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,370
Yeah. Oh, good question.

313
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,610
I'm going to get back to that. Okay. So for humans. Yeah.

314
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:29,210
When? During the teenage years. Yeah. Mm hmm. It will be like children.

315
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:41,390
Mm hmm. 30% less I.Q. because, you know, I started doing Talk Back of realizing there is not so good development doing those between ten and 20.

316
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:48,290
Okay, then at that point, they were not going to make really handicapped humans one better chimpanzee.

317
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:52,520
I would imagine, he said. Will take some more time. They are more forgiving.

318
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:56,690
I thought your book. No.

319
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:06,280
In summary, my research is not only a problem in private or mammalian impact, these are subset of invertebrate collaborative brains.

320
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,750
However, in humans,

321
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:19,160
we humans are born with fewer myelinated axons going back to chimpanzees and that growth of malady prolonged well beyond adolescence.

322
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:26,600
Even though we saw in that video that even I thought you were an. We have my administration going on now.

323
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:35,810
The extended mindedness only humans may contribute to making new connections between neurons with greater plasticity.

324
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:47,150
Oh, now the iPhone series Dance Dance Theory does say that these period of formation of connection between our neurons,

325
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:55,820
these periods of essential is more sensitive period for developmental mental diseases like schizophrenia.

326
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:02,960
Fears have again this period of mildness when they think human is more extend.

327
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:10,490
These are sensitive period for development of mental diseases like schizophrenia.

328
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,260
There is a theory going on that maybe these helpful side effect,

329
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:26,599
side effect of our higher developmental mental plasticity in the brain and the actual maybe has regarding that but examples they are psychiatric.

330
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:32,510
This is said that they the onset beautiful time during adolescence our early adulthood.

331
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:42,890
We know they are areas that schizophrenia is associated with a normal myelin stage of the cortical white matter.

332
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:50,330
Then then they see that type of trade off that we would usually observe during he what we feel.

333
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:56,090
We have another potential in this case of our brain.

334
00:42:56,090 --> 00:43:03,440
There's more time to develop what we think the advantages before, but by the way,

335
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:13,130
to have our brain more taking more time to develop because you can imagine the drawbacks even without even let's say,

336
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,820
let's say, let's say psychiatric diseases.

337
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:22,960
But even you can imagine that we are more depending from our partners for mankind.

338
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:30,540
Then you can imagine that our ancestors went to duckweed.

339
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:40,400
They they were more to depend on that pattern they than Marble Network or like what do you think are the advantages of.

340
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:49,190
Anyone in the market in any way to back connections.

341
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:53,770
And the more connections you have, the more you can have.

342
00:43:55,790 --> 00:44:01,750
So like I say. In your case, you already have those pathways in place.

343
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:12,440
It's easier. And then when you get older, it's like. Utilizing creating those new.

344
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:23,070
As your brains are. Mm hmm.

345
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:31,920
Yeah. Yeah, I think because it is not.

346
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:38,440
Yeah, exactly. And you need to imagine that. What, on first and only our our talk about what ancestor they live in in groups.

347
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:46,410
Hmm. They look. They live in groups. They didn't the, the children they need to learn skills.

348
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:52,560
Mhm. But example you can imagine that they need for example how to harm or how to,

349
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,640
when they were comfortable that they and how to distinguish between poisonous and non poisonous plants that,

350
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:08,640
that, that type of learning that happened during life and that is passed from generation to generation and that requires cognitive skills.

351
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:16,080
The teachers say this about what did you say earlier about self-conscious?

352
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:25,860
Yeah, they are. So there is a big discussion about what is conscious, consequential senior class consciousness in humans.

353
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,579
Consciousness is where it's coming from.

354
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:42,060
The brain is full and then some purely proposal digest all the complex networking of our neural that gave origins to our consciousness.

355
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:49,320
So in terms of Sorry, I know you can't make new neurons, but can you make the pathways?

356
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:59,010
And is this like myelination being kind of like solidifying as hardening in pathways or is it like you can still see?

357
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,410
Yes. And again, this is I think you can create new pathways.

358
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:09,389
You're older. The yet the older you get the get harder.

359
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:19,560
But I still think that that we as an adult were capable and able to learn then that implies making new connection in a pathway to become more

360
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:29,910
neurons then are let me I'm going to get back to the next class to have more information about that because really that's an interesting topic.

361
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:38,420
Hmm. Mm hmm.

362
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:46,690
So and so, like with psychiatric diseases like schizophrenia, where you have, like, hallucinations.

363
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:59,110
Mm hmm. Psychosis. So they had, like, low or lower or, like, higher myelination in the in the in that area of the brain.

364
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,620
I guess that in effect, yes. It's like let me get back to.

365
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:10,659
Really? Yeah, these are normal. But I don't know whether I don't know what developed is like to be advantageous.

366
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:18,070
But some people it can be with certain, like, neurological disorders.

367
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:24,850
Mm hmm. Like your brain changes as you get older and it can be disadvantageous.

368
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:34,450
Exactly. Well, as we get older, eventually with, ah, we have declining with our cognitive capacities,

369
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:47,740
but also from the point of view of natural selection is like, I want you all and you are already reproduce, then there's nothing matter what you have.

370
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:51,220
This happened to you because you are ready by the European to the next generation.

371
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:58,480
Where went to this that in in the lecture about it. Very quick.

372
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:04,540
Mm hmm. I have a client who has schizophrenia. Mm hmm. You know, just reduce the toxicity in his brain.

373
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:06,510
He became more or less right.

374
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:16,720
That is that I don't think was passed on genes as he just had syphilis make him his connection is that there's too much luminance

375
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:25,580
and I know that there are certain genes so we could get the country to that effect or to psychiatric diseases like free.

376
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:32,430
I remember I, I didn't make any sort of any dumb paper or I when I went with my master's thesis.

377
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:39,370
I don't know that other or there are other diseases that also have a genetic component, but of course, could be mental.

378
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:48,460
I remember. I would. Great. They are not only genetics. There is a complex of interaction between environment and behavior or even our life history.

379
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:55,280
Okay, now this is related. Do you remember what is in the any name is the only anyone?

380
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:00,069
Do you remember what is in the open? That salamander yet the salamander.

381
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:04,060
Remember what happened with that salamander?

382
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:07,719
It couldn't. It didn't grow up.

383
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:13,140
So I was just stuck in the juvenile hall like a child.

384
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:25,660
Yes, yes. But not the salamander gets to adult that the attorney that they are that the the salamander retain certain juvenile features.

385
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:33,010
But I've heard if you've taken that if they were confused by that speech to the Salamander because yeah,

386
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:39,220
they thought that was a juvenile and they took it out of the water and lost its features.

387
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:46,659
Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Because I used that, that retention and juvenile trait, however it is an adult is an adult,

388
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:51,130
but they are certain trait that they that they remain that you doing that features.

389
00:49:52,750 --> 00:50:01,390
And again remember I'm going now to make that connection with humans because we can measure gene expression they can them off our genes.

390
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:11,590
As you know they are genes that are highly bred during childhood or in a little bit they change expression in our life or if at all,

391
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,200
in response to environmental factors.

392
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:26,920
This tree is now here we have a comparison of gene expression in that in the brain, in humans, chimpanzees are not die rhesus monkey.

393
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:39,669
They are directed at human. Then they are 30 and here in that in exactly we have a year so that if within in samples that they put in subjects what

394
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:48,600
and what we observe that there are certain genes in humans that in in the adult and this is almost a middle aged adult

395
00:50:49,030 --> 00:51:00,399
for the middle forties is to the action you said young aspirations but they are more similar to that juvenile to that

396
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:08,350
kid compared to other primates you see for example in simple and there is absolutely a race on the gene aspiration.

397
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:14,830
But in humans, in an adult, there is still an increase of these particular genes, but in that is lower rate.

398
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:23,950
Now they are older genes. That is rather the contrary, that there is an acceleration and kicking aspiration in humans.

399
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:31,510
Also there are certain genes in that chimpanzee that age or acceleration compared to humans.

400
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:34,770
Other monkeys are full of thorium.

401
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:45,060
On paper, humans are rhesus monkey, but again, they are older genes in the chimpanzee that they don't remain more or less.

402
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:52,590
And I think they realized that, you know. Now there was a huge comparison, 1000 genes.

403
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:59,100
Then what is important from this analysis that they analyzed more than 3000 genes at most.

404
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:02,640
You'll see the figure most of the points are in this category.

405
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:11,650
Most of the difference looking inspiration in the brain comparing humans and chimpanzees was in that Neal to any human

406
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:18,820
not any category meaning that genes that in humans the expression of the adult is similar to the separation or the key.

407
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:25,230
Again, these are genes that maybe with your finger is easier to do to see.

408
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,140
Most of the genes are here in this category.

409
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:43,019
They are these are genes that the expression in the adult in humans is more similar to the kid and to juvenile to children comparing,

410
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:49,770
for example, adult chimpanzee and the juvenile chimpanzee that you can see,

411
00:52:50,400 --> 00:53:02,250
you see that there is a lower rate of is raised on humans that is more or less like our brain retain certain traits from that infant,

412
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:08,540
at least from the administration point of view. So we are, Bob.

413
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:12,690
We are. Yes, that's.

414
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:26,490
That's a that's a huge implication that where you see this, even as a middle age person, we have our brains have certain infant traits.

415
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:36,360
I know what you mean. Chinese medicine. We say that the older you become, the more infant you become.

416
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,960
Because, like you were born. Yeah.

417
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:49,590
Is that true? Huh? I think it just has a different characteristics.

418
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:55,960
So older people and younger people both need diapers. Yeah, that's okay.

419
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:08,850
Any. Any question. Okay, now, let's let's do a five minute break, and then we will discuss the expensive tissue hypothesis.

420
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:15,810
Okay, I will. Let me 1/2. What's the recording of this?

421
00:54:31,787 --> 00:54:35,116
Okay. Now, the second part of that of today's lecture,

422
00:54:35,117 --> 00:54:45,587
we are going to discuss the expensive feature hypotheses that try to explain how the develop the enlargement of our brain happens during the audition.

423
00:54:46,697 --> 00:54:56,837
Now and this is the question, we know that the brain is a very expensive organ then.

424
00:54:56,867 --> 00:55:05,327
So how do you all wish all the extra energy has to come from one place?

425
00:55:06,287 --> 00:55:07,817
I imagine you have a budget,

426
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:19,027
then you have a certain amount of money that you are able to spend during the month thinking you have an extra you have an extra expenses.

427
00:55:19,627 --> 00:55:23,237
You will need to get that money from another place.

428
00:55:23,717 --> 00:55:31,667
Now, what are the alternative? Let's say you have a fixed budget month to month and you have an exact expense.

429
00:55:31,677 --> 00:55:41,717
What are the alternative that you have? Whether you do.

430
00:55:41,867 --> 00:55:47,987
You have an expressway, your car got robbed of money on something else.

431
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:52,897
Exactly. You can reallocate your, you know, your money. You can say, okay, I'm going to spend less.

432
00:55:53,597 --> 00:55:57,467
I don't know, going out and the air because I need to convert this.

433
00:55:58,007 --> 00:56:03,137
Or you can say I'm going to get an extra job to pay for that.

434
00:56:03,587 --> 00:56:11,807
Then those are the two options. You have a fixed budget, you just reallocate the money or you can get extra money.

435
00:56:11,987 --> 00:56:16,127
I increase your budget. Now the expensive teacher hypothesis.

436
00:56:17,117 --> 00:56:22,067
One of the major assumptions was that the budget was fixed.

437
00:56:23,537 --> 00:56:30,697
I wouldn't disclose what in the areas by budget it means that the total energy expenditure

438
00:56:31,447 --> 00:56:36,517
and also on or also that based on metabolic rate was constant during evolution.

439
00:56:36,787 --> 00:56:42,937
Therefore we need that reallocation of energy to allow for or for in an argument with the brain.

440
00:56:43,717 --> 00:56:48,307
Then just to give you an idea and you see the view that you have encompassing the whole page,

441
00:56:49,327 --> 00:56:57,667
you see how much of our resting energy is allocated to the brain in humans that are prime example meanings.

442
00:56:59,137 --> 00:57:14,317
In humans, it's estimated that our brain needs about a quarter 25% of the total energy in rest as comparison.

443
00:57:14,617 --> 00:57:21,367
Chimpanzee only needs about 9%. In eating baby.

444
00:57:21,367 --> 00:57:29,617
See human babies. The human baby can hear the brain uses almost 60% of that resting energy.

445
00:57:31,297 --> 00:57:34,057
Then we had that. We need that extra energy.

446
00:57:34,357 --> 00:57:46,117
Then the expensive hypothesis I can get anyone explaining to me more or less in summary, what the proposed how expensive to do hypothesis.

447
00:57:46,927 --> 00:57:57,097
I think you have it there, but don't look at it where the extra energy came from to allow for the for the brain in action according to the hypothesis.

448
00:57:58,967 --> 00:58:02,187
GI? Yes. Trapped in their organs?

449
00:58:02,637 --> 00:58:14,127
Exactly. Getting saturated by other organs, then left propelled by these two anthropologist Wheeler.

450
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:19,737
They say they see how fast brain is unexpectedly an expensive organ.

451
00:58:20,517 --> 00:58:26,727
And they assume and I feel at that time the evidence points to that the baseline metabolic rate.

452
00:58:26,997 --> 00:58:36,477
Let's see me that I'm on primates. Then therefore we have a constant metabolic rate that has to come from reallocation of resources.

453
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:45,987
And they propose and they propose that that extra resource that came from that reduced GI tract.

454
00:58:47,877 --> 00:58:51,567
Therefore, our ancestors, our common ancestor, traded brain for guts.

455
00:58:52,227 --> 00:59:01,677
Now I went to I want to see that that could be in part one of the pathway, one of the Apollo, the evolutionary pathway.

456
00:59:01,677 --> 00:59:09,777
They also allow for induction with the brain. But this domain is not mainly the only pathway or even the major pathways.

457
00:59:09,987 --> 00:59:14,637
We will discuss that now. Then why?

458
00:59:17,127 --> 00:59:21,747
But also, you can imagine that getting a shorter GI tract can have problems during the old age.

459
00:59:23,307 --> 00:59:31,247
However, how our ancestors were able to cope with that shorter by truck cooking.

460
00:59:31,417 --> 00:59:42,747
Cooking? Exactly by cooking. And remember the evidence point the use of fire during a meal which only a starter

461
00:59:43,467 --> 00:59:48,536
that got a little more than one meal and use that in the past for the Homo erectus,

462
00:59:48,537 --> 00:59:56,307
maybe a little bit older on time, they more or less made sense.

463
00:59:56,877 --> 01:00:03,837
We need our large brain. The extra energy come from the reduced GI tract and cooking.

464
01:00:04,227 --> 01:00:10,587
Allow for that because then we need to short. We don't need a large truck to allow for the guest that just.

465
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:17,597
Now. And they showed these in the paper. They show these figures.

466
01:00:18,557 --> 01:00:24,977
And this is what will be the sizes of different organs in humans.

467
01:00:25,517 --> 01:00:32,207
If we have the same proportion as an old primate, then this is the expected.

468
01:00:34,427 --> 01:00:39,227
Then the aspect that we will have, that large GI tract is more brain.

469
01:00:40,097 --> 01:00:45,767
But in fact what we are observing is that would have a large brain, a smaller gut.

470
01:00:46,367 --> 01:00:50,237
And that difference and the other organs, they remain more or less about the same.

471
01:00:51,017 --> 01:01:02,057
Therefore, they conclude on the whole, they propose the reduction of the enlargement of the brain, well facilitated by the reduction of the GI tract.

472
01:01:02,327 --> 01:01:09,467
That has benefited your hypothesis. Now what is the evidence?

473
01:01:11,537 --> 01:01:15,317
Why did the evidence for this for these hypotheses now?

474
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:31,186
One prediction or the hypothesis is how will be the correlation of the brain less eye,

475
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:37,427
less eye to brain size in different species, in primates, in mammals, including humans.

476
01:01:38,117 --> 01:01:42,437
And I do that correlation of brain size versus other organs.

477
01:01:42,977 --> 01:01:48,107
Yes, absolutely. I mean, I try adipose tissue.

478
01:01:48,617 --> 01:01:53,867
What would you expect to be the correlation, positive and negative if this hypothesis is true?

479
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:07,267
The larger the brain. How will be the other organs as monitor exactly when to speak a negative correlation?

480
01:02:07,867 --> 01:02:10,476
Usually. Yep. If the hypothesis is true.

481
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:20,317
Assuming that the hypothesis is true, the larger the brain, the smaller you'll have organs that's will see this then that there is.

482
01:02:20,317 --> 01:02:30,967
This analysis was done in a hundred mammals, different mammals and 23 primates, including humans,

483
01:02:31,777 --> 01:02:38,677
and they calculated the correlation coefficient rather between the brain and the feeding organs.

484
01:02:39,937 --> 01:02:46,777
Then basically what we observe here is a positive correlation, even hijacking for body size.

485
01:02:46,777 --> 01:02:53,257
This is adjusting for body size because you can imagine you have a large body size, then all the organs are going to be positively correlated.

486
01:02:54,757 --> 01:03:02,327
Then even after adjustment for body size, brain size seems to be positively correlated with other organs.

487
01:03:03,517 --> 01:03:16,087
If we see the GI tract neck already is high, the correlation non-significant then if indeed this result contradict that expensive hypothesis.

488
01:03:17,497 --> 01:03:23,917
Because what these results are telling us is that yes, the brain has a role, but all the other organs.

489
01:03:27,167 --> 01:03:40,917
During all, we feel that where this extra energy came from, if we if we don't have a fixed metabolic budget during evolution.

490
01:03:52,517 --> 01:03:56,327
I remember the question I asked you at the beginning of the second part.

491
01:03:57,737 --> 01:04:04,547
You said availability increase. Did you have an extra expense and that maybe you can get more resources excited,

492
01:04:04,547 --> 01:04:11,387
more resource on next job or do something extra to get extra money then that that things will happen here.

493
01:04:11,507 --> 01:04:16,097
That is an extra expense to allow for the evolution of the brain size.

494
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:19,967
Then the organism is going to need more energy for that.

495
01:04:21,167 --> 01:04:24,647
Okay. This is again. Yeah. The correlation between that different parts of the brain.

496
01:04:24,797 --> 01:04:32,237
If I thought that brain was negatively correlated with adipose tissue but positive with other organs, this is the data from the previous table.

497
01:04:32,627 --> 01:04:36,657
But in a nice fit. You. Now.

498
01:04:37,287 --> 01:04:45,867
Then you can imagine that there are different pathways for them that their native will allow for for this extra energy to allow for the large brain.

499
01:04:46,137 --> 01:04:52,427
Now. We have been discussing the changing energy allocation.

500
01:04:52,607 --> 01:05:00,316
That again is possible. Our full was allocation of resources across people within these two pathways.

501
01:05:00,317 --> 01:05:04,377
They are not mutually exclusive. Most likely they will.

502
01:05:04,397 --> 01:05:07,607
They would. They are. They happen. And maybe because they happen.

503
01:05:08,087 --> 01:05:14,207
And one important factor is that cost of locomotion.

504
01:05:16,907 --> 01:05:26,387
What you see in the water is when we are able to walk in our two legs compared to chimpanzee that you therefore flex.

505
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:35,387
One of the advantages of that at the from an energetic point of view is more efficient to walk in two legs.

506
01:05:36,857 --> 01:05:42,467
We spend less energy walking two legs that in forming like engine.

507
01:05:43,247 --> 01:05:48,347
Then there is less use of energy for locomotion.

508
01:05:49,187 --> 01:05:58,517
Also, we will discuss in the lecture about developmental plasticity that also our life history may have change.

509
01:05:59,597 --> 01:06:04,847
For example, we can. Growth is lower, we are already physical.

510
01:06:04,847 --> 01:06:09,527
The brain that are green, the brain keeps growing, the more time to grow.

511
01:06:10,517 --> 01:06:19,247
Also, we will discuss how we output during our evolution with the human species.

512
01:06:20,057 --> 01:06:27,197
We have delayed reproduction compared to other primate, not only mother societies about even our wet ancestor.

513
01:06:27,197 --> 01:06:31,487
They delay reproduction compared to other primates.

514
01:06:33,497 --> 01:06:48,647
Now that would imply that I where infant, child and adolescent stages they are longer compared to other primates,

515
01:06:49,907 --> 01:06:55,937
then it is possible to gain the water allocation of energy, reallocation of energy.

516
01:06:56,327 --> 01:07:02,927
But the other option, and again, these are not mutually exclusive explanation, by the way,

517
01:07:04,127 --> 01:07:10,867
better diet quality high than high calorie, high density calorie diet allow for cooking.

518
01:07:12,497 --> 01:07:20,357
Again, remember, not our ancestor doesn't ask us where we are.

519
01:07:22,127 --> 01:07:29,207
We live in society. We live in groups. Then you can imagine what ancestor they share food.

520
01:07:29,267 --> 01:07:41,027
They share energy. And there has to be some way is there if I went on first or they were require more energy.

521
01:07:41,627 --> 01:07:48,047
There has to be a way to establish this energy supply to avoid starvation.

522
01:07:49,077 --> 01:07:52,847
Then again, they are two different pathways that they are not mutually exclusive.

523
01:07:53,477 --> 01:07:56,897
Increasing energy input and the reallocation of energy.

524
01:07:59,317 --> 01:08:06,647
Welcome. Now then what is the evidence for these?

525
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:12,257
What is the evidence that we humans have that same metabolic rate as other primates?

526
01:08:12,767 --> 01:08:19,067
Because that was the big assumption or that explicit hypothesis that we had that same basal metabolic rate.

527
01:08:20,357 --> 01:08:29,986
Now what are the Aryan? So this is this is while the papers comparing are total energy expenditure against fat free

528
01:08:29,987 --> 01:08:38,207
mass in humans and different are all the primates are the chimpanzee gorilla and the orangutan.

529
01:08:40,097 --> 01:08:44,327
What do you observe here? Comparing humans to these solitary primates?

530
01:08:45,897 --> 01:08:51,437
I am into the. Exactly.

531
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:54,877
We have fat free mass and that white.

532
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:58,647
Actually, we have our total energy expended during kilocalories per day.

533
01:09:07,667 --> 01:09:22,037
In the five freedoms that we have, a higher t greater percentage of muscle like the mass that we have is correlated to our how many calories and burn.

534
01:09:22,307 --> 01:09:25,497
Exactly physical activity is in a higher rate.

535
01:09:25,517 --> 01:09:36,107
Our prime means that we yes we have a higher total energy expenditure giving that a fat free mass compared to other primates.

536
01:09:38,747 --> 01:09:44,837
In other words, we have a higher, faster metabolic rate compared to other primates.

537
01:09:47,447 --> 01:09:57,467
Then that is that showed that the assumption or the hypothesis was a fixed metabolic budget is not supported by various.

538
01:10:01,477 --> 01:10:06,277
Now in that same paper, Ben, they did a comparison.

539
01:10:06,517 --> 01:10:10,117
They are satisfied by six males and females.

540
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:17,527
These are predictive values based on some metabolic equation from data that they collected,

541
01:10:17,827 --> 01:10:25,027
because you see here that now the expected way for made for human men, women.

542
01:10:26,557 --> 01:10:31,267
Now let's explain the figure. Here we are in in yellow.

543
01:10:32,077 --> 01:10:37,807
We had the fat mass in kilograms in red.

544
01:10:39,187 --> 01:10:43,657
This darker red is not based on metabolic rate.

545
01:10:45,337 --> 01:10:51,307
And the total red dot the darker it the light red in the total energy expenditure.

546
01:10:52,627 --> 01:11:02,496
And again, what these results show is that humans, compared to other primates, the chimpanzee,

547
01:11:02,497 --> 01:11:10,087
gorilla and orangutan, we have a higher total energy expenditure and a higher basal metabolic rate.

548
01:11:11,377 --> 01:11:12,097
Now again,

549
01:11:12,577 --> 01:11:23,077
then this showed that our metabolism facilitated compared to other primates to allow for these extra energy to for the enlargement of the brain.

550
01:11:26,197 --> 01:11:32,167
Then the this assumption indispensability to hypothesis is not quite true.

551
01:11:35,497 --> 01:11:39,007
Do you find it convincing the hypothesis? No.

552
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:44,347
It sounds nice. Doesn't that sound nice?

553
01:11:44,997 --> 01:11:46,527
That makes sense.

554
01:11:47,997 --> 01:11:58,577
Now, I want to point out that the fact that we have a higher metabolic rate, that's a nice clue that there was maybe some reallocation of resources.

555
01:11:59,587 --> 01:12:08,847
Hmm. Okay, then I want to consider now this comparison of all based on metabolic rate and

556
01:12:08,847 --> 01:12:16,586
total energy expenditure showed that in the hominin lineage ring is large,

557
01:12:16,587 --> 01:12:19,917
meaning less may be the reason behind that.

558
01:12:20,517 --> 01:12:23,997
Whether we have more energy, we have more energy.

559
01:12:24,357 --> 01:12:31,827
We have more energy to expend. To spend. Yes. Because our our metabolism was assimilated compared to other primates.

560
01:12:32,857 --> 01:12:44,337
However, however, it's possible that there was a tradeoff, also reallocation of energy between organs, physiological functions.

561
01:12:46,047 --> 01:12:51,877
One of the questions in the previous homework was about that insulin resistance, remember?

562
01:12:51,907 --> 01:13:00,807
What are the advantages of insulin resistance? Insulin resistance works as a mechanism to reallocate energy from very fed up

563
01:13:00,827 --> 01:13:06,387
organs to more important organs like a brain or immune system during an infection.

564
01:13:07,227 --> 01:13:13,467
Then maybe insulin. Insulin resistance has something to do with the enlargement of that brain.

565
01:13:13,917 --> 01:13:17,067
In fact, we know that the brain doesn't need to use glucose.

566
01:13:21,027 --> 01:13:24,117
Now. How much was due to reallocation?

567
01:13:24,327 --> 01:13:31,977
We don't know. But it's possible that played a role. Now, there is also maybe a risk of this.

568
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:43,166
If the aliens show I would ancestor has a higher total energy expenditure.

569
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:52,527
They need more energy then they are in higher risk of starvation because they need more energy then they are high likelihood of energy shortfalls.

570
01:13:53,847 --> 01:14:00,147
Then I would insist. Or they needed to have different strategies to try to mitigate these risk.

571
01:14:01,017 --> 01:14:05,217
Now they are different strategies that you can imagine why it would sharing.

572
01:14:06,327 --> 01:14:11,307
We kept food between us when our sister did the same.

573
01:14:13,867 --> 01:14:18,387
Also there was folate allocated to make other walking efficiency.

574
01:14:18,627 --> 01:14:23,307
The fact that we walking two legs is a more efficient mechanism for walking for legs.

575
01:14:23,577 --> 01:14:31,587
We use less energy to do that. I know that our game is achieve that, that vitality even more energy than food, using,

576
01:14:31,587 --> 01:14:41,427
cooking or using or that type of energy rich food that got me to have these underground if starch organs.

577
01:14:43,557 --> 01:14:50,007
And again we would just call morning on a lecture that changing our life history, our development, that change.

578
01:14:52,317 --> 01:14:56,907
For example, our childhood is longer compared to chimpanzee.

579
01:14:57,387 --> 01:15:02,787
We have delayed reproduction not only in our society, also during our whole ritual.

580
01:15:03,117 --> 01:15:07,497
We have delayed reproduction to allow for this extra energy for other functions.

581
01:15:08,017 --> 01:15:12,957
We will discover more in developmental plasticity lecture. Now also,

582
01:15:13,287 --> 01:15:19,856
this is related to our longevity that we will discuss in next week how we change

583
01:15:19,857 --> 01:15:26,067
in our life history maybe have contributed to the extension of our lifespan.

584
01:15:29,977 --> 01:15:39,337
Question. Comments. Very interesting.

585
01:15:41,387 --> 01:15:46,367
They are to try to do it all just to have another more discussion.

586
01:15:52,187 --> 01:16:01,517
Then the first question. Well well, do you think the death benefit hypothesis is wrong?

587
01:16:02,237 --> 01:16:17,517
Right, or more or less in between? The hope that the expensive hypothesis that Plato for the brain, for the drug wrong.

588
01:16:18,117 --> 01:16:21,887
Veronica I mean, it makes sense because if.

589
01:16:24,047 --> 01:16:30,347
That was easier to digest. I think there's some truth to that.

590
01:16:31,677 --> 01:16:37,067
You know, we are eating lettuce. Like leaves like in.

591
01:16:39,467 --> 01:16:43,456
Mhm. Yep. Yes that's true.

592
01:16:43,457 --> 01:16:48,766
And I want to again to, to, to make the point that maybe these different pathways, they are complementary.

593
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:53,497
So is no one or the other. Mhm. And I think ah well that,

594
01:16:53,507 --> 01:17:04,367
that previous lecture we have found I fear where we see the da da da da da chief during our vote we should have been more or less correlated with uh,

595
01:17:04,817 --> 01:17:09,697
enlargement of the brain. Then again, goldfish correlation is not causation.

596
01:17:09,707 --> 01:17:20,317
Maybe that another common factor going on, but it's quite suggestive that these data redshift are being correlated with our brain enlargement.

597
01:17:20,687 --> 01:17:28,157
Now, however, because we have this extra energy, because our metabolic rate is faster than other primates,

598
01:17:29,387 --> 01:17:33,587
then maybe that extra energy play a bigger role to allow for the enlargement of the brain.

599
01:17:36,797 --> 01:17:43,367
I mean, also, as the brain enlarges and makes it easier to hide and you are able to think.

600
01:17:46,907 --> 01:17:51,977
Mm hmm. There's also, like, an advantage figure for me in terms of that.

601
01:17:54,177 --> 01:17:55,977
Yeah, exactly. I began to blame women.

602
01:17:56,197 --> 01:18:10,467
I say more complex behavior in societies and also living in society would imply that now we transmit that that knowledge from our next generations,

603
01:18:10,467 --> 01:18:12,416
and now we can rely on knowledge,

604
01:18:12,417 --> 01:18:20,067
not because you can imagine that during a well, you can look forward and say a certain knowledge was passed last April,

605
01:18:20,127 --> 01:18:28,077
parents to kids, even grandparents to our to grandsons, to the grandkids.

606
01:18:28,947 --> 01:18:33,597
But now we're able to pass knowledge from even generation that we are not going to tomorrow.

607
01:18:34,107 --> 01:18:38,007
If we write the book, someone in the future is going to write the book.

608
01:18:38,457 --> 01:18:43,106
Then our society has become more complex and then that would be one advantage of having these.

609
01:18:43,107 --> 01:18:50,817
Even these what we mentioned before, that what it's important that we have these learning skills, even the thunderbolt.

610
01:18:51,447 --> 01:18:55,526
And don't they seem like, I don't know, this is just something I heard that was done.

611
01:18:55,527 --> 01:19:02,587
But we are delaying our development more and more. Human populations, like before you were sending.

612
01:19:04,307 --> 01:19:10,867
Earlier on. I don't know if that. Having like an impact on like we are becoming more adaptive like the and.

613
01:19:11,667 --> 01:19:16,677
Plastic that does not and thus are good observation.

614
01:19:16,677 --> 01:19:26,037
And we will discuss the in developmental plasticity because yes, we are now it feels that even that we are okay with that.

615
01:19:26,127 --> 01:19:29,967
Let me let me play this little bit the.

616
01:19:31,177 --> 01:19:35,967
The mean life expectancy have changed over time.

617
01:19:36,357 --> 01:19:44,367
And in average people live now longer they say die a century live in a few decades ago.

618
01:19:44,847 --> 01:19:48,687
However, the maximum remains about the same.

619
01:19:50,007 --> 01:19:57,807
We have to imagine that you have a normal curve, these distributions, things like that, that that graph is moving to the right.

620
01:19:58,017 --> 01:20:02,427
But there is a maximum that we can go after that.

621
01:20:02,727 --> 01:20:15,717
The maximum size to we are 120 that yes a few person reached that age but related to like brain cells dying or a kidney or just like different things.

622
01:20:17,517 --> 01:20:20,697
Yet. Leave it to them. Yeah, anything.

623
01:20:23,937 --> 01:20:31,857
Now, let me summarize this, because people have investigated the genetics behind longevity.

624
01:20:33,147 --> 01:20:39,117
If there are genes related to longevity, I find that they are bodies in that they are more related to various all ages.

625
01:20:39,387 --> 01:20:39,927
For example,

626
01:20:39,937 --> 01:20:50,127
someone can reach out to 85 years right now because you can imagine someone now someone is more likely to survive for heart attack than before.

627
01:20:50,727 --> 01:20:54,707
So one is more more able to live with diabetes than before then.

628
01:20:57,307 --> 01:21:00,717
Given that modern medicine so can reach 85 years old.

629
01:21:00,957 --> 01:21:05,307
However richer handed or more, it indicts more genetics.

630
01:21:05,557 --> 01:21:14,787
Hmm. What is quite interesting, you can imagine someone reaching 100 years for it because he's able to survive chronic diseases.

631
01:21:14,867 --> 01:21:24,387
Let's say you have a heart attack that you see by still keep going or maybe have a healthier lifespan and get chronic disease better late in life.

632
01:21:24,927 --> 01:21:28,797
Hmm. What do you think is going on?

633
01:21:31,617 --> 01:21:35,487
Someone that reads 100 useful things.

634
01:21:37,497 --> 01:21:48,387
Yes. And what he finds going on is that they they they got chronic disease in very late in life, but really much better yet.

635
01:21:48,657 --> 01:21:55,437
For example, some years old, I want to show that these results are index linked to dating and about longevity.

636
01:21:55,827 --> 01:21:59,847
But are people that reach 100 useful?

637
01:22:00,477 --> 01:22:06,477
Usually that first chronic disease by growing disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension.

638
01:22:07,257 --> 01:22:10,527
The first one, they got it like 80 years old. Yeah.

639
01:22:11,757 --> 01:22:20,367
Then they have a lifespan, healthier lifespan compared to someone that is going to lead that to 85, useful as they are.

640
01:22:20,637 --> 01:22:27,327
Then you find that that genes related to longevity one four are related to lifespan to healthier lifespan.

641
01:22:29,907 --> 01:22:35,157
We did our paper about that in our desk in the years.

642
01:22:35,197 --> 01:22:39,037
I guess I want you doing this work in this researching because yeah.

643
01:22:39,067 --> 01:22:50,247
We're trying to find. Now my my advice anybody I think big parties and be romantic behavior is community family support.

644
01:22:51,237 --> 01:22:58,347
But I live for the for the person reaching 100 years or more like him there is a genetic component.

645
01:22:59,727 --> 01:23:03,777
It's like telomere length. You like a telomere length? Yes.

646
01:23:04,527 --> 01:23:13,856
Now, also, what is also nice in this is we as a public health professionals working these.

647
01:23:13,857 --> 01:23:17,307
I used to have this collaboration. I used to work at Boston University.

648
01:23:17,847 --> 01:23:21,867
I used to work in this before. Work is called the Black Women Health Study.

649
01:23:21,957 --> 01:23:31,586
Is that because about more than 50,000 African-American women in the country now, we have found are psychosocial stress related.

650
01:23:31,587 --> 01:23:38,817
For example, to experience of racism, discrimination are related to more higher risk of diabetes, chronic diseases.

651
01:23:39,577 --> 01:23:49,257
And now we have we are working this analysis to do that preliminary results, but we have some results that show the EU.

652
01:23:49,917 --> 01:23:58,617
As a black woman, you have more experience of racism in your epigenetic aging rate because you can measure and you think that methylation,

653
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:08,757
that DNA, you can measure some biomarker biological age like a telomeres you are exposed more to psychosocial stress gets faster.

654
01:24:09,897 --> 01:24:14,007
It's not like. That's like weathering. Yes. Weathering hypotheses.

655
01:24:14,517 --> 01:24:20,727
Things struggle to cope. Exactly. This kind of seeing that in patients that are larger, right?

656
01:24:21,357 --> 01:24:25,737
Mm hmm. Because it's like the experience of weight bias. It's like having some effect.

657
01:24:25,947 --> 01:24:33,747
Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Then if in doubt and this is also related to the the other evolutionary adaptations,

658
01:24:34,047 --> 01:24:43,617
because we discover with insulin resistance, those are physiological mechanisms to respond to acute stress.

659
01:24:44,277 --> 01:24:49,586
You can imagine that your period of starvation may be our resource of where we have insulin resistance to allow

660
01:24:49,587 --> 01:24:56,957
for viral get to the brain or you have an infection that we need more energy to the to down to the immune system.

661
01:24:57,267 --> 01:25:01,497
Then you can imagine that we have this mechanism, physiological mechanism to manage your stress.

662
01:25:01,887 --> 01:25:11,427
But in acute way, however, we have this chronic stress in modern life, then they become productive.

663
01:25:12,507 --> 01:25:16,737
These are physiological respond. They become productive than they do without the development.

664
01:25:17,187 --> 01:25:21,427
Of chronic diseases. Okay.

665
01:25:21,637 --> 01:25:25,027
We will discover more that aging in I think next lecture.

666
01:25:25,747 --> 01:25:29,617
Um, presentation today. Not today.

667
01:25:29,617 --> 01:25:34,566
I am doing the presentation you are doing. I know you have done to do that or you're done.

668
01:25:34,567 --> 01:25:39,277
This was all the second part. I've been expecting something else.

669
01:25:40,597 --> 01:25:44,257
Okay. Questionable comments. Um.

670
01:25:44,617 --> 01:25:47,827
Okay. There you go. You will have more questions.

671
01:25:48,007 --> 01:25:57,057
This is all for today. Please keep in mind these points that we discuss in the second part about this benefit

672
01:25:57,187 --> 01:26:01,957
hypothesis are all for what are the implications for our development to have a big brain,

673
01:26:02,887 --> 01:26:10,706
because now we need more time to develop that brain, um, or homework, etc.

674
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:13,746
I reposted is due next Monday as always.

675
01:26:13,747 --> 01:26:17,667
Then I will see you next Monday for a great result of your week.

676
01:26:18,007 --> 01:26:19,507
Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome.
