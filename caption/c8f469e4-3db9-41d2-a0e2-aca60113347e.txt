1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,290
After watching this video,

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,510
you will be able to
use PROC UNIVARIATE to

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,000
get the distribution of
a continuous variable,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,100
and use PROC TTEST to calculate

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,700
t-tests for normally distributed
continuous variables.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,600
First, let's remember where
we stand in an algorithm.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,100
In the last video,

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,140
we talked about
categorical predictors.

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,890
Let's move now into
continuous variables.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,870
In this video, we will be

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,450
focusing on not matched data and

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,710
continuous variables
that are normally

13
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,265
distributed as highlighted here.

14
00:00:42,265 --> 00:00:45,160
We're going to use the
same example that we

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,770
used during the last
video for the outcome.

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,935
Remember, I studied a
cross-sectional study

17
00:00:50,935 --> 00:00:54,785
and our outcome is abdominal
obesity, yes or no.

18
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:58,210
Now, I suppose there's going
to be a continuous variable.

19
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,230
We are going to use

20
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,540
dietary carbohydrates
expressed as

21
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,725
a percentage of total calories.

22
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:05,430
To give you some background,

23
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,935
although not all
carbohydrates are the same,

24
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,000
for the purposes
of our hypothesis,

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,130
we're going to assume that
carbohydrates will be

26
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,095
positively associated
with abdominal obesity.

27
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:18,460
This is definitely true
if you think about sugar,

28
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,370
although it may not be true
for total carbohydrates.

29
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,380
Let's test our hypothesis.

30
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,900
I told you that in this video,

31
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,195
we will deal with normally
continuous variables.

32
00:01:29,195 --> 00:01:31,250
But before knowing
what to do with them,

33
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,290
you actually need to check

34
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,860
first if they are normally
distributed or not.

35
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,560
The first step is to
check the distribution.

36
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,585
If they are normally distributed,

37
00:01:41,585 --> 00:01:44,255
we will do t-tests,
if they are not,

38
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:45,815
we have two options;

39
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:47,675
we can transform the variable

40
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:49,790
or use a non-parametric test.

41
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,030
We will see that
in the next video.

42
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,620
In order to check the
distribution of a variable,

43
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,480
we will run PROC UNIVARIATE.

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,280
We already saw that before,

45
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,720
and we will make sure to include

46
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,915
the options Normal and
Plot in the state.

47
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:06,515
Before moving into checking
our carbohydrates variable,

48
00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:08,690
let's look at the key output

49
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,275
from PROC UNIVARIATE
for another variable.

50
00:02:11,275 --> 00:02:13,900
By adding normal and plot,

51
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,550
you're getting first the test for

52
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,380
normality and second the plot.

53
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,115
Be Be here, because all
the test for normality,

54
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:22,780
and yes, there are four of them,

55
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,120
says gives you more
test than you need.

56
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,740
I'm telling you that the data is

57
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,060
not normally distributed here,

58
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,430
so you will be rejecting

59
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,900
the null hypothesis that

60
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,755
the data is normally distributed.

61
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:37,030
However, the test for
normality are very

62
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,240
sensitive to detect
departures from normality.

63
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,369
If you look at the plots,

64
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:45,980
the data does not
look terribly skew.

65
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,340
Sure, it's not perfectly normal,

66
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,515
but it's probably okay normal.

67
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:52,795
If you give this plot
to a hundred people,

68
00:02:52,795 --> 00:02:54,680
most likely a high
percentage of them

69
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,415
will see it normal
and the others won't.

70
00:02:57,415 --> 00:03:01,024
The same as in the
classical visual illusion

71
00:03:01,024 --> 00:03:03,094
of the cup and the faces,

72
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:06,185
normality here is in the
eye of the beholder.

73
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:09,560
Bottom line; with
large sample sizes,

74
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,845
you can afford some
departure from normality.

75
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:15,605
Don't use the test for normality.

76
00:03:15,605 --> 00:03:18,800
They are incredibly
sensitive, remember.

77
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,605
Look at the plot,

78
00:03:20,605 --> 00:03:22,470
if they look more or less okay,

79
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,980
you can probably go
ahead and assume that

80
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,161
the distribution is [inaudible] .

81
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:31,670
Now, let's look at our
sample and let's check

82
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,935
the distribution with PROC
UNIVARIATE for carbohydrates,

83
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:38,190
and this is what we get.

84
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,510
Note that because I have a
reasonably large sample size,

85
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,670
I'm not looking at
the normality test.

86
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,100
But in any case, the plot
looks pretty normal,

87
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,705
and by they way, the test
was not significant anyway.

88
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:52,100
Now that we know
that our variable

89
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,285
is normally distributed,

90
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:55,525
we can run the test.

91
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:59,945
We will use PROC t-test
and we just need to add

92
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:01,460
our outcome variable to

93
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,950
the classic statement
on a response variable,

94
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,490
to the value
statement. That's it.

95
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,495
When running this code,

96
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:10,100
SaaS first gives you

97
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,750
the descriptives of the variable

98
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,765
by categories of the outcome.

99
00:04:13,765 --> 00:04:17,180
Here, you see mean
carbohydrates for people

100
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,779
with abdominal obesity and
with no abdominal obesity,

101
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:24,860
together with standard
deviation, minimum and maximum.

102
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,410
You can ignore the second tape.

103
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,395
Then if you remember from
your statistics test,

104
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,630
you have two options for t-test;

105
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,535
when the variances are equal,

106
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:36,305
you will do a Pooled t-test,

107
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:37,460
and when they're unequal,

108
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,460
you do a Satterthwaite test.

109
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,260
The first thing you
have to do is to check

110
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,170
the test that tells you the
variances are equal or not.

111
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:49,720
If you will do the table that
says equality of variances,

112
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,590
your null hypothesis here is

113
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,180
that the variances are equal.

114
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,895
Therefore, if the test
is not significant,

115
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,440
you fail to reject the null,

116
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,410
that the variances
are equal, and now,

117
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,795
you can check the pooled
t-test like in this example.

118
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:05,535
But if your test is significant,

119
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:07,110
then you reject the null and use

120
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,040
the Satterthwaite test instead.

121
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,275
Now, that we know
which t-test to use,

122
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:14,990
the pooled one in this case,

123
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,820
how do we interpret our data?

124
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,340
Well, I mean the P-values
telling us that we

125
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,145
are failing to reject
the null hypothesis,

126
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:24,110
that the main
carbohydrate intake is

127
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,160
equal among the two groups.

128
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,055
Actually, if you
look at the means,

129
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:29,210
you can see that it's true,

130
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,360
that the means are
not that different.

131
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,800
Which makes sense
with the biology,

132
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,140
since I told you that
not all carbohydrates

133
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,220
are necessarily the same,

134
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,455
and although some
specific carbohydrates,

135
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,660
such as sugar would
likely be associated,

136
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,885
this may not be true for
total carbohydrates.

137
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:47,630
Throughout this semester,
I will emphasize

138
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,135
a lot that you have to
look at your estimates,

139
00:05:50,135 --> 00:05:52,505
your means, you radars,
your off ratios,

140
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:54,020
or whatever you are estimating,

141
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,620
and not only to your P-values.

142
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,510
Remember that P-values are
highly driven by sample size,

143
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,065
and therefore, when you
have a small sample size,

144
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:05,270
you may still see
differences that may be

145
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,670
clinically or
biologically important,

146
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,590
but that are not
significant because

147
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,570
you're under power
to detect them.

148
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,905
The opposite is true,

149
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,470
if you have a really
large sample size,

150
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,525
every small difference, even

151
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:20,245
if meaningless will
be significant.

152
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:22,130
Please make sure that you look at

153
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,115
both things when
interpreting your data.

154
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:27,425
In summary, in this video,

155
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:29,570
we learned how to use
PROC UNIVARIATE to

156
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,930
get the distribution of
continuous variables,

157
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,040
and we learned how to use
PROC TTEST to calculate

158
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,090
t-tests for normally distributed
continuous variables,

159
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,535
and how to interpret
its output properly.

160
00:06:40,535 --> 00:06:42,590
In the next video,
we will move into

161
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,528
non-normally distributed
continuous variables.
