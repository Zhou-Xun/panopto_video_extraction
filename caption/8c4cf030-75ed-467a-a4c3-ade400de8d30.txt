1
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:31,190
Hey, good morning, everyone. It's great to see you again, I feel like I've gone forever or like a whole week.

2
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:36,350
Oh my gosh, I saw the recording. I had an exchange with Professor Gee.

3
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,600
I'm so sorry. Like the projector didn't work right for a while.

4
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:49,280
Yeah, I got fixed. That was ridiculous. What the heck? And I saw like the guy in the background, and I'm really sorry about that.

5
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:57,030
And of course, I feel bad like abandoning this guest lecturer coming into my class anyway.

6
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:07,050
Uh, we're there. Were there any questions from the lecture on water quality and health before we get going?

7
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,240
I have a question I thought about, um, replacing pipes.

8
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:20,180
What do they usually switch to the ground? So pipes that don't contain any lead?

9
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:29,200
Absolutely, for sure. Depending on the region and ground temperature and other considerations.

10
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,030
Um, stainless. It's mostly disorders that are like the historical issues.

11
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,420
It's not like there's LED plumbing.

12
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:49,050
It's that where a lot of the connections are throughout the infrastructure is where we're in the LED is leaching from.

13
00:01:49,050 --> 00:02:00,770
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But there's other more like plastic oriented plumbing, where the where the temperature allows.

14
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:06,980
In other regions as well? Yeah, because we knew about new exposures we might get from smoking.

15
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,250
Yeah, it's a great question, right? And we talked about that.

16
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:18,260
That's going to be kind of our theme for today is continuing on exposure controls and right when we talk about substitution.

17
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,140
This is the challenge is OK.

18
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:31,160
We got rid of what we know is causing a problem or replacing it with something that we hope will cause ideally no problems,

19
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:38,150
but at worst, hopefully less problems, right? But then, yeah, that's a that's a thought going ahead with the longevity of it.

20
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,160
What's the cost of it?

21
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:49,400
And then from an environmental health exposure perspective, you know, are there other concerns that we need to be aware of or looking out for?

22
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:57,760
Great question. Any others?

23
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:05,560
All right, so today we've got two objectives, and we're spelled out in a recent canvass announcement.

24
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:13,600
We're going to start with our fourth and final installment of Exposure Science in the news.

25
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:20,860
So hopefully everyone brought an article with them today or a summary of an article to share.

26
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:30,280
Kind of going through the steps that we have previously, you know, classifying the type of hazard as it physical, chemical, biological.

27
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:37,720
What are the exposure pathways? You know, how is this getting distributed in a workplace or community setting?

28
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,830
What are the roots of exposure that we're concerned about?

29
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:51,850
What would be, you know, maybe some opportunities for poor monitoring or further assessment of whatever problem you're highlighting in your article?

30
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:57,640
But then the focus today is on what are the control opportunities right?

31
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:06,460
And kind of using our hierarchy of controls, what kind of walking through that, the higher up, the better right as our preference and most effective.

32
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:12,340
But in some cases, we need to go quite a ways down. So just exploring that once we finish,

33
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:22,000
we use about the first half of the class period for our in the news and then we'll shift and spend the second half going through an exercise here.

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,160
Well, we'll we'll break up into small groups as well and kind of talk through a couple of scenarios.

35
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:34,930
But again, really, with the emphasis being on exploring opportunities for control of exposure.

36
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:41,370
Any questions before we get going on the yes and the knees. All right.

37
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:47,030
So let's see, I might. 10.

38
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:56,720
So how about a group of three, maybe a group of three, group of four, group of three, something like that?

39
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,670
And go ahead and take five minutes to share your article.

40
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,960
I'll keep track of time and we'll rotate through the two groups of three.

41
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,610
You can actually have a little bit more time.

42
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:15,470
You can have maybe six or seven minutes if you want each, because it's going to take the group before a little bit more time to get through that.

43
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:25,790
On your mark, get set. Go. Yeah.

44
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:37,184
It really doesn't matter. We're going to have one group of four so you can understand you never what they learned the article this morning.

45
00:05:39,814 --> 00:05:48,274
All right, it's getting quiet. Sounds like you guys have your plans ready, so let's go ahead and re reconvene and we thanks to Lawrence,

46
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:51,784
he's actually agreed to share her article with with the whole class.

47
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:55,834
And then we'll kind of go through and pick out the highlights from each group,

48
00:05:55,834 --> 00:06:00,054
said Lauren, who wouldn't mind giving us a summary of the article you found? Yeah, sure.

49
00:06:00,054 --> 00:06:05,614
So mine was based on landfills and specifically one that was in Pennsylvania.

50
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:11,764
What they actually they burn the trash there at the steam plant in order to help produce electricity.

51
00:06:11,764 --> 00:06:20,314
But it's impacted the residents greatly. Like people, they don't go outside, they don't do barbecues anymore because of all the dust in the air.

52
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:24,934
And like a lot of it, comes from New York and New Jersey too, and it comes there.

53
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:30,454
But they have like really high rates of cancer and asthma.

54
00:06:30,454 --> 00:06:33,544
And it's like, well, there's only like thirty three thousand people in there.

55
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:44,884
But it was like it was one third of the solid waste from Pennsylvania in New York and New Jersey all end up getting burned there at this point.

56
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:53,914
And just like, I mean, it's like. So it's like the city is 69 percent black,

57
00:06:53,914 --> 00:07:00,514
and so they have like higher rates they've seen with the disproportionate to the socioeconomic classes there,

58
00:07:00,514 --> 00:07:05,314
and then they have chronic health conditions and asthma and cancer.

59
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:10,624
But it also so it like they're really below this all like safety limits.

60
00:07:10,624 --> 00:07:19,294
Also, like all the reports from it, kind of like just just I don't even know how it's going out there.

61
00:07:19,294 --> 00:07:28,274
So and it just all the nitrogen oxides and the sulfur dioxide that are being put out into the air.

62
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:34,654
So I can't believe that it'll come. Yeah. What's our interacting? What's the community, the city, the municipality?

63
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:39,964
So it's like Chester, Pennsylvania. So it's in Delaware County.

64
00:07:39,964 --> 00:07:45,684
OK. I don't know exactly like where to think that's like Philadelphia ish.

65
00:07:45,684 --> 00:07:49,324
Right? Josh is not familiar with you guys know, my geography is terrible,

66
00:07:49,324 --> 00:08:01,004
but that I can recall I've driven through Pennsylvania, but it's sort of like, OK, I've been kind of like, OK.

67
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:12,484
Yeah, you were right, it is somewhat near Philadelphia, OK, 20 minutes or so.

68
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:18,544
Yeah. And so like the the and there's just the article talked about the chief sustainability officer,

69
00:08:18,544 --> 00:08:22,374
like the local city is saying how like they're not the source of the problem.

70
00:08:22,374 --> 00:08:30,994
But yeah, everything that they do and I mean, the residents were complaining, you know, how like nobody's outside anymore,

71
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:35,914
like kids aren't going outside because like the dust, they just can't breathe for just everything ends up in the air.

72
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:39,334
And like, not enough people are realizing that all of their trash is.

73
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:43,834
They just put their trash up to the curb and don't think another thing of it. Right? Sure.

74
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:51,534
So. Well, thank you for sharing. And then I have a follow up, but I'm going to ask the question to the whole class.

75
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:56,274
You cannot give an answer if we want you to start, but I'll invite others to join in.

76
00:08:56,274 --> 00:09:02,064
So kind of following the theme for today, which is around and against the terrible stories,

77
00:09:02,064 --> 00:09:06,714
but thank you for sharing it or an opportunity for control of exposures.

78
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:21,154
So in this scenario, working within that hierarchy of controls, what are some options that might be available to pursue?

79
00:09:21,154 --> 00:09:27,724
Perhaps they could adjust. It seems like I know Detroit are solid waste incinerator,

80
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:33,764
kind of a similar issue where it magnifies it takes in waste from like the wider metropolitan area.

81
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:40,294
So it's kind of similar how to like the Pennsylvania one comes from like a small community.

82
00:09:40,294 --> 00:09:47,944
It's the burden of a much wider community. I mean, maybe if they reduce the speed at which they burn or less material, they're going to space it out.

83
00:09:47,944 --> 00:09:53,374
Maybe that means less pollution, but then also, maybe they could do more engineering controls,

84
00:09:53,374 --> 00:10:01,684
more filters or like a higher smokestack or only burn on the line like better air does stuff like that.

85
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:07,834
OK, so a mix of kind of administrative and engineering control opportunities.

86
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:11,884
Any other ideas that came to mind from folks?

87
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:19,084
I don't know if this is like this ever really happens, but also maybe like extending the boundary of like how close people can live to then it's like,

88
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:28,844
I mean, like, those communities are that close and being exposed to and they're just going to continue to, you know, do waste to energy stuff, right?

89
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:35,764
And you're pushing out, right? I mean, I don't know how much they really do that, but I just think.

90
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:43,144
Absolutely. Yeah. So buffer approaches are a thing, and in this case, it would make a lot of sense.

91
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:54,004
Absolutely. What else comes to mind?

92
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:57,264
This one speaks to me at the higher level, right?

93
00:10:57,264 --> 00:11:05,314
That's kind of where we start, which is what policy and and you know, you mentioned the example of Detroit.

94
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:08,584
It's historically the same thing here in Southeast Michigan,

95
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:19,944
the Detroit waiting municipal waste incinerator for the longest time important municipal trash from the city of Toronto and burned it.

96
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:30,004
Right. So you're it's not just, you know, the community waste that's being burned and therefore the exposures are of their own waste, right?

97
00:11:30,004 --> 00:11:34,744
It's where Ford for various reasons.

98
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:43,384
It's an opportunity for income, for revenue and important jobs, you name it, right to sign contracts to burn other people's trash.

99
00:11:43,384 --> 00:11:50,104
And so you have this very disproportionate burden of exposure within these communities.

100
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:57,544
From a policy perspective, right, this seems like an opportunity to maybe decide that it's not and not worth it.

101
00:11:57,544 --> 00:12:11,704
Whatever the perceived benefits are, tax be, you know, revenue jobs in this case, some some alternative policy approaches.

102
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:17,344
Any other thoughts or comments? I got one. I think you said it's just like when and when it's not the benefit anymore.

103
00:12:17,344 --> 00:12:24,454
I remember when, like China stopped importing trash and stuff like causes huge like back up with us, like what do we do in America now?

104
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:28,324
Because we just gave it all to them? And now it's like, I think Pennsylvania was a big one.

105
00:12:28,324 --> 00:12:31,984
Great at New York, used to ship over there, and now it's going to Pennsylvania.

106
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:36,094
So it's just like, now we're positive, like we are. We don't want to deal with it, but we don't have to do anything.

107
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:44,104
You don't know what to do with it now. I just kind of symbolizes like now we're stuck with it instead of just giving up different countries and stuff.

108
00:12:44,104 --> 00:12:48,634
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, we're talking about waste, right?

109
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:55,924
I mean, actual trash. But then even recycling is the same, the same issue as well.

110
00:12:55,924 --> 00:12:58,564
And also like, I mean, I also mentioned, you know,

111
00:12:58,564 --> 00:13:09,034
like the increasing amount of products that we use that have like PFOA as know is so that like all the products that we're put into the landfills,

112
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:16,034
I mean, if you go back to everything that we're putting out, like we couldn't approach it from different, a different perspective.

113
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:20,554
Absolutely. Because of what's causing the issue. So sure.

114
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:24,574
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, your policy with products? Absolutely. Yeah.

115
00:13:24,574 --> 00:13:32,644
And you know, when you talk about sustainable products, reusable products that you don't need to dispose of, right?

116
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:41,704
You know, you mentioned some great examples of organics with with the soft chemicals, but there's also just tons of metals, right?

117
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:47,744
All the electronic waste. It's also been an issue of, OK, yeah, we're going to we're going to recycle this right.

118
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:53,674
So we like take it to the hazardous waste center, right? And then it goes somewhere.

119
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:57,164
It's not allowed to be burned here. But guess what?

120
00:13:57,164 --> 00:14:00,904
You know, there are places in the globe that, again, from a revenue perspective,

121
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:08,314
are happy to take it and deal with it, but not necessarily deal with it in ways that are safe.

122
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:15,384
Thank you so much, Lauren, for sharing your article with the class. So I guess staying on this side of the room will work our way across what?

123
00:14:15,384 --> 00:14:24,904
What does this do? You have to share new channels, an article about selling exposure and linking it to mortality and also cost to their.

124
00:14:24,904 --> 00:14:32,884
So previously, airlines have been definitively linked with endocrine disruption, but only indirectly linked with mortality.

125
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:42,994
And this study was a cohort study from an Heinz actually over 10 years that looked at rates in the urine to quantify,

126
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:51,754
and they were actually able to directly link fairly exposure to all cause mortality and also cardiovascular mortality.

127
00:14:51,754 --> 00:14:58,534
So it was significant from that perspective that there's a direct link now to both of these types of mortality.

128
00:14:58,534 --> 00:15:05,764
And then also the economic cost per year to society was estimated to be thirty nine billion.

129
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:13,204
And that was significant because previous estimates when it was just thought of as an endocrine disruptors were only eight billion or so,

130
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:17,194
a very significant increase.

131
00:15:17,194 --> 00:15:26,014
I can go into more detail that but opportunities for exposure are for exposure control are more like high level, probably at the policy level,

132
00:15:26,014 --> 00:15:37,834
because it's really industry that's producing under like food packaging, personal care products, toys, flooring as a plasticizer.

133
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:41,074
So that's where we're getting our exposure.

134
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:47,794
So if we're able to have some regulation around that, like the U.S. has already done some regulating around toys,

135
00:15:47,794 --> 00:15:52,174
but not for food, and that's one of the bigger exposures.

136
00:15:52,174 --> 00:16:03,004
So if that could change, that could greatly reduce our exposure and also reduce our body burden because the half life is only one to three days.

137
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:07,644
So it is possible to get it out of our systems and the process is something like people.

138
00:16:07,644 --> 00:16:14,764
Right, right. I'm interested. I don't actually know the answer to this.

139
00:16:14,764 --> 00:16:16,054
Are there yet?

140
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:29,404
Products like canned foods or something that that promote and advertise being valley green or something along those lines of their products?

141
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:38,134
Yes, I've never seen like a food, OK, but personal care products that are promoting that, but it's not yet an industry wide adoption, right?

142
00:16:38,134 --> 00:16:41,284
But there are specific. Yeah, yeah.

143
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:48,274
I've started seeing people free, like when you start looking at cooking patties and stuff, but you have to see really phthalate free.

144
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:56,854
Other than, I mean, it's not a top class, not like nail salons, and I see it with like that kind of stuff, but not like for any food stuff, right?

145
00:16:56,854 --> 00:17:04,834
OK. Yeah, you're doing something about that.

146
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:13,564
They don't have to tell you one thing, you have a gene as they kind of have to tell you that it's in the personal care products,

147
00:17:13,564 --> 00:17:19,194
like they're more on the hook for saying, Oh, this is value creation it.

148
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:23,204
That's a good point, but also families can fall under fragrances,

149
00:17:23,204 --> 00:17:27,564
and they do not have to disclose any fragrance like they can just throw in the label.

150
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:31,924
Literally the word fragrance and that's it. Right, right.

151
00:17:31,924 --> 00:17:38,334
That's true. All right, great.

152
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:44,484
Thanks to this group and thanks to Melissa's so much. Let's go ahead and move the folks in the middle here.

153
00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:53,574
So I found this article that kind of references like a peer reviewed, well, it was like it was from L.A. Daily News.

154
00:17:53,574 --> 00:18:02,544
And I reference like an article that said the socialist Santa Susanna Field Bar was a site for nuclear research and rocket testing in northern L.A.

155
00:18:02,544 --> 00:18:11,754
And it was like partially melted down in 1959 and kind of left the soil contaminated with cancer causing chemicals and like radioactive waste.

156
00:18:11,754 --> 00:18:19,344
So this peer reviewed article said that the recent like usually fire in California is the cause of

157
00:18:19,344 --> 00:18:26,274
increased radioactive particles in residential neighborhoods because it's like in the dust and in the ash.

158
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:38,004
So a 2007 consent order required that NASA, Boeing and the D.O.D. clean up the area by 2017, but it hadn't started yet.

159
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:42,774
And so when the fire broke out, like it burned like eighty percent of this like feels arbitrary.

160
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:52,824
And in the study, they took like three hundred sixty samples of household dust and ash from like 150 homes, and some were normal.

161
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:57,164
But a lot of them was also in the immediate aftermath, like high high.

162
00:18:57,164 --> 00:19:04,134
The radioactive isotope. And so that kind of like caused a lot of concern in the neighborhood,

163
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:14,354
like I kind of did like a deep dove and looked at Kim Kardashian's like on it and I'm like, Oh, right, I'm feeling better.

164
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:24,374
You know, you just kind of like a joke. And so some of the counter conclusions was like from Cow EPA's like Department

165
00:19:24,374 --> 00:19:30,074
of Toxic Substances saying that there's multiple like pathways of exposure,

166
00:19:30,074 --> 00:19:39,224
saying like, you know, it's not. They didn't identify like the contamination directly from this artery, but still like they're working with,

167
00:19:39,224 --> 00:19:49,214
like the EPA is working with Boeing and like the Los Angeles Regional Water Board, to hold Boeing accountable for the cleanup.

168
00:19:49,214 --> 00:19:54,104
Yeah, so that's like another route of exposure is through the groundwater.

169
00:19:54,104 --> 00:19:59,444
Mm hmm. So yeah, that's like the main summary of the story.

170
00:19:59,444 --> 00:20:06,574
And like I said, um, like the main exposure control was really just like elimination.

171
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:13,214
I know it's yeah, it was supposed to be done in 2017, like it burned in 1959.

172
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:23,754
So it's kind of like a really long time. All right. OK, thank you so much, family, for sharing that.

173
00:20:23,754 --> 00:20:39,064
Any other any thoughts? What else do folks think around opportunities for exposure control in this in this scenario?

174
00:20:39,064 --> 00:20:45,374
Clearly, clearly the most effective way to do it, you know, failing to it right, actually deal with it, actually clean it up.

175
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:50,764
Right. That sounds like an incredibly frustrating endeavor to try to chase it everywhere through

176
00:20:50,764 --> 00:20:59,034
all of the possible pathways and routes of exposure to somehow intervene at that level.

177
00:20:59,034 --> 00:21:03,324
All right, thanks very much, and let's go ahead and move to this group over here.

178
00:21:03,324 --> 00:21:10,954
Yeah. So um, the article we ended up selecting was about the physical aging of microwave radiation,

179
00:21:10,954 --> 00:21:24,564
pro lifestyle devices and how the younger population of children are especially vulnerable as they will be seeing a lifetime of exposure because,

180
00:21:24,564 --> 00:21:28,584
you know, cell phones are becoming more incorporated into our society.

181
00:21:28,584 --> 00:21:39,534
There's a lot of regulations and exposure limits that have not been updated to reach these current levels of usage for our human behavior.

182
00:21:39,534 --> 00:21:43,884
And so our current safety on this revision works out.

183
00:21:43,884 --> 00:21:51,024
Twenty five years ago and there is a 35 year old science using a model of a large adult male.

184
00:21:51,024 --> 00:21:59,164
And so obviously there has to be an adjustment in the policy. So as far as control goes, that's the biggest issue.

185
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:04,884
And obviously, education to just parents,

186
00:22:04,884 --> 00:22:12,084
cell phone distance between children and the cell phone need to be regulated

187
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:18,084
because children are being more susceptible and are smaller than our souls,

188
00:22:18,084 --> 00:22:24,864
and our bodies can be a lot more fluid, able to absorb the radiation easier than us.

189
00:22:24,864 --> 00:22:36,294
And so one of the recommendations that they currently have in the fine print is for cell phones should not be closer than five millimeters.

190
00:22:36,294 --> 00:22:45,924
Your Amazon Echo or Google Home should not be better than eight inches, as well as laptops eight inches from your body.

191
00:22:45,924 --> 00:22:58,014
And that is said in a study that this kind of radiation actually is best known for layperson vision,

192
00:22:58,014 --> 00:23:02,694
and it actually takes three or more decades to see these tumors develop.

193
00:23:02,694 --> 00:23:13,194
So that's why children are the most susceptible. And the biggest recommendation they have right now is just to give the device an airplane

194
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:19,094
mode so that there's no connectivity and the limits are much radiation is exposed.

195
00:23:19,094 --> 00:23:25,344
So, yeah, that's obviously excellent, and I thank you for sharing.

196
00:23:25,344 --> 00:23:33,954
So. Just to go a little bit further on the um looking at the hierarchy of control.

197
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:38,604
So you've actually kind of reported on rate guidelines and recommendations.

198
00:23:38,604 --> 00:23:48,704
So kind of asking the whole class what would be some other considerations in this case?

199
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:54,374
Can we actually go with that or so I thought of what we first discussed this.

200
00:23:54,374 --> 00:24:02,954
If this is actually the publication of this acute pain have high simplification really setting the

201
00:24:02,954 --> 00:24:12,004
companies to start producing radiation proof cell locations and just something to minimize exposure.

202
00:24:12,004 --> 00:24:18,944
How PPE in that respect? Of course, I think so.

203
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:30,734
Yes, this is another American soldier. Sure. So some sort of barrier you could actually probably look at the same concept from a perspective that we

204
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:39,494
all wear some sort of right like for a body suit to protect us from all of our all of our device demands.

205
00:24:39,494 --> 00:24:49,904
Good idea. Thanks, Sean. Ever did. I was just thinking now about how much kids use technology in school to provide kids with to pass.

206
00:24:49,904 --> 00:25:00,464
So like a long term thing, you need your steering away from relying on technology to have legal.

207
00:25:00,464 --> 00:25:07,644
It's a favorite penalty, and they're not getting radiation from that.

208
00:25:07,644 --> 00:25:17,334
Yeah, absolutely, so so substitution in this case, right, so you can still accomplish whatever it is, but without the technology,

209
00:25:17,334 --> 00:25:23,724
I imagine you reduced the magnitude by like instead of having all funds give you a more powerful and better reception.

210
00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:28,234
But maybe instead of like painting the nearest tower, you could cell phone content.

211
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:32,994
Your router then paints the tower, so at least the device you're holding doesn't have as much power.

212
00:25:32,994 --> 00:25:40,704
But I don't know. It's really interesting because the physical hazards recovered like radio wave radiation are not ionizing radiation.

213
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:46,434
So is is it radio waves? That's the agent of concern or microwave microwaves?

214
00:25:46,434 --> 00:25:55,854
Interesting. So is that only in 5G, but not in life by then, because airplane still have.

215
00:25:55,854 --> 00:26:02,674
Pleasure. I think what one of the recommendations to do airplane.

216
00:26:02,674 --> 00:26:09,664
I'm not sure, I think airplane mode turns off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and all I really notice is nothing.

217
00:26:09,664 --> 00:26:20,254
Oh, so I mean, there's no functionality for any overseas travel, but.

218
00:26:20,254 --> 00:26:34,284
Any other thoughts, what journalism? I just want to read it.

219
00:26:34,284 --> 00:26:44,394
I don't think it was a magical girl was going to source. Actually, Caitlin, if you wouldn't mind, no, no urgency,

220
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:50,664
but send me a link to send me an email link and I can I can post it to the class for anybody who's interested in looking further on it.

221
00:26:50,664 --> 00:26:56,004
Yeah. All right. So thanks so much for that.

222
00:26:56,004 --> 00:27:05,484
Excellent, really interesting articles and nice job kind of thinking through um and specifically following up on exposure control opportunities.

223
00:27:05,484 --> 00:27:12,234
So we're going to stay on that exact theme. We've got about a half an hour left in the class period.

224
00:27:12,234 --> 00:27:23,244
I'm going to say, let's stick with our three existing groups, which is logistically convenient and move into our next exercise.

225
00:27:23,244 --> 00:27:29,374
So today we're going to be I can make this a little bit bigger.

226
00:27:29,374 --> 00:27:32,014
Looking at a couple of specific situations and again,

227
00:27:32,014 --> 00:27:42,094
with the I the idea of identifying opportunities or exposure control and then even surveillance to tell us whether our controls are effective or not,

228
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:51,124
we're going to use three of these groups and two to bring a little bit of variation into them.

229
00:27:51,124 --> 00:28:02,014
How about if we say Group one can be you guys over here, so a volatile organic chemical present in drinking water in a rural community?

230
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:12,754
So in this case, it's a chemical agent within a community exposure setting, and scenario two just strikes a little too close to home.

231
00:28:12,754 --> 00:28:21,544
Let's skip over that one. Let's go with the scenario number three here with the group in the middle.

232
00:28:21,544 --> 00:28:29,824
Radon exposure among underground miners. So in this case, the physical agent within an occupational setting.

233
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:35,584
And then actually, let's let's stick with physical agents down here.

234
00:28:35,584 --> 00:28:45,784
The group over here take scenario number five where the situation is noise exposures among concert goers and staff,

235
00:28:45,784 --> 00:28:49,654
so also including the workers at a concert.

236
00:28:49,654 --> 00:28:58,454
So in this case, the physical agent, uh, and considering both, you know, kind of a community exposure from the concert goers themselves,

237
00:28:58,454 --> 00:29:03,214
but then also an occupational exposure from from the worker's perspective.

238
00:29:03,214 --> 00:29:11,074
Your goal is going to be to think through relevant opportunities for exposure

239
00:29:11,074 --> 00:29:16,894
controls using the hierarchy of controls that we've been discussing in class.

240
00:29:16,894 --> 00:29:23,374
And then, you know, feel free to kind of make up details of your scenario that make it easier for you to actually work through.

241
00:29:23,374 --> 00:29:28,954
And you can discuss those exposure control scenarios and then think about,

242
00:29:28,954 --> 00:29:35,074
you know, what would be some, uh, exposure surveillance, some sort of monitoring,

243
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:46,594
surveying data collection that would help you to confirm that whatever controls you're thinking about are reducing exposures sufficiently.

244
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:52,714
And then, you know, take take leeway wherever you need to think broadly, be creative.

245
00:29:52,714 --> 00:30:00,214
And then we'll do like we usually do at the end will kind of have a reconvening of the class and then report out with what you came up with.

246
00:30:00,214 --> 00:30:11,224
So based on this, I'm going to say, let's take about 15 minutes of discussion within each group and then we'll report out and in each group

247
00:30:11,224 --> 00:30:19,264
can have a couple of minutes to just share what they came up with any questions before we start this one.

248
00:30:19,264 --> 00:30:24,304
All right. Go for it. By 2021,

249
00:30:24,304 --> 00:30:43,204
they're going to include a CDC where the flu outbreak in this document is actually on canvas and the home page in case anyone wants to pull it up.

250
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:59,601
Yeah, all. I think that's what's playing here.

251
00:30:59,601 --> 00:31:04,351
Yeah, yeah, 100 percent. Something that.

252
00:31:04,351 --> 00:31:21,461
Yeah. So let's go ahead and start with this group over here, since they were the first to kind of announced, they're ready.

253
00:31:21,461 --> 00:31:36,551
A volatile organic water now, so we're assuming that this will be either on their own bottle system so that the volatile organic comes out water.

254
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:42,351
So for an interim control, you're using one of these water treatment systems.

255
00:31:42,351 --> 00:31:48,341
We also look at specifically reverse osmosis with water filter with a harmful.

256
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:56,291
Carbon filter will control both the House and then in the long term.

257
00:31:56,291 --> 00:32:09,911
Finding the source that is. The Arkansas gas station with an agricultural community to opening or landfills or dry cleaners.

258
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:15,841
And then we also talked about the testing ground water source to make sure that you

259
00:32:15,841 --> 00:32:25,351
are working or checking their baseline for exposure to the chemical in their water.

260
00:32:25,351 --> 00:32:41,451
But we are also saying that the point forest industry could possibly control that and get those people the charges for the monitoring.

261
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:52,711
I want to hear you talking about this. The house is called Check Their Water to make sure that the coaches are working as a.

262
00:32:52,711 --> 00:32:58,351
So this kind of goes like this in the volatile.

263
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:03,631
We weren't sure play could also be concerned for that.

264
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:09,241
So you're saying measure the air or we're taking a sample like before it's filtered,

265
00:33:09,241 --> 00:33:16,831
like putting it under the hood and you start to see how it follows the line.

266
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:23,011
But we weren't really sure like any control fatalities or how you are going through Washington before.

267
00:33:23,011 --> 00:33:27,361
Right, right. Presumably, that would manage kind of both rounds of exposure.

268
00:33:27,361 --> 00:33:38,051
And then we also said, do you sometimes can have plastic foam you trace back to it?

269
00:33:38,051 --> 00:33:45,241
You're also talking about how you look at the increase the ball so comfortable about a laboratory.

270
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:52,331
Come off of it. Absolutely. You heard that. What we said.

271
00:33:52,331 --> 00:34:00,131
All right. Excellent. Nice work. Let's go ahead and move to the group in the middle here, who had the raid on exposure?

272
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:06,521
Yeah, our situation was right on exposures and on underground miners. And so right down to earth, there's no fiscal agent.

273
00:34:06,521 --> 00:34:10,931
And so first off, we're trying to imagine, like what kind of mine it is.

274
00:34:10,931 --> 00:34:15,971
And so like, if you are in a uranium mine like Grade II, it's going to be just done.

275
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:21,011
It's going to be an exposure that's going to happen. You can't really avoid that. But if it's like an iron mine,

276
00:34:21,011 --> 00:34:28,061
perhaps you could have a particular shaft is really high for radon and you could just close that part of the mine and perhaps a mine somewhere else.

277
00:34:28,061 --> 00:34:35,051
But just imagining that we won't be able to do that, we we've done substitution where instead of perhaps even having physical miners,

278
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:41,861
you could have some kind of robotic vehicle or like mechanical devices to mine instead of just sending people down there,

279
00:34:41,861 --> 00:34:43,511
so you could replace the hazard.

280
00:34:43,511 --> 00:34:52,511
But if that doesn't work, you could do engineering controls such as he could put an basically from the mine shaft to the surface.

281
00:34:52,511 --> 00:34:55,811
The sign-ups is like not going to hurt the ground workers, but on it,

282
00:34:55,811 --> 00:35:00,311
a lot of the concentration is to be diluted down in the mines and maybe bring down the right levels.

283
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:05,251
They could also, if that wasn't feasible, maybe putting some kind of air filtration system.

284
00:35:05,251 --> 00:35:12,371
And then you could also perhaps now actually thinking goes back down to the administrative controls,

285
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:17,291
which would be more typical in an individual dose of workers and being, Hey,

286
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:22,211
you've had excellent radon exposure, you have to go work in office, swap the person out.

287
00:35:22,211 --> 00:35:30,521
Or you could then also for PPE, you could get people to emitters, film badges, respirators,

288
00:35:30,521 --> 00:35:37,071
all sorts of personal protective equipment, making sure they take showers and stuff after they go to work.

289
00:35:37,071 --> 00:35:46,691
So then like this stuff and then obviously train people on radon and smoking and radon exposure is like a really bad dynamic where,

290
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:51,101
like, it's just both harming your lungs really, really badly.

291
00:35:51,101 --> 00:35:56,651
And so you don't want to have both exposure and maybe try to get all the miners to not smoke.

292
00:35:56,651 --> 00:36:02,001
So I got. They're excellent now.

293
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:08,781
Thank you so much. I don't know what to call you. Sort of scenario number one group scenario number three.

294
00:36:08,781 --> 00:36:15,111
And then over here, the group that head scenario number five run the noise exposure.

295
00:36:15,111 --> 00:36:22,251
What all did you come up with? Yeah. So we had noise among concert goers and staff.

296
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:27,351
So for elimination, I mean, like an alternative is really to not have a car.

297
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:35,001
It's not really feasible for substitution. We thought it could be maybe like you could have like a like a silent concert.

298
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:40,821
So the noises coming through like a headphone that somebody could control versus like speakers up on stage.

299
00:36:40,821 --> 00:36:46,091
But like, is that the concert experience they're going to be willing to opt into?

300
00:36:46,091 --> 00:36:50,931
Um, and then we also thought like kind of more engineering controls.

301
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:55,071
It could be like you could kind of like add more speakers.

302
00:36:55,071 --> 00:37:00,291
So the speakers are really right on the front of like the concert hall, but not as loud in the back.

303
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:07,431
So maybe instead of like having all the noise concentrated and then like coming out, have it from like multiple angles or sides.

304
00:37:07,431 --> 00:37:11,661
So like, it's still everybody still getting the sound to be able to hear it.

305
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:16,171
But it's not like at one hundred in the front and I'm like 55 in the back.

306
00:37:16,171 --> 00:37:21,771
Um, and also like maybe looking at like if there's certain frequencies and like noise,

307
00:37:21,771 --> 00:37:28,941
there's like more damaging, like maybe eliminating or like trying to minimize, um, like those.

308
00:37:28,941 --> 00:37:33,921
And then also for like the workers to maybe like rotate them through.

309
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:41,121
So like if they're at the front of the concert, like have them have progressively move back, kind of like what the TSA does.

310
00:37:41,121 --> 00:37:48,081
So they're not getting all of their exposure at once. Um, and then for warnings like you could have like a I don't know,

311
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:55,971
some kind of thing that tells you like the decimal noise level in the room is like asking maybe like the band to like you try to keep it below,

312
00:37:55,971 --> 00:38:02,751
like maybe dampening like the band itself and then like having the singer because I feel like I always can hear the band more than you can hear,

313
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:05,931
like the vocals.

314
00:38:05,931 --> 00:38:12,051
And then like, there's a with the Apple Watch, the like the community could have like a I don't know if they had one or like something similar,

315
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:16,891
like, okay, here, just so they are aware of like the noise.

316
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:22,761
Um, and then we thought like personal, like your mufflers or earplugs, definitely for staff.

317
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:28,901
And that is like having that as an option available for like free for our comfort zones, you know?

318
00:38:28,901 --> 00:38:36,731
Yeah. Excellent. Nice job. Any other comments from the group?

319
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:45,311
All right, yeah, this one is particularly interesting to me, right, because people go to the concert to be exposed to noise like that.

320
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:54,251
The inherent, you know, understanding has anyone warning your protection of some sort at a concert?

321
00:38:54,251 --> 00:39:05,441
Yeah, I have as well. I don't actually sense like this, like I'm getting this downgraded experience or whatever from from doing it.

322
00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:09,461
I think the key is having the right kind of air protection. So like, I used to be under a line.

323
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:15,851
And so like a lot of people want easier protection because just like the ones around the ears like that really diminish your ability to play the like.

324
00:39:15,851 --> 00:39:19,691
If you're looking for the right filters, it doesn't really do that at all.

325
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:24,551
Yeah, but people think any kind of game production does the right thing.

326
00:39:24,551 --> 00:39:31,151
Absolutely. They're not. They're not all the same. I also like I think I've gone to concerts of the past like up until recently.

327
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:34,721
I don't even think about like the noise like damage.

328
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:40,401
Yeah, that could be happening. Yeah. So like, educating people is an important piece, right?

329
00:39:40,401 --> 00:39:49,011
Right. Yeah. You know, and it's with with concerts, especially and again, this is my experience.

330
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:56,711
I assume it's some other people's, you know, a couple of hours long, very loud.

331
00:39:56,711 --> 00:40:02,171
You end up at home later that night and then I mean, you just have this like throbbing ringing in your ears,

332
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:07,461
right for like the entire night and into the morning. It's like a telltale sign.

333
00:40:07,461 --> 00:40:13,971
It's not. It's not like one of these unseen, unheard on sent exposure.

334
00:40:13,971 --> 00:40:19,721
Right? It's it's absolutely there. All right. Thank you so much for your engagement on this.

335
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:25,241
I think I think we did a pretty good job right between the eyes and the news articles.

336
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:35,081
Going through this exercise of really trying to, through several scenarios, have some applied examples of applying those hierarchy of controls,

337
00:40:35,081 --> 00:40:43,421
you know, both within occupational workplace setting, but also within community settings where these exposures take place.

338
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:55,821
Any any questions about this as a general topic, because we'll definitely be kind of moving on from it going forward.

339
00:40:55,821 --> 00:41:00,621
All right. Thanks again for your engagement. Good to see you all again.

340
00:41:00,621 --> 00:41:08,410
That said, have a good weekend and we'll see you next week.
