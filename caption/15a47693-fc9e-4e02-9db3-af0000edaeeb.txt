1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,310
You have to play. Yeah. Yeah, me too.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:24,470
I mean, I know. I know that. But, you know, honestly, I like it cause I the 25 seasons are there.

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:35,680
Like, you know, it's interesting because I was just like, oh, my God, oh, my God.

4
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:42,410
I don't know what got to ask.

5
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:59,730
You know, there's really great opportunities for me because I was like, terrible.

6
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,650
My legs are only high strength.

7
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:16,260
And right now I think, oh, you have to try and keep really cool.

8
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:25,050
I mean, I have to like tomorrow. No, definitely. So, um, it seems like fall has arrived this week.

9
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,510
It's gloomier and darker. Sun will come out later today or tomorrow and.

10
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:47,349
And whether a little bit more. So I ended here last time and we were talking about this cohort of nonhuman primates, the Japanese macaques,

11
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:56,860
and they were looking at the influence of prenatal exposure to in this case, it was a high fat diet, a 30% diet.

12
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,519
And they're calling this in this particular slide of Western style times that

13
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,800
was that that was the moniker that they used for this particular illustration.

14
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,850
This is kind of a summary of what they saw in these studies.

15
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:16,890
So this this represents a liver cell of the offspring now.

16
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:26,979
And here you had a higher concentration or higher levels of maternal lipids, and this affected many of the intracellular processes.

17
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:33,310
So you had a greater disaffected loop genesis within the liver cell.

18
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:42,010
This had an impact on exporting weapons, which went down the cells of this of these animals.

19
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:49,960
We had greater genesis oxidation within the mitochondria.

20
00:02:50,350 --> 00:03:03,790
But the big impact that we saw here was an increase in triglycerides and more of a higher triglyceride content in the individual lipid liver cells.

21
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:11,469
These impacts, whether or not this could be reversed with a change in the diet and how quickly might be seen.

22
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:17,590
But we did see this increase the upregulation of lipids and against an increase in triglycerides,

23
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,630
and this affected many different cellular processes down here.

24
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,650
So the Cooper cells are macrophages or immune cells within the liver.

25
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:39,760
And in response to this, higher levels of triglycerides in the hepatic cells, you get greater inflammatory markers, more cytokines,

26
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,749
IL six F you get more pro-inflammatory responses,

27
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:56,560
reactive oxygen species and the effect of the greater reactive oxygen species was a reduction in antioxidants.

28
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:06,130
And this is an overall summary of what happens in the liver cells in the offspring.

29
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:14,740
So they studied this in both in vivo where they took biopsies of the liver from the offspring and they recovered

30
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:22,840
hepatic cells and cooper cells in macrophages and studied them in vitro to find these different end points.

31
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,170
Another interesting thing that they observed in the offspring of the mothers on this Western

32
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:36,160
style diet was that it had a significant impact on the bone marrow immune cell populations.

33
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:41,560
So when they took bone marrow biopsies from these offspring,

34
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:47,830
they looked at the different populations of immune cells, lymphocytes, monocytes and so on.

35
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,840
And what they found was with the control control diet.

36
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:58,520
So this is prenatal and postnatal diet and they got this population of cells.

37
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:05,660
So we're looking at the erythrocyte population here in blue, which represents cells that would become red blood cells.

38
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,730
Your orange represents the population of cells that would go on to become myeloid cells.

39
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,370
They are the neutrophils, basically monocytes and so on.

40
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,140
And then the gray represented multi lineage cells.

41
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:30,110
And this could be on the side searching for lymphocytes. What they found with the animals that were exposed prenatally to Western style diet and they

42
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,210
put on the control diet was that there was a huge change in the myeloid cell populations.

43
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:47,989
So I don't know if this has been observed in humans in terms of a prenatal exposure to diet, having this impact on the offspring.

44
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:57,500
But I do know that people who have dyslipidemia, people who have greater adipose tissue mass have this phenotype.

45
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,660
They have a higher number of circulating my blood cells in the body.

46
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:16,530
This is the final slide of this, just the lectures that we started on Monday and summarizes what they saw in terms of the

47
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:25,290
Western style diet and its impact on the mothers and the fetal brain and offspring behavior.

48
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:33,120
And so to follow through this diagram here, so the maternal diet, the cats run the dog for a very long period of time.

49
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:42,420
And this is the 36% fat diet. This resulted in the mothers a state of of obesity in metabolic syndrome.

50
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,430
And this had some changes to the maternal mental health.

51
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,010
There was signs of greater stress, anxiety and depression.

52
00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:01,629
And within the intrauterine environment, they observed higher levels of glucose surplus rods,

53
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:09,340
free fatty acids at different kinds of changes in the different kinds of different pectin and leptin or oxidative stress,

54
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,180
hypoxia, inflammation and changes in the microbiota.

55
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:28,810
And these and this was theorized to contribute to placental dysfunction and perhaps impaired brain development within the offspring.

56
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:38,080
So it is theorized from these exposures that this led to impaired brain development in the offspring

57
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:45,850
affecting the melodic Jordan pathway and dopamine pathway of the offspring born to these mothers.

58
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:58,240
And in regard to postnatal development, we have alterations in maternal behavior from exposure to this diet and as a consequence

59
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:05,460
it's theorized that this contributed to a greater anxiety among the female offspring,

60
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:13,690
greater aggression among the male offspring and repetitive behavior, um, impaired social behavior in the offspring as well.

61
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:26,769
So it's been theorized based on this long term model in a non-human primate, that these prenatal exposures in this case to environment,

62
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,210
an environment with elevated levels of these macronutrients in utero,

63
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:39,670
that this contributed to the increased risk of mental health, obesity and neurodevelopmental disorders within the offspring.

64
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:53,770
So thus far I've been talking about pregnant women and I have looked for examples in regard to transgender

65
00:08:53,770 --> 00:09:02,650
men in regard to how little environment and transgender matter just might be different than women.

66
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,940
And I was not able to find any publications on this subject.

67
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:17,690
I do know that the NIH is really interested in finding out more information about transgender people and populations and their metabolic health.

68
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,820
So there have been calls for grants to study this population.

69
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,600
And thus far, the information that we have is very, very limited.

70
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,050
So we'll see more about this in the future, whether or not the transgender women,

71
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:43,790
transgender men and women have differences in pregnancy outcomes based on this transition from female to male.

72
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:55,629
Okay. So any questions about prenatal development?

73
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:00,670
And obviously in this particular lecture, did you have any questions?

74
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:06,610
Anybody told me I wasn't sure how to find the animation. Yeah.

75
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,240
Click on the fox. I yeah.

76
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,170
So if you if you move the down arrow, it'll uncover the core itself.

77
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:24,220
Did you find it. Okay. It's a, I use it because it's, it's a way to show one little finger at a time within a big figure to make it less confusing.

78
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:40,200
So at the end of the day. I'm so passionate about the increased my life and change in immuno.

79
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:50,160
So this is it is it hasn't been proposed or like with increased myeloid cells possibly like an

80
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:58,790
auto it auto immune response or some sort of like dysregulated immune response from the general.

81
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:05,940
There's been a lot of most of the research that's been done in the area in terms of changes in bone marrow.

82
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:17,850
Immune cell populations have been done in mice. What they found is that signals that cytokines that particular subsets of immune cells are increased.

83
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:24,120
There's a lot of this, a lot of work looking at what's going on in the in the adipose tissue itself.

84
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:30,480
Within the adipose tissue itself, there's an increase in chemokines that recruit cells that are already in the blood,

85
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,450
and there's an increase in cytokines that cause the bone marrow to make more of these myeloid cell populations.

86
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,240
So in theory, if you have more myeloid cells, you could have more monocytes.

87
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:51,569
And monocytes can play a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis so that you have more monocytes.

88
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:59,490
You could potentially have a greater risk of atherosclerosis later in life or having a greater population of those particular cell types.

89
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:10,770
And then the consequences of that increased risks just that could possibly predispose

90
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:18,360
individuals to not be able to exercise as much as bone marrow populations.

91
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:28,290
You know, it has more to do with having more of these cells in circulation.

92
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,610
And that potentially can can trigger a greater level of inflammation and.

93
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:52,110
Of. So. Next lecture is.

94
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:57,910
And childhood obesity. And. Long time ago,

95
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:05,350
I used to have a guest lecturer give this talk to me looming over the pediatrics and she's

96
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,660
subsequently moved into administration and doesn't have time to do any guest lectures anymore.

97
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,630
So I cover some of the material that she presented.

98
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:23,710
And you had a chance to read Allison Miller actually Fleming's review paper on stress and childhood obesity before class.

99
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,830
So for today, we're going to go over the learning objectives.

100
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,629
So we've already talked about cutoffs for childhood obesity.

101
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:40,540
I'm going to add a little bit more detail in there so that you're aware of how these cutoffs were implemented.

102
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,200
We're going to talk about the prevalence of childhood obesity in children,

103
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:57,070
and we're going to talk a little bit more more detail about race in education level and how it affects these, the prevalence of this.

104
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,050
And then we're going to describe proposed causes of childhood obesity.

105
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,990
And that's the largest section of what I'm going to talk about today.

106
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:14,830
So in terms of treatment strategies, I'm going to talk about that in much greater detail later in the semester.

107
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,030
So how is childhood obesity defined?

108
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,990
Well, this is challenging.

109
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:33,920
You want to set standards that tell you something about the level of adipose tissue or are total body fat percentage,

110
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,470
and you want to create cutoffs that could predict adverse health outcomes.

111
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:46,280
This has been done at the population level and with adults, with children.

112
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:52,580
When the committees met to set the standards for childhood obesity,

113
00:14:53,630 --> 00:15:00,290
the cutoff measurements don't meet this criteria or meet these criteria, I should say, for pediatric populations.

114
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:10,160
So that the cutoff for childhood obesity, 85% overweight or overweight, were based on this expert opinion.

115
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:26,000
So a committee of experts in the field of pediatrics and childhood endocrinology and obesity met, and they came up with the system for these cutoffs.

116
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,920
So they set the cutoff based on the age and sex of the child.

117
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:39,620
And again, this is the international task force who made these recommendations.

118
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,470
And some of the older publications, again,

119
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:49,850
use the old system where you see the risk of overweight and overweight as the criteria for body sizes in children.

120
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:59,510
And so that the new categorization is if you're over that 85th percentile,

121
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:04,190
but below the 90th percentile for for age and gender, that would be considered overweight.

122
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:15,770
The old one, the old way before 1929, it was risk and overweight and forced to be categorized of having obesity as a child.

123
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,540
That would be nine. You'd be in the 90th percentile for the same gender at any age.

124
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,840
The old system before 2009 was at risk.

125
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:37,700
Instead of risk, that overweight would be overweight. So they these measurements are correlated with adiposity and linked to negative health outcomes.

126
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:48,740
But the data here in terms of the cutoffs and health outcomes, this is based on expert opinion rather than empirical data.

127
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:58,760
So you should be aware of that. So I'm showing you this before and it shows you the growth curve here for boys 2 to 20 years of age.

128
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:08,270
And it gives you age and body mass index kilograms per parameter squared, just as we used before.

129
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:21,170
Except that the categorization isn't based on the BMI number, it's based on the percentile that they're in, based on the whole cohort here.

130
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:32,450
So above the 90th percentile for this particular child, they would have a BMI of 23, but they're in the 95th percentile.

131
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:38,059
So they would be considered to have childhood obesity. This example here,

132
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:44,360
the ten year old boy with a BMI of 21 would be categorized as having a being in the

133
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,800
overweight because they're between the 85th percentile and the 95th percentile.

134
00:17:49,490 --> 00:18:03,260
And then and then so on the subsequent designations here for having a being in the lower categories like normal weight and underweight.

135
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:12,110
So those are the categories. And based on those percentile.

136
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,960
Yeah, Kimmie, I'm just confused, I guess that we wouldn't, like, tell people.

137
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,590
I just feel like with in my our other class with growth in maturation, we're talking about, you know,

138
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:28,280
these similar percentiles for height and length or whatever where we were just kind of talking about,

139
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,940
Oh, your child's in the 80 percentile or your trials in the fifth percentile,

140
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,930
because we wouldn't be like, Oh, your child's over height or your child is under height.

141
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,840
We would say, like, it just seems a little weird to say that for this particular thing, I guess.

142
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,050
But maybe we would just say, well, we just not say percentile.

143
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:50,240
So which is used as a screening tool.

144
00:18:51,470 --> 00:19:00,010
So what you're trying to do is trying to figure out you've talked a little bit first about a lot of genetics.

145
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:08,870
Obviously, with with that kind of a you're trying to figure out, okay, if you have a child, that's way off the growth curve, really high.

146
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:21,230
Mm hmm. Okay. Now there's there's an issue here that's that could suggest some type of irregularity in their in their genome that would explain them.

147
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:27,350
Wouldn't that be if it's off the curve, though? Not if it's within the percentiles, it would work off the percentile.

148
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:34,910
Okay. So the same would be true for a child or anyone who is far below these cutoffs.

149
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:49,100
So if you have a child, for example, who has an issue with gluten, so you could have a lower weight child or child who's below these percentiles.

150
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:56,990
And between the ages of 2 to 5, you'll see manifestations of our celiac disease.

151
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,490
So in that way,

152
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:09,890
that's a screening tool to indicate there's an issue with that particular child who might have not consuming enough calories because of that issue.

153
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:19,850
But in terms of of putting them in these different categories, you're trying to figure out where the child falls in relation to everybody else.

154
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,640
Now it's up to kids. When they go to the doctor, they want to see, Oh, how big am I now?

155
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:31,430
Or whatever? And they're excited about getting that number. Am I bigger than my sister and my brother, the kid across the street?

156
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,360
So in their minds, it's just this is I'm big.

157
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,280
I'm you know, I'm I'm growing up.

158
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:50,270
So in their minds, that's great that the discussions of terms of whether or not a child is at risk, that goes on between the parent and the physician.

159
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,780
And that would come into play when you're looking at what's going on with their metabolic parameters.

160
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,390
Okay. So at this stage it's like, okay, this is a screening tool.

161
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,450
Is there are there issues with metabolic parameters?

162
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:10,239
And if there are, then you would start to talk about whether or not, okay, we've got to intervene.

163
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:18,550
We have a child who has excess adiposity. We need to to talk to the parents about diet, physical activity and so on.

164
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,410
So this is a screening tool. Remember, your mind is a screening tool.

165
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:31,360
It's a white instrument. It's great at the population level in terms of what's going on at the individual level, you need more information.

166
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:42,780
So when you look at this overall trend, you can see an increase in this,

167
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:50,640
the prevalence of childhood obesity at all ages and the different lines correspond to the different ages of children.

168
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,590
And the blue line represents all children.

169
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,840
So you can see since the early sixties, this has increased.

170
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:05,340
You see kind of a leveling off in the last 20 years.

171
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:18,690
And there have been a lot of different things that have been tried at the population level in terms of programs implemented to reverse this trend.

172
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:30,240
And we're seeing changes in the very youngest group and kind of an upward trend with the older groups.

173
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:36,120
But some of these changes could and could represent what's happened economically.

174
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:48,720
So this change here after 27, 2008, this was thought to be a consequence of the Great Recession, but we're not really sure.

175
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:59,100
So you report this information and the enhanced database and you suggest that there might that may have been a consequence.

176
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:06,240
It's an association. So some kind of was used.

177
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,190
There was used. There was a percentile that was used for the BMI.

178
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:21,120
So this is the prevalence of childhood obesity. So we're talking about children that are exceeding the threshold of the 90 to 90 fifth percentile.

179
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,630
Okay. Yeah, because it's a.

180
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:36,620
With the past few slides, it seems a bit problematic because as the whole population's BMI shifts upward and the percentile tends to change.

181
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:42,290
So you would think that two and. Will that change in the future?

182
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:48,590
Yeah. So then like then like the 95th percentile again can probably have to shift down to classify.

183
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:55,129
Yeah, that's the risk factor. Right. That's exactly what is what is this?

184
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,860
If time goes on and we see this upward trend, what's the what's the category?

185
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,200
You can only have 5% in the upper, but then it's more than that.

186
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:08,089
So this is based on a historical sample. So I don't know.

187
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,389
I can't give you the historical sample data. Exactly.

188
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,840
But it's it's a historical sample in terms of what you're seeing here.

189
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,770
Okay. So they don't like readjustments every year? I don't think so, no.

190
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:34,040
Yeah. But you know, that growth chart is from 2004 growth and I think from the CDC about growth, 2010, 2000, it's like over 20 years old.

191
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:41,690
And yeah, as far as I know, there aren't new growth charts that represent what's going on better use for 2022.

192
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:47,930
But perhaps that's the case. It's it's what you're saying of 2000 and that's what everybody is still using.

193
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:57,320
And again, it's a historical sample. I don't know how far it goes back and I don't know how many children are continuing use for this chart.

194
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:12,130
So in terms of race and ethnicity, the higher prevalence of childhood obesity is has been observed.

195
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:22,900
And Hispanic children, followed by non-Hispanic black children and non-Hispanic whites, and then finally non-Hispanic Asians.

196
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:32,920
So I couldn't find an up to date bar graph from the CDC to represent these values, but this was mentioned in some of the background reading.

197
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:41,620
So this follows similar trends that we see with adults in terms of who or what ethnic or race populations

198
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:49,840
have a higher prevalence of these particular reaching these particular thresholds for body size.

199
00:25:52,720 --> 00:26:06,760
So I showed you diagrams are graphs before looking at trends and the percentage of childhood obesity over the years in regard to household income.

200
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:24,340
So this shows you what's been going on in the last. This data was collected between 1908 1999 and until the period of assessment ended 2011 2014.

201
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:28,120
This data was published in 2018.

202
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:37,780
So I can't give you if trend information after this, but it shows you the same kinds of things that we talked about earlier,

203
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:42,370
where if you were in the category with the lowest income.

204
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:51,370
So the salad bar here are our line, I should say, represents less than 130% of the federal poverty level.

205
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,120
And these girls and boys are more likely to have.

206
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,500
Or however, there is a higher percentage of childhood obesity in this group.

207
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:12,110
Then we see the heavy dash line where you have 130 to 350% of the federal poverty level.

208
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:19,490
And then finally, the dotted lines where we have the lowest level of childhood obesity.

209
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:25,040
If you had a household income greater than 350% of the federal poverty level.

210
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:34,610
So suggesting that lower income children who grow up in lower income households have a greater risk.

211
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:46,490
And then we're looking at here education level of the parents heads of the household, and we see a similar trend.

212
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:56,480
Children who grow up in homes with parents who have less education, just a high school education, are more likely to have had obesity.

213
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,780
And you have some college and then a college education.

214
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:08,660
And we see similar trends where these percentages decline with more education.

215
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,590
So are these factors,

216
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:23,360
race and ethnicity and the education level of the heads of the household have a significant impact on the level of childhood obesity.

217
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:31,130
And the trends seem to be going upward, but these lines appear to be relatively flat during this particular time period.

218
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:44,140
So here are some consequences. Children who have obesity are more likely to have a high blood pressure,

219
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:51,790
elevated cholesterol levels, increased risk of impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance,

220
00:28:53,140 --> 00:29:02,110
as well as obstructive sleep apnea, joint and musculoskeletal discomfort, fatty liver gallstones,

221
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:08,170
gastroesophageal reflux or heartburn, and then future health risks associated with this.

222
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:13,540
There's also a significant psychological burden associated with this.

223
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:24,490
Kids who are affected by obesity are more likely to have anxiety and depression and low self-esteem as a consequence of bullying from their peers.

224
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:32,570
And this is a significant problem in this particular population.

225
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:39,320
And there are programs within education systems to reduce this.

226
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:46,820
However, none and not implemented in every school system. And so this is going to be a persistent problem.

227
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:53,600
And this is has to be addressed. And we've got to stop blaming people for their body sizes.

228
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,510
And this goes down to the pediatric level as well.

229
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:02,300
If children learn that this is inappropriate, perhaps when they reach adulthood, they'll learn this as well.

230
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:09,990
Okay. So why are we seeing an increased prevalence of childhood obesity?

231
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:21,840
I just finished the lecture on the perinatal environment and we talked a little bit about a bit about diet and how that's changed,

232
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:28,140
where there's an increased availability of calories, increased number of calories, and there's gene environment interactions.

233
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:35,790
But I'm going to talk a bit more in regard to childhood obesity and causes in terms of physical activity,

234
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:43,590
family environment, stress, which was the focus of the paper that I had, all of the read and then the built environment.

235
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:51,990
And I have one slide that discusses what's happened during the COVID pandemic to kind of highlight

236
00:30:53,070 --> 00:31:02,220
the importance of the schools and social interaction is to preventing childhood obesity.

237
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,120
So I was thought to be the most important contributor to childhood obesity.

238
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:20,390
And we've seen an increase in the consumption of highly processed food, rich macronutrients and lower in micronutrients.

239
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:27,260
And I showed you that Kevan Hall paper in the Kevin Hart paper discussed how highly processed

240
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:33,530
food can affect how much food people consume and the rate at which they consume it.

241
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:36,350
The same would be true with what's going on in children.

242
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:45,260
But in terms of studies that have looked at children of pediatric populations and regard to highly processed food,

243
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,570
the example that's often given is sugar sweetened beverages.

244
00:31:52,230 --> 00:32:00,270
So a number of years ago, there was a huge focus on sugar sweetened beverages as the driving force for childhood obesity.

245
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:11,669
There was huge arguments in the in the scientific and popular literature about high fructose corn sirup and segment of the population.

246
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:19,709
And some pediatricians were convinced that high fructose high fructose corn sirup

247
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:24,120
was the problem and that if we eliminate high fructose corn sirup from our diets,

248
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,530
there's a problem with your way.

249
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:38,270
And as you look at this very closely and examine what's in high fructose corn sirup versus conventional sweetener sucrose,

250
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:45,360
you find that very little difference. So these are the kinds of studies that work done to look at trends in childhood

251
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,830
obesity and associations with a consumption of sugar sweetened beverages.

252
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:58,380
Now, I showed you data last time showing that the population as a whole is reducing their level of sugar sweetened beverage consumption.

253
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:09,960
So people are following the guidelines to to reduce that and still see an uptick in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults.

254
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,860
So clearly eliminating or reducing the from the side is not having the desired effect.

255
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:29,320
Then there's the theory that it's lack of physical activity that the children are spending too much time on with sedentary type activities,

256
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:34,870
viewing videos, not engaging in physical activity or exercise.

257
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:45,490
So it's thought that this time spent watching television displaces physical activity and this potentially drives weight.

258
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:58,480
So this adds the potential for the consumption of high calorie foods during television viewing or video viewing.

259
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:06,340
An awful lot of ads now for sugar sweetened beverages, calorie dense foods.

260
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:15,310
And it's theorized that this increases caloric consumption and this is a driving force.

261
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:27,760
And the other part of the equation is that this is sedentary behavior and exposure to a couple of foods.

262
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:34,540
The other part of the equation is the lack of regular physical activity and how a number of school

263
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:42,720
systems have reduced or have fewer opportunities for children to engage in physical activity.

264
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,670
Physical education programs and some school systems have been reduced to a minimum or eliminated altogether.

265
00:34:49,610 --> 00:35:05,730
And. You have issues in terms of law in areas where you have limited access to safe areas for children to play and become physically active.

266
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:16,110
And perhaps this is a driving force and this partially explains why we see a greater prevalence of childhood obesity in certain populations.

267
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:24,299
But is there proof of this? Is there empirical evidence that these two things, these drivers,

268
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:35,670
TV viewing or physical activity are affecting a child's level of weight and adiposity?

269
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:45,060
Well, in order to answer this question, you'd have to do a longitudinal study with a relatively large population of children,

270
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:49,950
and then you'd have to collect a lot of information about their physical activity levels,

271
00:35:51,510 --> 00:36:02,040
their diets, and their viewing time for television and the amount of time that they spent in the sedentary and sedentary activities.

272
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,360
So there was a study done by chance at all.

273
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,790
Is there anything on 2017?

274
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:20,570
And they looked at this and they provide they had a study that whose purpose was to examine the associations among physical activity,

275
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:28,640
sedentary time and TV viewing with fat, mass and visceral adipose tissue mass in childhood through adolescence.

276
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:35,180
So they were following these children from the age of five to the age of 19, a period of 14 years.

277
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:47,460
So this is a really ambitious study. And they're looking to determine if physical activity and TV viewing affected adiposity and children.

278
00:36:50,250 --> 00:37:00,630
So this data was collected and the I'm a bone health development study.

279
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,800
So this is a subset of children that were enrolled in this study.

280
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:21,310
And they had that data at the end from 230 boys and two girls, and they examined them at ages five, eight, 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19.

281
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:29,970
So roughly every two or three years. And in order to determine their physical activity levels,

282
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:39,090
they actually gave them these accelerometers and accelerometers, something you can wear on your wrist.

283
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:43,800
And it can tell a researcher about your activity during that time.

284
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:56,430
So if you're moving, if you're sedentary, if you are walking, if you are running, doing sports,

285
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:03,090
there are algorithms that are in place that can determine what you know, what your physical activity level was.

286
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:11,190
And the way they quantitative physical activity was to use the Met metric.

287
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,100
So this is the metabolic equivalent metric.

288
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:27,839
And they used the threshold of performance as an indicator of having a moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity for light intensity,

289
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,060
physical activity. They set the boundaries at 1.6 to 3.9 sets.

290
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:40,300
And then for sedentary behavior activity, they set the values at 1 to 1.5 sets.

291
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:46,710
So this was a objective way to measure physical activity.

292
00:38:50,020 --> 00:39:02,950
So for two TV viewing outlets per day, the parents would report on a regular basis the TV viewing for children when they were 5 to 8 years of age,

293
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,760
when the children got to be 11 years of age,

294
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:12,639
which the children themselves reported their TV viewing time, which, as everyone knows,

295
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,670
an 11 year old may not give you the most honest answers in terms of their TV viewing time.

296
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,460
But this is what they use in this particular study.

297
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:36,350
And then for body composition, they did DEXA scans, so they were able to calculate total fat mass and visceral fat tissue masses.

298
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:47,480
And then they were from this information, able to create sex specific growth models to create fat, mass and visceral adipose tissue growth curves.

299
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:55,610
And they were able to test the effect of physical activity or sedentary behavior and

300
00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:02,209
TV viewing time on whether or not that was associated or correlated with with fat,

301
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:09,440
mass and visceral activity. And then they made adjustments for weight, height, linear age, nonlinear age and maturity.

302
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,990
This is what they found.

303
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:24,899
So based on the growth models, they found that low levels of of moderate to vigorous physical activity were associated with higher levels of fat,

304
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:31,080
mass and visceral adipose tissue for males and higher levels of fat mass for females.

305
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:37,520
So in regard to TV viewing,

306
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:46,490
they showed that TV viewing was positively associated with having a greater fat mass or visceral adipose tissue mass in both males and females.

307
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:56,510
And then lower physical activity was positively associated with that mass in males.

308
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,880
And then an interesting finding of this particular study was the sedentary time.

309
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:13,950
The time in which they had the lowest level of energy expenditure was not associated with fat, mass or visceral tissue in male or females.

310
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:22,959
So this would argue that the important thing in terms of following guidelines for physical activity in children,

311
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,980
which is 60 minutes of physical activity a day for children,

312
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:41,350
is that it's moderate, physical and vigorous physical activity time that's most important rather than the sedentary time.

313
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:50,620
So we spent an awful lot of time, as do children do, sitting in front of devices, screens, phones and so on.

314
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,700
And that has increased our sedentary time.

315
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:03,090
But in order to. Look at what is driving an increase in adiposity.

316
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:09,570
It's not having enough modest, vigorous physical activity rather than the sedentary time.

317
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:15,450
Another thing that they found was the contribution of high TV viewing.

318
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:21,390
It's not it's not the high sedentary time. It's the high TV viewing that's a problem.

319
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:31,230
And this was thought to be related to what children see on TV.

320
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:40,590
Would you think it'd be more likely that people who are doing high physical activity would also care more about their diet?

321
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:45,170
Maybe that would be an association. Yeah. So that's a confounding factor, right?

322
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:51,629
That's something that could. These are associations and these studies are really hard to do because you you can control

323
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:55,110
for some things or you can measure something for which you can't measure everything.

324
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:00,320
Right. So yeah. So if people are more physically active,

325
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:10,280
perhaps another aspect of that an individual is that they their diets are have more things and vegetables can include

326
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,480
more fruits and vegetables and that might be a confounding factor and that might contribute to this as well.

327
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:25,099
So yeah, certainly. So in regard to TV viewing, it could be uniquely associated with that.

328
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:33,770
It has a sense it's associated with snacking behavior in which you consume more calories than you think you might.

329
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,260
It promotes unhealthy food preferences because you're exposed to advertisements.

330
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:46,300
And children, particularly children under the age of under the age of five,

331
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:53,650
can't discriminate between what's real and what's truth in terms of advertisements.

332
00:43:54,290 --> 00:44:03,520
This is a huge problem. So there's been calls from public health professionals to completely eliminate marketing to children.

333
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:10,180
But as you can see, you can go down any grocery store aisle where there's breakfast cereals and you can see what this is.

334
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:19,150
That's not been implemented. The other thing that's interesting about TV viewing is that it affects sleep behavior.

335
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:26,230
So if you're exposed to lots of television or screen time, in the case of modern times now,

336
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,770
it can cause sleep disturbances and this can have an influence on total.

337
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:42,930
But there are a number of limitations. This is just one study. But the reason why I showed this study is very,

338
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:48,390
very few studies have followed people over this long period of time and looked at these types of outcomes.

339
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:53,189
These kids were in Iowa. They were living around the University of Iowa.

340
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:58,440
So these are white kids and they're mostly and that's a higher socioeconomic status.

341
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:08,040
So we don't we can't use this as something that might pertain to people living in other areas of other races and ethnicities.

342
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:15,430
There were a number of participants who dropped out of the study at the later ages.

343
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:19,060
So that kind of limits the interpretations of the study.

344
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:24,340
And then there's this potential for reverse causation in terms of, okay,

345
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:31,690
more physical activity could displace you in time or more TV and time could displace more physical activity.

346
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:38,140
So there's this problem of reverse causation. This is a longitudinal study.

347
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:42,100
We can show associations, but they show cause and effect relationships.

348
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,609
It's very difficult to. Yeah, I'm sure I remember.

349
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:54,860
Maybe in this class we read a paper about the TV viewing and snacking did not apply to the black population.

350
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,890
Remember that? Yeah. Yeah. Right. So the results might not apply to everyone.

351
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:04,729
Very, very true. And these. These are associations showing cause and effect.

352
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:08,140
Relations with any kind of a study cohort is difficult.

353
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:12,170
You'll find lots of differences in the literature about these types of studies.

354
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:22,520
So there's been a fair amount of discussion about the family environment and how that affects getting behavior in children.

355
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:29,580
And the family environment can be a significant source of stress, as you can see in the paper that you read about.

356
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:35,100
And so we'll talk about stress here in a minute.

357
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:43,620
But the family environment we're talking about now, parenting models and how that affects eating behavior in children.

358
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:52,230
So inappropriate or a lack of appropriate parent or modeling for eating behavior can affect a child's food choice.

359
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,670
So if a child is never presented with fruits and vegetables because they didn't want to eat them,

360
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:04,770
a lot of times it's it's more than likely that throughout their childhood that they're not going to eat fruits and vegetables that are very,

361
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:13,460
very little of them. The child will look at the parent in terms of what they're eating and copy their eating behaviors.

362
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:22,850
So if a parent has has made healthy choices, has made significant efforts for real planning,

363
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:25,820
this is going to affect the child's eating behavior as well.

364
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:37,190
So there are studies that have looked at parenting style and how it affects eating behavior in children.

365
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:50,990
Some of you may have heard this. So some categories that parenting styles fall into are authoritative, authoritarian, permissive and neglectful.

366
00:47:52,280 --> 00:48:03,410
And looking at this as a way to describe parenting style, perhaps this is associated with a greater risk of childhood obesity.

367
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:10,670
A number of studies have looked at this, but which one, which parenting style presents a greater risk?

368
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:20,870
So further descriptions about these different parenting styles you have on the top high and low expectations for self-control.

369
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:26,600
And then on the left, you have high sensitivity and low sensitivity.

370
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:33,160
So the top you're expecting the child to take responsibility for their actions in the last year.

371
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:45,590
You're engaged with the child. You pay attention to them and you're sensitive to their their needs and things that are going on in their lives.

372
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:58,640
So within this framework you have authoritative in which the respectful to the child's opinion but you maintain clear boundaries.

373
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:04,650
There's the permissive parenting style that's indulgent, without discipline.

374
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:11,700
You're very sensitive to the child's needs, wants concerns, but you don't set any boundaries.

375
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:18,870
There's this authoritarian parenting style that's a strict disciplinarian.

376
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:24,030
Think of a drill sergeant and this type of parenting style. And they're neglectful.

377
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:29,850
And in this particular parenting style, there isn't a parenting style. The parent doesn't pay enough attention to the child.

378
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:34,500
They don't set boundaries. And the child is pretty much on their own to make all of their decisions.

379
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:48,810
So I'm looking at parenting style and whether or not a first grader would fall within these overweight categories.

380
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,750
And again, this was published before 2009,

381
00:49:51,750 --> 00:50:01,620
so that the designation of whether or not the child would fall in these different categories in this particular paper was overweight,

382
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:05,850
which would be having a BMI of 95 in the 90th percentile.

383
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:11,790
But later on, the label was included.

384
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:21,260
That I'll show you in the next slide. So this was a study funded by the National Institutes of Child Health,

385
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:33,860
the study of early child care and youth development and children with complete data for parenting parameters at 4554 months of age.

386
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:39,980
And they measured weight, height and the first grade. And these were included in the analysis.

387
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:50,060
And they considered a cutoff of having a BMI greater than the 90th percentile, now considered to have a B obesity in the childhood population.

388
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:56,690
And they looked at the four different parenting styles and they constructed two scales,

389
00:50:56,690 --> 00:51:01,400
namely a total sensitivity and maternal expectations of a child's self-control.

390
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,950
They analyzed the data with a multivariate logistic regression analysis.

391
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:20,750
We evaluated the relationship between parenting style and overweight in the first graders, and they controlled for gender,

392
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:27,880
race, maternal education, income needs ratio, marital status, and childhood behavior problems.

393
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,190
This is what they found.

394
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:42,770
So they use this um percent obis to record to recommend to indicate the children who were above this threshold of the 90th percentile.

395
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:54,460
And this is what they found. So in terms of the parenting style, um, within these families where you had the highest level of, of,

396
00:51:54,500 --> 00:52:02,690
of childhood obesity, it was the authoritarian style that had the highest percentage of obesity in children.

397
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:11,690
And these were the drill sergeants, the parents with high expectations, with poor self-control and low sensitivity,

398
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:18,500
and the parenting style with the lowest percent of children with obesity was the authoritative.

399
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:28,430
The parents who were had high expectations for self-control, but who were engaged in the students other children's lives.

400
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:38,000
And they were very sensitive to the children's needs. And again, this data was adjusted for incomes to needs ratio and rates.

401
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:46,230
So when Julie Fleming used to tell this story, she got a lot of attention from the press about this.

402
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:50,340
Some many. Much of it was not good in terms of judgment.

403
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:57,059
And so this is just a small a relatively small sample of individuals.

404
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:08,580
And whether or not the parenting style, the family environment could influence the greater risk of of childhood obesity.

405
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:13,980
So here is the conclusion statement among the four parenting styles.

406
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,850
Authoritarian parenting was associated with the highest risk of overweight.

407
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:23,220
Again, this is above the 90th percentile. Publishing 26.

408
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,990
Understanding the mechanism through which parenting styles are associated,

409
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:32,280
overweight risk may lead to develop more comprehensive and better targeted interventions.

410
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:42,820
So a significant bit of attention has been focused on childhood stressful experiences.

411
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:50,500
And as you read the paper, you could see that this was a significant factor in many different aspects of students lives.

412
00:53:50,800 --> 00:54:01,540
I'm sorry, children's lives. So you have early life stress exposure from many different sources within the family.

413
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:08,110
And externally there are acute stressors, an interaction with a bully.

414
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,790
Being teased for one's race or ethnicity.

415
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:19,010
There could be a stressor related to one's socioeconomic background,

416
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:26,330
but there could be issues in terms of their environment that that a child is raised in.

417
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,500
And these stressors affect the parent and the child.

418
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:38,840
And then there are interactions between these stressors and how the parent and child experiences these

419
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:45,860
factors so that the stressor affects the biology and the mental health of the parent and the child.

420
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:52,190
And how a parent reacts to these stressors can significantly impact the child's emotion,

421
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:58,160
and it can influence a child's self-regulation, their biology and their health behaviors.

422
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:06,200
Yeah, I actually was wondering about this when I was reading the article about the cried out parenting style.

423
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:19,010
I couldn't find a lot in the literature, but do you think it could be a stressor contributing or do you think she cried out?

424
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:23,460
It may not be as damaging as previously thought.

425
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:28,129
So I'm not real familiar with that literature. And I don't know.

426
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:35,900
I guess not. But I guess they're just trying to kind of connect the two with the parenting style but in its much earlier state.

427
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,910
Oh, I see. I see what you're saying. Okay.

428
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:46,660
If you were referring to the infant's cry, if I think, oh, no, yeah, I know about aces, I know about Ace, I'm talking about the cried out.

429
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:50,540
I feel like it would be dependent on the attachment that the mother would have.

430
00:55:51,170 --> 00:56:00,890
Yes, but they've had some confounding. So you're referring to when an infant cries out to the mother and let it cry.

431
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:13,100
So yeah, instead of intervening like this, it's a different approach and there's been a lot of criticism and ambivalence.

432
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:18,160
So I didn't have a clear understanding of what was going on in the literature.

433
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:20,660
And I was wondering again, yeah,

434
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:32,150
I don't know that that is that is an interesting area of research and that can significantly influence by the parent's level of stress.

435
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:36,950
So if a parent is experiencing lots of stress, for whatever reason,

436
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:42,139
they may withdraw and that might make them have a greater tendency to adopt that particular

437
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:46,280
style that the child cry it out because they don't have the energy to put into that,

438
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,280
to pay attention to this child's needs as much.

439
00:56:51,830 --> 00:57:03,380
So the background paper went to great detail to discuss how stress during the life of the child affects the parent and the child.

440
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:10,340
And truly, the man has done a fair amount of research looking at stress,

441
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:20,900
cortisol and eating behavior and and based on a theory that stress increases emotional eating and a greater risk of obesity.

442
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:31,070
Um, she came up with the theory that children who are less able to cope with stress perhaps turn to highly palatable food.

443
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:35,520
And this is an engagement in comfort eat.

444
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:42,850
And this provides some comfort from stress and stress.

445
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:51,859
It can can increase cortisol and the increase in stress and response to daily activities,

446
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:57,910
the diurnal pattern and the acute increase in cortisol can affect eating behavior.

447
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:09,770
Um, and the levels of cortisol can change if you have chronic stressful interactions or responses in ways that you might not predict.

448
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:12,830
And I gave you an example in the paper that you read earlier.

449
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:25,390
So we know that cortisol does increase appetite. And stress can shift food preferences to more highly palatable foods and comfort foods.

450
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:30,370
And perhaps that leads to an increase in caloric consumption.

451
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:42,850
And it's thought that the greater consumption of these comfort foods can dampen the stress hormone access and make a child feel better.

452
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:53,320
So let's first look at patterns of cortisol in a daily pattern and in a reaction to stress.

453
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:58,360
When I'm about to show you, here are examples of healthy patterns of cortisol.

454
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:03,490
So cortisol levels and here we have a graph between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m.

455
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:09,090
Cortisol increases during the Daily Journal pattern.

456
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:20,780
It's the highest in the morning. It declines to lower levels by noon, and for the rest of the day, it goes down to lower levels.

457
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:38,840
And when we look at an acute reaction of stress, we find that with the stress or cortisol levels can peak very quickly within about 10 to 45 minutes.

458
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:54,630
Having worked with with mice, I can tell you that it can peak within minutes in a mouse and perhaps of that, they can occur faster than this.

459
00:59:54,650 --> 01:00:02,510
But what we're seeing in their here, and that's an example of humans with after it reaches its peak, it declines thereafter.

460
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:12,230
And this is under the assumption of, okay, this is a regular day where we're not experiencing lots of life stressors.

461
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:17,770
And with this stress response, it's assumed that there's a stress.

462
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:23,100
We get a cortisol peak in the client because we're not paying attention to the stressor anymore.

463
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:26,490
Okay. What happens in real life is a little bit different.

464
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:36,510
So here is an example of the read, the normal cortisol response.

465
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:44,670
That's the pattern that you would find during a day. And then a couple of examples of abnormal patterns of cortisol.

466
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:52,350
So in the dashed blue line, this is a hyper response to stress during from daily stressors.

467
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:55,370
In the dotted green line.

468
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:09,770
We have a high both response to stress throughout the day and the same type of pattern you might see in an acute reaction to stress.

469
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:14,360
So the red is the the normal pattern.

470
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:20,150
The blue is an indicator this time of no response to that acute stressor.

471
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:26,090
And the green line is in response to where there's no decline.

472
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:30,379
We're in response to that stress or cortisol levels are elevated.

473
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:45,390
The stress response continues. So the theory in which cortisol patterns could become abnormal are based on an accumulation of stressful events.

474
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:53,400
So for a child, this could be going to school and experiencing stress from just, you know,

475
01:01:53,460 --> 01:02:03,540
having to do assignments and taking exams and perhaps a kid getting bullied and and worrying about catching

476
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:10,050
the bus on the way home and all of the other types of stressors that they might experience during the day.

477
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:22,280
So collectively over time, there's this a cortisol, stress response, reactivity that starts to burn out and declines over time.

478
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:30,710
There's less reaction to stress in terms of the cortisol response and the diurnal pattern changes.

479
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:34,459
So here's the normal pattern. Here's the hyper responsive pattern.

480
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:41,300
And with age, as you're experiencing more of these life stressors, the pattern declines.

481
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:44,420
You have this hyper responsiveness to stress over time.

482
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:53,750
So here are some hypotheses. Here's a hypothesized pathway.

483
01:02:54,980 --> 01:03:06,260
So you have stress that could lead to aberrant patterns of cortisol fever, elevated or responsive or low levels of cortisol.

484
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:17,120
This could promote unhealthy behaviors, and this can increase one's risk for obesity.

485
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:33,290
So if you would show this picture of a child reaching for a cookie and in terms of a child coming up with strategies to release to relieve stress,

486
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:41,240
the sense of feeling overwhelmed are fairly limited, especially if a child between the ages of two and five years of age.

487
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:48,310
So this is a strategy to reduce the sensation of feeling stressed or burnt.

488
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:53,780
Having a burned out stress response is to consume highly palatable foods, making them feel better,

489
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:57,650
helping them not think about the stressful events that have happened in their lives.

490
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:12,020
So this is a couple of papers or a summary of a couple of papers by Julie Lemming and Allison Miller,

491
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:19,940
where they were looking at low income preschoolers and they had a greater level of psychosocial stress at home.

492
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:26,330
And in these children, they observed this flatter pattern of daily cortisol.

493
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:38,000
And a flatter pattern of daily cortisol was linked to reduced satiety responsiveness and more emotional overeating, which then predicted overweight.

494
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:47,569
And when they looked at acute stressors, they found that there was a blunted quarter of cortisol response to stressors,

495
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:52,170
and this was also linked to a higher BMI. Yeah.

496
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:57,690
So the first bullet, the flatter you're talking about the high flat or low flat.

497
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:02,910
So this would be the. Huh? I saw what you're saying.

498
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:07,860
Yeah. Flatter patterns of the daily cortisol.

499
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:15,480
So what I think they're saying here is this is a hypo responsiveness because of that altitude level of.

500
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:19,620
So this is flat. This is the flatter pattern. So this part still goes up.

501
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:22,910
The hyper pattern still goes up. A ladder pattern doesn't.

502
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:30,100
I believe that's what they're referring to. So.

503
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:37,190
Based on this hypothesis.

504
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:48,950
There was a study done in Ypsilanti with lower income children, and they were looking at children that worked at about 56 months of age.

505
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,510
Here's their graphic white, black and Hispanic children.

506
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:59,990
And they looked at a series of behavioral tasks designed to elicit stress.

507
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:05,690
This is an acute stress model. And they measured salivary cortisol.

508
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:09,080
Four of five times during this stress period.

509
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:12,080
And they used an area under the curve to.

510
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:19,150
Collect data as the calculated data point for the cortisol response.

511
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:23,260
And in terms of the child's body size,

512
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:29,530
they calculated their BMI and they calculated Z scores and they used linear

513
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:34,490
regression to evaluate the association between cortisol under these under the area,

514
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:40,479
the area under the curve and BMI C score and they controlled for child age, sex,

515
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:47,800
race, ethnicity and whether or not the child was non-Hispanic white or not.

516
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:57,940
And to elicit a stress response in a child on these acute stressor tests, it's really interesting how they do this.

517
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:06,520
And you don't want to do something that stresses a child out, but there's a way that you can provoke a stress response that is not traumatic.

518
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:12,190
So in this particular study.

519
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:18,720
So they're collecting salivary cortisol, not very stressful to the child.

520
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:23,040
And they bring a child in an environment and they have an examiner.

521
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:27,660
And the examiner plays with the child for about 20 minutes with toys.

522
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:40,170
And then after that period of time, the examiner presents a child with a toy car or some valued item, a deflated ball or a broken comb.

523
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:44,400
And in a child's mind, you know, they know the value of those different toys.

524
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:50,790
And the evaluator says, you know, if you perform these tasks,

525
01:07:52,710 --> 01:08:02,580
drawing a perfect circle or solving a puzzle in a certain amount of time, you get to have this particular favorite item.

526
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:08,360
And in some cases it was a brand new car or something else, something that the child really wanted.

527
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:16,469
So, of course, most of us can't draw a perfect circle and a and a six year old can't either.

528
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:21,330
And they were trying to draw these perfect circles and examiner would say, try again.

529
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:27,220
Now, that's that's not a perfect circle. Try again. The raising the stress level in the child.

530
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:35,710
They were then presented with a puzzle that they had to complete within a given period of time.

531
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:40,239
And in some cases, the puzzle had the wrong pieces.

532
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:48,940
And so it was impossible to solve the puzzle, to put all the pieces together, or they were given another type of a task.

533
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:57,250
That was way above the level of the child's ability. All of these induce an acute stress response in these child.

534
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:02,990
And after the time of evaluation, the examiner would take, oh,

535
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:08,669
and another area of the room and say they're going to wrap up that prize and they

536
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:13,560
would give the child the least desired prize based on their initial evaluation.

537
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:19,410
And during this time, they're taking samples to measure the stress response of their child.

538
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:25,260
And at the end, it's like, Oh, I'm only kidding.

539
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:29,640
I'll give you the prize that you desired. So then they they go happy.

540
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:34,810
But when they looked at the cortisol levels in these children during this acute stressor,

541
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:40,890
this is what they found that the cortisol response was blunted.

542
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:45,059
So there was a blunted cortisol reactivity to a stressor.

543
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:52,500
And the children who were in the overweight category compared to those who had this who were in the normal weight category.

544
01:09:56,690 --> 01:10:06,500
And the paper that you read, um, mentioned other studies that have tried to measure this responsiveness to stress.

545
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:09,860
And there's mixed data in the literature,

546
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:21,770
but having an abnormal response to stress and having a low level of cortisol could be an indicator of a chronic life stress.

547
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:30,020
So when you read papers on cortisol levels, you have to consider is it elevated or is it below the level that you would expect?

548
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:33,350
And these would be considered abnormal responses to stress.

549
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:38,740
And this could be a significant factor in the physiology of the individuals.

550
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:52,610
So the built environment has had a significant effect on the prevalence of body size in children.

551
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:59,590
We're living in a society that's automobile based and this is done on purpose.

552
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:06,799
So we have a lot of people living in areas that accommodate the automobile so that we can move around more,

553
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:13,160
so we can buy more stuff and support businesses based on this model of transportation.

554
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:21,679
And because of that many areas, particularly in the suburbs, they lack sidewalks.

555
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:26,960
So there's less availability of public pleasant places to move around.

556
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:31,880
And many neighborhoods lack community parks.

557
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:37,940
Um, neighborhoods that were built in the sixties, seventies and eighties lacked a lot of these spaces.

558
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:44,070
On community parks, playgrounds, bike paths and so on.

559
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:48,030
We're seeing more and more neighborhoods that are being built with these communities added.

560
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:54,450
But this is really important not only for physical activity, but for social interactions.

561
01:11:54,540 --> 01:12:02,399
So for parts of our society where we don't have this, there's less physical activity, there's less social interaction.

562
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:11,370
And all of this contributes to a lower quality of life and increases the risk of having a higher body weight.

563
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:25,110
So in order to address these concerns, a lot of people in the world who study childhood obesity and prevention updated.

564
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:33,180
Ludwig, who's at the Boston Children's Hospital, came up with a number of suggestions and suggestions.

565
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:43,350
So it's fairly simple, and I'll show you a slide at the very end suggesting that what you're suggesting is is very real.

566
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:51,180
And so we need to have an affordable, effective programs to reduce childhood obesity.

567
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:54,900
And we need something that's reproduced large scale.

568
01:12:56,090 --> 01:13:05,720
So there are children who have high levels of obesity and they have to be treated on an individual basis.

569
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:10,490
This is something that cannot be translated to the large scale.

570
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:14,780
We don't have enough pediatric specialists to address this.

571
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:23,030
So the focus in childhood obesity should be on prevention, targeting key drivers of obesity on an individual and community and national level.

572
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:28,370
And the place to start is in school nutrition programs and physical activity,

573
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:37,910
things that encourage a child to be engaged in more of this higher level of physical activity, modest to vigorous physical activity.

574
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:48,850
And at a community level, we need to invest more in social infrastructure parks, playgrounds, bike paths to promote an active lifestyle.

575
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:58,510
And then we need to redirect subsidies that are given to farms that grow things that produce lots of

576
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:06,129
highly palatable food and shift that to things that are less calorie dense fruits and vegetables,

577
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:09,490
making them less expensive, making them more accessible to everyone.

578
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:15,310
And then banning food advertising to children.

579
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:25,120
And I wanted to add these last couple of slides here to demonstrate the importance of some of these concepts.

580
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:29,860
So we had a major disruption in regular activities and children.

581
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:33,340
There were many of them shifted to remote schooling.

582
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:43,480
They had less social interaction, less physical activity because some of the parks were actually shut down because of the pandemic.

583
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:56,320
And there is some anecdotal evidence about changes in food preferences during the time there's a greater craving for locally dense foods.

584
01:14:57,070 --> 01:15:00,850
And this was just a simple survey done with this particular website.

585
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:09,280
So these disruptions cause changes in physical activity, social interactions, precedence for food.

586
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:15,130
And what effect did this have on the larger populations and the children?

587
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:28,630
Well, data is starting to come out now. And this was a paper published in the CDC website Morbidity and Mortality Weekly,

588
01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:35,620
and it looked at trends in a subset of individuals, about a 400,000 children.

589
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:41,440
And it looked at their BMI trends before during the COVID 19 pandemic.

590
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:45,790
So this is between 19 2018 and 2020.

591
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:57,520
And it shows you trends in estimated BMI for 3 to 5 year olds, 6 to 11, 12 to 17 and 18 to 20 year olds.

592
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:05,290
And you can see that in general, there's an upward shift during the pandemic period.

593
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:14,530
So before the pandemic, we see this slight increase, most notable at 6 to 11 year olds in terms of the different categories.

594
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,500
So the lines represent different classes,

595
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:26,560
and I don't know why they didn't just use the monikers that we normally use for these these levels of obesity and overweight.

596
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:34,479
But this is what they chose for this paper. So infants of 3 to 5 year olds and 6 to 11 year olds,

597
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:42,970
we see this change in the prevalence of these different categories of estimated BMI during the pandemic period.

598
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:51,310
So particularly higher in 3 to 5 year olds, 6 to 11 year olds, and not so much in the 18 to 20 year olds.

599
01:16:51,970 --> 01:17:04,530
So this disruption to just the school environment was enough to have a significant change on the BMI in these different categories.

600
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:12,010
And again, this is a this is a relatively big sample size, 400,000 subjects.

601
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:20,650
And this is just a bit of data that's coming out for what happened during the pandemic in regard to changes in BMI,

602
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:23,380
in children and the general population as a whole,

603
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:31,390
and how just a disruption and having a regular contact with people engaging in physical activity and school activities.

604
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:37,680
So there'll be a lot more data coming out on this within the next few years.

605
01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:46,420
So I'm going to end here. So I think regards to what to expect next.

606
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:53,590
We're done. I'm done talking about etiology, social consequences in terms of obesity.

607
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:58,750
We're going to focus the next few lectures that's going to be on the physiology of individuals.

608
01:17:59,290 --> 01:18:04,450
So the next paper that I posted focused on how do you know when you're hungry?

609
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:13,479
How do you respond? How does that work? And I posted a paper that was a review published in 2014.

610
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:19,610
And there are there are other reviews that have been posted for later, but they're much, much more complex.

611
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:26,530
So I'm going to try to keep it simple. And as we go through this section, it's tricky.

612
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:27,530
There's a lot of detail,

613
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:38,260
and I want to try to go through it slowly so that you are all right so much on this on Friday and will show up at noon and it will be Sunday.

614
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:55,000
You know, they seem like I should just leave.

615
01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:32,130
Yeah. You know, my best friend, the one you guys that I have really good, you know, very professionally ready to teach me how to do.

616
01:19:34,510 --> 01:19:49,530
I was like I was like, I know I was. If you not going to do Terrence, I know you go to the vet because, like, I mean, like.

617
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:57,940
Oh, that's okay. Yeah, I'm fine with that.
