1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:19,200
I started with that the last time we talked about mortality from year to year, about the operation of generating functions, walking around,

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,510
about how we define this function to be the human generating function,

3
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:38,190
namely the expectation of e to the power of t t is the prominence of this moment that arises from an oxygen around environment.

4
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:50,940
And those evaluate this as follows assassination, integration of the conflict, even the times, the PDA of this run environment.

5
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,440
And as we argue last time, we only care about this function in the point of zero.

6
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:06,230
And the reason for that is really if we take the derivative of this function and evaluate it.

7
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,360
R zero we got all the moments of this man available.

8
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,790
That's why we only care about this function in the neighborhood of zero.

9
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:29,850
So last time we ended up with this example, this gamma distribution and the karma distribution with parameter outside the beta, a pediatric skin.

10
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:37,290
And in this formula right where this gamma right of out of all our space non-active values from zero to infinity.

11
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:48,510
And these two parameters, alpha and beta, they are both positive until our goal is to try to evaluate every moment for this random variable.

12
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,920
In other words, we want to know what is the reason of access to the power of that right?

13
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,600
And the easiest way to evaluate this every moment for this right environment is to first derive the moment generating function.

14
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:10,740
And once we have a close form of the moment generating function by this random variable, we can just take the derivative,

15
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:20,580
whatever order that we'd like to take and then evaluate that derivative at T for the zero that we got all at the moment on this of environment.

16
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,160
And I hope you got a chance to work out this problem afterwards.

17
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,300
Show us. Take a look at how to do it together.

18
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,540
All right.

19
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:52,130
So first, let me show you how to calculate this, the expectation of this order and moment directly without using the moment generated function.

20
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,700
And you are to calculate this exportation of X and we just follow the definition.

21
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:08,180
Nothing we can write out the integration zero to infinity because that's a support for this final variable and an ax to the power.

22
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:15,440
I'm about x x, but then you plug in this formula.

23
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:33,560
What you got is one over alpha of on E to the negative x verbatim the x right.

24
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:42,500
And then the next step is really to solve this integration and to solve this integration,

25
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,770
what it would be, what it would be, the the trait that we can use.

26
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:59,060
Oh, there are two ways. The first part, brute force way, is to do the integration by part.

27
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:07,100
You can do it because it's up to some power times, exponential to the power of X.

28
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,850
And of course then you can do the integration by part. But that could be pretty tedious.

29
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,120
Alternatively, we can use the trait that we have learned and extended multiple times.

30
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:30,590
That is, to try to make this function inside and inside the integration to be a PDA of some random variable.

31
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:40,820
Multiply some additional concept because once we convert this function into the PDA.

32
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,830
We know the integration now is equal to what we think.

33
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,750
And if you look at this function, that's a function of X, right?

34
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:57,740
Because you are integrating with the respect of X as a function of as it really you can combine this to it becomes a power term, all that.

35
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:07,370
And you also have this, this exponential term of X, which should remind us of this common distribution,

36
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:16,220
because you look at the PDA for the common distribution and it has exactly those two components, one, power term and Y exponential.

37
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:31,550
So all of left is try to manipulate this constant so that they become exactly a PDA or some comma random variable or

38
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:46,670
combine is two times and upwards of of the active and plus minus one and then you have e to the negative as the X.

39
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:57,380
Now if you treat this and plus alpha as your new alpha in the original PDF option and this beta as the original beta.

40
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:04,820
Now give us some sense of how we could manipulate this constant and make it a PDA.

41
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:11,210
Right? If you true this m plus alpha is not a new constant that implies what do we need?

42
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:21,290
Not a exact PDA is comma, alpha plus n times theta to the power.

43
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,210
Of course that that's the parameter we need.

44
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:38,780
That's the constant. We need to make it a PDA. And Alpha One is us and we're beta.

45
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,980
Yes, right. That's the council.

46
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:50,890
That's the council. We need a part. If you change the council, then you need to multiply additional consent to make it equal to the original.

47
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:58,970
Right. But not give you a council name and think outside the integration.

48
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,370
So that the last line is equal to the previous line.

49
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,620
And now we know this guy is exactly a comma around a variable.

50
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,450
Right. It follows a comma distribution. Parameter.

51
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:22,600
What? What would be the parameter for this comma distribution.

52
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:31,240
So this new comma distribution plus our phones and plus alpha.

53
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,570
Right. The first parameter and beta the second row.

54
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:41,470
And we can just cross that. Oh since this integrates with one. All right.

55
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,000
And all that's left is this term which gave us this.

56
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,870
If we use this comma function, the relation for comma function.

57
00:07:50,210 --> 00:08:08,020
You know, this is exactly the plus of minus one times and plus of our minus two times all the way to alpha times and to the power of it.

58
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,410
So it's a.

59
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:29,310
It's these products and the supply is the property of the properties that this formula and moment in particular the kind of write out the expectation

60
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:44,910
of this run available to be alpha beta and also right the second order moment of this run available to be of alpha plus one times greater square.

61
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:56,420
And from those two, you can calculate the virus as well. Any question or so.

62
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,810
That's the original way of calculating the order.

63
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:06,150
We can directly do this integration, taking advantage of this trick and solve it.

64
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:16,219
Alternatively, you can also approach from the moment general function approach where the first step is to

65
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:24,630
calculate the moment generating function is defined as the expectation of E to the power of yes.

66
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:40,460
Okay, again, that is equal to zero to infinity e to the text time period, which is one over the alpha one.

67
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,180
E to the. That's you.

68
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:53,390
Yeah, that's. So now our problem becomes how to integrate this stuff.

69
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,400
All right, I'll give you, uh, 2 minutes.

70
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,260
Use the same train.

71
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:14,000
And we just used to try to come up with the constant so that this entire integration would be something conversion of some function.

72
00:10:14,500 --> 00:12:40,470
Now, I. Okay.

73
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,840
Got it. Okay, so let's look at this together.

74
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:51,850
So again, we need to apply the trick to making this PDF.

75
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,360
So we need to notice what a function is.

76
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,760
Right. What should we try to complete?

77
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,400
So if you look at the terms again, it only involves two terms.

78
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,470
What is this power term? The other is exponential term.

79
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:17,340
We can combine the two exponential terms so it becomes this adds to the power of alpha minus one times e to the power of some constant sense.

80
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,910
Again, that reminds us of the common distribution.

81
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:28,320
And the only thing that's different from the original PDA is the constant in front of us in this exponential.

82
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,750
So we can particularly use a constant so that it becomes a comma distribution with parameter

83
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:50,160
alpha and one over one over Vader minus T because that's the new constant in front of us.

84
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:58,060
So now with this new parameter, it's just limits on.

85
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:07,250
But this new parameter, this becomes a play out for this newcomer and a variable.

86
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,610
So we know the integration is 8.1 and all that's allowed.

87
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:15,950
If this pass. You further simplify this concept,

88
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:27,690
it becomes one minus times t to the power of and that the close form of the moment generate function of this common distribution.

89
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:38,639
And of course we only care about t in the neighborhood of zero and we don't need the T to

90
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,290
be extremely large or extremely small and only care about it in the neighborhood of zero.

91
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:53,290
So next we can use this engine to help us calculate the moment in particular.

92
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:59,390
And if we how we want to calculate the exponential acts to the power.

93
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:06,780
And that's going to be. That's right.

94
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:16,500
The moment the ends derivative of this moment generally approach function evaluate that 2.0 kind of words.

95
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:43,530
Evaluating this. You wanted to differentiate this one over one minus T to the power of alpha and beta and then T equal to zero.

96
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:51,450
So you do the derivative, uh, you can, you can find the actual expression.

97
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:58,620
And I expect all of you know how to do this derivative for this, the regular functions.

98
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,580
And that's also expected in the homeworks exams.

99
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:08,399
You should be able to know how to do the integration and all this regular

100
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:14,010
functions in particular we can say if we just take the first order of derivative.

101
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:28,660
Value added t or zero. Not going to give us space, right?

102
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:39,850
Any questions so far? So again, are these two different approaches?

103
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:50,950
You got the same answer. And essentially we use the same trick to simplify the formula by manipulating constants.

104
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:58,270
So now that we have a PDF or some distribution in the order to know which PDF to use.

105
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,010
That just takes practice. And the more practice you do,

106
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:11,829
the more familiar you will be with different distributions once you'll notice what this what the function of

107
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:21,880
acts is really is about the actual form of that functional box and the support for this random variable.

108
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:27,310
You got a good sense of what distribution you should use in order to make it a PDF of that distribution.

109
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,540
So there is no shortcut. You just need to see more.

110
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:41,050
Or to be familiar with this. This trick just takes preference.

111
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,460
Any questions? All right,

112
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:59,219
let's look at this binomial distribution or prevent an animal as follows all about distribution with parameter that p as we are looking for.

113
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:07,890
What that means is x is a number of successes out of an independent trials where each trial has the success rate of okay,

114
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:20,490
so previously we have derived using just the definition we have derived nice validation of X is end times B and the variance of acts is despite.

115
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:31,440
Everyone remember what is the Baroness of fine armor and memorable moments are good times be times one minus.

116
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,700
All right, so that's. What do I have known before?

117
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:44,000
Now, let's think about how to derive different moments on this random variable binomial random variable using the moment generating function.

118
00:18:50,040 --> 00:19:01,610
So again, the first step is to try to derive the moment generating function, which is a form of that definition that's key to the text.

119
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,389
And now this act is a discrete random variable. All right.

120
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:19,220
So when you evaluate this exponent expectation of E to the text now becomes a summation of acts from zero to an E to a tax times.

121
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:32,120
The piano of this random of apple, which is an x and y might have been to the.

122
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:41,380
And so now the question is, how do we simplify this summation?

123
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:50,950
Again, the trick is it's still the same. Try to make it some app or a piano in this case, or some other random variable.

124
00:19:51,100 --> 00:20:02,230
So that summation is equal to one. I'll give you another couple minutes to try to solve it, because simply by this function.

125
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:39,340
Right. And in. Let's look at this together.

126
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,980
So before I get started, take a second and look at this.

127
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,100
All right. So the summation is the one we are trying to Catarina.

128
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:58,080
We know if there is no this exponential term, exponential to the to the rest is just the summation of the problem is number one.

129
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:07,480
But really the problem is this E to the property X So that's the thing that we want to try to absorb into some of the terms or,

130
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:12,940
you know, transform into some other forms. And so these are exponential terms.

131
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:20,080
We just need to look into the remaining terms to see whether there is any additional explosion term so that we can combine them.

132
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:30,580
Famous case that gave us an idea that we can combine this e to the text with this because p to the power of x is also exponential.

133
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:45,910
That's how we can get started. So if we combine those two, what do we end up with going to be and choose as e to the t times t through the power of x,

134
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:56,110
since I can directly combine those two times one minus P to the minus x.

135
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:04,860
All right. But that is not the same path rather than converting into a piano.

136
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:17,110
We also have another trick. Recall that we can always rely on those inequalities, and we have learned to simplify this type of summation as well.

137
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:24,400
So does this form look familiar to you? Forgot about the actual values inside this parenthesis.

138
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:33,370
Just consider the summation of I goes up and down to and and choose.

139
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,080
I mean to the power of I b to the power of a minus II.

140
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,270
We have seen this before, right? We have seen this summation before.

141
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:57,860
When we talk about counting, they are we actually have a very useful equation that is equal to A plus B rather than.

142
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,520
Do you still recall how we can remove this equation?

143
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:18,020
It was an accounting idea. That's essentially what selection with or without replacement.

144
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:29,000
Right. So I'm honored or honored selection with replacement, the right hand side.

145
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:37,110
You can break it down to the product and terms is being A plus B and the left hand side is just that.

146
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:42,050
The enumeration of all possible combinations of those terms,

147
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:50,810
you can take one a from one of these terms and the remaining I get two speeds and that's going to give you and choose one times,

148
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:54,380
eight times B to the power and that's one and so on, so forth.

149
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:03,800
The left hand side is just the breakdown of the right, right? So that is the equation that we can directly use in this case to simplify the bottom.

150
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:16,430
If we use that equation, we would have got E to the T and P plus one minus P to the power of it.

151
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:31,630
And that's going to be that value. That's the moment generating function for this minor binomial right about that is.

152
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,760
Equation. How about simplify this? This formula.

153
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:44,390
All right. And with that, we can evaluate different order of moments.

154
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:49,400
For example, if we want to calculate the first order moment, we can.

155
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:01,410
Take the derivative, evaluated a zero, which gives way if you're taking the derivative of this function with respect to the teeth.

156
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:02,760
What you have.

157
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:29,760
What is the derivative of this function and times e to the t t minus p then minus one times, but e e t right and evaluate t equals zero.

158
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,500
I gave you this in a way.

159
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:40,740
This goes away. These two accounts also have to study and.

160
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:50,490
All right, so that's how you can use this moment that are function to easily evaluate the different order of moments

161
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:57,900
compared to the previous approach where we take all of those tedious steps to calculate the exponential,

162
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,149
to calculate the expectation of X. This is a much simpler right?

163
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:08,490
We just need to take the first order of derivative evaluate t for zero, right based on the final result.

164
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:13,020
Similarly, you can do it for the second moment, third on a moment, etc.

165
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,040
Right. Any question.

166
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:30,679
So the bottom line is, in practice, if you have a random variable, you know,

167
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:37,130
it's the media for piano and you want to evaluate different order moments.

168
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,500
There are really at least two ways.

169
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:50,240
First is to follow the definition and calculate this summation, or even greater for it, and think about whether it's easier to derive the MGM first.

170
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,070
If it's easier to go with them, to go with it.

171
00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:01,960
Otherwise, you can always use that definition to try to calculate the expectation about.

172
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:06,510
Exactly. It's.

173
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:17,420
Right. So now we have defined the moments that are named function and also the moments a

174
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:24,320
natural question one may ask is if we know all the moments for a random variable,

175
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,880
does that mean that we actually know the full distribution of the random variable?

176
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,130
And that's a that's a fair question to ask, right?

177
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:41,720
So because moments really capture some information about that random arrival about the distribution of the round about for example,

178
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,140
the first order moment gave you the mean or the average of the start of this,

179
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,019
the random our second order moment gave you the big well spread over one of our

180
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:57,830
whole third a moment gave you the skewness foreign moment and gave you the process.

181
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,070
So as you go all in all, it just gave you more and more information about not distribution.

182
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:12,440
So then the question is, is that infinite set of moments uniquely defined by distribution, how small?

183
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:15,860
The answer is no.

184
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:21,230
General answer is no, but under some scenarios actually is a yes.

185
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:28,340
So let's first take a look at this, the general scenario, why that's not the case.

186
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:37,120
And then we're going to talk about necessary, sufficient conditions for the moment, generally a function to define a distribution of thought.

187
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,630
First, let's consider why that's not the case.

188
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:49,329
To show that infinite Sara moments does not uniquely define our distribution.

189
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:57,430
All we need is a car example that have two distributions that are that have different apps or different VMs,

190
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,620
but they have the same moments all the way to the infinite in order.

191
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:12,220
Then we have a perfect example of this statement, and that is a proof why that's not true in general.

192
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:18,340
All right. So what are we going to do? We're going to provide a car example to show why that's not the case.

193
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:23,410
So consider this to rhinovirus x one.

194
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:39,250
We have a. PDF App one acts equal to one over square root of two pi acts e to the negative acts over to.

195
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:57,819
Know that square of two Acts readers of zero and another one of our which has a PDF to us which

196
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:13,930
takes very similar form as the first run of arable and multiply one plus sign to high and low of x.

197
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:21,960
And readers as you consider this to the right of animals or to kids?

198
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:32,460
So if you draw them. Both my families have the same support.

199
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:37,170
It's all from zero to infinity, and that's four X.

200
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:41,310
But this PDA looks different from the first one.

201
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:54,600
I know it's approaching zero. But I wrote in zero.

202
00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:01,190
And no, these term, this the first term goes to infinity.

203
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:07,490
Right. And the second term goes to zero.

204
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:13,820
When I approach the zero, the first term goals in 30 seconds are zero.

205
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:27,770
But the second term goes to zero much faster. If you recall and tell us we have to learn a real convergence and there's a lot as a rule.

206
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:33,980
So you can use that to show that actually that's a promise of zero, this functional approach of zero as well.

207
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,970
So that if you tried. Yeah, it looks like this.

208
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,650
It's a PDA. Look like this. We're at one X.

209
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:53,250
And for the second amount of arable, in addition to this one args, it also has this additional term one plus sign of tilt.

210
00:33:53,270 --> 00:34:01,909
I love this. So just give it some periodic periodicity to this to this function.

211
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:11,310
So if you draw it naturally, it looks like. Three.

212
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:37,670
But essentially they look like this. This up and down curves.

213
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:46,240
So that's what the PDA function is going to look like if you draw them on the, um, on this figure.

214
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,690
So we know this to random variables. They have different distributions.

215
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,570
All right. That's a that's clear to say.

216
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,720
And that's what are we going to do is we're gonna derive different orders of moments for this to show that

217
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:22,240
actually we have the same moments all the way to the infinity are infinite in order to do that first.

218
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:33,979
Hopefully the order of the first one of our following examination,

219
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:51,080
that's going to be the integration of us to our then one over square up to par x e to the next not to not square over to us.

220
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:56,540
Right. We just need to solve these integrations.

221
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:03,470
And what are you trying to first and I'm going to give you a.

222
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,650
I need this information.

223
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,890
I'm not going to do it in any one over two pie.

224
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:28,270
It's exactly where you belong.

225
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:35,280
Let's just take this equation as given and try to solve.

226
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:42,580
Try to simplify this integration and this.

227
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:50,140
This actually is the PDA or a normal distribution.

228
00:36:52,510 --> 00:37:00,640
So that's why this is so important. What are you that simplified about the size?

229
00:38:10,740 --> 00:39:26,030
It's. This.

230
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:09,070
It's not what will be the first step to simplify this integration.

231
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:24,110
I used to simplify this. You're right.

232
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,540
And I guess right next to prevent is equal to each compartment.

233
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:37,130
Long X. Very good. So, in other words, we can do a gender variable.

234
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:49,010
All right. So you look at this form and the hand that I gave you, they are very similar, differs in this power terms.

235
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:53,810
In this one has the power of the sum of x squared.

236
00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:03,140
The other have either x squared. So that reminds us of using the change of variable to grace the difference between the left and the right.

237
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:16,250
And in particular, we can set a new round of our a new variable or a new parameter Y to be equal to a law of x and we can define this new

238
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:25,160
from or Y to be log of acts and then replace the original integration by a new integration minus to Y for the log of x.

239
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:30,300
One of the integration range going to be it is going to be zero variability.

240
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:40,280
What is it going to be? I think we've been to infinity, right?

241
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:47,209
Because if I take zero, then this guy log out is going to be an active Infinity Acts infinity log.

242
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:54,560
That's going to be expected. So that also looks more similar to the equation that we have.

243
00:41:54,770 --> 00:42:02,630
Right. So this adds to the problem. I'm going to become exponential and y.

244
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:20,030
All right. And a one over square of two square it up to five times y times e to the negative y squared over two and instead of the ice now we have.

245
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:24,620
But why do want.

246
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:38,240
So that's where we got once we changed the variable into the parameter in this integration and now we can do some simplification.

247
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:47,930
So this easy, the power of my hands and out and what's left is this two exponential turns and a and a constant

248
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:53,540
one over enough to the integration limit is the same as what do we have on the right hand side,

249
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:59,240
which is good. And the only thing that's still not quite the same is this expansion.

250
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:08,030
And we can combine those two right and complete the square which gave us one over squared off

251
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:17,659
two pi e to the negative one over to y squared minus two and y once we combine those two,

252
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:28,940
we have this. All right? And if you complete the square will become one over two pi e to the negative one over

253
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:39,800
to y minus and squared e y times additional constant that we used to play the square.

254
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:47,780
And what is that additional constant e to the square over two.

255
00:43:49,460 --> 00:44:01,700
Right. That's an additional constant that we need to add in order to compensate or what do we have used in this square.

256
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:09,650
Now if you look at this, it is almost the same as what we have on the left hand side of the equation.

257
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:19,340
So if you don't see that directly, you can do additional change our variable by sending z unbiased y y.

258
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:25,550
So that's going to give you exactly what do we have in that equation,

259
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:40,100
anything that inactive Z square over to the Z E to the and square to two and this is equal to one.

260
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:44,540
So that end up with each of the square over two.

261
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:56,330
All right. So that's how we can use that equation to help us derive the formula for this ends on our moment.

262
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:02,200
X one. Any question.

263
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:30,230
Amount of space here. So now let's do the same thing to evaluate the ends on our four acts to.

264
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:47,870
It's going to be zero infinity. Two minus one plus two I.

265
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,570
No. Yes.

266
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,970
So that's the definition for the expectation of us to add to the power of that.

267
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:09,489
Right. And we know we can break it down into this two parts of the island.

268
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:16,700
And one is we already calculate that not exactly acts one to the power of an eye in the first part.

269
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:22,460
Plus the integration of the Aunt Affinity Act that one acts.

270
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,590
Fun facts.

271
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:50,100
If we can show that this term is equal to zero, then we know the two variable have the same same moment by every order.

272
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:57,630
So that's what are we going to show next? This term actually is equal to zero.

273
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:06,870
Again, it becomes a integration problem. All we need to do is to solve this integration and show that actually it's equal to zero.

274
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:15,090
Right. So if you look at this function, you can plotted if your body will say that it looks like this.

275
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:38,260
This particular function. This is not a symmetric function, but it is semantic with respect to the origin point and just sticking to zero.

276
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:45,350
If you plot it and prove that this is a zero, we can do another variable.

277
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:52,550
So let's do it here. And at a.

278
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:20,390
In this case notes that y to be log of x minus and we continue that same transformation that I used before.

279
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:26,870
I just combine those two transformations. I run out long X minus ten.

280
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:37,500
So you plug it in without any entity and.

281
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:10,380
Once you do the change of variable, this is a familiar value and verify this after class.

282
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:19,470
Okay. Yeah. What do you care January one to try this derivations to summarize yourself with this change of arrival in the integration.

283
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:26,250
And once you have that and notice it can be further rewritten as.

284
00:49:46,470 --> 00:50:00,970
At this. This is one step, one additional step of simplification.

285
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:07,960
Once we got here, we can notice we have too many two major components in this integration.

286
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:12,880
One in this financial through the power and the square minus y squared over two.

287
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,960
The other is this sine function sign up to pi y.

288
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:26,830
So we know the sine function is a is a periodic function and it is equal to zero at y equals zero.

289
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:35,620
And this additional exponential function is that symmetric function symmetric at y, x, y for a zero.

290
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:44,470
What that means is essentially you have this symmetric erm symmetric on the origin.

291
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:54,060
So every if you calculate, if you rewrite this integration, I'm not going to infinity,

292
00:50:54,070 --> 00:51:08,500
to infinity using the limited operation I say that there is a good enough reason to use the C infinity active C to see this entire function.

293
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:16,570
You know, this integration is always equal to zero because for any symmetric interval.

294
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,670
You always have this positive part and negative part that cancels out.

295
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:29,510
All right. So even if you take the limit, say, goes to infinity, that's still going to be a zero.

296
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:39,620
That's why you have this second term in the original and order moment operation always be zero.

297
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:52,010
I'm not ready to take advantage of this symmetry and periodic throughout its history of this two functions evaluating the situation.

298
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:59,420
And so that just tells us this to run of variables, although they have very different distribution,

299
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:04,220
they actually have the same moment all the way to the infinite order.

300
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:12,830
And that is provides a current example why infinite moments does not define a distribution.

301
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:18,590
You can have different distributions, even if the ones are all all with the same.

302
00:52:21,400 --> 00:53:08,420
Any question. All right. So let's take a break and come back out to try and find out how to ensure your workplace safety.

303
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:25,060
It's just a moment for me.

304
00:53:25,700 --> 00:54:17,380
It's not a 100 or 230.900 year old woman.

305
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:50,480
I actually saw one person who said that this might come up here with the passage of the original version of the report.

306
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:54,530
So that's going to be pretty much.

307
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:16,410
She was not to the.

308
00:55:25,180 --> 00:56:42,550
Children can be the last thing I tell you, he said, because it's hard to tell how much you can do.

309
00:56:46,410 --> 00:57:02,080
Look, you tell me what you think.

310
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:35,130
I'm going to make sure you just keep those comments.

311
00:57:36,790 --> 00:58:01,269
129 year old to it's to cause you take some action.

312
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:25,810
So I just want you to work towards something.

313
00:58:30,120 --> 00:59:07,260
You can continue to do it.

314
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:30,760
I think we haven't got our copy of the council office in the problem students have, which is great.

315
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:42,310
Oh yes. I'm still looking for volunteers to help.

316
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:57,070
So or let me know and submit email if you are interested in it.

317
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:01,920
All right. So let's continue on before I move on.

318
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:05,890
Any additional questions with this current example? Which one?

319
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:14,770
And there's a lot more than that I want to mention is that we calculate the different hours of moments using the definition.

320
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:20,710
Right. You can also think about whether you can calculate the moment generating function in.

321
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:28,440
But in fact, if you evaluate the moment at any function, let's say for X one,

322
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:43,780
that's going to be very key to the T one over square up to five x is an inactive law which is square over two years.

323
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,940
That's going to be the moment generating function.

324
01:00:48,720 --> 01:01:00,300
But if you take a look at all this terms that involve as if you have a half in the denominator in this short term that times goes to infinity.

325
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,680
This function inside the integration is going to explode. All right.

326
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:17,070
Because this exponential to the power of text has much higher order than the remaining two parts that goes to zero.

327
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:24,480
So that will dominant. So you can use the as rule two to actually prove that.

328
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:30,690
But it acts goes to infinity. We know this guy is also going to go to infinity.

329
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:37,710
That just means if you do the integration, it's not just going to be nonexistent.

330
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:43,410
That's why the imaginary or the base random variable does not exist.

331
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:47,940
Similarly, for an ax to navigate does not exist.

332
01:01:50,340 --> 01:02:08,400
That's not. And so the Theorem 2.3. 11 actually gave the present unnecessary condition for this infinite set of moments to define a distribution.

333
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:19,530
That is, if the random variable has found this support, then yes, we can fully derive the distribution with all orders of moments.

334
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:24,590
Okay. The more rigorously justice has found it.

335
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:29,140
And that's why to be the to see the born to run a variable.

336
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:37,950
All of those moments exist. Okay. And that's the condition after having all of those monad exist in the first place.

337
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:48,620
If X and Y happen is support, then this to see the app is equal for all you.

338
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,090
So that just means those two random marbles have the same distribution.

339
01:02:54,840 --> 01:03:02,520
If and only if there's two moments for every order is the same.

340
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:18,240
It also has another representation which is if I'm GAAP exist and they are equal or T in a neighborhood of zero, then the two are equals.

341
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:23,340
So consider the previous example.

342
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:31,230
We get that the condition that's missing is the boundary support because the premise example they have on ballot support.

343
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:37,350
Right. The support is from zero to infinity. So it's unbounded events from it.

344
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:46,740
Then we have this reverse theorem saying that equal moments is the same as equal distribution.

345
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:57,630
Right. The other words, if moment generating function exist, then equal moment generating function is equivalent to equal distribution.

346
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:11,310
I've think about it. There are other rigorous proof of the theorem going to be.

347
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:25,200
This is not within the scope of this club because it's going to involve very heavy use of the calculus and it's pretty tedious.

348
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:33,540
So, you know, midnight. But just want to give you a few remarks about this this theorem.

349
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:48,560
First, the convergence of an object and. If you look at the present theorem, actually, there are two, two different ways to express the theorem.

350
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:52,490
One is one condition that it can have is the body's support.

351
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:57,530
On the other hand, you can also have an idea of the exist in existence.

352
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:01,250
Those two are changeable, you know, conditions.

353
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:08,690
You don't need phony support for the second. Second part of that, there are tweaks to it.

354
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:15,740
So basically you can have unbounded support if they exist and they are equal.

355
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:21,380
You can also derive the two distributions are the same. Same for the first one.

356
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,660
You do not need arms. You have to exist.

357
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:35,570
If you have body support and same equal moments for every order, you can also derive the equivalent equal distribution.

358
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:43,760
These two are just the two of them. Two different theorems, essentially using the second part of a theorem.

359
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:53,780
Namely, if you have and you exist and they are equal in the neighborhood of zero, then the two distributions aren't the same.

360
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:57,740
We can use that to help us derive the convergence of running variables.

361
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:07,340
But suppose you have a sequence of rhinovirus denoted by this exon, and each one has this idea of anxiety.

362
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:15,500
Suppose we have this equation. A limit goes to infinity is how max?

363
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:21,200
How I t is equal to Hamas t or t in a neighborhood of zero.

364
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:28,040
And this right hand side is also MDA for some random variable x.

365
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:37,700
And then from the previous theorem we can conclude this sequence.

366
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:45,350
I'll be right about Vice. I actually converge to this random variable, hence in distribution.

367
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:46,670
In other words,

368
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:56,690
the caveat of the original random out of the sequence of our about converge to the key out of this new random variable x for every point x.

369
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:11,460
Where our practice is continues and there's a unique city of this moment are determined by this morning's area functions where all acts of

370
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:22,490
access continue as we always have these oh and this convergence only required Amjad to exist and party in the small neighborhood of zero.

371
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:31,670
So this is the convergence of our media. The convergence of our media implies a convergence of the city, our function.

372
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:39,650
This is one way. Later on, we will learn about different modes of convergence of random variables.

373
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:45,860
So if you want to prove convergence in distribution, this could be one approach.

374
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:54,920
If you can derive the MTA the moment, generate a function for the sequence of roundabout and gather MTA for the target.

375
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:55,580
Run a variable.

376
01:07:55,820 --> 01:08:04,910
If you can somehow show that this moment generated function converges, then you can show the random variables converges as well in distribution.

377
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,740
This is a theorem to keep in mind.

378
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:20,420
So the proof, as I said, is pretty tedious and it relies on this so called transport Laplace transformation.

379
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:30,650
So the first transformation is defined in this way. So this and the function by definition is a surprise as the right hand side.

380
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:37,280
It is also called the La Paz Transformation of Attacks of Acts.

381
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:43,910
So this MGI function is the LA Plus transformation of the PDA function.

382
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,230
The La Paz transformation is defined in its formulas,

383
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:56,540
but for the proof of both of the previous theorems already depends upon a very important property of this La Paz.

384
01:08:56,540 --> 01:09:00,170
The transformation that is the uniqueness of this transformation.

385
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:05,780
In other words, if you have a two AMG are equal to one another,

386
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:13,370
you know the analyze PDA should also be equal because of the uniqueness of this LA Plus transformation.

387
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:19,270
So that's one of the foundations of the proof. But again, the details going to be automated.

388
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:33,000
All right. So now let's take a look at an example to see how that convergence of MJF help us understand the convergence of the roundabout.

389
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:43,859
Okay, so this is a classic example where a sequence of binomial roundabout was one and goes to

390
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:51,750
infinity and P goes to a concept and actually approach or approximate a plus on distribution.

391
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:57,590
So before we get started, let me just that we already know what a binomial distribution is, right?

392
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:05,129
It acts as a binomial parameter and a p.

393
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:08,220
We know exactly what that means or what that implies.

394
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,680
We can write out the PDF or PMS or then run a variable exploit.

395
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:19,410
So now for someone run a variable. Also run a variable is.

396
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:29,240
Defined by a single parameter lambda which is greater than zero.

397
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:38,690
Okay. So both all run of our boys also at this point around available only takes non-active bias 0123.

398
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:48,250
All the way to infinity and the PMF is defining this way like a pump or random out of a lie equal

399
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:55,040
to small y is equal to this e to the active lambda lambda to the power of y over y factorial.

400
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:02,320
And this y only takes non-active unit so the factorial makes sense.

401
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:06,650
But this is a PM or plus all random variable.

402
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:09,770
Later on we'll learn more about some random variable,

403
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:17,360
but for now all we need to know is that it is a disagreement of our with this particular piano and the support is zero one,

404
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:30,179
two, three all the way through it. Okay. So this result just says if we have a sequence of binomial random variable where the

405
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:37,770
sequence is defined by increasing that and decreasing P so that P approach some constant,

406
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:43,880
then this sequence of binomial Navarro-Valls events are going to approximate across all around about.

407
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:49,050
And that's what we what are we going to show in a second?

408
01:11:56,830 --> 01:12:07,370
So in order to show that approximation for the sequence of run of our approximating this puzzle, we can use the theorem that we just introduced.

409
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:18,770
If there are p zero converges, then we can conclude the sequence of binomial is approximating this plus on retroviral.

410
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:24,260
Okay. We already derive what the MGM for binomial is.

411
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:46,010
Now let's first derive what the MGM or the plasma roundabout or binomial random variable x is binomial and p we already derive and i s t to be e e t.

412
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:49,760
One minus p the power of.

413
01:12:53,900 --> 01:13:03,660
And so that's something that we just arrived in the first session and now calculated

414
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:11,840
way is that MGM or this or someone write about what we call the destination is e.

415
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:29,820
C. Since it's discrete so we can write out the summation of y0dcy be productive lambda y y talk.

416
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:38,820
Can I give you a couple of minutes? Try to simplify this mgm up for the plus all around available.

417
01:13:39,420 --> 01:16:10,640
See what I can do with. We?

418
01:17:24,580 --> 01:18:16,480
She wasn't. On the other hand, if you've got it.

419
01:18:20,860 --> 01:20:18,050
A couple more minutes. New York credit.

420
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:30,220
Good. All right. Let's look at this together. So we have to solve this type of problem.

421
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:36,729
We need to kind of rain off this summation right here because we need to get an array of integration is summation.

422
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:40,330
We need to kind of resolving the situation to do that.

423
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:44,470
There are many two traits that only help us so far.

424
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:48,040
One is to use some inequalities that we have learned.

425
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:57,930
And another more common trait is to try to approximate this with some piano or some other rhinovirus.

426
01:20:58,570 --> 01:21:04,930
All right. So in this case, we need to take care of this sum with respect to Y.

427
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:13,140
So one, the first thing that you need to look into is which function are which term actually involved?

428
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:16,780
One. Any term that doesn't involve y is just a constant.

429
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:22,570
No matter how complicated the form looks like. You can take it out of this summation.

430
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:31,210
You don't have to worry about it. We only need to worry about any term that involved Y in this case, the first term involved.

431
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:38,140
Right. The second term doesn't involve Y as constant because I forgot about it.

432
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:41,920
The third term, this alarm that's y y also ye problem.

433
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:49,240
And finally, this denominator involved. Okay, so those are the terms that involve y.

434
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:53,710
And then the very nice thing to think about is whether you can combine some of them.

435
01:21:55,150 --> 01:22:01,810
All right. So in this case, we combine some of them and we combine a exponential term with a factorial.

436
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:15,490
Probably not. But we can definitely combine this natural term with this power to find out how many is essentially it just using a different basis.

437
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:28,660
So that is something that we can combine. So if we do combine, what we got is, again, as I said, this concept doesn't matter.

438
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:32,560
So we write in first denominators y factorial.

439
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:40,540
If they combine those two, that's going to give us lambda times e so that he is horrible.

440
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:50,860
Right. That's why when we going to have if we combine these two, our terms are two exponential.

441
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:58,060
That's actually not a power to that's lambda to the power of y, which is also exponential to find those two.

442
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:01,990
We got this lambda and e. So the key to the power of.

443
01:23:03,190 --> 01:23:07,930
No matter what's inside this exponential. It's just a constant.

444
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:16,000
It doesn't involve y. So what it really is, is some power center, the power of y divided by y factorial.

445
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:23,590
And that if you look back and it's a possibility of PMS, that's exactly the form.

446
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:29,710
Right. Except the council, then we need to do some more work.

447
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:36,180
But the actual form of this function as a functional life is the same as a function.

448
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:42,550
That's an exponential function. So I'm concerned to the paramount why divided by this y factorial.

449
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:49,140
The only difference is now we have a different constant. Instead of lambda, we have this lambda times e to the team.

450
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,210
So what's the right man? What's the remaining?

451
01:23:52,560 --> 01:24:03,410
What y remain is to God the constant corresponding to this new console lambda times e to the T so that it becomes a new plus on the piano.

452
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:12,280
But let me give you another minute to try to work from here to see whether we can further simplify this.

453
01:24:12,910 --> 01:26:03,739
So the final result. Okay.

454
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:08,600
So what else, then, do I need in order to make this a plus?

455
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:22,920
What kind of sense should I put here? She?

456
01:26:26,730 --> 01:26:30,680
Anyone that yes.

457
01:26:31,110 --> 01:26:42,090
Into the negative E to the T and marry good e to the nak to lambda e to the power of t.

458
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:51,300
All right. You just treat it as a home. Right this time to the T, that's your new lambda for this 4th of July.

459
01:26:51,930 --> 01:26:55,380
That's exactly what you put in this E to the power company.

460
01:26:56,640 --> 01:27:02,790
But you put in the power of this exponential and a negative sign.

461
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:13,320
That way it becomes a person, right? A variable with parameter lambda e to the power of t.

462
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:23,490
That's exactly the point for this new plasma roundabout and you can check this parameter is actually a reasonable parameter

463
01:27:23,490 --> 01:27:29,520
because it's greater than zero lambda greater than zero than lambda times C to the T is always greater than zero.

464
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:40,400
So that's fine. And don't forget to adjust for this new house that you add to your formula.

465
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:53,440
But that ain't going to make any difference in our regional one. So they're going to end up with E to the power of lambda e, t minus one.

466
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:59,410
And that's your piano. Sorry, that's your MGM.

467
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:18,360
Or this was all right now. Really focus on what the function of life is in this form and try to think about which distribution it corresponds to,

468
01:28:19,410 --> 01:28:27,000
which terms can be combined so that it mimics a PPMO or some other antivirals about the piano.

469
01:28:27,630 --> 01:28:30,660
Piano with a piano.

470
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:38,340
Now we have this two pianos, right? A piano for binomial distribution and the piano for this class on distribution.

471
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:45,420
What do I need to show is that if you properly construct a sequence of binomial random marbles,

472
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:50,640
there are a piano and an approximate a piano or a plus on distribution.

473
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:59,700
If that's the case, then we can conclude a sequence of binomial rhinovirus converge to the plus roundabout in distribution.

474
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:11,170
The other words now see the sequence of C from binomial going to approximate a CD4+ distribution.

475
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:30,060
So that's why we're going to show. Think about a sequence defining this way to 19 x and the binomial random variable with parameter and p m.

476
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:35,960
And. One two.

477
01:29:36,260 --> 01:30:00,020
All the way and in particular this and he and is this period is defined as lambda over the other words and time span is equal to this.

478
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:07,820
So later on you will see that actually this doesn't have to be exactly equal.

479
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:16,310
You can have up here. That is the kind of protein lambda goes to infinity.

480
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:26,540
Not also for simplicity. Let's just consider the case where he n is exactly defined as lambda over where namely some constant.

481
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:37,850
Okay then what do we want to show? Is that the MTA for this x n is approaching the AMG out of one.

482
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:47,210
We want to show this. And once we have this, we can conclude.

483
01:30:52,830 --> 01:31:08,330
The city of. This sequence of binomial random volcanic converged use in use.

484
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:15,030
This notation converge in distribution, which we will learn more about this later in the semester,

485
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:22,380
an approach that converts this excellent going to converting distribution to the run of our problem.

486
01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:30,570
Okay, so all we need to do now is to show this the MGM converges the angles.

487
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:46,230
So to show that we're just t in the neighborhood of zero, to show that this is the right out accent he is.

488
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:55,170
Because I know everything about Marvel. This is the forum for the MGM, and we just copy it here.

489
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:03,370
So it's going to be an easy one.

490
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:07,860
Yeah. Robert.

491
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:16,479
And we know this plan is defined as the land over at Lambda is a constant unless you are

492
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:26,320
sequence that's going to be lambda e xy over plus one minus lambda over to the power of it.

493
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:41,740
All right. And then we can combine some terms so it becomes one plus one over a lambda T minus one.

494
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:23,960
Why was there not enough?

495
01:33:28,070 --> 01:33:33,840
One. So now I need to use this.

496
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:45,210
Namely, if you have a sequence of numbers that converts to AA, then we always have this equality.

497
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:54,960
And if you take the limit and goes to infinity, one plus and over and to the power of a head, now it's going to equal to E to the power of M.

498
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:06,840
That's a very common or very popular equality in the limit theorem.

499
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:19,430
So you could take angles embedded in this and an approach a than this a one plus and over and the carve out in an approach this exponential

500
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:34,950
for e to the power of a so in this case is exactly using that by treating this guy e to the T minus one times the lambda as our N,

501
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:45,390
which is a constant in this case. So then we can have these is approaching as an entity.

502
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:51,600
This is approaching e to the power of lambda e t minus one.

503
01:34:54,490 --> 01:35:03,440
Right. Drop by using that theorem or lemma, we can have this, uh,

504
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:15,560
approximation that says the Amjad or this ax and this sequence of run America can approach this function.

505
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:22,610
And if you look at this function, that's exactly the idea for a plus.

506
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:30,560
All random variable is from Dr. Right. That is exactly the ability of a Y.

507
01:35:31,610 --> 01:35:38,420
Where Y follows, of course, on its distribution from is from dominant.

508
01:35:40,190 --> 01:35:49,580
And now we know for this sequence of random variable, it always approximate it always approaching this angle or a plus.

509
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:53,630
All right. About in the neighborhood of zero.

510
01:35:54,050 --> 01:36:00,230
Okay. And by using the theorem 2.3. 11, we can conclude this sequence.

511
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:04,730
All right. Available binomial and available all converge to this was all right about.

512
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:14,830
And that the group. The question.

513
01:36:22,350 --> 01:36:25,590
So to conceptually understand what this really means.

514
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:31,700
If you think about a sequence of binomial random parables.

515
01:36:32,130 --> 01:36:33,780
Right? Defining this way.

516
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:46,670
Whereas you as end goes to infinity, the number of trials actually increases to infinity, and the success rate for each trial diminishes to zero.

517
01:36:48,890 --> 01:36:53,630
Right. As the number of trials, because they admitted that, first of all,

518
01:36:53,900 --> 01:37:00,800
we can notice the support for this random variable going to be approaching the support available

519
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:09,860
because the support proposal is just that all of the non active entities and so that part is is okay.

520
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:17,660
And on the other hand if you have an increasing number of trials, a diminishing success rate for each trial,

521
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:25,520
but the mean for this binomial roundabout of all the average successes out of this,

522
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:37,160
um, trials is always faced to be the cause and lambda that you can start this run about a one just explode or just to go to zero.

523
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:40,940
It's going to stay somewhere with a peak around.

524
01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:55,970
Lambda If you draw this PMA function, you'll have a small and then you just have zero 1 to 3 four and also all the way to infinity,

525
01:37:56,510 --> 01:38:02,510
if you are an is equal to two probably of CMV and then look like this.

526
01:38:03,770 --> 01:38:14,600
If you are p e for three, then you will have a height of three, then you're going to have some something like this as a you,

527
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:19,760
as your own goes to infinity, the support is going to expand to infinity.

528
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:29,570
Right by the average of this of this random variables now going to go to infinity because you also have a

529
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:39,560
diminishing point being or in this case is close to the mode is going to stay somewhere if you'll harmonize here.

530
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:43,400
It's always going to stay somewhere around this area.

531
01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:49,790
So the PMA essentially going to look like something like this.

532
01:38:54,250 --> 01:39:00,780
Right. So if you draw a line that connects all of this PMF values,

533
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:10,170
you're going to have roughly a peak around this lambda because that's going to be your medium for all of random variables.

534
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:17,130
And this ship, if you draw the PMF or the fossil distribution and they actually have the same [INAUDIBLE].

535
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:24,870
So that's why if you have a sequence of binomial with this set up, it's going to approximate up close.

536
01:39:24,870 --> 01:39:25,140
All right.

537
01:39:26,410 --> 01:39:36,060
But conceptually, that's what happens later on after we learn about what binomial you're representing or assigns representing, you will see more.

538
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:41,250
Uh, you'll get a better idea of why this approximation actually makes sense.

539
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:52,750
Okay. Any questions so far? So one last point about the moment generating function.

540
01:39:53,140 --> 01:40:01,200
If you have a linear transformation of a random variable, then the moment generating function has the following relation.

541
01:40:01,390 --> 01:40:08,910
That is for any linear transformation x plus B, the moment generating function is going to be to the power times.

542
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:12,620
The moment generating function of x evaluated 80.

543
01:40:16,050 --> 01:40:23,880
And this can be true using that definition in particular, we know this X plus B is a new round of power, right?

544
01:40:24,210 --> 01:40:28,620
So in order to calculate that, we just need to do the integration.

545
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:44,520
Let's assume AX is a continuous maneuverable, so it's going to be a rotation of A and b e to the power of this honesty and affects x x.

546
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:49,760
Right. That's the definition of this answer.

547
01:40:49,770 --> 01:40:51,570
Plus B is our new round of arrival.

548
01:40:53,420 --> 01:41:11,200
And that's just going to be a T and affects the arms to the beating free to the media is a concern that has nothing to do with that.

549
01:41:11,810 --> 01:41:19,040
And now if you look at this guy, this is an expectation of his for the eight acts he.

550
01:41:21,370 --> 01:41:24,610
All right, fine. He took a beating.

551
01:41:28,290 --> 01:41:37,010
What is this expectation? I'll be to the extent if you treat this as your new round variable, that's just become the.

552
01:41:46,080 --> 01:42:05,560
So they. If you're treating Auntie as your new cousin, then this is just going to be the OMG or an evaluate at 18 times e to the beat.

553
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:13,300
And it's also equal to the MGM. MGM of AX.

554
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:23,540
I have a gap of x times e to the B team as the same and.

555
01:42:29,490 --> 01:42:32,880
So that's the linear transformation of running Marvel and wonder.

556
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:37,920
And another question.

557
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:47,360
All right. So that's pretty much for chapter two.

558
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:53,389
So that's kind of a quick review of what we have covering chapter two on the chapter two

559
01:42:53,390 --> 01:42:59,480
is really the gateway into what are we going to introduce next in many of the semester?

560
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:03,230
And we start from the definition of the random variable.

561
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:11,180
I recall that a random variable is nothing but a mapping from the original sample space to the relevance.

562
01:43:11,630 --> 01:43:22,830
So that's how rhinovirus define in the first place. And when you talk about the transformation of the rest of our civil rights.

563
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:32,680
This is why this is defined as a function of hours is still a random variable.

564
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:37,070
And for any right honorable we have defined as Syria.

565
01:43:39,650 --> 01:43:49,620
Give me the probability of at last or equal to this marks and for our continuous running variables we can evaluate

566
01:43:49,630 --> 01:44:04,600
that using an integration of PDR and for this great random variable we can calculate it using the summation.

567
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:34,760
And when this transformation of the wren available, we can derive the PTA for this transform run of arable directly from the domination.

568
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:37,670
If you have y you quoted G on ice,

569
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:47,030
we can define this city of Y to be the probability of y last argument y which is essentially the probability of all the eggs,

570
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:54,530
such that tax is not already partly one end and in particular only have a shortcut.

571
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:57,950
If this g is a management function.

572
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:11,999
Is monitoring increasing. Then that is just equal to g inverse y.

573
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:19,020
Why is his monotone decreasing now? Is going to be one minus f j inverse.

574
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:24,000
Why assume this is a continuous run of our okay?

575
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:31,860
It is not continuous then for the monotone decreasing function is not exactly like this and the formula is

576
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:38,730
slightly different because you have to consider a case where y equal to the small and it is continuous.

577
01:45:39,390 --> 01:45:42,660
For a data point, the probability is always zero.

578
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:53,070
So we can ask this kind of a formula what is the CTA of the transport roundabout?

579
01:45:55,050 --> 01:46:03,000
And from there we can derive the PDA by taking the derivative of this function and recall that.

580
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:09,480
And we have a theorem saying that if you have a monotone, monotone transformation,

581
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:15,420
we can always express the city of the PDA using a closed form formula.

582
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:26,880
Or finally, if you can separate your domain into some pieces and satisfying some conditions, then you can always ride the PDA exquisitely.

583
01:46:28,350 --> 01:46:34,170
But cannot you use that theorem? Make sure you check all the conditions, especially the supporting foundation.

584
01:46:34,950 --> 01:46:39,180
For each support of that, you need to make sure that a support for light is the same.

585
01:46:40,590 --> 01:46:46,300
I believe you have seen the question in the homework. If you don't have that foundation, you cannot apply that argument.

586
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:53,730
And so that's the first part about the propensity of a piano or the transform around a vowel.

587
01:46:54,270 --> 01:46:59,639
And in the in the second part, we talk about the characterization of the distribution,

588
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:11,910
insisting that I introduced the expectation of elements, which is in a continuous case, this is saying the creation of these attacks.

589
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:17,580
Yes. And for this great case, it changed the integration to summation.

590
01:47:19,710 --> 01:47:24,180
And expansion is now not always existent.

591
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:30,780
If they are all valley of giants, the integration is not finite.

592
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:33,960
Then we say the patient does not exist.

593
01:47:35,070 --> 01:47:41,580
And every time we have an example, the closing distribution I was always saying thinks about patient zero, but actually it's not.

594
01:47:41,910 --> 01:47:47,550
It doesn't exist. Okay. So patient does not always exist in exist.

595
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:57,430
You can calculate this. And we also say the expectation is a leaner operation, which means a can do a leaner transformation, longer run overall.

596
01:47:57,730 --> 01:48:07,840
You always have this year of X plus B is always equal to almost eight times that.

597
01:48:10,690 --> 01:48:19,090
Now we have the barons of Iran available, which is a patient of axis minus is mean squared,

598
01:48:19,690 --> 01:48:32,050
which also has an equivalent expression up here to the expectation of x squared minus x squared, and that's equivalent expression.

599
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:42,100
From here we have to have a very nice quality saying that e of x squared is always going to be of x squared.

600
01:48:42,910 --> 01:48:47,320
And it's also prove that using that instance inequality. So that's the variance.

601
01:48:47,770 --> 01:48:51,100
So various measures, the graph spread over many variables.

602
01:48:51,790 --> 01:48:53,860
Barrons does not have the linearity.

603
01:48:54,280 --> 01:49:07,060
So if you apply variance from A2 plus B, you've got a square variance of X and B just about is that a variance of any constant is zero.

604
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:13,360
And finally, when we further generalize to different order of moments,

605
01:49:14,140 --> 01:49:28,990
we define this as order as and expectation of X to the power of N and as central moment as interpretation of acts minus mu to the power of it.

606
01:49:29,950 --> 01:49:33,280
So the second order central moment is essentially the patterns.

607
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:42,540
And we also introduced this MJF, which is the application of EA to the T-X.

608
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:51,200
And that function is called moments entering a function because it has close relations by running Marvel.

609
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:57,780
Since then, you take the derivative and saw the derivative of this and as t.
