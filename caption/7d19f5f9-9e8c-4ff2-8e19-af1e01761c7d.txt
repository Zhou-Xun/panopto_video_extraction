Through our training here at the University of Michigan Public Health.

2
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,510
And likely in your professional lives, you may have heard acronyms like NHANES and BURFORD'S.

3
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,499
These are two of our key public health resources,

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,790
where the government is conducting surveillance of the general population with

5
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,810
respect to outcomes ranging from oral to mental to cardiovascular health,

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,470
and exposures ranging from dietary patterns to environmental exposures to TV watching behaviors.

7
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:45,750
These surveillance systems act like snapshots of the population health as they use a cross-sectional study design.

8
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,810
In this video, we're going to talk about what the cross-sectional sampling strategy looks like,

9
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:59,070
identify measures of association for this design, and compare the strengths and limitations of the cross-sectional design.

10
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,400
So starting at the top,

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:10,620
cross-sectional designs are where we collect information on exposure and outcomes simultaneously in some sample of the population.

12
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:19,320
Personally, I think it's helpful to think of them as photographs or snapshots of the population, because unlike the cohort design,

13
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,800
where there's some information about how things change over time,

14
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:30,960
the data in this study type is fixed at just one moment in time, as is shown visually here.

15
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,890
The populations sampled could be new, like a random capture of the full population.

16
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,430
Or it could even be using data from a longitudinal design,

17
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,790
like a cohort study or a randomized controlled trial where you're just looking, for example, at a baseline visit.

18
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,450
It can also be that investigators conduct targeted sampling.

19
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,260
So, for example, if you were interested in Lyme disease,

20
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,870
it might be that you only want to collect a snapshot of people in the Northeast

21
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:07,430
and Midwest sections of the United States where Lyme disease is most prevalent.

22
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:18,080
Ultimately, the data flow that comes from a cross-sectional design can be seen in this diagram where the investigator identifies some population.

23
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,340
They characterize their exposures and their outcomes simultaneously,

24
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,610
and then they cross tabulate exposure and outcome experiences for binary exposures and outcome.

25
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,500
Now with a situation of binary outcomes and exposures,

26
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:40,850
the investigator can then estimate the proportion of the exposed with the outcome and the same for the unexposed populations.

27
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,240
Because these data are all collected at one point in time, they reflect measures of prevalence,

28
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:55,460
so the investigator can estimate the prevalence ratio or prevalence odds ratio on the relative or multiplicative scale.

29
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,880
Similarly, they can also estimate the prevalence difference on an additive scale.

30
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,860
Now in this situation where exposures and outcomes are continuous,

31
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:16,140
we can look at associations in a cross-sectional design using correlations or a linear regression approach.

32
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:27,160
So there you have it. The key design feature of the cross-sectional study is that the data is collected simultaneously on exposure and the outcome.

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,910
As a result, the strengths of this design are that it takes very limited effort and cost to conduct.

34
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,440
Since you're not following people over time, in addition,

35
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:46,030
you can investigate many different exposures and outcomes in the same study so long as none of them are rare in your study populations.

36
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,319
However, the limitations are that it's cross-sectional,

37
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,840
so you can't establish temporality or know whether or not the exposure came before the outcome.

38
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:05,650
In addition, because our data is collected all at one time, you can only estimate prevalent disease, but not incident disease.

39
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,740
And finally, as I noted before,

40
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:17,530
this design is inefficient for rare exposures or disease unless you can target populations where those factors are not rare.
