00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,540
Welcome to the Epidemiology Department Math Module series.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:10,450
My name is Matt Buxton and I am a faculty member in the Epidemiology Department.

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:22,430
For this unit. We will walk through the steps of calculating the Spearman's rank correlation and hopefully give you a sense of the

4
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:30,860
way the data are set up in the way the data are arranged to calculate the experiment rank correlation coefficient.

5
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:38,540
In most instances the coefficient is calculated using a statistical program.

6
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:47,800
But I'm hoping that this process will allow you to fully understand how the coefficient is calculated

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,210
and maybe have a better appreciation for the data you use and how you come up with the coefficient.

8
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:03,970
So by the end of this unit, you will be able to list the steps needed to calculate the Spearman's rank correlation.

9
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:13,210
And then you will also have a first hand experience of calculating the Spearman's rank correlation manually.

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:24,870
As a recap about the two types of correlations covered in the correlation module on canvas,

11
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:35,190
Pearson Correlation allows us to evaluate linear relationships between two continuous variables.

12
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:47,800
Pearson Correlation is ideal when you have continuous data for a pair of variables and the variables have a relationship that follow a straight line.

13
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:57,620
Wow. Spearman's rank correlation is a non parametric eternity of tops in correlation.

14
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:05,900
The calculation is based on ranked values for each variable rather than the raw data,

15
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,210
which you will see when we go over the example in a couple of minutes.

16
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:20,230
So you might be wondering. Which situations would it be appropriate to use his famous rink or relation?

17
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:32,610
Let's go over a few instances. You should use the Spearman's rank correlation if you have continuous data in the relationship between them,

18
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,890
do not follow a straight line or where the relationship between the variables is not linear.

19
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:47,550
You can also use the Spearman's rank correlation for data that are not normally distributed.

20
00:02:49,800 --> 00:03:00,840
Data that have a monotonic relationship can also be analyzed using the Spearman's rank correlation in a monotonic relationship.

21
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:11,190
As one variable increases, the other variable tends to either increase or decrease, but not necessarily in a straight line.

22
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,290
Spearman's rank correlation allows you to fit curvilinear relationships.

23
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:27,790
However, there must be a tendency for the variables to change in a particular direction.

24
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:35,470
If you have a non monotonic relationship or a situation where as X gets larger,

25
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:41,750
Y gets larger, but then later on becomes smaller or something more complicated.

26
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,730
Then you should not use Spearman's rank correlation.

27
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,730
You can also use Batman's rank correlation for looking, not data.

28
00:03:52,690 --> 00:04:02,860
Or in our data are categorical data that have natural order categories, but a distances between the categories are not established.

29
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:12,550
An example of ordinal data is when socio economic status is classified as low, middle or high.

30
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:19,550
So those are some instances where it would be appropriate to use experiments rank correlation.

31
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:30,330
So we will now review the steps needed to calculate the Spearman's rank correlation and then follow that by an example.

32
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:40,620
First you will want to generate a table that includes observations for the variables that you will make to evaluate.

33
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:50,880
Next, you will assign a rank to each observation and you will see that, in example, I maybe have a better understanding of what this means.

34
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:59,720
Next you will calculate the difference in rank for each pair of observations.

35
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:09,950
And we do note that by D. Next you will calculate D Square by squaring the value of each difference.

36
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,210
Followed by calculating the sum of D Square.

37
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,360
And then lastly, you will solve the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.

38
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:29,310
Follow that. The formula is.

39
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:37,800
This strange looking piece, which is called Roll and is equals the one minus.

40
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:46,630
Six times the summation of D Square divided by in times and square minus one.

41
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:56,620
So this row of strange looking P is the Spearman's correlation coefficient.

42
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:07,750
Where and is the number of data pairs in D Square is the difference in the ranks of the two coordinates for each pair.

43
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,760
For each data pair. So let's walk through an example.

44
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:27,459
Here's the question. A cohort study was conducted to understand cytokine patterns over time among people who previously had severe COVID two,

45
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,400
which is what we refer to COVID 19 disease.

46
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:40,390
The table below contains the value of cytokines interleukin one A and interleukin one be from ten monthly visits.

47
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:47,010
Find experiments rank correlation coefficient between the two cytokines.

48
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:58,590
So as you can see in the table, we have the first cytokine I'll I'll one e in the second cytokine I'll won't be and you'll see we have

49
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:09,060
ten visits and for each visit we have cytokine values for each visit that correspond to each cytokine.

50
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:21,820
So we've kept the table with the values so we can easily track the numbers as we go on.

51
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:31,840
So in other words, this is asking the question if the values from Sarah visits of ill are correlated with I'll won't be.

52
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,010
So on this slide, we have our original table with the values of each cytokine.

53
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:46,830
And we next need to assign rings to each observation from the smallest to the largest.

54
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:56,970
So in this case. We will be assigning a rank of one to the first value file.

55
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:04,270
One e. Because it's the lowest value for all values for this item.

56
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:14,809
I don't want a. If you follow along the red box text box, you will see that visit to file one.

57
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:23,180
E has a value of 39.87, and for that value, assign a rank of two.

58
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,030
And this is because is the second lowest value among the ten values.

59
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:38,870
At the far end, you will see that a value of ten as the rank has been assigned to the value from visit ten.

60
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,350
Interestingly, that corresponds to the highest value.

61
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:49,070
And so it turns out that Visit ten has a value or rank of ten.

62
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,100
And then we'll do a similar step for the cytokines.

63
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:04,980
I won't be. You see that the first value in this case file won't be is one or 2.43.

64
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:14,510
This you see has been assigned a rank of ten because is the highest value among the i l won't be cytokines.

65
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:24,700
And then you see in the yellow text box, we have the difference between the ranks.

66
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:30,339
So in the first box for visit one, you see there's a value of minus nine,

67
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:39,340
which is the difference between the ranks for I'll want a a value of one and the rank for I'll one B which has a value of ten.

68
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,720
So one minus ten gives you negative nine or minus nine.

69
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:53,230
So we do that for all of the values from each visit and that we create a difference for each pair of cytokines.

70
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,980
And then after that, we will take the square of the difference in rank.

71
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:08,770
So you will see here that they for the first visit, the D Square is a one which is minus nine square.

72
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,820
We give you 81. So we do that for each of the difference from the different visit.

73
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:26,680
And we now have a table complete with the values for the ranks, the values for the difference, and then the values for the square.

74
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:37,890
And then followed by that we will calculate the sum of the square, which in this case would give us 272.

75
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:49,150
If we add up all of the values here. So now we have all of the values to plug in, the formula to calculate role.

76
00:10:50,340 --> 00:11:00,480
So when we plug in the values, we come back to the formula here and we say one minus six because six is part of the formula.

77
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,610
And then in the parentheses, we have 272, which is divided.

78
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,110
We have 40 square. We have ten observations.

79
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:17,330
So we have ten here. And in the parentheses we have N Square.

80
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:29,610
So in this case, we have ten square minus one. So when we proceed with a calculation, we have one -1632 divided by 990.

81
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:36,620
With that, we get a value of -0.6485.

82
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:51,330
So to interpret the calculated spearman correlation coefficient or rule of -0.6485.

83
00:11:52,710 --> 00:12:00,750
We know that the negative sign indicates that the cytokines are inversely correlated and that

84
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:12,780
a magnitude of 0.65 means that there is a moderate correlation between IL one E and i1b.

85
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:21,060
So in other words, when one cytokine goes up, the other cytokine value goes down.

86
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:31,520
So in this unit we've covered an example of how to calculate the Spearman's rank correlation using epidemiologic data.

87
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:40,130
You can find additional resources in the canvas page on on the canvas site.

88
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,710
Looking at the camp, the correlation. What you.
