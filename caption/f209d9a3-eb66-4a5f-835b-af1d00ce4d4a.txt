1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:07,450
And if artists work hard, I'll be like, That looks cool. And then I'm other artist and violin.

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,330
Cool. All right.

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,690
Hello, everybody. Hello, week five.

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,030
Can we believe? No. I can't either.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,690
First of all, I just want to make a plug for the Environmental Health Student Association tomorrow.

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:35,000
They're having a fundraiser. If you go to Hokey Pokey, which is on State Street, kind of like new shirts and stuff like that.

7
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:40,309
And if you buy anything and you mention your age, I say they will.

8
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:46,940
Some of the proceeds will go there. And they're doing a part clean up this weekend at Vandermeer Park.

9
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:55,640
So if you're not on the list serves and you like are interested talk to one of the the environmental health students.

10
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:08,090
I realize in a few weeks your midterm is coming up. I still have to make it, but it will be like an in-person midterm.

11
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,060
Close. No, close but paper.

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:25,670
Just for me, like for ease of grading, it will mostly be like multiple choice matching some some short answer.

13
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,800
TBD. I didn't even think about it this weekend, but I don't think it should be too too stressful.

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,220
Okay, honey, any questions or concerns so far?

15
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:52,580
Okay. I mean, the first duck commander, Garza's guest lecturer, she was she was actually on leave last week because she got deployed again.

16
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,419
So she's back. So she still has to redact her slides.

17
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,780
So once I get those, I'll put those on canvas for you.

18
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:08,540
You know, the first couple weeks of the course, we had a lot of guest speakers, but we don't have a guest speaker again until like November.

19
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:17,090
So, you know, it's just me. But we have a mid-semester evaluation coming up before the midterms.

20
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:24,710
So someone from the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching will be here just since you all are my first run of this course residentially.

21
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:33,890
Okay. All right. So today we're going to talk about how internalized racism can affect a person's infectious disease outcomes,

22
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,030
how personally mediated racism can impact their health outcomes.

23
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:44,110
Structural racism outlined factors that contribute to an equitable emergency response.

24
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:51,410
Analyze how racism has impacted people affected by Hurricane Katrina, and then we'll talk about Flint.

25
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,350
So this is all like one big slide deck for the week, although lots to talk about right now.

26
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:06,690
Like in my online class last week, we talked about Hurricane Fiona and the week before that we talked about the flooding in Jackson.

27
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,760
We're about to get Hurricane Ian hitting Florida.

28
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:19,490
So we we have plenty of very relevant topical things to discuss in the internment.

29
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:30,350
Okay. So let's talk first about how internalized race and personally mediated racism impacts infectious disease outcomes.

30
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,540
And like I said, feel free to like interrupt me at any time or if you have a comment or question.

31
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:45,470
So we've internalized racism. There are a number of studies that say that the health impact of internalized racism on

32
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:51,830
a person is it can lead to higher levels of psychological and physiological stress.

33
00:03:52,130 --> 00:04:01,490
So as we talked about last week with internalized racism, that may be like you attributing specifically to your race or ethnicity,

34
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:07,430
some some perpetuated thoughts like, oh, because I in this identity,

35
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:14,870
like I'm not as good as this or like I am not worthy of having this or like, you know, whatever.

36
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:23,990
So with chronic stress, obviously chronic stress can weaken your immune system just because it depresses

37
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:30,380
the response by how much physiological and mental strain your body is under.

38
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,250
But they have something called the parasite stress hypothesis,

39
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:41,780
where essentially the stress itself acts as a little parasite that like leaches onto your livelihood.

40
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:49,670
And it can cause things like sleep disorders, headaches, disturb your appetite, dizziness, fatigue, panic attacks.

41
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:59,900
And so if you have, for example, the belief that you're deserving of that kind of treatment or you should not expect better treatment, that might.

42
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:07,970
Result in you to not seek help as a result or just accept things the way they are in terms of like health care.

43
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:15,509
Right. And not really advocate for yourself personally mediated racism in health care.

44
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:19,010
And I'm like, this slide deck was made last summer.

45
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:26,839
So I found it like really great that, you know, the university pays for this like Shutterstock like subscription,

46
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,090
but also like really sad that like this stock image actually like exists, right?

47
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:38,060
Because it's common enough now where this person has a sign she's, you know, of Chinese descent says I'm not a virus.

48
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:45,200
So personally mediated racism in health care is different services or treatment regarding health care.

49
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:52,430
So this may maybe like implicit biases, microaggressions or even direct racism by health care providers.

50
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,200
And because of that, it can lead to adverse outcomes for general health,

51
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,680
such as lower life expectancy, lower vaccination rates, different pregnancy outcomes.

52
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:12,350
Chronic disease care differs a ton, higher blood pressure strain on mental health, pain treatment, emergency care and much more.

53
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:20,030
So I'm not sure if you've discussed this in your other classes, but if we look at something like chronic disease care, for example,

54
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:29,150
type two diabetes, you know, if we look at statistically, you know, when you're looking at white people versus black people who have diabetes,

55
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:40,670
those who are black are more likely to have like limbs amputated due to like lack of attention or poor care or like, you know,

56
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:45,710
treatment plans that aren't as thoroughly discussed by their health care providers

57
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,410
that end in like these outcomes rather than like their white counterparts,

58
00:06:51,410 --> 00:07:00,620
for example, or like pain treatment. Even pain treatment is different in people of color versus white people.

59
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,919
For example, there are a number of studies that have shown that even historically when you poll health care providers,

60
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:14,240
they believe that just because you have more melanin, your skin, you have a lower amount of pain receptors.

61
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:25,970
So that's led to a lot of we'll talk about this like medical studies on persons of color and those types of things.

62
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,419
This also has implications on infectious disease emergency response, though, right?

63
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:42,110
Because there is a lack of workforce diversity in terms of who they hire into these positions to play these emergency response roles,

64
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:52,879
who they see as leaders or people who should be in charge or distributing resources, but also sometimes a lack of cultural competency in response.

65
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:59,420
And then again, the level of treatment and response received may be different due to race rather than need.

66
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:07,910
Response may be delayed or further delayed. Later diagnosis suboptimal management among minority populations.

67
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:20,660
So personally mediated racism here like this is just a picture from trump gatherers in Washington, D.C., when he was still in office.

68
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,010
So this has no more uncontrolled invasion.

69
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:32,299
I just put this as an example because I would say like between 2016 and 2020,

70
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:38,570
we've seen a lot more people being vocal about their personally mediated racism.

71
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,160
Not to say that it didn't exist before it totally existed.

72
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:55,250
It just became more socially acceptable and if not like encouraged for people to be very vocal about, you know, their views on race.

73
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:02,390
Yeah. So any questions or comments about that stuff?

74
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,730
Okay. So structural racism and infectious disease.

75
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,190
So, again,

76
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:20,060
extensive literature and research by scholars in this area where they have explored the primary pathways or connection between racism and health.

77
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,640
But depending on the scholar, they'll they'll take a different lens on it.

78
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:33,290
So according to Bailey and all from their 2017 article,

79
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:44,540
they say that the pathways between racism and health are economic injustice and social deprivation, environmental and occupational health inequities,

80
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:52,040
psychosocial trauma, target and marketing of health harming substances, inadequate health care,

81
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,360
state sanctioned violence and alienation from property and traditional lands.

82
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:02,450
Political exclusion. Maladaptive coping behaviors and stereotype threats.

83
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,820
So what do they mean by, like, targeted marketing of health harming substance?

84
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,410
So. Is that like cigaret advertising? Yeah.

85
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,560
Within predominantly black communities.

86
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:30,930
And I think like even the, the types of cigarets that have the most amount of nicotine are usually targeted towards different groups.

87
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:38,280
Mm hmm. Other other examples of targeted marketing and health harming substances.

88
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,650
Or any of the other examples on this slide.

89
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:05,730
The first one didn't like lack of wi fi or internet availability in certain areas and areas of like food deserts as well.

90
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:11,010
Food deserts, yeah. Yeah. So I would put that under like a yeah.

91
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,650
So economic and social deprivation. What about political exclusion?

92
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:28,430
Examples of that Novembers coming up page voting issues like closing the polls earlier and not keeping up with the, like, different shifts.

93
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,770
Right. Right. We've seen like a lot of. Right. Because when you give people the right to vote.

94
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,099
Right,

95
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:44,600
that gives them the power to potentially change their health outcomes unless their area has been so gerrymandered that you can't do anything about it.

96
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,040
Right. But we've seen in certain states like Georgia, for example, or Texas,

97
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:56,660
where like they take out like polling drop boxes except for like one location in specifically

98
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,980
like minority areas where they know people are a lot more likely to vote Democratic.

99
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:10,460
So you have to wait hours to like drop off your ballot or they'll take out a bunch of ballot boxes and other places you can be purged from from,

100
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,639
you know, voter registrations without your knowledge.

101
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:20,209
So my sister, for example, who is a lawyer and works for the city of the mayor and has always been a United States citizen,

102
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:30,710
found out that she was purged from the voter registrations, but she checks regularly and she votes like for every primary midterm election, etc.

103
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:36,320
But she lives in Brooklyn. Right. Or like, you know, this whole signature matching situation.

104
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,130
I've never had two signatures that look the same.

105
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:50,000
So these types of things where they try to exclude people from exercising essentially their their democracy.

106
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:57,590
So this here is a figure of the weathering hypothesis.

107
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,890
How many of you have heard of the weathering hypothesis before?

108
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,420
Lexi. Is that a hit? Yeah. Okay.

109
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,560
But it's better. Okay. Do you want to take a stab at it?

110
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,710
No, you don't. Okay. Does it. Does anyone want to take a stab at it?

111
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,400
Okay. So. Well, let's look at the figure first.

112
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:26,779
So they talk about these structural influences like current and historical,

113
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:31,849
cultural systems, ideologies, ideology, resource allocations, living schooling,

114
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,140
working conditions like these are the big social determinants of health that we've talked about

115
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:43,600
that lead to like systematic inequality and then cumulative effects over time across generations.

116
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:53,240
So you have a biology environment interactions, then you have physical adaptation or disruption, then you have something called our static load,

117
00:13:53,570 --> 00:14:00,620
which is like cardiovascular and physiological load that result in like cellular aging and disease risk,

118
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:07,010
specifically cardiovascular disease risk, and that leads to healthy life or expectancy or inequity.

119
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:16,910
So if you think about something like, oh, like let me think about like I have a patio umbrella, right?

120
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:26,060
So I leave it outside and like throughout the year, like it's exposed to sun, it's exposed to the rain, it's exposed to the snow.

121
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,670
It was pretty cheap. I bought it at Lowe's for like 30 bucks.

122
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:39,259
So over time, like, my, my, like, patio umbrella becomes weathered because it's not the same color as it once was.

123
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:44,360
It's not like in as good of the condition as it once was because I like just left it outside.

124
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,130
I could bring it into my garage, but I'm like lazy.

125
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:59,870
But essentially the weather and hypothesis is if you take that, for example, but apply it to health and essentially health inequities.

126
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:09,170
So maybe if I bring this study, you'll like have hopefully talked about it in one of your other classes like Doctor Lopez's class.

127
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,340
So there was this seminal study done.

128
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,630
Shout out to all those girls. Maybe those one psycho social class.

129
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:28,300
There is a seminal study done looking at infant mortality rates between black women and white women.

130
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,660
Have I talked about this in this class? Okay, that was my class. I'm sorry.

131
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:39,850
So what they did was they looked at infant mortality rates and birth weight in white women in America.

132
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:45,220
Black women in Africa. Black women in America.

133
00:15:45,730 --> 00:16:01,600
Okay. And so when they looked and this was all adjusted for like age, income, level, gender, you know, smoking habits, diet, all this kind of stuff.

134
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,719
So they kind of did like this quasi experimental method that we call propensity score matching,

135
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,420
where it's like if you don't have the ability to conduct your own randomized controlled trial,

136
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,330
you kind of look at the sample and see like who is the closest 1 to 1 match.

137
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:27,280
Right? So like Ian and I would not be like a close 1 to 1 match in terms of comparison in a study.

138
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:33,670
But maybe Sarah and I would be based on maybe lifestyle factors and like age and some other things, right?

139
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:39,760
So when they looked at the white women in America and the black women in Africa,

140
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,730
they had comparable infant mortality rates and also gestational birth weight.

141
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:56,980
Okay. And then they followed some of these women once they immigrated to the United States and then followed up with their daughters,

142
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,090
who then had children, who then had children.

143
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:12,010
And over time, what you observe is these black women, their infant mortality rate skyrockets and the gestational birth weight goes down.

144
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,379
Right. And so all these other things are controlled for it's not like they're drinking during pregnancy.

145
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,190
It's not like they're smoking like 30 packs of cigarets a day.

146
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:27,820
But essentially, in this very comprehensive study, what they found was like these structural racism,

147
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:37,810
microaggressions, stressors of being like a black woman in America wore them down, whether them down over time.

148
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,830
And inherently, that's called biological embedding.

149
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,820
And what they talk about when they talk about like generational trauma,

150
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:52,060
general generational trauma can not only be like mental, but it can also be physical.

151
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,000
So what they observed was like this worsening of health over time.

152
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:02,000
So how many of you have heard that study before? Burnley.

153
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:08,049
Yeah. What I've heard in the context of, I don't know, I haven't read the study,

154
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,340
but I've heard about it from people, about people migrating from Central America.

155
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,650
And like after the first generation and people here, they have different health effects.

156
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:22,600
But it wasn't. I don't think it was about that. Right. Yeah. How your diet changes.

157
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:29,710
How your diet changes for sure. And like, you know, with migrants, for example, they have like also what they call like the healthy worker hypothesis.

158
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:37,540
So in order for you to like immigrate to this country and literally like sometimes like my parents, like my dad, for example,

159
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:44,559
like have to like sit on a boat for like two months and then like you dumped off in Guam and then like go to a refugee camp.

160
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,960
Like, you have to be like pretty healthy and robust.

161
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,770
Right.

162
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:57,099
But then, you know, talking about once you get to America and subsequent subsequent generations, like how behavioral patterns change and all that.

163
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,339
But it was I was actually messaging yesterday.

164
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,790
One of my colleagues was just on vacation for the last two weeks.

165
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,299
So nice in Albania and Greece.

166
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,890
And I was like because they were visiting families like you must have said so well.

167
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:17,020
And they were like, Yeah, but we also like walk so much.

168
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,250
We lost £5 just by like eating everything.

169
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,389
And I feel like in America in particular, it's not uncommon knowledge.

170
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,500
We have a lot of additives in our food, right.

171
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:35,649
And a lot of chemicals that aren't necessarily present in other countries.

172
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:41,350
So and we don't have good public transportation. So you like are so sedentary all the time.

173
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,390
Like when when I go to Europe to visit my family, I can eat dairy.

174
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,200
I can't eat dairy here. I'd be in trouble.

175
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,159
Right. So that's kind of what they talk about as well.

176
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,639
Or like, you know, even like if your parents are immigrants, for example,

177
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,280
when my mom first came to America, she was like so skinny, like a thin, thin.

178
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:10,230
Then even after she had my sister, but then she started adapting more like American eating habits and yeah, yeah.

179
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,640
So that's an example of the weathering hypothesis. The most common one is that study about.

180
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:24,719
Infant mortality rate because it kind of like coined the term. But this can be applied to to a lot of like other right other studies.

181
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,300
And I think this is quite interesting at least to me because like I my I, my undergrad was in cognitive science.

182
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,080
So if you think about, for example, like my parents are refugees,

183
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,739
they have a lot of like untreated PTSD and war trauma and all that kind of stuff like that.

184
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,629
Inherently, number one, affects the way that you're raised, but it's potentially as well.

185
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:57,060
Like all those stressors your mother carries while she's pregnant with you affects like your, your, like, neurobiology.

186
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:01,860
Um, yeah. Yeah. That's a whole other class though.

187
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:09,840
So structural racism exists in healthcare, I think too, this class that is not a surprise,

188
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:19,410
but the American Medical Association and a lot of physicians will like swear up and down that there is no such thing as racism in healthcare.

189
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:29,850
So this was a tweet that came out last year in February 2021, and it was a commentary like the one you all right?

190
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,329
Eventually. And it was also podcast.

191
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:43,170
You know, physician is a racist. So how can there be structural racism in health care and explanation of the idea by doctors for doctors in this

192
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:49,770
user friendly podcast and this is from the Journal of American Medical Association's official Twitter account,

193
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,910
this receives so much backlash like, as you can imagine, on the Twitter sphere.

194
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:08,610
But in the year of 2021 and one of the most respected journals in medicine like this is still the kind of stuff that they are essentially.

195
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:16,150
I don't know how getting. Do any of you remember that tweet?

196
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:22,090
Okay. So when we're talking about infectious disease outcomes,

197
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:27,790
obviously it will also impact a person's health insurance coverage, their quality of coverage,

198
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:34,750
access to primary care physicians and specialists, access to diverse or culturally competent health care providers,

199
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,410
access to health care facilities and responsive treatment.

200
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:49,960
And follow up. I would say like here in Ann Arbor and in California, I have gotten like some of the most responsive health care that I've gotten.

201
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:59,170
And now that I, you know, compared to California and Michigan, really good, because I can find not necessarily ethnically concordant providers,

202
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:08,230
but like a lot of my physicians and specialists are like Asian, South Asian American women, which is like awesome.

203
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,819
Whereas when I lived in Nebraska and Indiana, that was definitely not the case.

204
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,500
It was just like whoever's there and can I get an appointment, please?

205
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:18,909
But I can definitely tell.

206
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:29,049
Like, for me at least, I feel like it affects my comfortability and like, my, my, my level of feeling understood as a patient in terms of,

207
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:34,090
like, getting the health care that I need, but not all people get those benefits.

208
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:44,560
There's also, you know, issues historically with biomedical ethics in terms of and structural racism.

209
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,270
This is a photo of Henrietta Lacks. How many of you know about Henrietta Lacks?

210
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,270
Can somebody give me, like, a quick rundown of her?

211
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,440
Bernie. Yeah, I did read the book.

212
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,630
Okay. You were in justice? Yeah.

213
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:11,400
So she came in. I don't even. I feel like she's from the South, but I don't know what state it happened in.

214
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:16,370
Johns Hopkins. Johns Hopkins. Oh, great. Yes.

215
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:21,920
So she came in, she had sort of painted. And I feel like her.

216
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,120
She I don't know if she was really. It's okay.

217
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,770
It's okay. Other people could fill the gaps.

218
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:38,870
She was told if she had cervical cancer, but they took her cells and they've used them for a bunch of discoveries because these cells.

219
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,850
They think that since they're cancerous, you can't kill them.

220
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,940
So they're what is the word? They're immortal.

221
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,770
Oh, yeah. And her family was not compensated for it.

222
00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:00,230
She. She died. I don't know. She died from lack of treatment that they gave her.

223
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:06,060
But the family is not as if I know right now the family is not.

224
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:11,980
Given the pandemic and how much money these cells. Right.

225
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,480
Where she consented about use of ourselves. Yeah.

226
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:22,690
So these are called the HeLa cells now. Right. And they're like the most have been the most used cells.

227
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:28,960
And like all biomedical experiments, anyone else want to fill in any anything for this story?

228
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:35,430
So yes, it is about the immortal life of Henrietta Lacks. And then Oprah, I think you a movie about it.

229
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,650
Yeah. Yeah. But that's just like one example and this.

230
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:47,339
And then a lot of other things like the Tuskegee syphilis experiment like is why, you know,

231
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:55,950
there is a lot of strict human subjects, ethics, training that people have to go through now.

232
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:01,290
People still do wild stuff all the time, though. All the time.

233
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,899
Also, some issues we have are trusted and reliable sources of information,

234
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,760
especially in this digital age of like social media and like we've talked about before,

235
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,620
like clickbait headlines and like people misconstruing information.

236
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:23,190
Testing, contact tracing and surveillance is generally lower in communities of color as well,

237
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:32,100
just because some of the resources that focus in that area, but also in order to do testing and contact tracing and surveillance,

238
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:38,610
people have to report that information or like seek care to like a provider who kind of

239
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:43,950
serves as a sentinel or is like feeding that data into some kind of repository or database,

240
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:50,910
right. Culturally and linguistically, linguistically appropriate care is also an issue.

241
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:57,150
So, for example, we were talking about Henrietta Lacks and cervical cancer out of.

242
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:03,520
Excuse me. I drove up, like in the 1990 and early 2000,

243
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:09,429
Vietnamese American women were actually some of the high and had some of the highest rates of

244
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:16,750
cervical cancer out of any ethnic group just because they weren't getting pap smears done,

245
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:25,540
because there's like cultural beliefs about how like going to get a gynecological exam can compromise your chastity.

246
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:32,380
And in Vietnamese culture, like chastity and like virginity up until the time you're married is like a huge deal.

247
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,990
So what they did in California was essentially conduct this huge community based,

248
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:44,290
participatory research approach where they found a bunch of Vietnamese providers in,

249
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:47,380
like the Westminster Orange County area,

250
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:54,040
did some education like fliers and like restaurants and like nail salons and like

251
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,990
the local Vietnamese magazines and radios where it will actually reach people.

252
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:05,020
And then they were able to dispel some information about like what is a pap smear actually for

253
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:10,330
get those rates of cervical cancer screening up and then those rates of cervical cancer found.

254
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,240
And also like things become more complicated, right when you have an intersectionality of identities.

255
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:23,139
So those who identify as minority and female, like Henrietta Lacks, for example,

256
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:32,740
are like these Vietnamese women in Orange County might encounter not only racism barriers, but also gender identity barriers.

257
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:39,610
So just as a reflection, I just take a minute, a few minutes to yourself.

258
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:48,060
Right. And then we'll see if anybody you like is willing to share, take a few minutes to yourself, do anything there, jot down notes or you type it.

259
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:54,340
But like think about an experience where you felt like you didn't receive the health

260
00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:02,830
care that you needed because of your identity or how you look or how you present.

261
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:07,239
Right. And it doesn't I mean, this is your perception, right?

262
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:15,490
Because you I'm guessing none of us have ever went back to a provider to be like, hey, did you treat me this way because I am a woman?

263
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:20,740
Like, No, right? But I would just like you to take a few minutes to reflect on that.

264
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:25,920
I will as well and see if we have anything we want to. I share with the group.

265
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,860
Okay. Is that enough time? Okay.

266
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:24,089
Does anyone want to share? Okay.

267
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:27,390
Lexi? Yeah. So thank you. Visual impairment.

268
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:34,020
Like, that's pretty bad. Like, I go to a specialist here and do them. Just don't wear my glasses because they don't help that much, so.

269
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:41,220
Okay. Not enough to make a difference. And so, um, I went to a doctor for a routine physical one time,

270
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,890
and he proceeded to give me a lecture about how I needed to get a driver's license because I was a burden to my family.

271
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,940
And so there was a big disconnect there about.

272
00:30:53,510 --> 00:31:00,200
What was going on. I heard like laughter in the hallway between, like, the Emmys about me failing my vision test.

273
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:06,370
I'm like, Yeah, that was a. Think I'm so sorry.

274
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:13,280
Lexi now, like. Is there something?

275
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:19,450
Do they send you a survey afterward? I would have blown that up.

276
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,620
Yeah. Yeah. So that was something.

277
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,410
Mhm. And this was just for like a regular a physical exam.

278
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,860
Yeah. Okay. And I think they're just below the minimum person needs.

279
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,450
They weren't working classes at all. But they don't help that much.

280
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:42,010
I talked to my doctor about it and he goes, well, you should still be working.

281
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:49,500
They help you just a little bit like you should still be getting. Talk to my specialist about this one.

282
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:53,330
Right. So I felt like it could have been left at that.

283
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,629
But the comment that, like you're a burden to your parents, maybe, I don't know,

284
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:05,210
some ageism there or some, like, you know, personal stuff projecting onto you.

285
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,610
Yeah. I'm sorry. Thank you for sharing.

286
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:15,610
Anyone else want to share? Oh, I had a similar experience.

287
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:21,850
I've been a Type one diabetic for almost 30 years and I went to which I see a specialist for,

288
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:30,430
and I went to my primary doctor for, you know, something totally unrelated to that and all.

289
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:39,610
She she just fixated on my diabetes and she's like, sorry, talking to me about carbohydrates and different types of carbs.

290
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:43,420
And she's like, Do you know the difference between this and this?

291
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,800
And I said, Yeah, I've been doing this for 25 years.

292
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,520
I, I know what I'm doing. That's not why I'm here.

293
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,590
And then she still proceeded to talk about it and, like, didn't even address the issue that I was there for.

294
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:03,160
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

295
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:10,720
They don't give a ton of cultural competency or like sensitivity training in in medical school.

296
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:16,989
I think that is changing now in case you and of course, that to call you out, I think that is changing now.

297
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,580
But previously let because I have a lot of friends who are up going to medical school,

298
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:25,540
it was like maybe like half the lecture out of four years or something.

299
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:33,879
Right. And then like having met people over the course of time were like when I was at a layover in Las Vegas, really interesting.

300
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:45,580
Like I met this woman who is a paid actor to be these like stand in patients for for doctors to be reenactments, to do reenactments.

301
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,020
And she was a woman of color and she, like, really loved her job.

302
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:57,399
And that was super interesting. But like, we were in like Vegas and I think we were all flying back to California or something, right?

303
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,900
But like, if you don't necessarily have that opportunity to, like,

304
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:10,420
interact with diverse populations and like provide that kind of care or get that experience or get that cultural competency,

305
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:15,520
like by the time that it comes, I think they just don't know what to do.

306
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,660
And that's when like implicit biases. Getting him out for sure.

307
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,000
I don't know that I've ever had.

308
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:32,210
I can say, like based on my providers, that I felt it was because of my race or ethnicity, but certainly, certainly my gender.

309
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:41,430
Like, you know, sometimes with male providers, I feel like they're less comfortable interacting with me when I'm in the room like I had when they

310
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:47,790
would look me directly in the eyes because he was like kind of like a younger Asian male physician.

311
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:53,639
And I was like, I don't know, like in my early twenties or something like that, but you know,

312
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,510
like all of these kinds of things, if you can imagine, like we talked about before,

313
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:05,189
especially if you're like a person of color who experiences structural racism and also personally immediate racism,

314
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:14,150
every time you go and have like this bad health care experience, it's not just like one isolated incident, but it's like every single time, right?

315
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:21,030
Like you are not going to be likely to try to seek out care because it's just going to make you feel worse or you're not going to feel heard,

316
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,400
you know, these kinds of things. So I think you do too, for sure.

317
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:36,300
So an infectious disease response in particular, how racism exacerbates and hinders equitable response.

318
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:45,930
So this here is a framework from a paper there you can see from in case you want to read it.

319
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,140
But this is health inequalities in infectious diseases.

320
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:56,400
So this is essentially a framework that shows how you lead to an equal levels of illnesses and death.

321
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:04,259
Essentially, they separate the disparities into distal and proximal disparities where distal is, you know,

322
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:12,839
those higher level things like population structure, food, water, sanitation, ability to telecommute, social, psychological stress,

323
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:22,169
nutritional status, health care and then the proximal are like assertive, mixing, handwashing behavior, social distancing,

324
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:29,280
inflammation and immune function, vaccine behavior, health care utilization, treatment options available.

325
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,610
And that, in turn, can lead to differential susceptibility and severity to diseases.

326
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:42,900
The top ones can lead to differential exposure in the bottom ones can lead to differential consequences.

327
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,430
So I think that one lays it out pretty, pretty nicely.

328
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:56,489
So if we look here at select factors contributing to an equitable response, you have your sdoh age like poverty, race,

329
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:05,790
ethnicity, social marginalization, physical environment, but also discrimination when accessing resources for example.

330
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:15,209
So for example, like what is their perception if you are seeking like social services and you're like a person of color,

331
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:19,530
for example, your geographic location, your living situation,

332
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,709
and then you also have organization,

333
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:31,980
things that happen at organizational institutional levels where there's failure to take into account social disadvantages and disparities.

334
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:46,350
So. Okay. Trying to think of an example for you discrimination when accessing resources.

335
00:37:49,030 --> 00:38:00,769
So I through K through 12 was a was a free lunch kid my entire life because my parents got divorced when I was really young.

336
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:04,340
My mom was like basically working from paycheck to paycheck.

337
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:11,030
But for me, everybody at my school was a free lunch and like we were all free lunch kids.

338
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:22,640
So it wasn't like until I went to college that I realized that there were like differentials, like discrimination about access and resources.

339
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:31,940
I was also a work study student in college. I also received like financial aid that was not only merit based but also need based.

340
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:40,490
So I remember I was in like a satire newspaper for a campus I was on.

341
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,030
The writing staff is kind of like The Onion, but not as good.

342
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:50,150
Do we have something like that here? Just a serious newspaper is a serious newspaper.

343
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:55,190
Okay. Nobody knows. I just know about the Michigan Daily and that's a serious one.

344
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,630
So I was on like the Onion version of like We Do.

345
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,830
You do have one. Oh, okay. I called every three weekly or something like that.

346
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:09,439
Oh, okay. That's pretty funny. Okay. I've never seen it distributed like an undergrad things.

347
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,100
You don't really see it in this building. Oh, yeah. That's why I did this when I was an undergrad.

348
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:18,140
And I remember sitting in like the editorial office because it was like production night,

349
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,580
because that paper came out quarterly and there was this guy.

350
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,940
And I still remember this conversation because it still bothers me that much.

351
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:29,450
And I am so petty. I just like, Oh my gosh, sorry, just kidding.

352
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:36,590
But like we were. And he was always like, be trying to be competitive with me and like, I'm like, dude, why?

353
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:45,770
Like, so, like, for example, my roommate and I got a radio show for the College Station, like, because you can sign up for slot.

354
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:50,149
So we had like this one hour slot and then like he also signed up with another

355
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:53,900
friend and like didn't say anything to me and just like DM'd me on Facebook,

356
00:39:53,900 --> 00:40:02,690
the link to their show. Like I also have a show now because we were both pre-med and I was like, Why are you this way?

357
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:13,579
He went to medical school and is a pediatrician now. But, but I remember like he was, we were having conversation and I was like, oh yeah,

358
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,840
like a, you know, I'm here like on a full scholarship, you know, blah, blah, blah.

359
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:23,450
And he was like, Oh, how did you do that? And I was like, Well, you know, I was like valedictorian of my high school.

360
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:27,859
And he was like, Oh, but you went to like a low income high school, right?

361
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:33,319
And I was like, Yeah. And he said, Well, that doesn't count because you were valedictorian there.

362
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:44,990
So it's not as hard. And I was just like at the time when I was like 20, I didn't realize how messed up that was.

363
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:53,140
And now that's over ten years later. I still want to message like, you know.

364
00:40:53,600 --> 00:41:06,920
Yeah, anyway, but like that is I hope he's suffering, but that is like, you know, like why why should my like, we're both here.

365
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,270
Why does that make a difference of the fact that, like,

366
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:19,909
I was successful in like a low income setting versus like, you grew up really rich and came from like Kansas.

367
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:24,260
Miss, Miss Kansas City. Right. And your parents have like a transplant for you.

368
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:33,469
Like, doesn't that speak more to the fact that I overcame, like, systemic barriers, but it was, like, very looked down upon that.

369
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:41,360
I was like on a need based scholarship. What the [INAUDIBLE] is this? But anyway, that's just my personal example, because we're never chatty today,

370
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,290
so you just have to hear a bunch of me talking about my prejudice against people.

371
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:50,389
So. So with COVID 19 in particular, right.

372
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:58,790
We super saw the structural racism come out for those with racial and ethnic minorities or those from low SES backgrounds.

373
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:11,120
There was at the very beginning like challenges with COVID testing, accessibility, mistrust, outreach, financial, this digital divide, transportation.

374
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:19,999
So example, for example, the government ended the program to send free test kits home to your house,

375
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,530
the rapid test last month that was like the last call for it.

376
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,740
But because the main way you request it was going on like you know,

377
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:32,569
COVID test dot gov or USPS dot com with that digital divide like my sister and

378
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:36,860
I had to like put it in my mom's name and like get those tests done to her.

379
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:46,760
She didn't have a computer at her house, right? Then it also led to poor cardiovascular outcomes related to COVID 19 since it attacks the whole body.

380
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:56,220
A lot of. Chronic long COVID symptoms and physiological strain on the cardiovascular system,

381
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,600
especially for those who not only got COVID infection once, but who got it twice.

382
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:05,790
Okay. But also there were limitations of the COVID 19 trials.

383
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:13,830
They did try really hard to get people from different racial and ethnic groups, and they got people from all age ranges.

384
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,650
Right, because they wanted to be able to distribute it to kids.

385
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:24,960
But, you know, most of the COVID 19 trials, not only in the United States, but abroad, were performed at large academic centers.

386
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:30,930
Right. And they have differential levels of commitment to vulnerable populations.

387
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:40,830
So like I said, like maybe like here at the University of Michigan, maybe like I'm totally making this up.

388
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:46,170
Like, if they happen to work with Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, did you clinical trials,

389
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:55,580
that obviously looks very different than somebody who's just doing a clinical trial, for example, at like Nebraska medicine.

390
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:02,669
Right. The majority of clinical trial participants are from the United States, Western Europe and Asia,

391
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:09,040
in particular East Asia, lack of vulnerable patient groups such as racial,

392
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:13,890
ethnic minorities or individuals from low SES backgrounds in the COVID trials,

393
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:24,930
and a lack of principal investigators from underrepresented racial ethnic backgrounds in medicine in general conducting these clinical trials.

394
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:29,820
Um, any, any thoughts or comments about that?

395
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:43,650
No. You all know that historically clinical trials have mostly been performed in a male male rats.

396
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:51,900
Uh huh. Okay. Yeah. So that's why, like, in terms of, like, even medications, for example,

397
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:59,850
for the side effects that occur in women, they're just like, oh, we didn't we didn't expect this to happen.

398
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:08,580
And in particular, you know, there's a whole other side group, but a lot of.

399
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:18,650
Obviously a lot of people doing the research in the work on minority communities are not people who are minority themselves.

400
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:25,250
Right. And a lot of people trained in biomedical research are not trained in community based

401
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:31,520
participatory research principles are not necessarily trained in cultural competency.

402
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:39,800
Yeah, I get it. You're trying to make the world better, but sometimes honestly, people are just going after what gets them grant money.

403
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:45,840
So sometimes that now is being talked about more in the academy.

404
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:55,339
I went to an interesting webinar last year called Epistemic Exclusion of Research, essentially where historically,

405
00:45:55,340 --> 00:46:02,150
like minority scholars like myself who have been doing work in minority communities, when we do it,

406
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:10,279
we don't get nearly the level of attention or money or grant funding as as white scholars do.

407
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:21,229
And now that in public health, racism, anti-racist stuff, all this kind of thing is becoming super like a popular topic,

408
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:27,420
like pay attention to who do you see getting those grants and all that?

409
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:34,399
But, you know, I mean, I think everybody wants to do the right thing in in theory,

410
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,790
but in practice, in principle, sometimes it can look very different.

411
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:44,870
Right. So that's why, like now when you do clinical trials to the NIH, they'll want you to see, you know,

412
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:51,620
we have to fill out these forms to show like racial and ethnic distribution anticipated for our recruitment pool,

413
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:58,100
including individuals across the lifespan. If you're including women and minorities, why or why not?

414
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:05,570
If you're including children, why or why not? And if you're working with a minority population but no one on your team is,

415
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:14,360
they'll generally want to see like a community advisory board who is from the community on there in order to strengthen strength in your application.

416
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,280
That doesn't happen a lot in STEM.

417
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:24,620
I will say also the government and public health don't honestly have time to perform this kind of kind of oversight.

418
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:36,320
This is data from last year, from the American Community Health Survey, from the Kaiser Family Foundation from 2019 2010 to 2018.

419
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:47,020
Showing the rates of uninsured, no insurance for people who were non-elderly by race and ethnicity.

420
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:54,400
So I know it's different. Grady, is anyone is anyone not able to see the different shades?

421
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:06,910
Sorry, I didn't think about that. So the top one is black, followed by Asian, not Asian American, Indian-American native.

422
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:14,409
And then you have also the top is Hispanic and then American Indian American native, followed by blacks,

423
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:23,260
followed by Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, followed by Asian and then white.

424
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:33,910
In terms of levels of not having health insurance for COVID 19 people, at the very beginning,

425
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:39,880
people of color had higher rates of infection, hospitalization and death due to COVID.

426
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:53,890
So here you can see the breakdown again in terms of cases, hospitalizations and subsequent death here between all the different major racial groups.

427
00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:03,800
Here are our vaccine rates where this was between March to June of 2021.

428
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:10,730
There she is. There is a note that persons of Hispanic origin, though, may be any race but are categorized as Hispanic.

429
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:18,980
And then you can see the highest vaccination receipt of at least one dose is Asian, followed by white.

430
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,970
Followed by Hispanic, followed by black.

431
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:41,730
So just just think to yourself, you know, with this covered example, how might this relate to infectious diseases and other emergency response?

432
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:50,420
She's a thinker. Okay. So let's talk about Hurricane Katrina.

433
00:49:51,920 --> 00:50:01,579
So in Hurricane Katrina here, we're going to talk about like these four main areas where the hurricane itself

434
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:06,710
exacerbated structural inequalities in terms of differentials in infrastructure,

435
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:11,720
geographical development and class differences, environmental justice issues.

436
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:17,390
There was this perception that if the response would have been faster if most of the victims were white.

437
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:24,890
Right. The evacuation timing and the recovery has been slow for blacks versus whites in terms of housing and employment.

438
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:32,630
So how many of you were alive during Hurricane Katrina?

439
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,009
Okay, most of you. Okay. I don't I don't know how. I don't know.

440
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:42,020
1000 more than you are. Like college students now are born in, like, the year 2000 or eight.

441
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,870
Yeah. Okay. Everybody in grad school had to have been for.

442
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:52,250
They might not read. Okay. Yes. Yes.

443
00:50:56,210 --> 00:51:09,080
So Hurricane Katrina. Up until recently was one of the most devastating hurricanes experienced in the Gulf Coast region.

444
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:16,250
And in particularly in particular, it hit New Orleans, which is a predominantly black community.

445
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:23,630
Right. Mostly low. And it was just.

446
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:27,420
A cluster. This essentially,

447
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:38,879
if you remember Commander Garza talking about how before this like FEMA wasn't really very involved in terms of like any infectious disease response,

448
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,380
like they used to do emergency management. Right. They didn't really do public health stuff.

449
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:48,540
And they came under a lot of heat after Hurricane Katrina.

450
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:57,120
So in terms of the evacuation, many of the people who were poor and vulnerable were left stranded.

451
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:03,000
And like you see, these kinds of things happen all the time where these that there's this rhetoric or conversation about,

452
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:07,200
like, well, why don't people just evacuate, right?

453
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,189
And some people are stubborn, right? And they really just, like want evacuate.

454
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:15,060
But like, why? Why might someone not evacuate?

455
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:21,480
They don't want anywhere to go. Nowhere else to go. Right. What about a hotel?

456
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,860
Can't afford it and afford it. Right.

457
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:35,270
Uh, they don't they may not have the social capital or the resources or everybody they know lives in that area and is in the same situation.

458
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:44,299
Or like I work in a job where it's like, I can't take time off to, like, evacuate, right?

459
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:49,460
I might be like one of these frontline workers who, like, are still having to work at a grocery store.

460
00:52:51,690 --> 00:53:02,339
Okay. So. Oh, sorry. Forgot to queue this up. So I do have a trigger warning on this, but I do have this video to share about Katrina survivors.

461
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:05,640
Here's their hurricane survival story.

462
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,819
What kind of ad will I get before I phone?

463
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:20,160
14. I'm refusing to do the iOS 16 update because I hate drains and battery.

464
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:34,540
See how long you can hold off. Okay. The winds are going to pick up again, just like what you're seeing right now.

465
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:40,990
This that's not a small storm. I believe that they want to help us.

466
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:47,590
It was many times that a few helicopters, you know, came on the roof and rescued a lot of us.

467
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:51,320
It just made me feel like, you know, this is just nothing.

468
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:55,630
You know, it's just like they want us to die.

469
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:11,470
I was there with my family, my grandmother, my own little brother and sister.

470
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,790
My grandma didn't want to leave here, so I'm kind of staying with.

471
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:24,400
It was five days. I'm surprised that this building is still standing tall after ten years later because,

472
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:29,860
you know, I thought it was going to collapse on us, was going to come in.

473
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:42,260
And when the levees were breaking, I think a whole first level spilled water sit right on that brick everywhere holders, that small hole right over.

474
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,280
You can see the lying on the floor. That's where the water was.

475
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:53,500
I like that I saw was at night that that really from that night on four days afterwards, we didn't have no power.

476
00:54:53,770 --> 00:55:00,160
So we had to kind of like make stuff work. It was only actually that day that it's gone.

477
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:08,980
But from that point on it was, you know, a sunny day like nothing happened, you know, but water was everywhere.

478
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:17,559
I mean, you can see bodies also bloom. I'm not sure what those people were in a helicopter, those news reporters or anything like that.

479
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:25,380
But just watching us not help the lifeboats is the only, you know, rescues that were at the hands.

480
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:42,030
We all throw it all away from Rio without so suddenly. So I will try that.

481
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:59,310
Everybody was here. You know, most of all, this is a crowd of people, random people getting hurt, getting killed already, you know, dead.

482
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:04,170
So I was kind of looking at that as a motivation to move forward.

483
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:08,970
You know, so because that could be me or one of my family members right there.

484
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:26,430
You have your own servants and how we home.

485
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:32,790
We went straight to the convention center on the lawn at 18 with a truck.

486
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,050
What was his hair is not flat. I couldn't get that part.

487
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:48,410
It was like it was almost safe to say that I was purposely not.

488
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:55,450
And I was wondering, are we going to be safe? Oh, no.

489
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:03,190
I mean, I thought I was going to have more matches. I just thought it was going better area.

490
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:10,060
No water, no ice, no crashes.

491
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:17,890
Nothing for the last four days that people around the walls of a convention center laying in the middle of the street.

492
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:24,670
Babies threw, babies dehydrated and died. I just tried to take it first day here.

493
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:31,420
And, you know, it was kind of crowded. Meanwhile, almost the whole city was here.

494
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:41,520
I said in the prison. And I was also told that a lot of criminals were also.

495
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:49,630
Yeah. They kind of, you know, watch it bag. It wasn't safe. Well they didn't have really.

496
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:59,170
Like not able to carry in his area on the inside was like no caps National Guards nothing in that.

497
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:07,299
That's the way the look on my father's face.

498
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:12,879
Heidi was just living like this, losing hope, you know, I was walking around walking.

499
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,490
And even though it's not a happy time, you know, you can just feel like giving up.

500
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,620
I think family life is great right here holding hands.

501
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:34,630
Died, his wife and two kids. Well, when I say all conventions and all screaming wives, and if I was not about that, have.

502
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:42,620
But. Yeah.

503
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:49,280
I was right in H. Just one big symmetry here.

504
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:58,780
I'm standing right up in this area where I went against the wall for a few nights.

505
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:06,250
Well, we were on the inside of these escalators right here, the same escalators I went up.

506
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:09,790
You know, I was looking for refuges for our families, stuff like that.

507
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:14,350
So, you know, there's a real dog up there from the flashlight.

508
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:24,150
Oh, this is a great spot. Home upstairs, we saw a little girl and I says, you know, we're happy she's wearing it.

509
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:29,100
I would say my 14 year old. So it's terrifying.

510
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:32,280
I mean, it's give me life. I would have the same thing.

511
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:45,630
There. We have this kind of monster coming across our country every day, I guess, to minimize the chaos of what was going on.

512
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:53,340
But I think it was going, you know, at the end of the night was making everybody more angry because nobody came.

513
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:58,920
I don't know. I don't know, man. I let them walk out here, walk the [INAUDIBLE] out of here.

514
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:02,160
Walk me to some other town. Walk someplace where you can help them.

515
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:11,309
My own family car. We tried to go up this bridge to exit, so, you know, I'm nervous when they tell us to pull over.

516
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:16,920
My. Oh, my God. I'm letting my family killed three other guys, came over and pointed rifles at each other.

517
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:22,800
You know, even when we had rifles in for Lincoln's good thing health is good, he was like, You know what?

518
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:27,330
So let's go. But now we're not coming back for anybody, anything, you know?

519
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:33,290
Just keep on going. I will come back. We made it past the holidays.

520
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:38,610
I mean, it was like a big weight loss that everybody so eager to make.

521
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:44,340
So. I feel like I'm sort of year.

522
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:54,610
I felt safe. You know, I was around family and we were on the road when I saw them in one area.

523
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:58,810
You know, I just fell more than anything else out of those.

524
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:10,390
That was like the best. Okay.

525
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:18,300
Powerful video. I chose that one since I was like, I'm more of a personal story than just a news report.

526
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:25,530
Any, any, any. Any thoughts or reactions to that particular video?

527
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:34,950
Has anyone had a chance to go down to New Orleans since 2000?

528
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:38,460
Six for me? Yeah. What was it like?

529
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:44,410
I was my first time there. I went there. I mean, I think I.

530
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:53,520
And yeah, I didn't know what to think of. Like I, I like I really didn't have anything deteriorating.

531
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:56,780
So seeing those pictures on my phone. Gosh. Yeah. Yeah.

532
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:02,470
I mean, the devastation was like. Absolutely immense.

533
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:06,610
And we'll talk more about this as time goes on.

534
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:13,540
Abby, I know that like what you said in the video about how it felt like it was like, you know,

535
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:21,190
because their neighborhood was so devastated, but then driving it, like they got to a place where it wasn't like it felt stage staged.

536
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,660
Like, I remember watching like so many documentaries after Hurricane Katrina.

537
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:30,819
And one of the things that got brought up was that like when the Lower Ninth

538
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:35,620
Ward movies like was people like heard next or thought they heard explosion.

539
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:38,890
And like there was these like there were stories of like.

540
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:45,910
Was this planned? Was this on purpose that like hearing about, like, explosion, whether it be explosions like the levees breaking.

541
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:57,249
So just like you said, I mean, you remember all these documentaries and like the notion of like, was this place right?

542
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:01,780
And I mean, I can definitely understand like that perception of it, right?

543
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,759
Because like, we're we're in public house.

544
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:13,419
So we understand things like like structural inequalities and differential in like housing structure and like how these like hasn't been maintained.

545
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:20,530
And all that in the Lower Ninth was predominantly black adjacent to it was a very in New Orleans,

546
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:25,720
there's a community called resi where it's like a lot of Vietnamese people lived as well.

547
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:31,750
So it used to be on. I don't I think they took it off as called village cover side.

548
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:38,110
But this is a documentary about the Vietnamese community adjacent to the Lower Ninth and how like

549
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:46,560
after Katrina they came they were some of the first people to come back to the decimated area.

550
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:53,709
Right. Just because, like a lot of them have already seen their home country destroyed and now they America is their home.

551
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:56,290
So they're not going to lose their home a second time.

552
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:05,530
So they came back and they rebuilt and that kind of signal to like the adjacent black community also like it's time to come back,

553
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:13,809
it's time to rebuild. But the city of New Orleans, when they went to the city planning meetings,

554
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:18,010
usually they like Asian-American people historically in the past not do a lot of advocacy.

555
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:24,820
But this group, interestingly, started to advocate because they found out like the Lower Ninth in a lot of these areas where minorities used to live,

556
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:29,200
they weren't going to rezone it for residential housing.

557
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:36,310
They were just going to turn it into green space because they assumed that people weren't going to come back.

558
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:47,050
And it's easier to just like level everything and put like grass there or like make it a outdoor space then like rebuild housing for people.

559
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:56,770
And then in resi they also wanted to put a hazardous waste site there because where else that it could go, right?

560
01:04:56,780 --> 01:05:00,399
So this is a very interesting documentary if you have time to watch.

561
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,920
But you know, like for like as we mentioned earlier,

562
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:10,180
like a lot of people did not have the option to leave and then they're essentially being held hostage at the convention center.

563
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:13,780
So we'll talk later about FEMA's slow response.

564
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:20,800
But this was like a lot of backlash because President George W Bush was in office at this time.

565
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:28,750
You know, he was already under a lot of heat because, you know, 911 wasn't like too long before that.

566
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:36,040
This was like the infamous Kanye West, quote, like George W Bush didn't care about black people.

567
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:43,060
That was in reference to Hurricane Katrina. So just a ton of fallout from this.

568
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:49,000
And, I mean, do you do you all think we've learned anything as a country from Katrina?

569
01:05:51,040 --> 01:06:00,110
John, I see you're speaking your head. Mm hmm. I just feel like for other responses that I have been, like, very familiar.

570
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:13,250
And so it's like there is nothing. Like an inadequate response to, you know, people that infected by the cancer.

571
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:20,810
Right. Right. Yeah. And you feel like that is because of structural racism or do you think it's other things?

572
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:30,590
Oh, well, yes, I do think that there's. An impossible.

573
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:40,950
Yeah. So I mean, if we take a look at, you know, recent examples here in the United States and all over the world,

574
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:48,419
like a little like inclement weather or what we consider like once every hundred years, like this hurricane that's about to come in Florida.

575
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:51,450
This is about to become once every few years. Right.

576
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:57,749
So there was Harvey, there was Maria, there was Irma recently, Fiona.

577
01:06:57,750 --> 01:07:05,520
The flooding in Jackson, Mississippi, was just due to like heavy, heavy rainfall.

578
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:10,410
But Jackson, Mississippi is about like 80% black.

579
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:17,460
And so you're like if you read the news stories talking about Jackson,

580
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:27,510
local and state officials knew and they have quotes where we talked about this in my online class that they knew the infrastructure has been on,

581
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:36,510
quote, the brink of collapse for quite some time, but in particular, nothing was addressed.

582
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:44,879
And actually, let me bring up some some some statistics from that class, because it kind of overlaps when you figure out one Zoom session.

583
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,340
This was. Okay.

584
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:55,420
Yeah. So we don't need to. This is from my other class, but we don't need to watch the video about the flooding in Mississippi.

585
01:07:55,660 --> 01:08:02,500
But if you look here, these are some some images that I pulled from the American Society of Civil Engineers.

586
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:12,700
So if you look at across the U.S., the average age of roads, dams, water treatment plants is beyond the average life expectancy.

587
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:19,450
So for roads in the United States, the average life expectancy is 20 years.

588
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:23,560
And in the U.S., most of our roads now are about 29 years old.

589
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:29,320
Bridges, average life expectancy 50. The average age for bridges 43.

590
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:33,160
Okay. Railways 30. Where you at?

591
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:38,380
28? Water pipes. We've got maybe another five years.

592
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:45,990
Dams. We overshot it by six years. Levees were right on point and water treatment plants.

593
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:55,540
We've overshot it by five years, as seen in Jackson, Mississippi, because it started with issues at the water treatment plant.

594
01:08:55,900 --> 01:09:00,670
And if you look at the differences or since the 1950s until now,

595
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:10,420
about the level of investment from the federal government on versus state and local governments on transportation and water infrastructure,

596
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:20,440
it's really leveled out and the burden has fallen upon state and local governments that don't have as much financial resources,

597
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:29,410
but also the same person power as the federal government. Now, the Biden administration is trying to push forward this infrastructure bill.

598
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:33,130
Right. But there's a ton of like bipartisanship going on.

599
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:37,000
And if you look at the news coverage for the flooding.

600
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:42,730
Right. They talk about, again, how infrastructure inequity kind of led to this,

601
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:49,880
how underfunding and white flight contributed to the way the city of Jackson, Mississippi, has been left.

602
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:54,490
We talked about the demographics and there was this like huge controversy.

603
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,140
I don't know if you saw it on Twitter.

604
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:07,270
So this was like a huge water tank that was like this Twitter video was filmed outside of the governor's mansion

605
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:15,250
in Mississippi while like everybody else was waiting hours and hours in line just to get bottled water.

606
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:19,810
And in terms of like racism, in response, in terms of the news coverage,

607
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:26,979
we only see it explicitly mentioned in that article about environmental racism from Mississippi to Pakistan.

608
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:31,090
But the rest of the time is just like Mississippi.

609
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:33,909
Math students raised $5,000 for Jackson.

610
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:43,540
Flood relief like this should not be falling on schoolchildren like the owner should not be falling on schoolchildren to fix these kinds of burdens.

611
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:51,120
Or we're seeing this now, for example, with Hurricane Fiona in Puerto Rico.

612
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:55,750
They still haven't recovered from Marine Irma five years ago.

613
01:10:56,290 --> 01:11:02,590
If you recall, some people in Puerto Rico didn't have power for 11 months.

614
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:07,719
Right. The response took so long even to think, oh, who was it?

615
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:14,830
Elon Musk had to come down there and like bring his little Tesla cells to rebuild some of the infrastructure.

616
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:24,700
Some of the bridges that they rebuilt were during, you know, Maria Irma literally got washed away again last week during Fiona.

617
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:34,690
You know, at least this time response was deployed a little bit quicker as in they actually like had and the EMS

618
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:41,319
personnel and public health response personnel like ready to go before they knew Fiona was coming.

619
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:44,320
Just because these are the kinds of things you can actually predict. Right.

620
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:53,410
And they had, you know, three times the amount of power sources, ten times the amount of food, etc.

621
01:11:54,130 --> 01:12:00,910
And it's all good and well to have these things because it's like you can't immediately stop like a hurricane in its path.

622
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:04,000
I mean, there's like long terms, the things we can do for the environment.

623
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,030
But in terms of infrastructure,

624
01:12:07,450 --> 01:12:14,469
there are preventative things that could have been done in terms of like investing in resources or like one of

625
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:20,290
the biggest comments my mom has that she's noticed in the United States because she lived in Germany for a time,

626
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:30,579
was here in the United States, she noticed like houses are built super flimsy, like it's all like wooden frames and like plywood and stuff like that.

627
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:36,219
Just because they're trying to build them up really fast to make profit and turn them over and get it over with.

628
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:44,410
Whereas like in Europe, a lot of the house in Germany in particular, a lot of the structures are built of concrete or like stone.

629
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:53,980
Thinking about the longevity of a structure. And its ability to withstand, you know, the test of time, you know,

630
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:58,990
not having that kind of foresight rather than thinking about profits in particular.

631
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:05,409
Let me bring up the the some of the statistics for Maria or not.

632
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:10,980
Maria, Fiona, really fast. This class is like a little bit of a different scene.

633
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:18,640
Oh, I was talking about how I. I saw more about this than the hurricane.

634
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:23,950
But the reason was, you know, if you look at Puerto Rico, it is a U.S. territory.

635
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:30,129
Just to remind you, they have no voting power, but they do have limited legislative representation.

636
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:38,560
So they do have some members in Congress. Right. But this is predominantly almost all a Hispanic or Latino population.

637
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:45,670
So people go to Puerto Rico to go on vacation, to board their cruises there, to have a good time.

638
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:49,180
Right. Tourism is like one of its main bags.

639
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:59,110
But in terms of like wanting to give people representation and taking care of them as a U.S. territory, and it's not so much happening.

640
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:10,450
So this was a Category three storm that had about 85 miles per hour, 12 to 18 inches of rain, up to 30 inches in some areas that happened.

641
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:22,599
There was already as of Monday last week, half of the population was without power of almost a million without natural water sources.

642
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:28,810
Right. Bottled water was being handed out because natural resources had rough sewage flowing into it.

643
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:46,210
And then of the only a thousand people of the 3.2 million were accounted for as evacuating in the 130 shelters where the rest of the people,

644
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:55,360
one in five cell towers, were in operable. And so I had a feeling, like I said, they did deploy more supplies,

645
01:14:55,870 --> 01:15:04,570
but they already spent 9.6 billion to try to rebuild the island's electrical grid destroyed by Maria.

646
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:09,070
Now it has been undone again.

647
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:14,950
Right. And the mayors of San Juan in particular was interviewed.

648
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:24,519
And she said, even for Fiona now there's been a lot of talk, but actually very little action happening on the ground.

649
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,550
And they said it's all she said. It's all about leadership setting the tone.

650
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:35,890
So, you know, I'm no Chris Christie fan, but she mentioned in her article, like when Sandy, when was it not Sandy Hook.

651
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:43,120
It's that but not the flooding that happened. But that's a no no in New Jersey.

652
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:51,490
It was just dead. Sandy, sorry. Sandy Hook was the shooting hurricane sandy when hurricane sandy happened.

653
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:57,399
Like Chris Christie and president obama were on the ground within like hours of the storm clearing.

654
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:04,750
And in that, you know, article, she talked about how that really set a tone because leadership was like, we take this seriously.

655
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:08,830
We want to rebuild New Jersey. We had it right.

656
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:13,569
Whereas, you know, with Maria and Irma, like very slow response,

657
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:19,660
you see images like President Trump at the time, just like throwing paper towels at people into the crowd.

658
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:29,200
You know, I, I don't recall seeing as President Biden has actually visited yet, I mean, there's been some additional deployment.

659
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:34,330
But again, I'm curious to see how this will unfold over time.

660
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:38,080
Very different type of response. This is not for you.

661
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:46,239
Your homework assignments, not that very different response than like what we saw in 2021 in Texas with the ice storm, for example.

662
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:51,330
Right. Predominantly white population there.

663
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:55,899
Like the week before, they were like, oh, we're going to secede.

664
01:16:55,900 --> 01:17:05,530
Like we don't need to be part of United States. Bu we don't need to link up our power grid to share resources with Oklahoma and Nebraska.

665
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:13,660
And I have people I know who live in Texas. Some live in nice area codes and some don't live in nice area code.

666
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:19,090
So for the people who live in the nicer area, codes for their rolling blackouts they had during that week,

667
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:25,959
they had maybe like their power shut off like once a day for like half an hour max where zip codes

668
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:33,070
that were predominantly minority populations did not have power for days and days on an end.

669
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:41,830
So again, we see this this desperate response from the structural racism embedded within our systems.

670
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:52,900
So I'll leave it at that. And then on Thursday, we can get into specific infectious diseases that come out of flooding.

671
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:58,960
Any any final thoughts or comments or. Questions.

672
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:03,370
Okay. You're all kind of quiet today.
