1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,260
There's so much to cover, so little time.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:12,389
But actually, what I wanted to start with today was the forming of the community guidelines that we've mentioned.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,600
So it's in the canvas.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,630
But I also made an announcement this morning with the Google slides so we can all openly edit it.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,230
So the way I like to do this is, you know, I presented you with four community guidelines last,

6
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:36,030
last lecture, but we're going to add more and have some consensus as a class on which ones will solidify.

7
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,079
And I'll put that into canvas later today once we finalize it.

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,620
So we're going to break out into three groups and then, you know,

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,929
the respective groups will come up with their own and then we'll go through what the groups shared.

10
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,250
And then based on that, we'll decide as a collective which ones we want to keep.

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,379
So I think I'll break you out into groups. So for group one, I'll have she went to the bathroom.

12
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,370
Right. Okay.

13
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:16,830
I'll have when she comes back, see Swati, Neera and Chloe and then Ian, Paige, Sarah for group two and then for group three for the Abbie and Burn.

14
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:24,390
Okay, so go ahead and, you know, turn around respectively in your groups and give you about five,

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,930
5 to 10 minutes depending on how much conversation I see going on.

16
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,730
Feel free to just edit in that document directly and then we'll regroup in a little bit.

17
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,560
Yes, of course. Oh, yes, yes.

18
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:46,800
I'll pull that up as. I bet.

19
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:34,290
I dig around in my computer every day of the year and every year I am looking for a crowd and I don't know who I am,

20
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,510
but I don't want to bring this to you.

21
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,470
This is going to happen. You guys are so right.

22
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:53,800
And I think I'm a double edged sword. And also the 45 year old, another one of those that I don't like saying.

23
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:00,650
Yes. I guess it's because he hasn't answered question at this point.

24
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,100
It's not a plan. I feel like my sister. Oh, okay.

25
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:27,740
I'm going to have to join one of these two groups, another for the past three years, your sister and you remind us that I'm here.

26
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:39,180
Yes, I am. So I put all this together.

27
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:56,000
People. Of course, the floor of the House passes the Senate floor and.

28
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,790
We woke up one day, but it's really good to know there's something I'm not forgetting.

29
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:14,780
But really the first thing you have to do is let me know what you think about that.

30
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:24,730
And that's really our project I'm going to address.

31
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,370
Oh, my God. Yeah. All right. Good night.

32
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:42,880
So strive for intellectual. I think we're coming up on the deadlines, but it isn't really like it is.

33
00:04:45,630 --> 00:05:03,110
Oh, yeah. I saw. I saw. It's a good one.

34
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:20,860
Good to go to. You and your life do.

35
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,810
Go on. I know these are really particularly the last four.

36
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,090
I don't think I've ever seen enough. Yeah. Yeah.

37
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:36,880
Dr. Peoples is also trying to get her to guest lecturer for one of the things which used too busy this semester.

38
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,660
She was. She has a, B, D and now like.

39
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,509
Yeah. Like also feminist theory.

40
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:52,880
So she was at the Center for Teaching and Learning before she came over here.

41
00:05:53,470 --> 00:06:00,790
And I think for one of the few just over a year ago, because we've never had a day director before.

42
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,580
Like De I program in nature. His name is Mateen.

43
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:12,930
He's really cool. Yeah. Yeah. It seems.

44
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:19,380
Seems silly, but I think that's right.

45
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,850
So, group three. What's going on? And see.

46
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:34,280
I like oh, I like it this way.

47
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:49,850
Yeah, I maybe like I think if I can speak for my own experience rather than like other say, like, I know the amount of ordering, like.

48
00:06:51,010 --> 00:07:01,750
No, you're good. I'm like, I went to the point they're like, okay, I'm hearing a hearing other side converse.

49
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:13,030
All right. You know, group one we have regardless of people's opinions.

50
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,530
Oh, sorry. You just. I should let you write your own stuff, but go ahead.

51
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,590
We were just saying that, like, you know, no matter what opinion someone has, you should always treat them with respect.

52
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,810
Uh huh. And then. And then. Since we are in an infectious disease class.

53
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,860
Wash hands and. Yeah.

54
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,960
I mean, I feel like, you know, that should be an unspoken thing. Yeah.

55
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:42,300
You know. Okay. Group, too, you know?

56
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:51,670
So we said, uh, just respect common courtesy, ensure that we be respectful to other world views and perspectives and that you listen with personality.

57
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:59,530
Okay. And then group three, uh, use I statements and speak from your own experience.

58
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,080
Okay. I feel like there's some overlap between all three.

59
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,639
Well, how do you. I mean, with the exception of the hand washing line,

60
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:17,170
because I feel like that's implicit in not really fitting entirely into the into the the vibe of what we have going.

61
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:23,050
Are you okay with us adopting all of these in addition to the for and all kind of you know.

62
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:35,270
Reword and put them together. Are we okay with that? Okay. So I'll finalize this document and then put it back into canvas later today.

63
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:40,280
But this is this is like kind of like a contract. So this is what we've agreed upon.

64
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:49,100
If you violate the community norms, I'm not going to like throw you out of class or be like, shame, shame.

65
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,200
But you know, know that this was something that we discussed.

66
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:08,450
Right. So I think another one I you know, this is a school of public health tenant, which is practice forgiveness, which I, I like but I don't like.

67
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:15,530
So, you know, like a lot of times because we're all having a learning experience in the classroom,

68
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,840
it's okay if you misspeak or you feel like you made a statement that wasn't like

69
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,059
the best informed and maybe someone counter did and corrected you and you're like,

70
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,630
okay, I see where you're coming from. Like, maybe I shouldn't have said that kind of thing.

71
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:34,820
I feel like that's that's okay. But I feel like, you know, from my personal experience,

72
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:43,520
having to like take on a lot of the emotional labor of like educating people who have repeatedly done the same thing,

73
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:53,329
like at this point, like I've done with, like, you just need to, like, either get your act together or not, like, you know, give you the same grace.

74
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:58,940
It's more boundary establishing. But I would say maybe in this class we can try to practice forgiveness.

75
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:03,530
And if somebody becomes like, you know, exhibiting a pattern of behavior, I will address it.

76
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,490
But I don't think that should be an issue. Okay. All right.

77
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,379
Cool. So, so much material to cover today.

78
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,370
So little time or, you know, whatever. I'm always probably going to be behind.

79
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:25,580
So I will finish lecture one for part one and then move on to part two.

80
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:32,550
Yes. And now that I realize Wu's class is in here afterwards, like, we need to, like,

81
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:37,820
vacate immediately, but if we need to have conversations, then yes, we don't have it on Thursdays.

82
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,850
It's only on Tuesday. Oh, great. Okay.

83
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,950
I also teach an afternoon class in here and it was like the weirdest thing where

84
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,360
I was like teaching and the student just casually walks in and it was like,

85
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:57,049
Oh, are you teaching a class? And I was like, Yes. And I was like, My class is in here 30 minutes.

86
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,350
And I was like, okay, you can wait that bad.

87
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:07,000
But I think, you know, practicing forgiveness because we have not been in the classroom space in like two years,

88
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,070
I think everybody just like is reactivating to just say, I don't know.

89
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,450
So I will say I have a correction.

90
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:23,629
On Tuesday. I said that Mister Rogers was from Muncie, Indiana, capital of Indiana.

91
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:29,330
It's actually painter Bob Ross. And there is a Bob Ross museum in Muncie, if you want to go.

92
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,229
Okay. All right. That's my correction. All right.

93
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:39,770
So we left off on preventing the spread of infectious disease, because, again, we're just doing this very broad overview.

94
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:48,290
So decontamination is essentially the reduction of pathogenic or microbial materials on surfaces.

95
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,659
So this is generally accomplished using a chemical disinfectant.

96
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,500
So we're not eliminating or killing off any everything.

97
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,040
We're just reusing, reducing the level of pathogens.

98
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:12,589
And this is most commonly used in public settings. So, you know, these here are multipurpose disinfecting wipes that are made of ammonium chloride.

99
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:17,300
Right. You know, Lysol sprays, things of that nature.

100
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:27,950
I feel so torn because on the east side, I want to say, yes, you use Mrs. Myers and all that kind of stuff, but being on the infectious disease side,

101
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:34,610
I'm going to use the thing with the most chemicals in it, honestly, because I'm trying to not decontaminate,

102
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:40,220
but disinfect, which is the elimination of virtually all pathogenic organisms.

103
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:47,210
So you're reducing contamination to an acceptable level. This still can be accomplished through a lot of chemical disinfectants.

104
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:56,899
So depending on the pathogen of interest, the EPA or the Environmental Protection Agency has these lists of accepted disinfectants.

105
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,500
So list end is actually appropriate for SARS-CoV-2.

106
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:06,739
So a Clorox wipe actually can fully, you know, disinfect a surface from SARS-CoV-2.

107
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:13,760
But like we talked about earlier, you know, last on Tuesday, when something like prions, for example,

108
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:24,200
where sterilization might not be enough, you need to get something more powerful like gaseous chlorine dioxide or vaporized hydrogen per.

109
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,120
And then I would say the most powerful is sterilization.

110
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,770
So this is the total destruction of pathogens on a surface or an inanimate object.

111
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,290
And this is usually done with heat or steam. How many of your recent autoclave before?

112
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,180
Oh, wow. A good chunk of the class. How many of you incinerated anything before?

113
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:49,970
No. Like for fun, I'd like for folks like that.

114
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,600
But there's bad energy and access there.

115
00:13:54,650 --> 00:14:03,670
So yeah, so these are the primary two methods and you know, typically autoclaves, you see them in, in dental offices, in laboratories.

116
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,749
Hypothetically,

117
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:12,909
you should see them in nail salons as well because they're reusing they're reusing instruments to perform medic manicures and pedicures.

118
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:19,060
They should be auto cleaning the material as they might have bloodborne pathogens and fungi and things like that.

119
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:26,230
So, yes, you want to be able to select the disinfectant appropriate for this scenario.

120
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,210
So, you know, you also want to know about the nature of the disinfecting as well.

121
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:37,749
How much does it cost? How easy is it to use? What's the shelf life recommended contact time?

122
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,440
And then do I need to wear any PPE while using it?

123
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,010
What should you never mix bleach with? Ammonia.

124
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,429
Yeah, yeah. Because that can cause a toxic gas that will make you pass out these wipes.

125
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:58,110
For example, I gave it to myself. No one's actually used them.

126
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:07,559
So the minute I break the seal on this, the shelf life, I'm now degrading the shelf life.

127
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,140
The shelf life is degrading exponentially just because now it's exposed to the environment.

128
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,630
So all disinfectants, hypothetically, have expiration dates and a lot of time.

129
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,210
So that's what they mean by shelf life. But also if you're having to make a dilution, for example,

130
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:31,290
one of the biggest issues during the West Africa Ebola outbreak in terms of the response in West Africa.

131
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,680
Bleach is perfectly good at killing Ebola virus at a 1 to 10 concentration,

132
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:46,020
but because they were making that 1 to 10 concentration in a bucket and keeping it outside and it's like super humid and hot,

133
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:55,590
that mixture was breaking down way faster. So by noon, if you made it at 8 a.m., it is still it is not the same concentration that you started with.

134
00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:02,940
And that's something to be aware of, even like here, where janitorial services will use solutions to clean the bathroom and stuff like that.

135
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,879
If a person is it being like super mindful,

136
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,750
like I always think about that when I see that at restaurants where they have like they're spray bottles and they wipe it down of the rag.

137
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:18,180
I'm just like, you know, and then do you need to wear any PPE when using it?

138
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,910
Like, for example, I use bar keepers friend just to like clean my stainless steel sink.

139
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,059
I probably don't need to wear gloves, but I do. Yes.

140
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,080
Huddah. What is this like shelf life of like centers on average?

141
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:39,750
Usually it so according to this, this expired in June 2021.

142
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:49,500
But but you know, because I just broke it the seal and it's still fresh hypothetically it's so it's there's

143
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:57,299
there are some like simulators that you can plug in information into to try to get an idea.

144
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,400
But obviously like when it's desiccated, like fully dry, like it's no good anymore.

145
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:09,420
But if you were to take something like, you know, they're selling those big gallon sized hand sanitizers at Costco,

146
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:16,320
if you put them on a windowsill or expose them to sunlight, they break down way faster.

147
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:23,370
So I would say it's up to you to decide when you want to throw a disinfectant out.

148
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:30,420
But I think you can tell by just your senses, by appearance and smell like when it is no longer effective.

149
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,739
So like for example,

150
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:40,500
I did as training at an emergency medical service station and they had one of the gallon sized hand sanitizers sitting in their kitchen.

151
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,170
It was a communal kitchen for firefighters, and there was mold growing at the bottom somehow.

152
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:51,150
And when I looked at it, it expired four years ago, but they were still using it.

153
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,870
And I was like, okay, so what are we doing here?

154
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:00,120
Right. So I mean, there unfortunately is no clear cut answer with solutions,

155
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:10,200
especially depending on a like temperature and conditions like you want to be making those solutions ideally every 4 hours if it is not indoors,

156
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:19,380
you know, like at least midday, but like for Lysol wipes, like, you know, this is probably good for maybe another month or so, I would guess.

157
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:29,840
Yeah. Yeah. So this one here is just an example of some pathogens we talked about.

158
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:39,459
So if you have an envelope virus, gram, positive bacteria, vegetative, fungi, usually you'll need something like a bleach peroxide.

159
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,740
What an ordinary ammonia alcohol.

160
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:51,520
Fungal spores are also susceptible to the same thing and moderately susceptible to alcohols and banal eggs, small non envelope viruses.

161
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,240
You can see that they are resistant to certain things as well.

162
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,589
And bacterial spores which usually exist, you know,

163
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:06,400
in the environment are moderately susceptible or resistant to certain things because they're just more hardy.

164
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:15,490
But that also assumes that you know how to classify the pathogen, which a lot of times people don't.

165
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:23,710
So that's why the EPA tries to make it easy by just directly naming like a specific, like stars or like the common cold.

166
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:36,990
Contact time as well. How many of you like when you use a cleaner actually, like read the fine print and then, you know, know.

167
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:46,270
Yeah. So this one here says to clean and deodorize wipe surface with wipe, let air dry, discard wipe and trash do not flush.

168
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,790
Okay, so this one says wipe hard non-porous surface with wipe is bent until visibly wet.

169
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,870
Allow surface to remain wet for 4 minutes.

170
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:05,290
Yeah. Yeah. So and it says for candida albicans, which is a yeast infection type,

171
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:13,810
allow it to remain wet for 8 minutes for Norwalk virus, norovirus and gilio and feline calicivirus.

172
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:18,820
Rotavirus treated surfaces must remain wet for 10 minutes.

173
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,709
Let air dry. So, like, this is like very specific, right?

174
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,670
And people, like, seldom follow the directions.

175
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:34,210
So that's why I when people are aiming for for decon, sometimes they'll just get, you know, disinfection.

176
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,440
Yes, that's it. Yeah.

177
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:44,139
When I worked at the hospital, we and I did it like I had to down the sleep after every time since we were supposed to be leaving,

178
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,660
the seats went for 10 minutes before wiping it off.

179
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:52,410
And nobody knew that the whole time I was working there until we were supposed to answer questions.

180
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:58,420
Really, I think my ocean was coming through or something, and then we were supposed to know that.

181
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,469
So the whole time I was working there for like five months, nobody was doing that.

182
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,629
They were just wiping it off like right away. Oh, yeah.

183
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:10,840
So you're basically just wasting wasting wipes or people which people sit on it when it's still wet.

184
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:16,250
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

185
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,590
That's very common in hospitals. You know how they sometimes have, like, bleach wipes?

186
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:29,530
I've seen nurses use it to wipe their face. I'm like, Oh, you're breaking your skin barrier is going to do a lot of slugging harder.

187
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,600
How do you keep away with the right? Because I feel like it it'll dry, right?

188
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:42,700
Yeah. So in that case, you would either have to like make sure you get a really nice moist weight at

189
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,839
the bottom or you have to just constantly be reapplying it for 10 minutes.

190
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:54,370
So just say you wipe it. And rather than it drying in 4 minutes, it takes 2 minutes, you'll just have to keep reapplying it.

191
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:59,440
So in those cases, it's more it makes more sense to use a wet solution,

192
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:05,320
but people don't do wet solutions depending on where you are because it's like a tripping or slip hazard.

193
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:15,760
You know, one thing that came up during in the biocontainment unit, so people were really worried about, uh,

194
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:23,590
patients being evacuated there and like they were like, oh my gosh, like, you're going to infect all of Omaha with Ebola, blah, blah, blah.

195
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:32,080
And so plumbers unions actually were calling and threatening to shut off water to this hospital system because they were like,

196
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:38,080
we don't want you discharging this patient's, you know, waste into the municipal water.

197
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:49,450
And so what they had to do some some places like Emory, they had so little fires to the liquid waste and then you just throw it out accordingly.

198
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:56,680
And at the biocontainment unit, what they actually did was they would use either quaternary ammonia or bleach and

199
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,749
pour it in with the liquid waste and let it sit for double the contact time,

200
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:09,040
which was 20 minutes, unfortunately, because in those patient rooms they didn't have toilet seat lids.

201
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,490
But when you flush, every time you flush, you create like this plume.

202
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:23,200
So they just like used in the cafeteria tray that was autoclave, they hope, before being returned to the cafeteria or never returned to the cafeteria.

203
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,859
But, you know, you know when you're picking a disinfectant.

204
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,700
So contact time, shelf life costs can vary like a lot.

205
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:40,060
Like another reason I don't buy natural products because they cost more, but also they're not working product safety and toxicity.

206
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,520
I mean, yeah, I feel like small children or pets, right?

207
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,980
That's something you want to consider residues and odors and then concentrate versus ready to use products.

208
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:54,940
Sometimes people actually like residues, believe it or not. So like bleach wipes depending on the surface, can sometimes leave residues.

209
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,350
But that's helpful because it lets you know where has already been wiped.

210
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,720
Okay. So yeah, you can play around.

211
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:12,490
Like I mentioned, the EPA registered disinfectants list a through oh so like lists and for example again the SARS-CoV-2.

212
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,980
So there's like thousands and thousands of different disinfectants that are out there that you can use.

213
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:23,559
And this is just like an infographic that the the EPA has.

214
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:33,850
I know some people who have also had issues besides bleach and ammonia accidentally mixing bleach and pine-sol, which can cause a noxious gas as well.

215
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:39,309
So it's generally never a good idea to mix chemicals.

216
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:43,120
I mean, clean talk a lot. Are you guys. I'm clean talk.

217
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:49,840
Sarah And you've seen some of these house cleaners where I see them, what, like clean toilet bowls and they'll put, like,

218
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:57,879
comet powder and then the, like, bowl cleaner and fill up the whole bowl with, like, all these different cleaners.

219
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,570
And it's like, all right, first of all, you're ruining your pipes.

220
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:05,290
But also, like, this is excessive. But, you know.

221
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:11,180
I cringed. Yeah. Yeah, I do like the ones where people restock babies.

222
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:20,960
That's very satisfying. Okay, so preventing the spread of infectious diseases now or moving on to individual and personal behaviors.

223
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:30,800
So personal hygiene, obviously, these are things we as public health people tried to implement, but clearly everybody does that right.

224
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,749
Social distancing or staying home when ill. This is common sense.

225
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:45,260
But, you know, because of the way the nature of work culture in America has been pre-pandemic, that wasn't always possible.

226
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,670
So I was doing this training for this casino in Indiana.

227
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:55,640
And, you know, a lot of employees don't get paid time off or paid sick leave.

228
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:00,229
So I was talking to them like I was talking to you about about the incubation period.

229
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:04,219
But for seasonal flu, I was like, well, you know, you're still shedding virus after.

230
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,670
So ideally you should try to stay home maybe at least 2 to 3 days after.

231
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:13,100
And they were like, we can't do that and will literally get fired and they will replace us with somebody else.

232
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:19,160
Right. So sometimes, unfortunately, a lot of things are at odds with what we're trying to accomplish.

233
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:28,250
Single use tissues rather than handkerchiefs. I still periodically see people use handkerchiefs and it grosses me out to no extent.

234
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:33,740
I'm all about, you know, you know, trying to reuse things in upcycle.

235
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:42,800
So I do have those like silicone sandwich bags and stuff, but like when it comes to tissues, that is where I draw the line.

236
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:53,990
Okay. Ideally not sharing personal objects, washing up bandages and COVID safe sex practices, hand-washing, sneezing into your arm or your elbow.

237
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,480
They call it the vampire cough or sneeze.

238
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:03,940
The amount of people I just see openly sneezing into like the air or their hands still like after two and a half years in the podium,

239
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,830
it's still a lot of people. It's wild.

240
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:17,250
Avoiding the transmission zone, sanitizing regularly, not picking at wounds and blemishes, a clean environment, vaccination, and the list goes on.

241
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:26,270
So, you know, with hand-washing here, it's amazing to me how we still don't do it.

242
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:31,020
Right. So ideally, you know, you would lather your hands with soap.

243
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,840
Minimum of 20 seconds. That's the happy birthday song.

244
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:41,720
Twice they tell you rinse well under running water and then dry your hands with a clean paper towel.

245
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,850
What drives me crazy? On the sixth floor, DHS, again, environmentally friendly.

246
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:51,470
They decided to put in those low aerator faucets in all bathrooms.

247
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,060
It's really hard to get a good wash on your hands.

248
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,740
Does it matter if you use antibacterial soap or soap?

249
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:09,420
Regulation. No, it doesn't matter, actually. So soap itself is a surfactant.

250
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:16,470
So what we are primarily caring about is that because of the way that soap is made,

251
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:22,530
it helps loosen any particles on your hand and the mechanical action of hand

252
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:27,660
washing it and then physically washing it down the sink is what is beneficial.

253
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,070
We always prefer washing over, hand sanitizing.

254
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:36,810
But for some people and then clean single use paper towels.

255
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,230
I hate those Dyson airborne things.

256
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:50,460
I hate hand dryers because oftentimes the way those things are engineered, the air intake is the same as the exhaust and it's not filtered, obviously.

257
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:56,010
So think about like 90, 95% of the population isn't washing your hands correctly.

258
00:28:56,310 --> 00:29:02,760
It's soaking in like germy water and then just shooting it out in a larger radius.

259
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,930
Again, you know, eco friendly is. But at what cost?

260
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:15,480
I haven't seen it a lot, but like, if you like, sometimes go to like a random gas station in the Midwest because you need to use the bathroom,

261
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:24,540
they sometimes still have the like microfiber paper towel roll that just like recently circulates.

262
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:31,260
Oh, I just like at that point, like, you know, I'll wipe it on my pants and I'll hand sanitizer in my car.

263
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:37,050
What people. So hand sanitizer is great if you don't have the first option, right?

264
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:42,570
For professions like construction, maybe where they don't have access to clean running water.

265
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:52,140
But what's become a problem lately is people use hand sanitizer as a substitute entirely for hand-washing, like we discussed.

266
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,879
Hand sanitizer expires.

267
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:02,700
You want to make sure it's at least 60% alcohol in order for it to be effective early in the pandemic, when there was like a shortage of everything.

268
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:12,360
I saw tons of videos of people trying to make their own hand sanitizer with like a dilution of aloe vera gel and and isopropyl alcohol.

269
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:18,030
But they didn't understand basic math, so they were really making like 30, 40% solutions.

270
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:25,199
You know, I was in Bloomington when it started, so distilleries got in the game where they're like, We can't make vodka right now, so I'll make hands.

271
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,060
It says, Great, you guys clearly have the ABV for that, right?

272
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:37,229
But sometimes, like, I've seen, like when people hand sanitizer, they just slowly if you just I'm done.

273
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:40,320
But ideally it should be 20 seconds as well.

274
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:48,720
And you're getting into that, you know, between your fingers and then the indentations of your palms and the tops of your hands, which we don't see.

275
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:53,069
Like lots of bad habits have formed in the last two and a half years, and sometimes,

276
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:57,480
depending on the environment you're in, alcohol can actually make things worse.

277
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:08,880
So how many of you are familiar with C diff? Clostridium difficile often found in nursing homes and health care facilities caused by the diarrhea,

278
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:13,380
you know, again, sometimes found in fraternity and sorority houses as well.

279
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:20,670
But it's spore forming and it actually performs more spores with alcohol.

280
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:25,349
So if you're in a facility where there's like a bunch of set of patients and and

281
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:30,569
the providers are performing like hand hygiene exclusively with hand sanitizer,

282
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:35,090
you're just proliferating the spores. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.

283
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:41,820
I was specifically talking to somebody about the difference of hand drain with like electric dryer and paper towels.

284
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:47,430
And they made a note of if you don't fully dry your hands, then you have like a layer of water on it.

285
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:53,129
So then are you more prone to like bacteria coming out of your hands because you have this layer?

286
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:57,660
But yes. Like if you don't completely dry. Yes. So this is this is like.

287
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:03,540
Oh, I see. Oh, go ahead, Amazon. Well, this is a more of an industrial hygiene question.

288
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:10,470
What kind of skin is most prone to susceptible to infection?

289
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:16,770
The broken like if you have a wound. Yeah, yeah. What kind of skin is least susceptible?

290
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:23,360
Thick membranes. Like thick. Oh, yeah, I like it.

291
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,810
Dirty skin. Dirty, dirty skin, actually.

292
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:30,680
So if you're like, you know, Charlie Brown and, you know, Pigpen, the character Pigpen.

293
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:35,750
So what? Wet hands are more porous, right?

294
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:39,470
Because they're moist and right. So they are more susceptible.

295
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,870
If it's oily, it makes it it creates more of a barrier.

296
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,200
Like if you use a skin cream or or an oil, it creates more of a barrier.

297
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,529
But when your hands are wet and they're moisturize your your pores and all that are more open.

298
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,860
So. Was the person pro hand dryer?

299
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:02,750
Well, it's interesting because we I think there'll be some of us, maybe none of us would discuss.

300
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:12,080
There's a class by Julia Oliver HLS who talks about the environmental cost of hand dry with paper towel versus an electric dryer.

301
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:17,840
And in the class, you learn after like a hundred times of use the electric dryer than so,

302
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,680
even though it's using electricity, it's already for cost products.

303
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:29,330
So in terms of cost, so like the whole past year I've been telling people that, oh, you should do it with a military contractor.

304
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:36,740
And then I've gotten some resistance from people and I'll post it on canvas later because I periodically save tick tock.

305
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:41,390
There's one one where they, they just have a petri dish that they hold.

306
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:47,360
Yeah, it's pretty gross. I still eat hot dogs, so I don't care, much less.

307
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:54,319
Yes. They're I just want to hear your professional this because I feel like it's been a pandemic thing that

308
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:01,400
people wearing gloves and then doing tasks and then hand sanitizing the gloves and then doing another task.

309
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,150
It grosses me out. I just want to know. That's bad practice.

310
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:12,410
That's a hard no, I think because, you know, we often see this because people are wearing single use disposable gloves.

311
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:17,630
They often think that they're now impervious or like invincible in some way.

312
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:27,170
So you'll see, like police officers wear gloves at a crime scene and then like still wearing it, like pull out their phone and like make a call.

313
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:30,770
Right. So these are things we tried to get out of the practice of.

314
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:39,500
Oftentimes, depending on the situation, they'll just recommend hand high, frequent hand hygiene over gloves and just dry your hands out more.

315
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:45,050
But people don't change them out frequently. So the gloves are carrying different pathogens.

316
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:50,300
And then when you sanitize them, you're breaking down the glove material.

317
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:59,510
And essentially, like there's a lot of studies showing like micro permeation over time for gloves, like it's not a visible tear,

318
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:06,680
but the material, the nitrile where the rubber or whatever you might be using is slowly degrading.

319
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,940
So you're still getting that material in there. So that's a bad habit.

320
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:17,330
So if you see someone I know, I'm always like, I cringe every time I see it and I just want to be like, put a new pair on.

321
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:21,049
Yeah, yeah. Your employer, hypothetically, should be paying for it.

322
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:24,080
So what does it matter to you? Just change them out.

323
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:30,559
Right? Yeah. So vaccines and we'll talk about this a lot more.

324
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,129
I mean, obviously, vaccine preventable diseases have not gone away.

325
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:39,290
If anything, they're coming back with a vengeance now, you know, safe.

326
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:45,740
Many myths about vaccines have been perpetuated. Obviously, young and healthy people can get sick.

327
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:52,160
Not just not they don't cause the disease they're designated to prevent,

328
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,600
which is still a big hurdle that we have communicating this to the general public.

329
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:04,160
And vaccine preventable diseases are expensive. So, for example, vaccine preventable diseases are expensive.

330
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,450
If you step on a rusty needle or something, right. You might be susceptible to tetanus.

331
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:16,640
So you go get a tetanus shot. There was a couple of years ago a story of a mother who was anti-vax and her son.

332
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:26,570
She declined the tetanus vaccine for her son. As a result, he got an infection and had to be hospitalized for several weeks.

333
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:33,140
Guess how much the hospitalization there through some numbers out 80,000.

334
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:37,069
50,000. Okay, prices. Right. Let's see. You know what?

335
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:49,250
Imagine to go high. How many weeks? A few weeks. Yeah. Probably like 300,000, 300, 300,000, 50,000, 115.

336
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:58,650
I feel like I'm 58. Well, 800,000. Only because my daughter's, like, when I was, like, week.

337
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:05,020
Maybe like a day or two. Yeah. No, my daughter spent two months in the nephew, and it was almost $1,000,000.

338
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:09,919
Yeah. This person didn't have insurance. $800,000, right?

339
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:19,190
Versus just getting the tetanus shot. You know how many of you know the origin of vaccines cause autism?

340
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:29,880
Okay. Mira, do you want to share? Yeah. So basically, I know there is one guy and he owns a kind of pharmaceutical company that, like,

341
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,510
you know, gave out vaccines and he wanted people to take his vaccines and no one else's.

342
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,640
So you heard a rumor about, like, another specific company, all of their vaccines cause autism,

343
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,900
but then it backfired and everyone assumed that all vaccines cause autism.

344
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,889
And so just that spread of misinformation led people to believe, you know.

345
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:52,620
Right, okay, I'm here is help.

346
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:58,930
Sale What about you? What's yours? And I was like part of that lens, that article.

347
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:07,900
Um, so it was those the Lancet article with, I think, a British group and I forget the the pie or the leader.

348
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:19,450
Andrew Wakefield. Yes, that's right. So it was essentially from that article where they had like a faulty association between vaccines and autism.

349
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:28,929
I think they had a really small sample size and they like cherry picked the things they like cherry picked data to kind of create this association.

350
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:33,159
But then when they actually looked into it, so the article was approved.

351
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:41,440
But then when Lancet and other scientific journals like really looked into it, then they found out all the the faulty associations they made.

352
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:48,960
So then after a while, they redacted the article, but at that point, like it had already caught on in the media, popular media.

353
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,840
So then the damage was done. Yeah. Yeah. Hoodia Um,

354
00:38:53,380 --> 00:39:04,870
also I believe that the PI they've like given funding to do it by people who were like anti like he already had a biased perspective going into it.

355
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:12,370
So he was trying to prove this particular perspective. He was like being paid to do this work for money.

356
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,420
And even after that he was like he lost his medical. Yeah.

357
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,660
Talk about a conflict of interest. Yeah. So pervasive it doesn't.

358
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:28,380
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I remember from the study was that all the people selected already had autism.

359
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:34,560
Yeah, yeah. Talk about bad science, but that happens all the time.

360
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:38,280
That problem happens here, honestly.

361
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:43,410
And so. But because people have it in academia, people are crazy.

362
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,280
Yeah, but I mean, it's like how much how much are perish?

363
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:54,960
You know, like the pressures to publish The Lancet is one of the foremost medical journals in the world, not just in the United States.

364
00:39:55,410 --> 00:40:00,450
And nowadays, with the, like, slow death of print media.

365
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:04,210
But even news like the contraction of budgets, a lot of.

366
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:11,190
Back in the day used to have a designated science reporter who had specifically handled working

367
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:15,630
with researchers and his the medical field to report these stories to the general public.

368
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,320
A lot of newsrooms don't even have that anymore.

369
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:26,040
So it's just like a and like a just whoever journalist is available and they and now is the clickbait, right?

370
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:33,480
They try to just take what headline is most appealing or they might not fully understand the science and extrapolate what they want from it.

371
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:38,069
Obviously, this study in The Lancet was characterized in this way,

372
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:43,889
but the media had already like caught on like wildfire and the damage was done and has been done.

373
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:48,990
And then that's when you had like Facebook kind of starting out social media.

374
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,759
Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg really got on to this, remember?

375
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,190
And she was like, my son got autism from the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine.

376
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,549
And then a few later, few years later, she was like, Eh, just kidding.

377
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:07,410
He doesn't have autism anymore because they put him on a keto diet, which is not how that works either.

378
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:13,950
But again, like these myths are perpetuated and it's really harmful because now we see

379
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:20,459
for various reasons there was a huge measles outbreak still like in Europe,

380
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:29,610
even 2017, 2018, 2000, 19, polio is back, baby, you're talking about we just all want to be paralyzed.

381
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:33,420
Apparently, like these are very vaccine preventable diseases.

382
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:40,439
And most vaccines are either way in the weaker or dead form of the, you know, germ introduced.

383
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,620
So essentially it's like training day for your body.

384
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,290
Like, you know, if you think about like I kid,

385
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:50,370
I don't know football because I guess there's a game the Saturdays I'm not coming around this area but like,

386
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:58,290
you know, like you train for the game and then when it comes time, hypothetically, you know what to do and you win, right?

387
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:06,030
So that's essentially what the vaccine is doing for your body. I mean, there's so many readily available vaccines like me, for example,

388
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:12,360
I was at the age where I got the varicella vaccine, like right when it came out and I had two doses of it.

389
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:19,170
I've never had chickenpox in my life, whereas my sister, who is what they consider Elder Millennial,

390
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:26,640
she had to actually gain natural immunity from getting chicken pox because they didn't have the vaccine yet.

391
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,549
Have A and B, tetanus, HPV, meningitis and shingles flu.

392
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:41,340
And then when you go abroad here, if you go abroad for school, they have an international vaccine clinic where you can get cholera,

393
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:44,760
yellow fever, typhoid, dengue, depending on where you're going.

394
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,590
So we'll get into this more in a second.

395
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:52,020
So face coverings, this is another effective way,

396
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:58,409
essentially just a simple barrier to create the response of your droplets from going out into the environment.

397
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:04,319
But this is not a substitute for social distancing, you know, ideally single use.

398
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,310
And should it be worn for more than a day in a row if they're not laundered?

399
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:15,810
But this is something that we have now definitely seen as more of a common cultural norm in other countries than in the United States.

400
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:22,950
So prior to the COVID 19 pandemic, even you notice, and Asia and particularly East and Southeast Asia,

401
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:30,509
it's very normal for when people are sick and they have to go to public to wear a mask and like being on campus.

402
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:37,260
Right. We have a lot of international students. So I always noticed, like the international students from Asia would wear a mask.

403
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:43,410
But for some reason here in the United States, there is a huge stigma around mask wearing,

404
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:49,590
whereas in other countries like Japan, for example, they see it as a community protective behavior.

405
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:59,790
In the US they see it as a personal choice. So, you know, that's caused obviously a ton of a ton of a ton of issues.

406
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,040
Countries that were lower resource like way lower resource like Vietnam, for example,

407
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:15,060
everybody followed quarantine and didn't masking so the number of COVID deaths that they have substantially lower than in the United States.

408
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:22,159
We'll get into this in a minute. In each level, this is something called the hierarchy of controls.

409
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:28,819
We frequently use this in industrial hygiene and occupational health as a way to think

410
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:33,440
about what controls do we want to implement to protect the worker from the hazard.

411
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:39,470
But it can also be implemented in scenarios outside of work, and we'll get into each of these levels in a second.

412
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:46,850
But I want to hone in on these too, specifically personal protective equipment and community protective equipment.

413
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:53,540
So PPE, we usually, you know, a lot of times will implement some controls simultaneously.

414
00:44:53,870 --> 00:45:02,900
We usually don't like to do PPE unless we have to, because the reason is it has the greatest reliance on the person to put on and take off properly.

415
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:10,820
So if I'm wearing like a full hazmat suit or even if I'm wearing a mask, for example, I'm very conscious that it's only body.

416
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:15,380
Whereas if the air system, which is an engineering control, is working properly,

417
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:22,790
I'm not actively having to think about how it's working or how many air exchanges it's making PPE, though.

418
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:27,739
So most of us are wearing surgical masks in our procedure masks.

419
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:32,810
But, you know, like not to draw attention to you, Huyton and Ian, you're wearing k a 90 fives, it looks like.

420
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:38,030
So your actual whole face piece is a filter. So in those situations,

421
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:43,790
those are considered respirators because you're actively drawing in the air and the material

422
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:49,280
of the mask is filtering the air before it enters your nose or mouth and you breathe it in.

423
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:53,420
So PPE protects you from the environment.

424
00:45:53,750 --> 00:46:00,380
Now, when we get into surgical masks and cloth masks, we're not protecting the environment from us.

425
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:06,790
Right? Because essentially the surgical masks and cloth mask is stopping the arresting of particles.

426
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:13,850
So we're trying to stop us from further contaminating the environment, but it's only as effective as the community uses it.

427
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:20,000
Yeah. So here we can just see, like, this infographic.

428
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,860
So this person is considered the index case where they have COVID.

429
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:32,960
Right. And as we talked about, COVID is considered a reciprocal fraction of less than five microns.

430
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:41,540
So just say this person coughs or sneezes. The cloud of responsible aerosols kind of stays within their area.

431
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:47,719
They are wearing a mask. The exposed contact is hypothetically, you know, ten feet away.

432
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:54,620
And they're also wearing a mask. If this person wasn't wearing a mask, these red dots would be shooting all over the page.

433
00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:01,940
So for donning the mask, I mean, so many of these bad behaviors have formed like throughout the pandemic.

434
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:08,450
So obviously not wearing it as a chinstrap below your nose, above your chin as headband,

435
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:12,019
dangling it from your ear, you'll notice I don't have a napkin.

436
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,740
But like when I'm not wearing mine, I leave it out.

437
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:23,810
And with the inside facing out so that it's drying and dissipating when I'm not wearing it, I don't have a napkin.

438
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:28,250
So I'm just, you know, my bag is probably cleaner than this table here, but,

439
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:32,270
you know, like people shove them into your pocket, their pockets or whatever,

440
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:42,110
and that's just trapping the moisture in the mask and then you're contaminating the outside with what's on the inside and vice versa.

441
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:44,899
This is like a whole headache.

442
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:51,950
So I'm like, Holy [INAUDIBLE], we have to undo so much bad stuff and I don't even know if I'm going to see it happen in my lifetime.

443
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:01,520
So, you know, what we've seen over the pandemic that they've tried to implement?

444
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:06,260
It's the Swiss cheese viral defense model.

445
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:11,450
Like a slice of Swiss cheese. Like no measure. No single measure is perfect.

446
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:15,319
Right? So, like, staying home only does so much. That's only does so much.

447
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:21,650
Like avoiding touching your face only does so much. But if we stack the cheese, eventually there are fewer holes.

448
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:28,790
I think at this point people basically think that the pandemic is over, unfortunately for the most part.

449
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:36,260
But Dr. Fauci, who is retiring soon,

450
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:46,280
recently released a statement where he said that we better buckle up for a pretty intense flu season just because,

451
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:51,410
you know, a lot of people have long COVID now. Their immune systems are down and so on.

452
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:56,380
Mask wearing has fallen off. More people are in public spaces again.

453
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:03,200
So all of these personal behaviors that we have, those certainly affect the community.

454
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:11,419
Hand hygiene, cough or sneeze etiquette. I've definitely seen people travel when they are violently ill.

455
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:15,920
I mean, sometimes you don't have a choice because you're stuck somewhere. Right. But these are all personal.

456
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:19,380
Behaviors that affect the collective.

457
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:24,090
So herd immunity or now they're trying to transition the terms of population

458
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:29,710
immunity is when a large portion of the community is immunized or vaccinated.

459
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:37,229
So here you can see when there's no herd immunity, you know, you have the number of susceptible people and infected people.

460
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:48,240
But when you have population immunity, either through vaccination or natural acquired immunity, the opportunity for infection decreases.

461
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:55,979
You know, when originally they were trying to argue like you get vaccinated to protect those who can't get vaccinated for various reasons.

462
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:00,560
So like the flu vaccine, for example, is incubated in eggs.

463
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:06,210
So people who are allergic to eggs can't get the flu vaccine or if you've had an adverse reaction.

464
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:11,520
One of my friend's dads got the iron bar from the flu vaccine.

465
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,280
So now I obviously cannot get the flu vaccine.

466
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:19,769
He's, you know, since recovered from those symptoms, but certain people can't get them for those reasons.

467
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:23,489
So that's why we try to do it, to create the population immunity.

468
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:34,350
But now people, you know, don't necessarily have that altruistic nature anymore, especially since the pandemic, which is unfortunate.

469
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:40,530
There's also organizational and local laws to try to prevent the spread of

470
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:43,860
disease with screening and surveillance through the local health department.

471
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:52,950
And local laws and community laws can sometimes supersede federal or state level laws when it comes to public health measures.

472
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,520
So specifically, like if we think here in Washtenaw County,

473
00:50:56,790 --> 00:51:05,130
a lot of times Washtenaw County has been more conservative in the sense of what the public health measures are than the rest of the state of Michigan.

474
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:14,310
So if you go here in Washtenaw County for a while, indoor masking was required in like a lot of spaces where if you went to like Livingston County,

475
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:19,140
for example, like you could hardly find anybody wearing a mask.

476
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:27,600
So in those cases, often the local or community laws take precedence over what state or federal requirements might be.

477
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:39,000
Ideally, we have standard operating procedures or policies to kind of address infectious disease response.

478
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:45,040
But I kind of feel like we did for a while and now people are back to flying by the seat of their pants.

479
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:48,420
Is that also the feeling people have?

480
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:49,550
Yeah.

481
00:51:49,620 --> 00:52:00,270
So determine what is required for the organization or workplace to sustain functionality as reading this article in the Chronicle of Higher Education.

482
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:08,220
That was our our our pandemic measures hurting universities.

483
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:21,290
So kind of like here in the U.S. that the economic argument essentially about keeping things open and making things as normal as possible,

484
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:28,170
partially the argument was to give college students like as normal of experience as they can.

485
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:36,569
Right. But a lot of places are withdrawing measures for various reasons, either like pressure from state entities,

486
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:43,530
if they're a public institution that receives a lot of state funding, donor pressure, things like that,

487
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:51,780
and having training and education, obviously, but adherence did proper infection control procedures and then having workplace

488
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:56,880
culture and policies that are congruent to curbing the spread of disease.

489
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:02,970
Some places are better than others and I'm surprised at when he came in this morning.

490
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:07,050
Was there a bouncer at the front? I know. No, he's not here.

491
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,830
He was here all summer and now he's not here.

492
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:18,990
It's really interesting to me. So it's like, you know, we're one of the few schools left on campus that still has one head.

493
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:23,390
I don't know if there's a difference between. That seems to be true.

494
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:26,970
Okay. Always wanted as page one. Okay.

495
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:32,070
Like sometimes like you have to my I guess it's different over here.

496
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:36,870
Well, the bouncer and us one also serves as like the welcome desk person.

497
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:44,729
Like, if you need to know where a room is or like to greet visitors, so now they kind of serve that dual function.

498
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:50,700
Whereas like obviously this person just has like some desk, random desk that they pulled there and put like a plexiglass barrier.

499
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:57,540
But I was surprised because I was like, Why do we do this all summer when there's like literally just faculty here and like a few grad students?

500
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:03,270
So I found that to be interesting. But you absolutely don't find that in other schools or units, right?

501
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:10,620
So even when we're talking about workplace culture and policy, this can even differ within the same space.

502
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:15,570
Oh, this is a tough one. Staying up to date with the news.

503
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,990
How to ensure that it's a credible, unbiased news source.

504
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:36,500
How to. This is where they're talking really loud.

505
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:43,560
They think, Yeah. Okay, so I still have 25 minutes.

506
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:52,830
Okay. So how, how how many of you have seen something and have been unsure if it was real or not?

507
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:56,490
Right. Any specific examples?

508
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,030
Okay. Like what specifically? Um. I don't know how, like, with it.

509
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:07,680
I don't know if I believe everything, but there are some channel or account that are like, just like news sources.

510
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:13,290
But I don't know if that's credentials or if there's like repeating other things I see from like other news sources.

511
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:16,370
But, um, it's a way to be like introduced to a story.

512
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,770
But I guess you still have to do your own research and like actually figure out where.

513
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,980
Yeah. Yeah. I try to go for the sources that are like verified like on twitter.

514
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:32,940
They have the checkmark or they have that. I'm tik out now. Hoda i just had a class last semester and we had students do what we called like a data

515
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:37,739
detective assignment and it was like what we did to show an example and it was there was a

516
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:43,049
TikTok that was like had a graph which was like a scientific graph from the paper that showed

517
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:47,280
like a correlation between I forget the name of like the really famous candle company,

518
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,379
but like how there was like a spike in Yankee Candle, a spike in COVID cases,

519
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:56,580
and then like people were calling in to be like, we can't smell like the candles.

520
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:05,879
Yeah, yeah. And just like the way that it's like the they're taking the facts, but they're like interpreting it incorrectly.

521
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,800
So we had a lot of students like go to like the original source that like the Tik

522
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,370
Tok was getting it from our news sources and things like that to be able to be like,

523
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:20,340
are they actually reporting it correctly because they may not be trained to read the scientific data?

524
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,900
Yeah, most people are very tricky, very tricky.

525
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:29,729
And most people these days get their news from other people on like Facebook or again,

526
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:34,620
because of the way that media is heading and everything is like behind a paywall,

527
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:41,340
people just extrapolate what they can from the headline or from like a single 140 character tweet.

528
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:48,639
And then, you know, it's kind of like the game of telephone where like you see something and then you tell someone and they tell someone.

529
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,410
And then before, you know, it's like totally out of control.

530
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:57,510
And there's so many different things going on sometimes that really can be hard to keep track.

531
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:02,489
Like for me, because it's part of my job, I have a Google News alert set up with certain key words,

532
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:07,290
but like, you know, 2016, there is Zika virus, there's food recalls all the time.

533
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:15,479
Recently there was like a food recall for Oatly, which I don't use that brand and like specific protein shakes that might be contaminated,

534
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:19,770
but like all the time that it's like listeria outbreaks, e coli,

535
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:27,990
I don't eat romaine lettuce if I have the choice because it's always infected, like go with a butter lettuce.

536
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:37,469
Okay. So this is really difficult, though, because I'm sure there's somebody in your life or in your family who watches certain news sources.

537
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:47,549
I'll just say like Fox News. Okay. Or like read something like The Federalist where they do have a very specific agenda or angle, right.

538
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:55,860
So it's very hard to find a neutral news source, even though I do have a certain lemming like sometimes it's difficult for me to even watch

539
00:57:55,860 --> 00:58:05,060
things like MSNBC just because it's so I don't know what's the word I'm looking for a partizan,

540
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:10,380
partizan or like b like really jazzed up.

541
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,860
Okay. And yet Lord the Lord leader. So.

542
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:22,319
Immigrant, refugee and migrant help. So this is also another hot topic that will delve into and consider more.

543
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:29,670
Right? So we obviously want to try to promote and improve the health of immigrants and refugees and migrants who cross the border.

544
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:33,870
This is also become heavily politicized now. And interestingly,

545
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:44,160
if you look at the there was a recent article that was in the NPR about American perceptions of like immigrants invading the border.

546
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:48,540
And the majority of people do think that.

547
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:52,290
Which is surprising to me, right?

548
00:58:53,430 --> 00:59:01,440
I mean, the ideal situation is that, you know, like Statue of Liberty, like, give me your tired, broken, you know, hello.

549
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:08,760
So when I lived in Omaha, my, my, my master's thesis capstone, actually,

550
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:17,219
I was placed at a primary care clinic that Omaha actually has a huge intake of refugees here

551
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:23,840
in the United States because it is a large site for Catholic health charities and Lutherans.

552
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:27,360
So they sponsor a lot of immigrants and refugees coming.

553
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:33,270
So this primary care clinic that I worked at was specifically the clinic where a lot of the.

554
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:41,080
How refugees went for their initial health screenings and then got their vaccinations and such as it should be.

555
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:45,310
And they have like a scheduled three exams that they have to get, right.

556
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:51,820
Because you had refugees, they're coming, you know, from all parts of East Africa, West Africa,

557
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:59,920
parts of South East Asia, and it's all part of global disease surveillance and primary health care prevention.

558
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,309
And we'll talk more about leveraging community health workers.

559
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:11,170
But now with this rhetoric around immigrants and refugees and migrants, they're not getting the health care they're needed.

560
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:18,340
They're being put in like, you know, detention centers, essentially, that have just become cesspools of infection,

561
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:24,820
which is really disheartening for our occupational health protections.

562
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:29,770
This here comes from Nihad, which is the institute where Dr. Fauci is from.

563
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,130
They haven't updated it since 2017.

564
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:38,709
And this is not to say that the United States is more prone to infectious diseases than other countries.

565
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:43,960
It's just a US based institution. So obviously this is what we're going to focus on here.

566
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:53,250
But the red dots are the newly emerging and the blue are like resurging or reemerging, and then the black is deliberately emerging or bioterrorism.

567
01:00:53,260 --> 01:01:00,610
The only one we have there is anthrax. But thinking about like the global fluidity, I could, you know, of the world these days.

568
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:05,800
I could be on a plane and be in Australia in less than 24 hours from now.

569
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:14,139
And if you remember, back in 2006, team, they had the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro simultaneously.

570
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:21,430
There was a huge Zika virus outbreak going on and Zika virus causes microcephaly in fetuses.

571
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,300
So in that year in the U.S.,

572
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:34,300
there were about 500 women who were pregnant and got Zika virus and one in ten of those babies was born with microcephaly.

573
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:43,360
And so it was really I mean, obviously, the World Health Organization can't do anything about the Olympics Commission

574
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,870
or whatever because they're like in Switzerland kind of doing their own thing,

575
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:52,990
obviously. But then we knew at the time that it was also a sexually transmitted infection.

576
01:01:53,380 --> 01:02:02,080
So you had people coming from all over the world to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and potentially exposing themselves to Zika virus

577
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:08,980
when they might have not otherwise been like in in climates where they don't necessarily have mosquitoes at that time of the year.

578
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:13,120
Like think someone coming from Sweden or Mongolia, for example.

579
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:20,770
So because of how small our world is getting, that means that the rate of infectious disease outbreaks only goes up.

580
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:34,479
You know, I'm going to skip over some of these parts with my spiel on like OSHA and all that because that's not like super of interest to you.

581
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,030
And I'm kind of be I'm behind.

582
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:43,780
But, you know, in terms of biological exposures, we usually have these things called occupational exposure limits for workers.

583
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:49,930
So for things like ammonia. Okay. No more than a thousand parts per million in an eight hour workday.

584
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:53,320
Retiree No more than 200 parts per million in an eight hour workday.

585
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:58,900
Same thing for asbestos, for biological exposures, anything related to pathogens.

586
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:04,000
We consider this the most insidious occupational hazard because you can't see it,

587
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:10,240
you can't smell it, and you can't measure it immediately or quantify it in any way.

588
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:17,680
So I could take like a direct reading instrument right now and immediately get a readout of how much carbon dioxide is in this room,

589
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:26,710
which is helpful for air quality. I can't just take a direct reading instrument and quantify how much SARS-CoV-2 is floating around in this room.

590
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:31,720
Like, there is absolutely no way to do that. So that's why it's considered the most insidious hazard.

591
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:36,970
And they try to put an emergency standard out for COVID protections.

592
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:38,170
But really,

593
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:51,130
because a lot of the OSHA regulations and clauses have not been updated since the 1970s because of continuous funding cuts and stuff like that,

594
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:59,200
really, you can only function off of, you know, personal protective equipment standards, blood borne pathogens standards.

595
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:13,059
Okay. So going back to the hierarchy of controls here that we saw earlier, you know, the top one we tried to aim for is elimination.

596
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:14,920
And this is the most effective, right?

597
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:24,010
We want if we can fully remove a hazard, we'll do it so a person can do something on the ground instead of like on scaffolding, for example,

598
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:30,399
we're moving the fire hazard by having them do the task on the ground for an infectious disease example,

599
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,640
the isolating or quarantine is an example of elimination.

600
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,479
If I don't need to go to the grocery store inside, I can do a pickup.

601
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:46,330
I can do a delivery grate because that's preventing me, an exposed person to potentially exposed non exposed persons.

602
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:55,450
Substitution is the second most effective control and this is when we replace it with something that does not produce as hazardous as an effect.

603
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:02,420
So like using like instead of using lead based paint, we use titanium white paints or acrylic paints.

604
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:11,169
Now for infectious diseases, you know, substituting a harsh disinfectant with one that's less toxic but equally as effective.

605
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:19,570
Right. So we're not swapping out like bleach for, you know, Mrs. Meyers, again, I'm sorry, this what I can think of right now.

606
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:28,420
Engineering controls. This is the third most effective. It doesn't eliminate the hazard in any way, but takes people away from it.

607
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:34,990
This tends to be more expensive as a solution, though, in terms of like upfront costs.

608
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:37,959
So like a good age HVAC system, for example,

609
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:45,710
if you're thinking about like in nail salon because I also do nail salon work is, you know, easily $20,000 to retrofit.

610
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:49,210
Right. But in the long run, it will save you money.

611
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:53,860
But these savings are like intangible sometimes to the employers,

612
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:59,170
like worker health or like disability life years adjusted these kinds of things so they don't do it,

613
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:06,370
you know, like installing a guard on a machine to prevent my hand crushing or like your hand from being chopped off.

614
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:10,870
Right? Installing plexiglass shields, HEPA filtration.

615
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:16,089
These are all engineering controls for infectious diseases, for admin controls.

616
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:19,180
These are less well controlled but more cost effective.

617
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:21,040
So people usually like to do this, right.

618
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:31,719
So like warning labels, staggering work shifts, having some people remote work training is even considered in administrative control.

619
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:41,290
So ship rotation for infectious diseases and then PPE, as we mentioned, is the least effective but sometimes necessary, right?

620
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:48,009
Because there's really no way we can stop, you know, like a hard hat prevents your head from being crushed potentially.

621
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:51,110
Sometimes you actually really need it. So.

622
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,780
Ooh. That was was supposed to finish on Tuesday. Obviously it's not.

623
01:06:54,820 --> 01:07:00,820
So let's go into the next part. So environmental factors.

624
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:08,590
Oh, sorry. Any questions from all that stuff? Okay. Environmental factors facilitating infectious disease transmission.

625
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:16,329
Sorry. So I know I said you can read the readings as suggested, but one of the really good ones,

626
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:22,120
I think, is the Eisenberg one is that Marisa Eisenberg Joe Eisenberg from the EPI.

627
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:27,780
But it's not. It's just very car less lasting. But they seem to be very into AP and it's a great paper.

628
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:37,980
So what they talk about in there is the epidemiological triad, which is the Asian or for us, the pathogen, the susceptible host and the environment.

629
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:46,710
And these be three things together in confluence create the epidemiological triad of disease.

630
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:52,610
So climate and weather, for example, if we think and look at it,

631
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:58,950
climate change leading to normal changes or abnormal changes in weather patterns for areas.

632
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:08,700
So if you think of something like drought, for example, warmer temperatures help proliferate things like mosquitoes.

633
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:17,520
So globally, you know, the world has heated up by like two degrees, which some people think is really nominal.

634
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,660
But it's really I mean, I'm preaching to the choir here, but just catastrophic.

635
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:25,440
So if we look again, back to the example of Zika virus.

636
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:29,730
I'm originally from the Val Valley of California is very hot.

637
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:38,250
So growing up, you typically think of mosquitoes mostly being in like really hot regions or in the south, in the southwest.

638
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:42,380
So when I was in high school, West Nile virus was a huge issue.

639
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:45,390
There were birds just dropping left and right.

640
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:49,710
So the vector control department would do aerial spraying.

641
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:53,210
So they would say like, you know, broadcast that on the news or whatever.

642
01:08:53,220 --> 01:09:00,330
Like Wednesday night at 6 p.m., a chopper is going to come by and just like dump a bunch of insecticide.

643
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:07,350
So like dopey outside, ideally with Zika and West Nile, we usually would.

644
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:14,190
Yeah. You'd expect to see it in Texas, right? You expect to see it in Southern California, Arizona, Louisiana.

645
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:22,030
They started getting Zika virus carrying mosquitoes all the way in Alaska during 2016.

646
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:32,190
Ocean warming, so can lead to an increase in toxic, toxic algal blooms and consequences like red tide.

647
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:35,730
And especially with us being here surrounded by the Great Lakes.

648
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:42,540
Yeah, oftentimes, um, more frequently closed down beaches because of people drowning and things like that.

649
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:46,649
But you often see signs out there related to the algal blooms as well.

650
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:50,910
It's too toxic to go swimming, fishing, doing any of those activities.

651
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:58,530
And elevated temperatures obviously affect weather patterns and negatively impact plants, animals and humans.

652
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:05,549
We've also seen anomalies in terms of increased rainfall and elevated.

653
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:15,090
So that's a type of precipitation. So with more still water ponds, etc., this is really conducive to mosquito breeding.

654
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:25,020
It put us sorry, what about when we were talking about like there was some drought and the longer the temperatures spread but if there is a drought,

655
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:29,370
wouldn't there be like less standing water. Yes. Mosquitoes to breed.

656
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:37,079
Yeah. There, yes. So yes and yes. So there is less still water for it for mosquitoes to breed.

657
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:40,080
I think in the not in this PowerPoint.

658
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:45,240
In another PowerPoint, I'll show you how fast the mosquito life cycle goes.

659
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:58,200
So you really don't need that much water and that much time for them to just go like wildfire so the mosquitoes can find any still water.

660
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,959
It doesn't have to be a pond. It doesn't have to be a puddle.

661
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:09,270
It can be like, you know, maybe like you had a kiddy pool that you put outside for your toddler or even your dog to cool down.

662
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:19,560
They'll go hang out there or they'll even find like even traces of water that are in the environment and go breed there as well.

663
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:25,019
But they love warm temperatures, so that is super helpful to them.

664
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:26,790
And we'll talk about ticks later as well.

665
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:37,080
Or climactic events like hurricanes, obviously, they wash up debris, garbage and other items that can lead to more rodents,

666
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:43,020
habitats, habitats for rodents that can lead to hantavirus, leptospirosis or cholera.

667
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:52,350
So back in 2017, when there was Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area and there was like severe flooding,

668
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:56,250
I mean, we can even next week talk about what's going on in Mississippi right now.

669
01:11:57,510 --> 01:12:04,559
Tons and tons of animal poop just floating in the street, being washed out.

670
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,680
And that and that leads to leptospirosis.

671
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:13,530
Like we said, this also not only does a wash up gross stuff,

672
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:22,140
but it disrupts natural environments and further blurs that line between where things naturally reside and.

673
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:26,850
Where they reside. So four.

674
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:33,610
So if we're looking at things like infrastructure, for example, infrastructure is considered part of the environment.

675
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:42,190
So if we look at things like water treatment, plants, dams, etc., how many of you have actually been to a water treatment plant before?

676
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:48,129
A couple. It's really cool if you ever get the chance to go because it's like, Oh, it's like poop water.

677
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:54,400
And then you go all the way to that and as like, Oh no, it's being discharged into the river cycle of life.

678
01:12:54,400 --> 01:13:00,879
It's so beautiful. But these are ideally like breeding sites, again, for mosquitoes and malaria.

679
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:06,760
So like to go back to your point, for example, like if you have a city like Tucson, for example, hot, hot, hot.

680
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:10,120
But they definitely have a water treatment plant there. Right.

681
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:19,420
And a part of it in order for the primary and secondary treatment to work for the solids settling and all that has to be outdoors.

682
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:29,650
I feel sometimes it's like a giant square looking thing or a circle, and then there's also larval contact due to moist soil.

683
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:37,120
Inadequate microbial barriers can cause cryptosporidium, defective plumbing, which can cause,

684
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:46,030
like viral dispersal of things like scars and then reservoir and distribution, like water cooling towers can cause things like Legionella.

685
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:50,980
You'll never find me in a hot tub because that's where Pseudomonas hangs out.

686
01:13:53,200 --> 01:14:01,540
Development and change in land use also proliferates infectious disease outbreaks, so there's human interference with nature.

687
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:07,389
One of the most devastating things that was happening and is still happening is

688
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:12,340
they're cutting down large parts of the Amazon rainforest in South America,

689
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:21,549
which you literally can never get those things back, like some of those things back that have been there for like hundreds and hundreds of years.

690
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:27,730
That's where they source a lot of the primary ingredients for medications and different therapeutic treatments.

691
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:33,790
But as you're cutting those things down, like other things live there, so where are they going to go now?

692
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:40,960
Right. They have to go to the nearest place and now they're in some kind of habitat where they haven't been before.

693
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,820
It also changes again the way that water resources are developed and managed.

694
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:50,650
Mining creates an intermediate what we call host habitat,

695
01:14:50,950 --> 01:15:00,130
and then forest fragmentation as well encourages the the rapid movement of and blurring of these borders.

696
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:07,990
So, you know, deforestation, obviously, if you get rid of where ticks live, they're going to go somewhere else like your neighborhood.

697
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:15,610
So we've seen an uptick in Lyme disease. We've seen an uptick in animal and pathogen migration into suburban areas.

698
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:20,979
We've seen like pushing contact with the reservoir hosts like Hendra virus,

699
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:27,430
which is in the lethal virus family as we've seen it in India and then mosquitoes, those pesky mosquitoes.

700
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:36,010
Um, technology and industry has also served as an environment to increase infectious disease outbreaks.

701
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,180
So medical technology, for example, I have a whole other spiel about this,

702
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:46,000
but the increased prescription of antibiotics were leading to anti-microbial resistance

703
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:51,130
and the way that food is processed here in the modernized world in terms of,

704
01:15:51,640 --> 01:16:01,990
you know, mass slaughter, kill farms, etc., contaminated model crops, undercooked meats, improperly stored food cruises.

705
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:07,720
Meat consumption has also gone up a lot. So this has all slowly contributed.

706
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:14,080
Globalization as well has led to these really antibiotic strains.

707
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:19,270
People also because it's all about production rate and money output,

708
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:26,920
you have improper food storage, so you might have things like aflatoxins in crops and then this,

709
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:35,829
you know, you have any of the IRB into a swine containment facility or like a large chicken culling facility.

710
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:40,239
It's really unpleasant and smelly, but poorly kept.

711
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:45,250
Poultry farming facilities leads to things like avian influenza.

712
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:52,120
And again, because of the blurring and zoonotic transfer of diseases, that's how humans get things like avian influenza.

713
01:16:54,730 --> 01:17:00,280
When they say cage free, that doesn't mean they're free range.

714
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:11,020
Just so I'm sure you talk about that in other classes, but just literally food for thought and then travel and commerce as well.

715
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:22,360
We talked about importing pathogens, recreational travel exposure when staying somewhere, hantavirus never find me renting a cabin in the woods.

716
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:25,600
Partially because I don't want to get murdered, but hantavirus.

717
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:32,530
So there's a lot of rodents like at Yosemite. There was a hantavirus outbreak because there were just rodents living in the walls,

718
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,360
in the cabins and spreading their fecal matter and urine everywhere.

719
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:44,799
Tick bites while hiking. And then they don't let you ideally bring in like plants or like other things from other countries.

720
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,790
Like you can't bring a pineapple back from like the Bahamas or something or throw it away.

721
01:17:50,590 --> 01:17:58,600
And then obviously, politics is now involved in part of the environmental landscape of how infectious diseases are spread.

722
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:02,260
But we'll talk more about that as the semester goes on.

723
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:08,350
Economics as well, depending on resource, poor environments, urban environments, crowding.

724
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:16,089
We'll talk more about that. Warren Conflates as we've seen here, like last two years ago,

725
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:23,380
there was a civil war going on between the Republic of Congo and Uganda on the win, the Republic of Congo.

726
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:29,950
And then so people were fleeing across the border to Uganda, potentially infected with Ebola.

727
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:32,410
So those kinds of issues can happen as well.

728
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:40,840
Or displaced persons in refugee camps then, you know, we have these social behavioral aspects that we'll get into more as the semester goes on.

729
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:51,090
So I made it almost the way through. So I'll pick up here on Tuesday and then.

730
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:56,409
Yes, please. Labor Day. Yeah, you forgot about that.

731
01:18:56,410 --> 01:19:03,820
I just did that. So I'm really excited. Does anybody have plans or do Republicans?
