1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:09,030
It just so happens that she has a lot of time.

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,730
So she's never asked you that? I don't. I know.

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:31,960
She's kind of like, yeah, yeah, I like you.

4
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:43,530
I can find time to go to your friends because I don't know how you do.

5
00:00:43,650 --> 00:01:29,910
So I got to ask, you know, I just can't say which one is it?

6
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:52,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,680
I think I feel like.

8
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,810
I mean, such a one.

9
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:22,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:44,510
You know, I was just wondering why TV shows.

11
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,840
I want to go into that.

12
00:02:48,760 --> 00:03:10,270
I have to tell you that I think just from this probably going to be like the same exact thing.

13
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:18,610
It's going to be a nice place to work.

14
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,560
You know, it's a lot easier to just get along in the street.

15
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,080
Yes, that would work. I don't know.

16
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:44,320
Yeah, it's called the show. It's like they're not really every day, you guys.

17
00:03:47,370 --> 00:04:01,270
I was a couple. If you're single, I guess, like, you know, and I was like,

18
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,620
first I'm going to like I'm probably going to either do this here in New York because I had like a dream.

19
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:31,410
Yeah. I was like I just like I was like, why do you think it's okay to quit?

20
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:39,490
Because it's it's called Standing on the list.

21
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:48,750
So that's really we actually 20 Yankees are going to come on.

22
00:04:48,750 --> 00:05:03,100
I don't know. So when they get funding funding, I'm sure we can get our experience.

23
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:15,220
I mean, I don't know the whole country, oh, you don't get involved in class.

24
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:21,580
So the way we're going to vote, how we're going to talk about I'm serious.

25
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:37,360
And obviously so an introduction to the world of canvas organize the assignments into one of them is a class session.

26
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:46,590
So I will propose to what we are going to cover on the topic that we like to program in these sessions.

27
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:54,729
We're not going to finish all of those today. You know, we'll see how far we get.

28
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:09,730
And then on being an example for those of you that are running to so that you know that I have office hours from 12 to something every Thursday.

29
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:14,139
So today is the first day of office hours.

30
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,530
You can join me. Yeah. Zoom or you can.

31
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:25,060
Or you can still do on my office. Three, six in seven, eight.

32
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:34,300
Just right. You know, these things build these things in our third floor.

33
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:46,870
And so you know and all of us global peace of mind I because I'm instructing you know,

34
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:56,500
I can't I'm not going to spend every week just to make sure I'm okay.

35
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,479
So I have one at the beginning of the week and it was fun.

36
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,560
And then in another one it's bombing, right?

37
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:11,010
So you know that if there's anything that I think is needed, one, continue zoom.

38
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,730
But for now, I think you know everything that you should be.

39
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:22,209
You sent me. Okay, well, that's all right.

40
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:28,020
So I would like you to go on to.

41
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:48,750
I am going to propose right now that something made into this file that I want you to use and download and use for stationary.

42
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:55,390
Then we can talk about the ten time series on Sirius XM.

43
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:41,309
Just suppose that even a second. And then you should know that you for.

44
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:45,060
For you to download and that.

45
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:57,960
Later today, I am going to assign your first homework assignment and also your first video lecture to assignment and the video.

46
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:05,760
The homework assignment is going to be to note this coming Tuesday, what a week of me is going to be by doing that,

47
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:14,670
and I'll give you instructions about how to proceed with that for now.

48
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,920
This is so preamble.

49
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:28,910
I'm not sure. So we have.

50
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:42,070
So we have a time series here, though, and we want to forecast let's say that we want to try to get injured 25 and 26.

51
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:54,670
Literally millions. Those are the two videos that I want to focus on.

52
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:04,950
So there are two kind of and you'll see that in that kind of time series.

53
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:16,920
The first one. This is what we call the stationary time series this time.

54
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,500
And this is whatever in mind or any value that you want to it.

55
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,060
So that the stationary time series like that.

56
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:42,180
And the main feature of this stationary time series is that it has a long run.

57
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:54,690
I mean. And in the long run, a constant standard deviation from certain variables,

58
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:07,830
those elements between the minimum and maximum of the of the theories that seem to remain stable.

59
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,810
So when you see something like that, this is, what, close to that?

60
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:37,309
We call that stationary analysis. Stationary bases and there are other types of activities that one that are don't

61
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:46,610
follow that kind of behavior like pottery and you can take something through.

62
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,430
You cannot say that on average this has a constant need.

63
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:08,600
Right. And you have to really look at the upward trend.

64
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:22,100
And that is serious, that we have a trend and sometimes a series that opens again for people to climb on this.

65
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,440
It's a bit strange that we call those non stationary.

66
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:37,760
You know, these carry more information than the stationary time series because we can forecast where the trend is.

67
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:48,410
Besides all of the things, that intensity is hard. But when you see the trend and the trend can be, you know, going on,

68
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:58,070
going down the curve exponentially, the came something that can be many shapes of a triangle.

69
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:05,480
But the idea is a have a constant mean, you have a pattern.

70
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:14,430
Does that persist over time? And this is, again, what we call non stationary intensities.

71
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:23,870
We're going to focus right now on the stationary time series for today and part of next week.

72
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,710
Right. So let's.

73
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:58,160
So if you have downloaded this discography, so what I'm going to do is first figured out whether this series is stationary or not,

74
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:13,460
and the best way to do this now is simply do all the times I do is a visual and if we do all the time series, you like that.

75
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:22,850
So I'm going to highlight including labels and everything and I'm going to press control sheet and then.

76
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:36,580
People.

77
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:31,340
So now I like my time series and I'm going to go in concert and I'm going to go, This is not in the chart X, Y and Z, and I am I want to select this.

78
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:37,160
I started with a straight line and some markers.

79
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:46,609
So now this is, this is our our times here is because it seems like it has all the way all

80
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:53,330
the console mean looks to me right it has to be very obvious that it doesn't.

81
00:15:53,870 --> 00:16:06,830
So when when is borderline or something like that and I'm going to show you later some more specific ways, that's for sure and everything.

82
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:20,030
But something like this is clearly station here, so it has a little bit of a constant mean you're going to see these opening now an opening.

83
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:32,070
So remember it doesn't have to be it includes a very clear, consistent pattern, but below an average looking.

84
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:40,340
If you want to see something close to those elements, let's change that scale.

85
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:59,150
And I want to change. I double click on the Y axis and I want to change the scale from 25 to meaning so we can get closer to the data.

86
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:12,010
And this is where we are now. We have and is stationary, we decided is stationary and and is true.

87
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:26,360
And then there is a plethora of both methods that we can use in order to forecast the future and forecast this time series.

88
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,050
And we want PTO 25 and 26 forecast.

89
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:42,190
So I'm going to start by describing, you know, them those those matters.

90
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:58,340
Okay. So so if if the if the time series is has a constant mean when you think and you take the average of all these numbers that's my forecast.

91
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:09,470
What would be now be fine right now be a way to forecast that but this might not be the best way and any idea why this might not be the best way?

92
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:19,100
Might not be. Well, it might not be the best way, because these Times series managers mean,

93
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:31,420
even though it has a constant outreach and I know we're all constantly I mean,

94
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:40,300
you know, locally you can have these people with low local means, for example.

95
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:04,980
For example, these local need, you know, quality and needs locally and here.

96
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:19,400
Right. Even though overall the you can you can imagine some riding the scene is sloped way around and and you know remains along that line.

97
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:26,060
And so there's nothing you can have, you know, pieces of the time series.

98
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,409
We use Meander for a while and change your meanders.

99
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,860
What we think this is what we call our correlation patterns.

100
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:52,850
Right. So they they an observation, a data point that you see now and to is is is more likely to behave like the previous period than,

101
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,970
you know, you know, several things in the past. Right.

102
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:05,930
So if you are right before passive demand even though on our on the long run a stable mean there might

103
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:13,829
be that a few years you have a high demand and you're still you have a low demand so it tends to grow,

104
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,690
which is not we're not locked away on the ground more so than that.

105
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:23,540
So we what what we are going to do.

106
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:30,960
So instead of I'm thinking the average of all these series,

107
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:39,559
we are going to take our preview of this small group of these series in order to forecast the future.

108
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:49,940
So if we're here, we probably should take the average of these two observations in order to confirm that instead of the whole thing,

109
00:20:50,690 --> 00:21:02,210
yeah, this is what we call moving averages, because what we want to do is get rid of the noise and figure down the local meaning.

110
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,230
So if you take the average of these observations, you're going to, you know,

111
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:17,030
take away they all come down around the mean of that series and you know, these go over what is constant about that series for a lot.

112
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,990
Right. And this is in income.

113
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:36,860
Oh, okay. So what we do then is they say you want to forecast in your 25 and 26, then I will take this.

114
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:45,200
They they they in the average, let's say of the three most recent observation.

115
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:58,620
Right. So you. All the more reason for provisions going to come before them.

116
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:07,190
And then these are which is what I'm going to forecast for 25, 35.

117
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,410
And let's see that.

118
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,350
Let's say that I want to point that people. 26.

119
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:27,960
Well, Imperial 26. I need to think the average of the three most recent observations, but I don't have to mention the City of London five.

120
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:28,260
Right.

121
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:43,440
So I will have to get to 536 and then I can make an observation for at 25 this thing that they were fast selling made for video 25 after the survey.

122
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:54,100
So I mean, this is the average and that is it.

123
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:11,819
And the reform passing between the 35 and 15, what, you know, any job, 35, 35,

124
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:28,050
36 and 35 know I think Investment Council and 35 goes to observation but not to forecast and both those are going to be my forecast for 2025.

125
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:42,600
Okay. So the question is why did they determine that my forecast a Whitney best my thinking

126
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:48,630
did the average of the three more recent units in order to forecast the future.

127
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,020
Well I don't know that I used that. All right.

128
00:23:52,020 --> 00:24:04,470
But there are ways in which you can actually determine what is the best possible you know, the number of opinions that you saw this year.

129
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:15,670
Let's say that you are not sure about taking a two period moving average versus the three we know you want to be.

130
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:24,390
You know, when there's two or three alterations to the past, are you invested you can do for the premises?

131
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,490
Well, you can do this one.

132
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:40,140
So let's let me get these photographs here. And then what what you can do is, given that you have all this data,

133
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:51,540
you can assume that you don't have you can actually make believe that you don't have the full information about the Time series.

134
00:24:52,020 --> 00:25:02,490
Right? And then you can start saying, okay, I just have observations one and two and I'm going to form an observation putting here.

135
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,010
I'm going to look at the data for fiduciary view.

136
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:12,080
Then I'm collecting the 31 and I'm going to see what is the error, what is the difference between the two.

137
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:18,340
And then I'm going to keep doing that and then I'm going to compare, you know,

138
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:29,490
the so measure of the anchor that I have within two people in a week versus a three period moving average and they want to has his monitor.

139
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,259
And then that's the one that I am going to use in the future.

140
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:45,989
So let's say that I want to compare the two two period moving average to the

141
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,470
three period moving average and then start with a continuing momentum research.

142
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:58,920
So what it's going to going to do, I am going to ignore it in order to do well to pick a moving average with this time series.

143
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:09,450
And I think forecast rankings are great for because I already have the information and just wanted to know how the these methods perform.

144
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:14,670
If I had forecasted from the beginning that 90 days with the ceiling.

145
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:27,150
All right so what I can do is, you know, taking the average of the first two observations, this is the average data.

146
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:39,770
To do that the average. 33 and 38.

147
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:51,089
And then and get things right. So this is my this would have been my forecast for the PS3 with a two period moving average and well so I

148
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:56,610
forecasted this is in being a two way forecast for these things for three and then I got the wrong one.

149
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:14,940
So I have an error, right? And then I just take the difference between the observations and my forecast for observation minus the forecast.

150
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,990
And that's going to be my error. Negative five, right.

151
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:24,460
So this means that the.

152
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:35,300
Let me let me do that. It doesn't matter which way goes up to me and my logical cash flow forecast, my evasion.

153
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:43,490
Let me do the opposite here with the one moderate forward calculation.

154
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:51,650
What I'm going to do. The truth.

155
00:27:51,820 --> 00:28:02,460
It is the one of got my vision and what I want to do is be interpreted these the directly so these

156
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:12,150
five means that my four guys were you know exceeded they did observation five by fire and five you.

157
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,570
So what I can do now is replicate this formula.

158
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,980
So if I replicate this formula here because I'm using relative references.

159
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:41,850
So now these four cars is going to be the good news for cash is going to pay 38, 31 divided by two and then we get 35.

160
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:47,940
And then there is that book. But when I did that 35, then I got observation.

161
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,270
You know what took 35? These are rounding.

162
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:56,530
That's why you will see exactly things you.

163
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,590
Give you a little bit more on this email.

164
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:12,200
So you can see when I form a sales to those emails, one, this email looks like I'm being sold.

165
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:25,280
So I would be here for 4.5 loads and here I am point five below for President's Day, 4.5 when I get 35 and so on.

166
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:33,929
So I would do the whole thing. I would replicate that.

167
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,410
And then I have measures of error.

168
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:43,860
I know I have been very, very narrow was 4.5.

169
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:49,260
The second was -4.5 and so on and so forth.

170
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,860
So I have, you know, these these compilation of better.

171
00:29:53,190 --> 00:30:07,280
So one thing that you say that we can do is, you know, add all these errors to get an average of this and, you know, an average measure of the error.

172
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:13,000
Why wouldn't that work? If I do that.

173
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:31,240
Well, you know, if I if I add all these numbers, you see that there are some positive items, there are some negative, so he can cancel it.

174
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,770
And then you can have a very, very bad forecast.

175
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,719
Very inaccurate series is being broken down, up and down.

176
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:48,120
And, you know, the error is zero, but it's not I mean, it's a huge error, but you just cancel it out, you know, below.

177
00:30:48,120 --> 00:31:00,509
So we do two things. We take the average of the is we there's some of the square of the error and that's gone and that that called a mean square.

178
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:04,440
Andrew the mean.

179
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:13,090
Square is dissolving the notes and spinning wherever would be.

180
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:27,160
They have forecast 85 observations and they square and divide that by the middle of observation.

181
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:32,620
This is some some.

182
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:47,370
So you get the that some of the square there of the night by the number of observations they are that's the square.

183
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:58,900
And if you don't want another measuring instead of the means, wherever you can, do they they mean absolutely.

184
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:10,450
Deviation is like this. The same thing as it means where everybody, instead of taking the square, you take the absolute value of the difference.

185
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:17,500
So these number will be 4.5.5, you know, three, 3.5.

186
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:27,340
So no, no, no sign. Right? So in this case, we are going to in this class, we're going to be fair.

187
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:37,980
You need to know both. Right. But I'm going to prefer to use the means wherever, because it has nice physical properties.

188
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,519
This is what we do when we use the do regression analysis.

189
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:47,890
We try to minimize that because that. Right. So that's what regression is.

190
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:54,190
So it's a nice comparisons. I see that.

191
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:02,020
So I'm going to create I'm going to show you how to do it.

192
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:07,550
I've made sure called I mean, square. So it means clearer than square.

193
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:13,750
And what I tell you is that I am going to raise these number.

194
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:21,670
So I'm going to square does No. Three square.

195
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:38,910
The thing going to wear all these number and then I am going to ask all these numbers and then so I'm going to take this some of these numbers,

196
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:46,360
I'm going to think I did the observation. So this is going to be equal to the some.

197
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:57,979
Of all these number. I don't mean to divide by the number of observations.

198
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,660
You don't have to count them.

199
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:13,540
You can use the function of Count in Excel and simply highlight the number of forecasts they follow and they will get my means, whatever happens.

200
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:24,049
6.9 What does it mean? We you know, we we cannot tell you right now what it means in being something related to another method.

201
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:28,730
So if I want to compare it to people moving average,

202
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:36,060
what's interesting is the way that we can do the same thing for a three year moving average and I get the two means where have errors an eight.

203
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:41,090
The one that is low. No, no, no.

204
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:47,140
You don't have to, you know, do these extra calls.

205
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:50,570
I didn't do that thing in.

206
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:11,670
And this is the area where we can we can save we can save the air or a bed or a square.

207
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:26,129
Simply by using some Excel formula that an Excel function that will square all these numbers and Apple is done or something like that,

208
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:34,350
you don't have to actually create two things where there is two.

209
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:50,570
Right. So I sum all these elements square, and then this is the sum of some of the square.

210
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:55,650
And then I divide that by the number of wherever they have.

211
00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:08,020
So I get the mean square root. Good.

212
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,410
Okay. So what do you think about this?

213
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:22,620
What I tell you is I don't need I don't need this, you know, these two columns and the.

214
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,090
Without them. I'm I'm going to both these and these spreadsheets sheets.

215
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,859
So you see that the same. So I copy the special causes.

216
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:41,580
It's easy to order. You know, one of these is like copy and one of these two columns.

217
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:51,630
And now I told you that what I'm going to do is use a formula.

218
00:36:51,990 --> 00:37:03,030
I use a function in Excel that will take this number minus this number is where it goes, no matter where you put it, and so on.

219
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,790
And that is the sum of X.

220
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,550
So it maybe why?

221
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:30,860
Well, that's that's a thing that some of mine is quite square and then I'm going to open parentheses and then I'm going to highlight the first column.

222
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:40,430
You know, have to be the same number of data points because this is the enterprise I might even have forecast for the first two periods.

223
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:54,540
So I don't include them. And then I'm going to be present, Carmen and then I am going to highlight the forecast and then I'm going to divide that.

224
00:37:54,550 --> 00:38:02,650
I might a little bit of observations that I have here and then I can do that count as I did before in.

225
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:17,380
There's no post-invasion. And, you know, we got 6.931, you see 2.931.

226
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:22,660
So the same thing. So this is what we did before.

227
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,950
This is what we do in an abbreviated format.

228
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:38,660
And we got the same thing. So I'm going to I went to all of these the baby the the two period moving average and it's easy to use.

229
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,690
We know. Imagine this guy's and his record.

230
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:54,800
And when people think about the 3 billion moving average in this woman, it will be obvious.

231
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:05,990
Can you show the formula for the two periods moving average MSE to go through and make the figure and then I'm going to make it right there.

232
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:20,480
Yes, that's right. Yeah, I can see how that helps you do this, right?

233
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:26,180
Yes. So why did we see different ways right now?

234
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:37,520
I want us to get very sorry. I want to show you exactly what we're doing right here, where they are, and then we pay the average here.

235
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:52,660
So that was like A, B, C, and this is like this is exactly one thing to know just because I feel like that's a good one.

236
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:07,370
Because remember, you're going to use a lot of these the sum of X minus Y squared.

237
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:19,340
Now I am going to do my three period moving average and then you will be okay.

238
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,930
So how do I do the three moving averages? Okay.

239
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:36,769
So I started forecasting period what you know, in order to do a three period moving average, I need only the observations of the last three.

240
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:47,599
And therefore the first period that I can forecast is beyond that I can use three observations in advance and then in video three,

241
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,000
I use the three observations and forecast the future, which is the fourth.

242
00:40:52,460 --> 00:41:05,970
So I am going to be here and then I am going to take the average from 1 to 3 and.

243
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:16,170
I mean, I am going to go through this formula and because we are using relative references.

244
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:24,149
So the moving average is the average, it would be wrong and that's why we call this rule.

245
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:32,850
The average is this is one is this is the average of these three observations.

246
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:36,830
And this one is that obviously is four.

247
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:45,290
So when you see these three provisions here, but the other one is the three.

248
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:50,040
So the averages are moving and therefore will be happy.

249
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,730
What I want to do is it's very close to the observation that I want to work out and,

250
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:02,040
you know, take a little bit of the noise out by just ordering those observations.

251
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:21,250
And let's do. And then let's do the in the MSP.

252
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:29,140
So is it going to be like. Some of it is mine.

253
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:33,170
Why? We're looking for it.

254
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,800
And then what column do I use first?

255
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:43,700
And from what? Cell phone the way it's been.

256
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:49,520
And then it's going to be what looks at first observation to be that great.

257
00:42:49,520 --> 00:43:02,989
And we do three will not be these observation here because that's the first that I for which I have four or five so is going to be 35 here.

258
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:17,420
So a little bit in camp is four. So I do number and then I present coal mine and then I get my forecast.

259
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:33,920
We it will be very and you know this is the names I'm going to divide that by the the little forecast that we have for the 10 billion moving average.

260
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:50,270
It gives you the formula and the company that injured some of its mangoes y squared from

261
00:43:50,870 --> 00:44:01,410
B 525 that sent you 511 August to be 25 that day and divided by the little forecast.

262
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:09,600
Anyhow, I could have highlighted these. So the economy or opportunity doesn't matter to think of.

263
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,750
It has to be this growth period that I have, right?

264
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:19,820
Because I'm averaging growth here. So I get 7.19.

265
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:25,190
So you have to take with a three year moving average and a 4 billion.

266
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:28,760
And is it between the two and three period moving average?

267
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:38,000
Which one of the views do you use to pay your way because he has the smaller

268
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:45,200
the square and so they they are they lower that number you know the better.

269
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:51,889
So the perfect forecast would be the square or equal to see that that you actually

270
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:58,460
nailed down every single observation used for that won't give you the error.

271
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,780
That's what's happened. You never get that.

272
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:15,410
And always not only in the physical system that you get something that can you do the three GMA again.

273
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:34,190
How you got that forecast column. Yeah. I do believe the moving averages will be an average of 81.3.

274
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:39,080
The first one. Right, that's being that forecasting period for.

275
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:43,370
And then just copy that one. Thank you.

276
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:56,270
Okay. So if you want to see how these four guys look how they look in the graph.

277
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:03,890
So let me do you guys and what we're going to do now is.

278
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:20,670
What I'm going to do now is is simply going to follow the 2 billion moving average and to going to see how they look.

279
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:27,870
So I am going to I'm going to highlight the time period for them.

280
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:37,650
And then I want you to write Control and then click on the digital moving average.

281
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:42,030
And then I go to Droneship. And then the road.

282
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:47,460
And then there. Right. Right.

283
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:56,310
Right, right. So I highlighted everything that I needed to do.

284
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:02,430
Highlight this. These won't be loaded simply because we don't have observation.

285
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:08,030
Just, you know, to make sure that we don't mess up anything.

286
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:14,870
I'm going to also include the blank cells.

287
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:23,550
And then what I'm going to do now is I am going to right click on isolation and dutifully for these numbers,

288
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:29,490
and then I'm going to do things that I need to activate the.

289
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:41,130
And once I have activated the drive, I am going into the station and so I need a graph.

290
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:54,690
Excel knows that I am trying to completely paste those numbers into the graph that was already in that I already created.

291
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:58,290
And these are going to be the new series.

292
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:04,770
Right. So we have a column of opinion moving up and a column of repeating a moving average.

293
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:13,110
So those are two new series. And then the series names are the first column.

294
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,890
Series are in columns. The series names are in the first row.

295
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:22,930
What do I mean? That means that there's a label top.

296
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:32,010
So you see this one.

297
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:43,790
But you know that what it means is that the series names are in the first row, so the first row would be a row.

298
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,160
One of those things that I highlighted.

299
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:50,430
It has the name, right? So those are the names.

300
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:56,520
That's how they identify what they do.

301
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:02,160
And the X values. I want them to be in the first column, right?

302
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:21,250
So the time period. So this is the time being 3012 and then and then I'm going to click okay and get the new.

303
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:37,440
Goes to guarantee they want to find out what you think.

304
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:42,560
So you see what you mean?

305
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:54,570
Is this thing that you used?

306
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:18,330
Okay. So I have a my my daughter in Germany and originally a three year will be

307
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:27,550
marriage if you take a look at this this is how I put on four trusted dinosaurs.

308
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:36,520
And if you want to know which one is or one and then let's put a link and.

309
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:42,080
It will expand.

310
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:53,030
So and one day we will open the trunk element and then I want to put the leg in here so you can see which and which one is there?

311
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:58,160
2 p.m. and 4 p.m. and 3 p.m., right.

312
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:16,190
So the two period moving average is the orange will be on the gray one is the tribute to the orange one, according to the MSI,

313
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:31,310
is closer to the observations to the the forecast are better on average than the four P than the the the attributable because it has a longer MSI.

314
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:42,160
So if I want to forecast with it you either the two P repeated the one I will use the 2

315
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:48,980
p.m. what we now retrain because is set as this moderate so 6.9 hours instead of the p.

316
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:53,780
So I'm going to get rid of the 50 year moving average.

317
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:13,420
Highlight the. Because we needed that.

318
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:18,250
Because people that don't believe in dependency. And now.

319
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:32,230
Now I'm going to forecast period 2025 and 26 hourly forecasts, as I told you before.

320
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:36,909
Right. So I use that to move in our region.

321
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:46,360
The first forecast is going to be just continuing the same much the same process, the same formula.

322
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:57,750
So here I will be continued to before my forecast with the average of 20, 20,

323
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:07,230
23 and then for period 25, my forecast should be the average anything before.

324
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:14,010
So I need only to. Extend that.

325
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:19,010
So now I have 35.5, right? So that's my first real forecast.

326
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:25,290
I don't have observation for period 25, so I cannot compare everything.

327
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:34,140
And then but but so remember, I am right now in opinion when before forecasting what is going to happen in the year 25 and 26.

328
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:43,140
And then they want me to forecast in the 2041 one to point 26.

329
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:50,490
So how do they do that? Well, I would like to take the average of the observation field.

330
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:55,259
24 and 25, 26.

331
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,630
But I don't have that observation period.

332
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:06,540
25 So I when I think that observation so I'm going to pretend that the observation here will be equal to the forecast.

333
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:29,370
And then I'm going to take the average. Of the 24 and instead of observation people 2520 4000 people 25 from the my my forecast.

334
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:44,340
35.5 and 25.8. So that those are ready to forecast and you want to see how they look in the wrong place and when you do that.

335
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:52,740
So I'm going to highlight the items when you see some price control and then I can going to highlight the forecast,

336
00:54:53,160 --> 00:55:03,719
I am going to copy the values that I'm going to activate the graph and then I'm going to

337
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:14,090
paste those values based special and that's going to be in this U16 thing that I'm seeing.

338
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:17,280
So this is going to be new points instead of a new series,

339
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:29,520
and it's going to be just new point through the variable being average for the columns and then it comes out in the first row.

340
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:45,420
And that's it. So you won't have the names in the first row because now they I'm using spending promises that don't have any labels.

341
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:55,060
And this is my forecast for period 25 and 26.

342
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:58,900
Those two points are forecast. I don't have a provision in.

343
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:12,960
So when I, I keep forecasting for a while and every time I forecast, I can optimize my time series and that's okay or I can check again.

344
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:16,290
But we need to be using being able to be able to see the changes.

345
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:26,760
But in general, you figured out that the best way forward for this time series is set to give you the moving average.

346
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:35,400
And therefore I am thinking the average of the past two observations in order to forecast the future, and that's our third forecast.

347
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:40,800
So that's the real first for or four in question.

348
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:47,680
He's working with me anyway.

349
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:58,340
Okay. Um, so I feel like this assumes that be like the period's kind of fit.

350
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:03,350
What happens if it's cyclical? Like, if it's year, if it's like an annual yearly cycle?

351
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:07,190
So, like, every year around Thanksgiving, we get a bunch of emergency room visits.

352
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:10,850
But that doesn't happen in October. December.

353
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:15,950
So it like the periods next to it don't aren't an accurate forecast.

354
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:20,140
Yeah. So that's what's called the seasonality that we haven't gotten.

355
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:25,640
Okay. So this is I'd say that's a good point.

356
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:32,660
You took a look at the time the time that you say stationary and I don't see any seasonality.

357
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:39,259
Okay. So you have to use the observe the observations that you have to decide how you're going to forecast.

358
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:44,870
And if you decide that it's stationary, then you do this inside of a stationary.

359
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:51,890
And then you figured out there is no obvious pattern that that cyclical pattern.

360
00:57:51,900 --> 00:58:02,180
So, you know, let me use a moving average technique to forecast the intensity and then the dose

361
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:07,760
of all of those techniques to forecast stationary intensities are moving up

362
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:13,430
because what we are saying is the best you can do is take so average of possible

363
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:17,240
prevention just to get rid of the noise in order to forecast the future.

364
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:26,690
And that we don't think the average of all of them because we think that more recent observations are more important to work out,

365
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:31,440
that you do your job and then you think just leaving chunks.

366
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:40,700
Now how what's the length of the charge then you you try different people it usually we

367
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:49,909
don't go more than what the movie doesn't so you try to think and things they want to you

368
00:58:49,910 --> 00:59:03,649
know smallest I mean means a lot now so this is you know I'm I'm going to do exactly

369
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:12,670
what I did now but I am going to give you a more general method to use moving averages.

370
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,460
And what yeah.

371
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:29,360
This is an extension of, you know, what I just said to you, that some observations in the past are more important and older to forecast the future.

372
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:35,240
Right now, I'm using that to include moving the moving average, the forecast that you like.

373
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:40,040
But I am taking an average of the two people in to be a little bit.

374
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:50,770
So this in essence, what I'm doing is informing them, you know, you want me to I mean, I'm doing the work that.

375
00:59:54,410 --> 01:00:04,840
Video. Pete Rose one. In the two areas.

376
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:13,660
Leaving the ridge is equal to the observation opinion.

377
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:23,400
He. Close the observations he made as one.

378
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:40,810
You ride a bike to ride to the forecast for your life is equal to the observation at four floors the observation that at two divided by two.

379
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:45,290
So that's where the moving average is, right? And then I keep rolling that stuff.

380
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:49,190
That's my 2 million moving average. You have one trip in your moving average.

381
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:56,799
So of the observation of the observation of the as well as originally my husband and my wife.

382
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:07,490
And now I can write I can write the same formula just distributing these, you know,

383
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:26,970
device over here so I can say this or catch them completely close to 0.5 is, you know, we.

384
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:33,010
Lawless 0.05.

385
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:37,300
Summary Observation Activities one.

386
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:49,100
Right. Does it look right to you? So this is observation point.

387
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:56,020
So it is 030 or.

388
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:19,240
Oh. So those low doses of brain induced thinking, you know, over 80 divided by 2.5 D and then o t minus one divided by two is equal to 2.50 3 minutes.

389
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,590
Right. So if you can think of this formula,

390
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:35,960
that's what we call a symbol who is just taking the two observations in the paper and applying some weights to those observations.

391
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:45,560
And then you can say what observation in the past has 50% of the way to forecast the future.

392
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:49,610
And then, you know, two observations.

393
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:55,579
In the past, we just completely had the same way to forecast the future.

394
01:02:55,580 --> 01:03:06,559
All of them have the same way. If I have the 3 billion moving average, I would be throwing three, three, three, 3.3333.

395
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,680
So I distribute the way in simple. Mm.

396
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:14,910
The other is in the same map, it's the same amount, the same value.

397
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:18,800
And now you are going to say, well why do you do that?

398
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:29,150
You know, if we are talking that sometimes the most recent observations are more important for the future, why not?

399
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:37,400
I give you this number. I need a bit of a different life than this one.

400
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:43,790
Know that what is important is that the waves are up to one minute.

401
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:46,969
They are between zero and one and they are up to one.

402
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:56,060
And why they're the one we want to add up to one is because we want to preserve the overall mean of the series.

403
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:09,650
And so here I'll say I'm taking on average point five for the mean of this observation and then point five for the need of this variation.

404
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:12,680
So if I do this seven hour time several times.

405
01:04:12,830 --> 01:04:22,350
So if I have this, for example, you know, I would be preserving the mean, I would guess thing like that in my mind forecast,

406
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:34,960
we are going to go down a stay, you know, closer to the meaning of these observations.

407
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:46,280
Okay. So how do I do that? How do I just, you know, think of different numbers from the 45.5?

408
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:51,590
Does the average you simply just take the average of the logic away from this thing?

409
01:04:52,010 --> 01:05:00,080
Well, what I'm going to do now is I'm going to make those when I'm going to make some weights

410
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:14,720
and things going this to create what I suppose to be the weighted moving average.

411
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:36,080
Well, wait, the movie, man. What I need first is determine the weights, and the weights have two out of one and be between zero and one.

412
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:41,200
So I'm going to do that for you. Let's say you.

413
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:47,919
I always start with all this weight.

414
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,390
Build a weight that is applied to all this observation.

415
01:05:52,660 --> 01:06:00,880
So in this case, we're going to be building two and then the next one is going to be the most recent observation.

416
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:07,480
And that for that building, once is my preference and you can label that however you want.

417
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:17,930
But in this case, what I tell you is that W two from w one right now are 0.50.58.

418
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:23,440
So I'm going to start by doing that. Only 5.5.

419
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:40,630
What do you find? And I want to monitor this in such a way that is some of these weight.

420
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:57,450
Always. I don't do it. You know, I got to do it.

421
01:06:57,450 --> 01:07:02,850
Quick formula here. They told you to one night, not the little one.

422
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:09,900
And done with that. So we don't have to do this thing because ultimately we will be satisfied.

423
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:15,870
But in general, we are going to be dealing with three or four people the way people do.

424
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:31,830
So I just want to, you know, create an eco system from a proceeding, you know, work in kind of slow moving in a way that we have, which is this film.

425
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:45,660
And then here I want to create the things you need with me in me.

426
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:52,590
Okay. So first, I need to create.

427
01:07:56,410 --> 01:08:01,020
I need to create a weighted Lumina.

428
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:06,380
So I'm going to forecast. And then.

429
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:09,719
And then I'll produce the faith forecast again.

430
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:13,980
And then I'm going to be using it starting in period three.

431
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:20,650
So I'm going to weigh those two with the same weight over five.

432
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:35,370
So this is going through and then I need to go w to the wing that I applied to the all this observation and I want to know that I focus this formula.

433
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:49,919
I want the weight to remain the same. And then I multiply that times the 33 observation one and then I will do this one and then

434
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:57,760
I'm going to go elimination and then multiply times and use automation in order to do that,

435
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:07,080
right? So that's my weighted moving average and it's going to be exactly the one, this one, right.

436
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:10,830
Because we what we did,

437
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:18,090
this is an average of the first move through region and this isn't something on average through the first observation because they wait.

438
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:28,690
So they say and they seem to gain the.

439
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:42,430
We? It's wonderful.

440
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:55,820
One decimal. So I'm going to compute as I did before the emission, you know, the formula.

441
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:29,640
It was very. So you say that because I like the movie the way I know how to look that way.

442
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:38,200
Right. So we put the dollar our side before they go to the gym, before the girls.

443
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:44,850
And that means that they start locking that cell.

444
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:53,760
So it's the same rules. No matter what you do, you would be doing the thing.

445
01:10:54,150 --> 01:11:04,170
And for those of you with PCs, all you need to do is press conference or do you get in the door?

446
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:08,550
So I don't remember what to do.

447
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:15,240
He had to do that. He said There's a key on the mountain, but go.

448
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:29,070
Make sure that you have the lunar signs before the columns on the floor of the building were purchased for the poles.

449
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:32,410
And they're not right with that stuff.

450
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:39,400
That's it. So now let's let's compute the mean square.

451
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:50,200
And this is the showing of miners wives claiming this actually did what we do.

452
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:59,040
Before I went to I liked to select the Apollo.

453
01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:03,000
Followed from observation three with roses.

454
01:12:03,130 --> 01:12:15,390
And who. And then I'm going to the home of the.

455
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:34,000
And then dividing lines by these three nations is progress.

456
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:54,589
And then we should get exactly the same number. We've got to be a pretty simple moving average right now is let's see, I'm going to pull out now.

457
01:12:54,590 --> 01:13:00,110
This is a moving average. I'm going to float the weight of moving average.

458
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:05,750
It's going to be exactly on until at least one of the ones that is in average.

459
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:12,890
And in order to look, I am going to do I like the.

460
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:50,830
She six. And I'm willing to bet on the movie, not just in front of the TV, the grand.

461
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:58,230
And finally, link to a special.

462
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:11,080
Is a when you see some columns this year to the first row, they are and the values are in different columns.

463
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:20,720
So what you see now is the median weighted moving average.

464
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:24,770
On top of this one with a simple moving average.

465
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:30,290
So now what I tend to do right the same image.

466
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:45,510
See, what I can do is change the weight. And let's say that I think the W W2 should be the largest weight blindly and the only one should be pointing.

467
01:14:48,200 --> 01:15:01,760
So you'll see now that the Time series is like a different engraving, and that is the weight of moving average.

468
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:13,430
And the weight of the new note seemed to be better than the three that the simple moving average you see that the median weight,

469
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:21,350
the moving average is 6.83 and the opinion moving average is 6.93.

470
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:25,370
But there is better not that much, but is better.

471
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:36,940
So you see here this is very close to this observation and this is close to the termination of the old one.

472
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:41,990
So you improve a little bit. But, you know, I don't know in which direction.

473
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:45,440
What what about if I do the point.

474
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,960
7.3.7 the.

475
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:54,510
Okay.

476
01:15:54,660 --> 01:16:17,680
So .78.30 now that this is work so a first we are talking now the MSCI in the with a 2 billion weighted average way larger that is going to happen.

477
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:26,430
All right. So the point is now what I want to do is figure out what are the best way to do this globally.

478
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:32,100
One and two, I want to minimize make this number smallest possible.

479
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:39,540
And so I'm going to use an optimization routine that go through that set.

480
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:49,829
Let's go to the solver. And there's over is an algorithm that you have in functions in general.

481
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:55,040
This is a nonlinear function because we are trying to minimize something with an a square.

482
01:16:55,080 --> 01:17:06,120
So the sum of squares and so so is nonlinear and I want to manipulate the waves in order to make that MSE as well as close.

483
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:12,150
Right. And so, and I can do these trial and error, but they will take me forever.

484
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:18,870
And if I do that immediately, if we did well in average of what being a weighted moving average will take me forever to do that.

485
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:27,750
Impossible to do that. Right. So I'm going to do that using an algorithm that will do that optimization for me.

486
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:48,820
And so. Okay.

487
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:56,209
So now what I'm going to do is I am going to go into theta and then I'm going to go through this.

488
01:17:56,210 --> 01:18:01,700
So. So you don't have this folder in your computer.

489
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:06,020
There's an easy way to do all of this over.

490
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:21,680
If I go to data. And then you should see on the right corner of your original data analysis and so on, if you want.

491
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:30,950
The best way to get that would be if I go to the options.

492
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:39,490
And then I go into add ins and then click on Go.

493
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:56,150
And you want to make sure that the solver so that you don't need solver tables but the the solver in is is check that's what we.

494
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:03,790
It's over in Jamaica. And then click.

495
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:11,790
Okay. So this is take a look at how what we're going to do with this.

496
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:15,750
So what is that we want to do?

497
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:21,120
What is our objective? We want to maximize something or minimize something.

498
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:28,880
They want to shrink minimize the means were right.

499
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:40,830
That's why they minimize that mean square that mean make the air as small as possible so you minimize and

500
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:54,810
minimize the information in the opinion weighted moving average empty and then by doing one by changing one.

501
01:19:55,260 --> 01:20:02,350
So I can use more than you do and some get to two.

502
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:11,400
Can I put any numbers for what we want to know is more more frequent and cannot do anything for

503
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:17,410
only one and only two because they have to be between zero and one and then was narrowed to one.

504
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,980
Right. So I'm going to create those constraints.

505
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:40,170
They go one and w you have to be less than independently and less than or equal to one and the sum of w one and two.

506
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:55,860
So I have the formula that adds all these to these sum has to be equal to one so that, you know, they have to be greater than or equal to zero.

507
01:20:55,870 --> 01:21:08,630
But if you click on these check if you check these the this button here, you will automatically make the waste.

508
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:12,660
Not only that, they can be zero, but they can be made right.

509
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,490
So that automatically that that program does that for you.

510
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:27,170
And then I can console look and when I feel when I check this so I get that 8w2 and

511
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:36,810
it's only seven and only one is .3.7 and 29 and point 71 if you want to be precise.

512
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:43,680
And the MSE happens to be 628, which is a little better than the .5.5.

513
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:49,650
But if you look now, you take a look at these numbers, the.

514
01:21:53,150 --> 01:22:02,150
The great one. Those are, on average closer to the observation, closer to the observations than the old one.

515
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:11,450
And that's quite creative. So the issue is, if I want to forecast now, I will use those weights to forecast the future.

516
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:27,730
Then I will use. For of those extend this one to create my first task so that I want to do it.

517
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:39,350
And then in order to forecast the next one, I'll be a weight, including a weighted average of needs.

518
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:52,240
And over 30 of these number and these over this number here are these number here,

519
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:57,880
which is automation plus these forecast because I don't have the observation of the use of these links.

520
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:08,620
So this is going to be equal to the three things I will be using for the price

521
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:34,540
the way number two laws and the reason for each suit in the individual way.

522
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:51,820
The reason clearly five points to talk about why these was important to you and and it's going to be in 35.16.

523
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:59,530
It's a little different from what we've got before. And this is what I have for you for today.

524
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:05,139
So just to give you a bit more time.

525
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:14,850
But this is too exciting. And so I will see you in the next.

526
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:34,700
I just. I was listening to.

527
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:48,620
So.
