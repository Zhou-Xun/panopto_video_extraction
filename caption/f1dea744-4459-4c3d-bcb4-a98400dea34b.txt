1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:08,070
Social Determinants of Health,
Culture, Gender, and Power.

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,985
Social conditions as contexts for
understanding health disparities involving

3
00:00:11,985 --> 00:00:16,462
African-Americans and whites highlight
the need for structural changes

4
00:00:16,462 --> 00:00:21,660
to address root causes of observed
differences in health outcomes.

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,844
Public health professionals are at the
forefront of this work using strategies,

6
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:30,087
such as community based participatory
research to help guide relevant research,

7
00:00:30,087 --> 00:00:34,211
and advocate for policies that recognize
the significance of addressing social

8
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:37,176
determinants of health.

9
00:00:37,176 --> 00:00:39,349
What are root causes
of health disparities?

10
00:00:39,349 --> 00:00:46,690
Did you consider structural racism
that results in poor quality housing?

11
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,870
Environmental toxins?

12
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,590
Inadequate working conditions?

13
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,170
Ineffective schools?

14
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,270
No access to grocery stores?

15
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,526
Or policies that perpetuate
discriminatory practices?

16
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:09,520
What are other factors
that came to mind for you?

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,849
Pervasive, when working in
African-American communities,

18
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:15,322
is the used of deficit
models to guide our work.

19
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:18,830
What do I mean by this?

20
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,130
Deficit models attribute unhealthy
behaviors to cultural norms and

21
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,090
individual behaviors without
assessing structural conditions or

22
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,690
cultural strengths that
contribute to health outcomes.

23
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,910
Frameworks using a cultural lens to
incorporate cultural sensitivity,

24
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,572
cultural humility, and cultural
appropriateness when assessing health

25
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:47,760
in ethnically diverse communities
are vital to effective change strategies.

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,750
It is also critical to consider
the intersection of culture, gender, and

27
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,070
power when we use a health equity
lends to determine solutions for

28
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,255
health disparities.

29
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:03,518
Like race, gender is a socially
constructed concept that involves

30
00:02:03,518 --> 00:02:07,931
a process of how structural forces
influence economic, social, and

31
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:13,350
political opportunities for men and women.

32
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,855
Advancing health promotion to reduce
disparity should determine the role of

33
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:19,240
culture, gender, and

34
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,691
power that result in the internalization
of social oppression for a group.

35
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:27,578
From a cultural perspective,
African-Americans have a rich

36
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:33,030
history of resources used to survive
that are cultural strengths.

37
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,060
These strengths are foundations
on which change is possible.

38
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,870
Constructing solutions to reducing or
eliminating health disparities require

39
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,440
deliberate action to address root
causes of disparities in health.

40
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,440
This means considering solutions
beyond the individual to broader

41
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,290
strategies to address change.

42
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,680
To review, health differences
that are unnecessary, avoidable,

43
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,780
and considered unfair and
unjust are health disparities.

44
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,169
Who determines what is unnecessary,
avoidable,

45
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:16,013
unfair, and
unjust are those who are most powerful.

46
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:19,293
Giving voice to vulnerable
population is the responsibility of

47
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:20,939
public health professionals.

48
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:28,390
Using a health equity lens, or approaching
your work is critical for success.

49
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,910
Conducting health equity research requires
a different way of thinking about race

50
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,080
as a variable in research.

51
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,560
A common approach is to include race
as a controlled variable in research.

52
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,670
What do we learn about
health from this approach?

53
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,300
We learn about the direct influence
of race on health outcome.

54
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:58,420
In reality, race is a proxy for other
influences, including structural racism.

55
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:05,210
What other variables may be a better
way of reflecting race in research?

56
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,125
Consider for a moment your interest
in health disparities research.

57
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:14,390
Be specific as you determine
your health disparities topic.

58
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,350
Decide on your population of interest.

59
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,100
Describe your health equity questions.

60
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,700
Level of influences to
include in your study.

61
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,490
Approach you will take to reducing
the specific health disparity interest.

62
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:37,594
State why this research is significant,
including your main message.

63
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:40,480
We will work on refining your
thoughts in group sessions.
