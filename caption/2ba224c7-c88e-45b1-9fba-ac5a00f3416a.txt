00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hi, my name is Dr. Alfred Franzblau. I'm a faculty member in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences in the School of Public Health,

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and I'm going to speak with you today about aging in public health.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This lecture on aging is divided into five segments.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The first segment will focus on some important background and definitions in order to help frame some of the public health issues related to aging.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So what do we mean by aging? Most obviously, whether we like it or not, we all age or grow older with time.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And along with aging come any changes such as increased life risk of various illnesses and chronic diseases.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But under some circumstances, aging can also be an advantage.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
As with the improvement of certain wines or cheeses with age.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
More specifically, when humans age, there are a variety of physical,

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
psychological and social changes that occur, though with considerable variation among individuals.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Some things generally improve with age, such as knowledge or wisdom.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
However, many physical factors decline or deteriorate, including many physiologic functions.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Think of hearing vision, reaction, time and other physical characteristics that generally decline with age.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
All of the preceding comments about aging have been focused on the individual.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But what about the impact of aging when we consider it from a population perspective?

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:09,000
More specifically, a population ages when the age structure shifts to older ages as when the mean or median age increases.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Such a shift in the age structure of a population can have significant impacts on public health.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So what has been happening with the age of the U.S. population? And why is this important for public health?

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We will examine these questions now. And in the subsequent segments of this lecture.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
For many decades, the age structure of the U.S. population has been shifting.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We're growing older. And since the baby boom generation, i.e. those born between 1946 and 1964, began to reach age 65 or retirement age.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The shift in age has accelerated. A big part of this shift is the fact that life expectancy has increased and people are living longer.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
In addition to increased life expectancy, the shifting of the age structure of the population has also been impacted by a decline in

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
the birth rate so that there are relatively fewer young people as can be seen in the diagram.

25
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The shape of the age distribution has been shifting from a pyramid distribution in 1960 toward a uniform distribution projected for the year 2060.

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:43,000
As we will see, this trend of aging has many important consequences for public health.

27
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The shift is not only the result of a greater absolute number of older adults,

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
but also reflects the fact that the older adults represent a larger and growing proportion of the U.S. population.

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Along with this shift in the age distribution, there's also a shift toward greater racial and ethnic diversity.

30
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It is projected that a majority of the U.S. population will be nonwhite by the year 2050.

31
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
While the elderly population is projected to continue to grow rapidly over the next 40 years,

32
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
the number of children under 18 will change only slightly during the same period.

33
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It is projected that at about twenty thirty five, for the first time in history,

34
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:44,000
the number of adults 65 and older will exceed the number of children under 18, and that this gap will continue to widen.

35
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
As we will see, this dramatic shift in the age structure has many consequences,

36
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:01,000
particularly in regard to the major public health and social programs for the elderly.

37
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The dependency ratio is an important concept. The dependency ratio can be defined separately, but similarly for youth and for older adults.

38
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The youth dependency ratio is the number of people under age 18 divided by the number of working age adults, 18 to 64, then multiplied by 100.

39
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The old age dependency ratio is defined.

40
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Analogously, it is the number of people 65 and older, divided by the number of working age adults 18 to 64, then multiplied by 100.

41
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So, for example, we can see that in 1940 the old age dependency ratio was eleven.

42
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:56,000
In other words, there were only eleven adults, 65 and over for every one hundred working age adults age 18 to 64.

43
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
However, as can be seen, the old age dependency ratio has grown steadily.

44
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Currently, in 2020, it is 28 and it is projected to continue to increase to 41 by the year 2060.

45
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The point is that as the number of older adults has increased both in absolute numbers and as a proportion of the overall population,

46
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the number of working age adults has steadily declined relative to the number of older adults.

47
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The youth and old age dependency ratios are critical parameters,

48
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:43,000
since it is primarily the working age adults who pay the taxes that support the major social and public health programs such as Medicare,

49
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Medicaid and Social Security. And going forward, each older adult, for each older adult,

50
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:07,000
there will be fewer workers paying taxes to support the major social programs, which translates into significant fiscal problems.

51
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The population projections that are described on the preceding slides are based on a number of assumptions.

52
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Most critically, the projections assume two things. First, that the U.S. birth rate will continue to slow, as has been the case for decades.

53
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And so the rate of natural increase will also slow. And second,

54
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:38,000
the projections assume that the net international immigration to the U.S. will continue at the present rate over the coming decades with

55
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:47,000
these assumptions that can be seen that the net immigration has been and will continue to grow relative to the rate of natural increase.

56
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And in fact, by 2030, net immigration will exceed the rate of natural increase going forward.

57
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:05,000
As we saw on the preceding slide, the old age dependency ratio is projected to increase to historically high levels.

58
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Most immigrants are young and or working age and therefore contribute to the workforce.

59
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:22,000
In other words, the rate or number of immigrants allowed into the U.S. each year has a direct impact on the old age dependency ratio.

60
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If the future rate of immigration were to decline substantially below the present rate,

61
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
then the old age dependency ratio would increase even more than the projections shown on the previous slide,

62
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:45,000
which would exacerbate problems with major social programs.

63
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So why is the aging of the U.S. population an important public health issue, as we have seen,

64
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
the U.S. population is aging and the old age dependency ratio is increasing.

65
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The major health and social programs for the elderly, including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, are already expensive.

66
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
As we will see, older adults tend to have many more medical problems than younger people.

67
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
A key consequence of a greater disease burden is that annual average per capita health care costs for those over the age of

68
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:32,000
65 are roughly five times greater than for children under 18 and roughly three times greater than for working age adults.

69
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Further exacerbating these fiscal challenges is that health care spending usually

70
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
increases faster than the overall rate of inflation or the gross domestic product,

71
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
as we will see in subsequent segments of this lecture.

72
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The current pattern of financial support for the major health and social welfare programs is not sustainable.

73
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:10,526
So in summary, aging is very important, both from an individual perspective and from a population and public health perspective.
