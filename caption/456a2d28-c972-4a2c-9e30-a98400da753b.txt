1
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:09,360
Reasons for Inequalities.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,850
Let's turn our attention to why
inequalities in health exist.

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,190
Personal responsibility is
certainly a part of the answer.

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,670
But it is critical to understand that
the choices we make depend on what

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,110
is available to us and

6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:29,060
the historical circumstances that
situates us in contemporary life.

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:35,394
For example, why do people live
in impoverished neighborhoods?

8
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:41,074
The concept of health equity acknowledges
that it is difficult to be healthy without

9
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:46,676
having access to good jobs, housing,
schools, interpersonal relationships,

10
00:00:46,676 --> 00:00:52,120
neighborhoods, healthy foods,
supportive polices, etc.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,260
Differences in health equity
are systematic rather than random or

12
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,560
occasional.

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,430
Comparison between groups are required
to assess equity, while inequalities in

14
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,170
health results from a lack of access
to health promoting resources.

15
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,750
In 1990, Margaret Whitehead produced a
seminal report to provide a foundation for

16
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,160
understanding why
inequalities in health exist.

17
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:23,690
She identified reasons that were
avoidable and some that were unavoidable.

18
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:28,490
These classifications have become the
basis for clarifying what is unjust and

19
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,070
just when determining whether
inequalities in health exist.

20
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:37,240
Avoidable factors include income and
social status,

21
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,980
education, employment and
working conditions, social environments,

22
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:47,540
physical environments, healthy
child development, health services.

23
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:53,110
All factors that can be avoided or
changed to eliminate or

24
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,100
reduce their contributions
to health inequalities.

25
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:02,840
On the other hand, unavoidable factors
include biology and genetic factors,

26
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:09,510
sex, race or ethnicity, culture,
personal health practices.

27
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:18,340
Unavoidable factors are considered
impossible to change, alter, or avoid.

28
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,263
Some avoidable factors have received
extensive attention in the health

29
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:25,736
disparities literature,
such as home and work environments,

30
00:02:25,736 --> 00:02:30,100
access to healthcare, and
individual health behaviors.

31
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,890
The key with health behaviors

32
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,220
on the avoidable list is that
these behaviors are freely chosen.

33
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,340
What do I mean by that?

34
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,330
What are some examples?

35
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,730
Be prepared to discuss an example
of behaviors freely chosen versus

36
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:52,178
behaviors that are restricted.

37
00:02:52,178 --> 00:02:57,236
Measuring progress towards health
equity goals requires defining

38
00:02:57,236 --> 00:03:02,026
health equity to have clear
guidance of what is being assessed,

39
00:03:02,026 --> 00:03:08,670
including subgroups in definitions so
that which groups to compare is known.

40
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:17,490
Assessing the isms, that is racism,
sexism, classism, ageism, etc.

41
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:22,460
Determining appropriate comparison
groups for analysis or evaluation.

42
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:28,290
Identifying who decides what is unjust or
unfair.

43
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,240
Asking appropriate equity questions.

44
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:37,430
Not all questions are health equity
questions, do you know the difference?

45
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,720
Measuring progress toward reducing or
eliminating health disparities.

46
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,310
As you think about your work, consider
whose responsibility it is to address

47
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,920
health inequalities in this society and
at what level of influence.

48
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,370
Here is a frequently used
framework to address health

49
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,960
equity over multiple levels of influence.

50
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,813
Work in this area office involves multiple
levels of influence from the individual

51
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:09,183
through society, which includes policy
influences that are critical for

52
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:15,287
improving population health.

53
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:18,974
We will address different levels of
influence in more detail as the course

54
00:04:18,974 --> 00:04:20,680
progresses.

55
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,370
But consider how your work might benefit
from using a social ecological framework

56
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:31,160
that views individuals as embedded
within systems, influences

57
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,610
occurring at multiple levels, reciprocal
influences that may be helpful or

58
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:42,749
harmful, and the impact of
lifetime experiences on health.
