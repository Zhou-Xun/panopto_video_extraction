1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,755
Hi, I'm Carrie
Karvonen-Gutierrez,

2
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:09,360
and I'm a faculty member here in

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,445
the department of epidemiology.

4
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:14,175
Today, we're going to
talk about inflammation.

5
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:15,930
As a public health practitioner,

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,010
you may have heard a lot about

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,110
inflammation because it is known

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,460
as the culprit underlying

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,380
many of our age-related diseases,

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,140
which are of major importance
to public health.

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,650
Often, inflammation
is considered in

12
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,350
a negative way in
respect to our health,

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,360
but it is actually
a necessary part

14
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,655
of our body's defense
against injury,

15
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:37,540
pathogens, and other invaders.

16
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,460
In this module, we will
get an introduction to

17
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,430
the ways in which inflammation
keeps us healthy,

18
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,085
and learn the cardinal signs
of inflammation.

19
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:48,770
In later modules, we will
learn the differences

20
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,100
between acute and
chronic inflammation.

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,620
Inflammation is the body's local

22
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,440
vascular and cellular
response to injury.

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,435
The word inflammation comes from

24
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:01,400
the Latin word inflammare,

25
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,020
which means to ignite.

26
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,700
Keep this in mind as we think of

27
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,160
the cardinal signs
of inflammation.

28
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,830
Inflammation is
an adaptive response

29
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,455
to restore homeostasis
in the body.

30
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:16,129
When our body's homeostasis
is disrupted by injury,

31
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:18,595
pathogens, or other invaders,

32
00:01:18,595 --> 00:01:20,705
inflammation is the body's way to

33
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,835
signal the immune system to heal,

34
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:24,740
and repair damaged tissue,

35
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,025
and mount a defense
against those invaders.

36
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:31,265
Inflammation can be present
throughout our body,

37
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:33,379
and as part of
the normal response

38
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:35,555
following injury or infection,

39
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:37,625
it is a normal response.

40
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,165
For example, if you have a stye,

41
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:42,080
or an infection in
one of the glands

42
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,210
on your eyelid as
shown in this picture,

43
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,655
it will become red and painful.

44
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:48,860
This is due to inflammation.

45
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,170
Or perhaps, you injure
part of the gum in

46
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,305
your mouth by eating
something rough or sharp,

47
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:57,560
your gum line will feel
swollen and painful.

48
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,485
This too is due to inflammation.

49
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:04,040
Four of the cardinal signs
of inflammation were first

50
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,790
described in the first century
by a Roman medical writer.

51
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,890
Because of this, they've
been named using

52
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,605
Latin words including calor,

53
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:15,490
rubor, dolor, and tumor.

54
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,550
These words mean heat,

55
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,705
redness, pain, and swelling.

56
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:23,540
These cardinal signs
of inflammation are

57
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,060
due to the pathophysiologic
responsive

58
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,910
our body in response to injury or

59
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,810
invaders as part of
the inflammatory response.

60
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,860
As we learn about inflammation,

61
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,740
think back to
these cardinal signs to

62
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,720
understand how they occur.

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,190
What physically happens in

64
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,750
our body to lead to these signs?

65
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,170
In the 19th century,

66
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,990
a fifth cardinal sign of
inflammation was added,

67
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,775
the loss of function.

68
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:52,880
This loss of function results as

69
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,700
a consequence of
the other four signs,

70
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,605
particularly pain and swelling

71
00:02:57,605 --> 00:02:59,120
which limit movement and

72
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,730
thus inhibit our normal function.

73
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,600
Our body has many lines of
defense to keep us healthy.

74
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,375
Some of these defenses
are non-specific.

75
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,715
That means that they are
mounted in response to

76
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:13,295
any injury or any invader.

77
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:15,260
Our first and second lines of

78
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,170
defense in our body
are non-specific.

79
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,735
Other defenses are specific,

80
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:23,570
which means that they have
a tailored response which are

81
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,995
initiated when challenged
with a specific pathogen.

82
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:30,020
More information about
these specific responses

83
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,110
are included in
the module on immunity.

84
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,500
Let's start by taking a look at

85
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,855
the first line of defense.

86
00:03:37,855 --> 00:03:40,855
You can imagine how
our body is challenged with

87
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:42,940
all sorts of potential invaders

88
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,875
and injuries all of the time.

89
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,900
We come in contact with
many different surfaces,

90
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,325
we inhale air with
microparticles and pathogens,

91
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:52,720
and even when we walk,

92
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,675
we bump into something
which may cause us injury.

93
00:03:55,675 --> 00:03:58,300
Most of these encounters
in fact, however,

94
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,180
do not make us ill. We
encounter these exposures

95
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,655
all the time but remain
healthy. Why is that?

96
00:04:04,655 --> 00:04:08,440
Well, our body has a robust
first line of defense which

97
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,270
continually works to protect

98
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,790
us from the outside environment.

99
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,010
This first line of defense
includes our skin,

100
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,595
mucous membranes,
secretions, and hair.

101
00:04:19,595 --> 00:04:21,260
Let's think of an example of

102
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,645
how this first line
of defense works.

103
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:25,100
Think of a windy day,

104
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,900
when small particles including

105
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,795
dust and dirt are being
blown all around.

106
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:32,270
These dust and dirt
particles might get in

107
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,225
our eyes and cause
damage or an infection.

108
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:37,220
However, our body works to keep

109
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,680
those out of our eye
and keep us healthy.

110
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,200
Our eyes blink reflexes work to

111
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,740
keep dust and dirt
out of our body,

112
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,220
and even if they do
get near our eye,

113
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,490
our eyelashes work
to trap the dust

114
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,330
and dirt before they
get into our eye.

115
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,205
If they do get in,

116
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:56,960
we do have a tear response
then that can work to

117
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,885
cleanse the area and
remove the invader,

118
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:02,990
in this case, dust or
dirt from our body.

119
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,865
All of this is part of
the first line of defense.

120
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:08,710
Like the first line,

121
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,945
the second line of defense
is also non-specific,

122
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:15,560
meaning that it responds
to any injury or invader.

123
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,080
Unlike the first line
of defense, however,

124
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,370
which largely works to keep
invaders out of our body,

125
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,960
the second line of defense
is the way our body

126
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,005
responds once we have
already become injured,

127
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:29,900
or once an invader
has entered our body.

128
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,210
The inflammatory response is

129
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,535
included in the second
line of defense,

130
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,425
and it works to identify,

131
00:05:36,425 --> 00:05:40,280
engulf, and destroy
unwanted invaders to our body,

132
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,765
and to signal and repair

133
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:44,720
other systems to aid
in tissue repair.

134
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,870
We will learn more about
this process and how it is both

135
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,000
beneficial and detrimental for

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,285
our health throughout
this module.

137
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,100
In addition to initiating
tissue healing

138
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,320
and repair and
destroy an invaders,

139
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,020
the inflammatory response
plays a major role in

140
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,065
signaling for the third line
of defense in our body,

141
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:05,500
the specific immune response.

142
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,090
Inflammation is
the body's way of signaling

143
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,100
the immune system
which can further

144
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,350
help with tissue
healing and repair,

145
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,010
but can also mount a tailored
attack against invaders.

146
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,140
More information about
the ways in which

147
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,840
the immune system works
to keep us healthy in

148
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,825
both specific and
non-specific ways

149
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:26,905
is included in
the module on immunity.

150
00:06:26,905 --> 00:06:30,020
In this module, we
learned the inflammation

151
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,065
is part of our body's
normal, automatic,

152
00:06:33,065 --> 00:06:37,205
and non-specific response
to injury or an invader,

153
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:38,900
and that the five cardinal signs

154
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,745
of inflammation include heat,

155
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:45,235
redness, pain, swelling,
and loss-of-function.

156
00:06:45,235 --> 00:06:47,060
Inflammation is part of

157
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,680
the underlying physiology of

158
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,945
nearly all injuries and diseases.

159
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,460
I encourage you to think about

160
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,190
your own work and your own areas
of interests to see

161
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,350
how the inflammatory process is

162
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,786
relevant for
those health conditions.
