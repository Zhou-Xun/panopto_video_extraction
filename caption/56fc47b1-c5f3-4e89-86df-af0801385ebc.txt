1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:11,630
Okay. And then. Year the year before.

2
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:36,740
Which was about. You have?

3
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,690
Yeah. Very, very Reid.

4
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,940
But. Here is one of that.

5
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:20,870
That's. Yeah.

6
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,800
We know one of the reasons that.

7
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:39,240
Yeah. I don't want to have my father.

8
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,830
Thank you again and thank you.

9
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:58,550
And they are. The year.

10
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:17,030
One. I think.

11
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:28,630
But. I did it to distract you.

12
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:38,250
The. The former.

13
00:02:48,810 --> 00:03:00,740
Yeah. Okay.

14
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:10,580
I'll go ahead and get started. Welcome back. I hope the long weekend was helpful to help you recover after adjusting from the first week.

15
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,840
So welcome back and let's go ahead and get started.

16
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:25,160
I apologize again for the size of this room. I reached out to the registrar's office to get another room for rent for this time frame.

17
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,950
There's no other class that's available, so bear with us as we manage this safe space.

18
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,460
And I request additional chairs and tables, so we should be good.

19
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,390
In terms of seating, what changed would be those who are up front might have a little bit of a difficulty scene,

20
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,420
but I appreciate your patience with that.

21
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,940
So I would like to start with some announcements before we get started with the activities for today.

22
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:04,340
The answer key to the exercise from last week is now posted on campus is on the week one page.

23
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:10,580
If you go back to the schedule for last week and you scroll to the bottom of the page, you should be able to access the answer key.

24
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,950
If you have any questions regarding the answers we have, you want to follow up?

25
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,270
Come to office hours.

26
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:25,700
And if you are not available for the times that we are available for office hours, reach out and we will find a time to meet with you.

27
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,770
Also are recording the recording from last week's lecture.

28
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:40,850
It's been posted. I got an email just before class that somebody wasn't able to access it, so I'm going to check and see what's the issue with that.

29
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,200
Anybody else have a problem with? Maybe I should put it in a way that I might get a chance to access the video from last week.

30
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,790
Were you able to view it? Yeah. Okay. I'm not sure I should look into that.

31
00:04:53,330 --> 00:05:06,050
Thank you. And then in two weeks, the class that we're going to be having on the 20th, we will need to access us for the exercise.

32
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,710
So if we do not already have SAS installed on your computer,

33
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:18,380
I encourage you to try connecting the virtual sites where you have access to surf and you can use us from there to virtual sites.

34
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:26,800
It will be good to try before class time. So if you have any issues or any problems we can troubleshoot before class of 20.

35
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,560
If you have any questions, just reach out and we'll be happy to work with you.

36
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,840
Any questions about the. All right.

37
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,970
So plan for today. We will spend a couple of minutes looking at two questions from the exercise from last week.

38
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:52,750
There appears to have been some confusion, or at least the ones that most of you or some of you didn't get right.

39
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,640
We've covered those two questions were introduced by the statistics data.

40
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:10,020
And then we would work on an exercise using. So the first question from last week's exercise is question to me, sir,

41
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:21,120
appears that there must have been some confusion about the poverty status and family by family type by presence of children 18 and under.

42
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,800
So what we have in this table, we have the verbal ID.

43
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:34,650
And for those of you who decided to use the five year estimates, ranging from 2015 to 2019, we have the associated values.

44
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:43,290
And then for those who use the 2016 to 2025 year estimate for the American Community Survey, we have the values here.

45
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:52,920
So for this one, some of you entered the number and that was okay since they didn't specifically say percent.

46
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,639
But if you enter percent, that's fine. So check it.

47
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:03,840
If you are having some confusion about the answer, you've got all the steps you use to get to your answer.

48
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,930
Please reach out and we're happy to clarify that for you.

49
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,230
And then a second question. The question to if.

50
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,120
And the question I was asking,

51
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:28,680
how would you complete the task of having a study of 400 participants that you wanted to upload data to the year holder?

52
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,860
Of course, that's going to take a lot of time to do that. One address at a time.

53
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:42,690
So there is an option to do that or more. So that's a special format that you need to set your own following.

54
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,050
So it has to have the discrete number.

55
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,690
But the unit number, the street address, the city, the zip code is safe.

56
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,380
And then there are certain cell types, the septum.

57
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,280
And with that, you can upload up to 10,000 records.

58
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,510
Or if you reach the file limit of five megabytes.

59
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:12,300
So this makes it a whole lot easier if you're using a large data set and you have address information that you want to upload and get information for.

60
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:19,950
Additional information can be found at this link in case any of you may be interested in using these data.

61
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,690
Any questions about the two key questions?

62
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:30,460
And lastly. Okay.

63
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,580
So we are moving on. So a new topic for today us by the statistic data for health research.

64
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,740
So when you hear vital statistics, what do you think of that?

65
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,930
What what comes to mind? Birth control?

66
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:57,490
Yeah, birth and death. Previously, these data used to include marriages and divorces,

67
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:03,650
but they are now part of a different survey, which is the National Survey on Family Growth.

68
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,460
So this survey was collecting the information as well.

69
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:12,410
And then they were also collecting marriages and divorces.

70
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:20,320
Wonder the by the statistics category. So after June 1996, it was this continuous Soviet leader information.

71
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,250
It can be found in a national survey of.

72
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:34,570
So by this that this thing really means you have an accumulation of data on birth deaths and then also about death.

73
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:45,540
And we'll talk a little bit more about each driver. So you might be wondering who's actually going about collecting these data.

74
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:52,490
The data collected by the states. So the states have authority to collect the data so they decide which forms they use,

75
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,350
they decide what types of information, and they have authority over the entire collection process.

76
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:09,900
However, they are required after collecting the data to send the data to the CDC under the National Center for Health Statistics,

77
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,100
and it specifically for the National Vital Statistics System,

78
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,520
to collect the data and then disseminate the data to people who are interested in using these data.

79
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,740
So the states have authority to collect the data and what types of data to collect,

80
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:34,170
what federal law dictates that the data are then combined and then made available for people to use.

81
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:46,140
So if a birthdate as state law required as a birth certificate should be issued or completed for all nine births.

82
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,150
And when we think about birth certificates and birth data,

83
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:58,380
what types of information do you think we have collected, at least that we collect on the birth certificate?

84
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,100
Yeah. Please. Wait, wait.

85
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,700
Yes. You play soccer, Elizabeth? Yes.

86
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:15,719
Parents. Parents? Yes. All very important information.

87
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:22,470
But when you think about I don't know if any of you have resented taking a look at your birth certificate.

88
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,330
What types of information that you have on. I think.

89
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:38,850
ID, so information about the baby's name, but the information that we collect on.

90
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:46,660
So yes, collect the information that we collect or at least the information that we get on the form that we leave the hospital with is so limited.

91
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:57,820
So just a few variables on that form. Nothing compared to what actually collected for the process of through the process of being pregnant

92
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,980
because so many data collected during pregnancy and then some of them are collected at birth.

93
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:15,280
So compared to what you get as your official legal birth certificate, the actual data process is really expensive.

94
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:22,900
So I know this is hard to view. So I have additional slides with close up pictures.

95
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,960
This is the center which we collect data related to the process of giving birth.

96
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:40,330
So really, really intensive process. So like you mentioned, we collect information on the child's name, the time of birth information on the mother,

97
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,200
the father, and then also the person who is certifying the birth.

98
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:53,670
So really sensitive information that we collect. When you have a minute, take a look at your birth certificate and you'll see how different it is.

99
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,279
We also collect information on the mother's race.

100
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:05,830
And you will see when we go through the exercise today that we have so many data points that are available from the birth certificate.

101
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:15,680
Also, collect information on the father of the child. So additional information from medical and health information about the mother,

102
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:22,670
and then also information is provided on the mother's behavior and other activities.

103
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:28,040
So information is collected on cigaret smoking before and during pregnancy.

104
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,290
Any thoughts about this type of data being collected through a pregnancy?

105
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,950
How accurate do you think people are reporting accurately?

106
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:44,690
First of all, in general, cigaret smoking. What? I talks about how people will respond to this question or whether the smoking.

107
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,770
As I think. Yes.

108
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:07,340
Thank you. So sometimes that can be a tendency for people to report on a report that people are reporting that the smoke,

109
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,709
especially when they have a situation where maybe they have a diagnosis and it's

110
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,880
is easy tendency to blame the person for getting that particular condition,

111
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:27,410
especially if it's related to cigaret smoking. So imagine during pregnancy how accurate this data might be for somebody who's just had a baby and

112
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:33,350
you're asking about cigaret smoking or if the person just had a baby and a baby was born pre-term.

113
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,249
You know,

114
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:41,360
trying to get this information can sometimes be tricky because people will be reluctant to share because it's so easy to blame people for that.

115
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,980
But sometimes you are able to get some of these data from the medical records prior to delivery.

116
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,810
So with that, you have a better chance of having the data be a little more accurate.

117
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:01,670
But it's a mix. Some people you get information at delivery, other people you get information during the course of pregnancy.

118
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:10,630
Okay. So a sense of information about the the newborn and the animal.

119
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:21,640
The mother is doing pregnancy and then doing delivery and then anything later to the baby will be recorded on the birth certificate data.

120
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:31,100
Form. So a new form, which is the standard form that's used now, was developed in 2003.

121
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:37,220
Again, because these forms are under the purview of states.

122
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,370
Some states decided even after this form was generated in 2003,

123
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,710
they took their own time to decide whether they wanted to use these forms or they wanted to use forms.

124
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,560
What are the wanted to use forms that they had generated as individual states.

125
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:04,760
But we talk as we talked last week, there are benefits to having all data collection points using the same data,

126
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:10,130
because then you have issues where you have a variable that is on one form or for one state,

127
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,609
and then you have variables that may not be used for another state.

128
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,810
And then you have missing data.

129
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:28,120
So in terms of what completes the form sometimes is that the attending physician will complete the birth certificate form here at U of M.

130
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:34,370
I had this in my daughter's at the hospital here and usually is a medical clinic.

131
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:40,189
If you have a large hospital, you will have a clerk who will come by and collect additional information,

132
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:46,160
some of the information that you have from your prenatal visits and other information that will collect at birth.

133
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:56,210
And then you will have the attending physician who might check the form, assign it, and then make it then ready for sending to the state system.

134
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,660
But then there are births that are happening at home outside the hospital, and in that case,

135
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:11,270
the midwife or the attending person at that delivery will be the one responsible to complete the birth certificate and then follow that information.

136
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:20,930
Parents can also complete the information, and then suddenly, because of the legal implications for having a baby, what do they get?

137
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:29,850
Social Security information. So parents will then complete the necessary information so they can then follow with the county after.

138
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:45,120
Any questions? Similar to birth data for mortality data.

139
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,760
The states also are the ones are controlling the filing,

140
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:58,860
the completing of death certificates and require that death certificates be submitted

141
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,590
to the Office of Statistics within five days of death or discovery of a dead body.

142
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:10,110
So who completes the birth certificate? It can be a physician.

143
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:15,720
It can be the medical examiner or a coroner. Or it can be the funeral director.

144
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,610
So even though the funeral director can complete the death certificate,

145
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:29,400
medical certification will have to come from the physician at a hospital where the body was found or the medical examiner.

146
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:38,460
If a body was discovered, maybe somewhere in moves, the medical examiner will be the one to complete the medical certification.

147
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,320
And then if an event that were done will complete the remaining part of the exam.

148
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,350
So similar to birth certificate, the death certificate,

149
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:56,220
they have a standard form that states can use and to get into whether they want to use that form or not.

150
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,740
And we have links here if you want to just take a look at for.

151
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:13,270
So similar to some of the questions, some of the things that were discussed last week in terms of being similar across data collection points.

152
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:23,160
So we have the international classification of diseases where we use coding to classify the cause of death or these birth certificates I'm sorry,

153
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:31,990
death certificate forms that are completed. Again, as information becomes available.

154
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:39,460
There are always changes to these documents so that before there was the ICD nine and now the current version is the ICD ten.

155
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:45,730
So if you are looking at death and you are doing a study where you are looking at multiple years,

156
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:52,180
you might run into the situation where you have ICD codes that were generated using the

157
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,400
ten version and then you might also run into the eight version of the ninth version.

158
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:06,820
So you have to then be mindful and careful of how you analyze your data because you might have classifications that may have changed over time.

159
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:16,960
So you have to come up with some kind of strategy either to combine the data or somehow do your analysis by ICD coding.

160
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:28,270
So the Health Department will use software to translate the information and death certificate into ICD codes.

161
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:38,830
But for smaller states where maybe they will have such staff or maybe somebody specific to do this, those data points would be forwarded to and CHC.

162
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:44,530
And then there they will have mortality folders to assign appropriate codes for

163
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:51,120
certain cases that didn't meet the criteria to be automatically transferred to.

164
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,940
And then for fetal deaths, stigma also required a reporting of fetal deaths.

165
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:12,150
And this for some states as more for births, a death happening for too long gestation and in other states will report any fetus there.

166
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:22,530
So around 20 weeks is the cut off for those states that decides to report fetal deaths when they're over by just maybe for stillbirth.

167
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:30,780
And it's one two week period is interesting because that's around the time where potential for the fetus to survive outside of the wall.

168
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:39,180
So they're kind of classifying this as stillbirths compared to those births prior to 20 weeks of gestation.

169
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:44,340
But some states in this report for any period in gestation,

170
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:52,130
which is useful because sometimes you need data to understand what are some of the risk factors associated with early death.

171
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:59,040
So having these data can be useful for public health purposes and also for research purposes.

172
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:08,700
So there's also a standard form along with the standard birth certificate and the standard death certificate.

173
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,430
There's also a fetal death certificate that's available.

174
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,870
You can check that link if you want to. Just see what variables are collected.

175
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:26,540
So in terms of data sources, we will be using CDC water today.

176
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,890
So you see what information you can freely access.

177
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,520
And then there's the National Death Index.

178
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:41,360
This is a very useful resource. So sometimes we conduct cohort studies.

179
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,480
We know that homicide is going to be very expensive to conduct.

180
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:54,620
And imagine doing a study where you want to connect exposure with alcohol in an individual.

181
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:00,410
It's going to take a long time if you have a large cohort and you want to know the outcome among those individuals over time.

182
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:07,580
So for some studies, they collect the exposure information or the necessary information that you need.

183
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:17,059
What is a one time point or multiple time points? And then is that the follow up of those individual at a certain point and then they can link those

184
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:25,490
individuals in the National Death Index you can use if you have your participant's Social Security number,

185
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,700
you can use the National Death Index to see if those individuals died, what was the cause of death.

186
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:37,880
And then you can, you know, have exposure information when a person was alive.

187
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:43,570
And then you can get the outcome and get a sense of what was the factor leading to that person death.

188
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:51,000
So sometimes it can be a way to be cost effective and to be efficient in terms of how long you can follow individuals over time.

189
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,330
But as you know, all the studies can be.

190
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:06,490
And then if you are interested in using biostatistics data, the exercise that you're going to be doing today will be more aggregate data.

191
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:12,200
So you're going to be clicking here. And generating a table or a chair.

192
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:21,320
But if you are interested in analyzing the data, you can go and download individual level data as individual level,

193
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:28,580
but you don't have any unique idea associated with this. Well, you will have personal information to identify the individual.

194
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:35,300
So you can you half line data, age, race and a whole slew of information.

195
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:44,030
But you just won't have personally identifying information about those individuals compared to census data where you have aggregate data,

196
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,510
vital statistics. If the option is to use individual level D.

197
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:57,810
So some examples about the types of data you can use in biostatistics.

198
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:06,390
As I've explained, cohorts, major cohorts can ascertain that should a linkage with the National Death Index,

199
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:20,460
we can use the National Vital Statistics System to get important information about trends in births, deaths, particular trends within all births.

200
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:29,550
You can get all of this information based on the data we are collecting from birth certificates and leading causes of death can be one

201
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:39,120
key resource that report every year and we can see trends over time because these data collected on a yearly basis all year round.

202
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:50,630
Any question before I go into an example that I worked on for a conference earlier this year and a question.

203
00:25:52,370 --> 00:26:00,059
All right. So I use the imagine and that is that this data system and the data associated with that

204
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:07,820
just to look at a study comparing air pollution exposure and preterm birth in two cities.

205
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:14,240
So the two cities we use in other data and other and data from Detroit.

206
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:22,700
So the motivation for that study is that environmental pollution is evenly distributed by

207
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:30,680
location and race and may contribute to the burden of preterm birth among different groups.

208
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,600
So we evaluated the association between living in two cities,

209
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:42,980
so groups living in one city and then another group living in other city with different air pollution classifications.

210
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,290
And the percent of live births that were preterm among African-American.

211
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,520
So a little bit of background on Peter Berg. You know, just on television, everyone about preterm birth.

212
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:01,700
Preterm birth is defined as birth or parent before 37 weeks of gestation.

213
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:06,019
And you have categories within that definition.

214
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:14,720
You have extremely preterm, which will be before 28 weeks of gestation, very preterm between 28 and 32 weeks.

215
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:20,870
And in moderate to late preterm 30 to 2 thirds of just before 37 weeks of gestation.

216
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:34,730
Babies born extremely preterm, experienced adverse outcomes, mortality, severe morbidity, and then lifelong illness.

217
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:41,810
Chronic conditions associated with preterm birth. Preterm birth is a leading cause of perinatal mortality.

218
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:47,360
And to date, efforts aimed at prevention have not had a major impact.

219
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,170
So some studies have looked at nutritional factors.

220
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:55,430
Some studies have looked at antibiotics to treat infection.

221
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,180
For some of the studies that found some improvements.

222
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:05,810
Unfortunately, some of the studies, they found that those who were treated worse outcomes.

223
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:16,510
So so far, we haven't had any major intervention that's really played a major role on preterm birth.

224
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:25,759
And as I mentioned earlier, we had differences by race and location with Hispanic groups,

225
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:35,780
African-American groups, having some of the highest rates of preterm birth in certain locations.

226
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:46,610
And then beyond the infants, preterm birth is also associated with adult and child adverse health outcomes.

227
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,390
So you have maternal health concerns.

228
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,350
So people who have a preterm cha.

229
00:28:54,850 --> 00:29:00,440
All right. Usually associated with cardiovascular disease later on in life.

230
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:09,230
What's not clear so far is whether the cardiovascular disease could be a core current event for preterm birth or not.

231
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:14,840
But there's an association with those who eventually gave birth to preterm babies.

232
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:25,670
And then among the offspring, you also have increased risk of diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease.

233
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:33,980
And when that child that was born among the children that were born preterm, then that intergenerational risk,

234
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:43,310
meaning if a person was born preterm, therefore ought to have an increased risk of having a preterm child.

235
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:50,180
And so so the burden of preterm birth doesn't stop at birth, but it doesn't stop with the infant.

236
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:54,489
It continues on into adulthood and across generations.

237
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:59,500
So a huge public health burden. So just some numbers.

238
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,970
Preterm birth in the U.S. from 2007 to 2020.

239
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:09,700
We see that the rates seem to be fairly stable over time.

240
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:17,350
That's a lot of dip in the middle years from around 2010 to 2017.

241
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:26,320
But at the bottom, you have a year and then on the Y axis, you have the percent of preterm birth among all births in the U.S.

242
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:35,800
So here early preterm birth was defined as any birth happening prior to 37 weeks of gestation.

243
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:44,020
While late preterm birth was defined for this particular record between 34 and 36 weeks,

244
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:50,080
just before 37 weeks of gestation, the usual time of just stations around 40 weeks.

245
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:58,810
So you can see that with all the research and all the interventions that have happened over the years,

246
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:03,610
that preterm birth rates have not fallen down drastically.

247
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:11,770
With all the efforts and advances made in terms of studying and understanding some of the risk factors.

248
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,370
Now looking at our present work by race, looking at data from 2019 to 2020,

249
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:29,770
you can see for all races and all regions, you have the overall rate being ten three.

250
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:37,420
So that's 2019 and a 10.09% for 2021 non-Hispanic whites.

251
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:42,270
You have the rate being around 9% among Hispanic individuals.

252
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:48,429
You have the rate being around while closer to 10% among non-Hispanic blacks.

253
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:57,580
You see that the rate is higher, 14.4% from 1949 2019, and then also for 2020,

254
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,840
also for early pre term where you have a higher rate of more severe outcomes.

255
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:12,970
You also have higher rates of preterm birth among African-American individuals.

256
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,730
So as we can see, this is just by race.

257
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:25,090
And sometimes you can look at a data by location, you see a stark difference between the overall rates and the rates by race.

258
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:32,590
So we were interested. Okay, let's understand a little bit further.

259
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,860
We're seeing differences and we're looking at differences by race.

260
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,990
But let's see if there are other factors that play a role in this.

261
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,740
The Chinese, at least the results that we've seen.

262
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:54,280
Let's look at preterm birth rates among African-Americans, but in different locations, because we wanted to test the effect,

263
00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:02,410
or at least the association looking at the location aspects of being at risk of breaching that.

264
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:08,830
So we utilized data from the National Biostatistics System for the year 2004.

265
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:15,130
And because we have such a large dataset, it was a restricted data to singleton pregnancies.

266
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:21,430
And then on the other hand, we use air quality data from the US EPA,

267
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:28,980
and we conducted a two way comparison of preterm birth among African-American women in other and in Detroit.

268
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,290
We go into this,

269
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:44,979
we're already aware that the air quality will be better in others and in the air quality will be not as great as in other in other I'm sorry,

270
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,900
in Detroit. So we knew there would be differences with equality in the two cities,

271
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:57,010
but we wanted to use data to confirm what we'll be able to study with our hypothesis.

272
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:06,160
So we download that data from the U.S. EPA and then actually compared the data values between Innova and Detroit.

273
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:13,630
And then we use Chi Square Test to compare preterm birth rates by geographic location.

274
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:19,000
So for our results, we found that average PPM,

275
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:28,840
one of the air pollutants that we use Associated Air Quality Index, was different between in other and Detroit.

276
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:34,810
So we thought that would be the case. But we have data to back.

277
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,940
I will have lots of. So we have 47.5 in other.

278
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:48,790
And the standard deviation is 22.1 and is 66.8 for Metro Detroit, with the standard deviation being 24.9.

279
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:54,800
So. Okay.

280
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:03,640
So based on this, we classified Inaba as having low opium levels compared to the drugs.

281
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:16,300
So out of the 10,523 eligible births among African-American women, 10,361 occurred in Detroit and 162 occurred in.

282
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:26,110
We found that among African-American women in Detroit, we had a preterm birth rate, 17.6%,

283
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:34,450
which is even higher than the data showed showing Detroit in general compared to an average, which is 8%.

284
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:42,950
So the difference we found was statistically significant with a p value of 0.0010.

285
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:53,120
Interesting finding we were able to conclude that comparing the two cities that we found that they had significantly different

286
00:35:53,450 --> 00:36:02,210
air quality index and we found differences in the percent of preterm birth among African-American women in the two locations.

287
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:10,880
So with this, we are then able to make the point that there are differences not only in terms of biological risk,

288
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:16,100
but in terms of the environmental exposure that people are exposed to,

289
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:22,730
and then therefore having the potential to increase their risk for preterm birth or any other conditions.

290
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:36,350
So based on this example and what we've talked about with the census data, what we've talked about about the national biostatistics.

291
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:46,310
Data. Let's think a little bit about our AP trainee and think about what would be the advantages of primary data collection.

292
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:53,509
So meaning we're designing our study. The investigator wants to go in and investigate a particular research question.

293
00:36:53,510 --> 00:37:02,570
So in this case, preterm birth incidence, what would be the advantage of designing your study and going in and collecting data?

294
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:11,520
Yeah. So.

295
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,070
Yes, thank you. You can go eat and you can collect the information that you want.

296
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:26,800
It's actually what you need for your study statement, what you need to support to give you the data to evaluate your hypothesis.

297
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,340
Any other to. Yes.

298
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:37,190
So the way in which we asked them the question. Clear.

299
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:43,020
So how we ask the question, if you're doing a study, you want to make sure you're asking the question in a similar manner.

300
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:51,660
You don't want you say you most times in most studies you have a team that you train in the same way that you wanted to ask the question.

301
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:58,200
You don't want one person asking and then just checking off what the participant says.

302
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:02,970
And then the next person is asking, Are you sure? I can see myself behind.

303
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:08,590
You sure you don't want to change his answer in any different responses and

304
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:12,960
different prompting different experiences for the participants in the study?

305
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:17,110
So yes, you have a team you've trained and you've trained and exactly.

306
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:22,240
You want the data the way you want the questions asked and how you want your data collected.

307
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:31,060
Any other thoughts on this? Okay.

308
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:38,350
So I have some points here. Allows the investigator to collect specific data needed to answer the research question of interest.

309
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,820
Questions can be asked exactly as intended by the study protocol.

310
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:50,320
The investigator can select a population of interest. So we if we were interested in looking at more African-American women,

311
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:58,330
we can go and then say, we have a study where we are interviewing African-American women.

312
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,730
An investigator can set them up. An exclusion criteria specific for us.

313
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,190
However, limitations for primary data collection.

314
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:22,400
And it talks. Yes.

315
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:35,050
But yes, funding primary data collection can be very, very expensive, very costly.

316
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:40,780
So with primary data collection, you need to apply for funds, get funding,

317
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,980
and then a process of collecting data which can be costly and time consuming.

318
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:56,200
So the other limitation of my day here could be potential for a small sample size.

319
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:00,970
So you have funding to conduct a study. What kind of studies run for that to go up here?

320
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:05,830
And you need to be able to enroll participants in the study.

321
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:13,210
Sometimes you have a smaller number than anticipated individuals wanting to participate in your study.

322
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:19,300
And then the key factor, you need to be able to have a sufficient number of pre-term cases.

323
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,290
So that's also potentially a problem.

324
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:28,840
Not only that, you have a small sample size, but you might have an even smaller number of preterm births.

325
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:36,969
So it makes it a little bit difficult to analyze the data and very restrictive in terms of what are you able to look at,

326
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:52,020
subgroups or categories for your data? Now for the national virus that this big data set, we have strengths that start with the large sample size.

327
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:59,430
We had over 10,000 participants in our study. It's rare that you learn to be able to have that for our primary data collection.

328
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:08,920
So with the large sample size, we were able to exclude other participants and then focus only on African-American women.

329
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:16,810
The number and the data were readily available, so the study period was able to be a very short period of time.

330
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:23,019
Come up with your research question. You go to the website, download the data, run your analysis,

331
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:30,430
and you're able to write the purpose for which you studied the analysis, either for a conference or for a manuscript.

332
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,950
Now, for the publicly available data,

333
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:41,589
you have some limitations as you've come across in many aspects of the epidemiology

334
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:47,370
and data collection that use the annual p m level is still classified.

335
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:55,060
Each city has potential for misclassification because we use data for Ann Arbor as a whole.

336
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:01,420
So, you know, individuals can be any part of Ann Arbor and we're signing at the same time.

337
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:12,579
So we have this as a major limitation because we're not using specific air pollution exposure to individuals and because, again,

338
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:20,790
we're using data that are publicly available, some factors that we would prefer to be able to control for are just an analysis.

339
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:28,270
We were not able to do so. So we have large sample size, but some limitations in terms of specific.

340
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:35,130
Any question about the national biostatistics or this example?

341
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:50,860
Related to this that. So proportion biostatistics data that was very useful as we saw with the census data are a very

342
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:57,640
useful source of readily available data that can be used to evaluate a range of research questions.

343
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:05,210
They are also critical for informing policy and also providing information for policymakers

344
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:11,800
to make decisions about key health indicators that we talk about the leading causes of death.

345
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:22,030
That information is available on a yearly basis, so policymakers, public health practitioners can use that information.

346
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:30,220
So plan or the needs for getting states to plan, for the need for all local regions,

347
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:36,700
and to be able to make decisions about what to prioritize and then what other factors are going to move to the better.

348
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:45,170
Any questions? All right.

349
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:50,600
For next week, we will be looking at the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

350
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:59,790
It's usually referred to us and he will interview the final project and then group as time as would be enough time.

351
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:12,560
Now for the exercise today, you can visit this link or if you want to canvas and go to assignment and you will see the second assignment.

352
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:22,430
You can see just where you are and work with people at your group, within your group at that table, and then each group to upload a single document.

353
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:32,450
Again, primarily, we are asking you to upload the documents because we want to view it as the, you know, places where you may have gotten it wrong.

354
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,240
And then that gives me an opportunity to highlight those answers.

355
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:44,370
For our next section. Okay.

356
00:44:45,690 --> 00:45:04,950
Any questions? Let me know. Six 4540.

357
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:12,050
Yes. How would you set up a video?

358
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:19,860
From. I.
