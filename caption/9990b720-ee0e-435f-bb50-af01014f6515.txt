1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:22,320
I started an Alzheimer's on Thursday night and cost about 1 to 210 minutes to plan time accordingly.

2
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,250
So there are six questions in total quite different ways,

3
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:37,500
which are clearly part of the questions that you plan ahead accordingly and you can bring them a calculator.

4
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,390
You don't need any fancy calculators. The basic calculator will suffice.

5
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,580
Any sign of a calculator should be sufficient.

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,290
And so again, it's a closed book, but now it has.

7
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:06,560
Yes, you can. Yes. In class in this world, from 1 to 2, you know, she'll go off all the time because I can hear very clearly.

8
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,660
One the 250 over the same as the class.

9
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:21,070
And now the question about the exam. So all of.

10
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,230
Yes. Are there any submission formulas that will provided?

11
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:34,010
So if needed, you know, we will provide it in the exam if it's not provided.

12
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:41,110
Basically, that's something that we expect you to know. And so there's nothing that's unreasonable.

13
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:49,390
So if it's some common equation in quality, we will provide it.

14
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:56,110
Put it that way. Yes.

15
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,080
Lectures content on the exam. Again, exam covered the content of today's lecture.

16
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:11,770
Yes. Everything we do today, including today's lecture, is going to be our class that most of you show up today.

17
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,920
This also includes, in the meantime, performance and analysis.

18
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:25,780
Yes. And we ask questions during ask.

19
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,160
So we have started to work on the exam and both the instructors have to work on the exam.

20
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:42,940
So as far as we can tell, you know, we do spot any and all of the points in the exam.

21
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:49,209
So that's the best we can say. But if you still have questions, feel free to ask some questions.

22
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:59,800
We may be able to answer some questions and I'll be on time Thursday.

23
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,460
So one of my students Amna to well after the exam.

24
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,130
But again everything as you know has been planned.

25
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,920
So if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

26
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:20,170
And the other the other instructor will be able to answer the question if it's a reasonable question to be announced to everyone.

27
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:28,300
So any question about the matter, no luck.

28
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:35,860
And as far as I can tell, it's the it's a it's a reasonable exam.

29
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,860
It's not as you know, it's part of the ICRC code.

30
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,160
You know, it gives it to the to the science, which is good.

31
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:54,700
So I hope you all get grades. And so make sure that you review all the materials, all the homework questions, and then every single one of them.

32
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:01,270
All right. And also practice on your calculus, not only for the exam, but also for the rest of the semester.

33
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:10,360
As you have said, we start to use this calculus knowledge and also quality's kind of the relations

34
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,950
and we're going to need more of them in the second part of the semester.

35
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,420
Right now is definitely the time to review. I'll tell you.

36
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,910
All right. So let's continue on. Why are we have last last time?

37
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:31,670
So we ended up with this hypogeum like distribution last time.

38
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:39,500
The setup is is very familiar. So we have standards set up in the counting process.

39
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,450
Essentially you can think of a two by two table, right?

40
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,550
If you have any balls in total. Some balls are white.

41
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,230
Some balls are red in this earth. And in total there are.

42
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,690
And white balls are objects and balls, a total of minus out radicals.

43
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,470
It is you a sampling without replacement.

44
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,770
Random sampling without replacement.

45
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:17,370
Random sampling means each ball equal probability of being sample from this are if you do a sampling with small and balls.

46
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:31,260
Now what that means is you have an absolute minus small and remain in there after the sampling.

47
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,990
Right. And that's the basic setup.

48
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:45,240
So once you have this set up, the only and that's actually changing in this two by two table is one of these four entries.

49
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,860
As long as you can fix one of the entries. The remaining entries are going to be fixed.

50
00:05:50,580 --> 00:06:00,270
Right. Let's say it. You know, the first entry as our run of our namely the number of white balls in this small and samples.

51
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,420
Once you have a fixed light, all the remaining three cells are going to be fixed.

52
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:15,900
All right. So the only thing that's changing from one experiment to another is this one about ROI.

53
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:23,010
And from the previous knowledge, we know that this Y cannot take any numbers based on this setup.

54
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,880
This is the wrench for this random barrel.

55
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,670
The other words, this is a support for this novel. I can only take integer values in this support.

56
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:42,300
The smallest value is the maximum of zero and minus and minus M and the largest by that I can take is the minimum of an hour.

57
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:49,260
Take a look at our previous notes to see how we actually found this range.

58
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:56,910
All right. Now, this run of our boys is essentially a well defined enactment.

59
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,920
To do is to get a better understanding of the distribution for this roundabout.

60
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:11,219
And as the very first thing to quantify the distribution for this disagreement and how we can derive the PMS or this random variable,

61
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,350
the probability mass function, the other word or every value in this range.

62
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,770
What is the probability of the amount of alcohol taken in that particular body?

63
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,310
And that probability again is the own knowledge, right?

64
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:29,430
From the previous nodes. We can use the counting process to help us out with our probability.

65
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:40,440
In particular, if Y takes this small s in that range, the probability of Y for us is is transmission.

66
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:48,420
This ratio, the numerator is the number of ways that it got as wide and minus as radicals from the standpoint as the

67
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:56,309
denominator is just how many ways that it can sample this small and calculate those into the ratio.

68
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:04,860
That's the probability and that defines the path. And that line is as wrench in that support.

69
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:14,650
In that support, you got the options for p gamma hydrogen match, right?

70
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:22,470
Right now. Right. Any question about the definition of this friend of our arrival later on?

71
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:31,050
We'll see a couple of examples to say to say how we actually use this run of variables to help answer very important questions.

72
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:39,960
And I got a couple important points about the setup. One is that these three numbers are fixed, right?

73
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,810
These are considered as parameters for this distribution of this hyper dynamic distribution.

74
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:54,360
And another important point is that we need to notice the range of this round about.

75
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:02,390
And thirdly, we need to pay attention to how this random variable, how the sample is actually conducted.

76
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,350
It's a random sampling.

77
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:13,140
Without recording any violations of that sampling procedure, you won't get to run a variable dies the average unhappy distribution.

78
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,770
For example, you can think about random sampling with replacement.

79
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:27,300
You can also have a two by two a table, right? That Y is now going to be hydrogen magic.

80
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:36,750
Also, you can do a sample, you can do a sampling without replacement, but the random on white all the do not have equal probability of being selected.

81
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,680
Now, again, it's not a hodgepodge of natural distribution.

82
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:50,129
So it does it does it does have to satisfy all these constraints on our part to be alive.

83
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:56,600
I don't have a distribution. Any questions or moments.

84
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,640
All right. Now we know the PM out or this man unbearable.

85
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:05,420
The very next thing that we want to do is to get some summary statistics for this right available.

86
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,680
For example, we want to to different order of moments on this right about.

87
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:27,620
So what these hyper geometric we can learn from the case moment of this roundabout about directly using the trait that we have learned before.

88
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:39,440
But basically, if you want to calculate the expectation of y to the power of anywhere y follows a hyper metric distribution wise parameter.

89
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,140
And then you can write out the definition.

90
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:55,820
That's going to be what a summation of Y goes from the lower bound to the alphabet.

91
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,679
So in this two numbers, right, you know what the lower bound is, but it's a pretty dominant.

92
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:16,940
So I just thought it was I'll be a newbie to represent the lower bound that I'm proposed and Y to the K times, the piano value at Y.

93
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:23,720
That's just the definition. We want to evaluate the case moment for this right of this great roundabout.

94
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:30,680
Okay. And then the next step is to plug in the formulas and see whether we can simplify it.

95
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:43,060
It's going to be quite a. What is PM is and why.

96
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:52,500
And my shoes and my ass all over the shoes.

97
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:59,380
All right. So we can break it down to see whether we can simplify anything.

98
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,800
So this is about how. Why?

99
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,710
Okay. So that's what we have.

100
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:42,030
Once we break everything down. Right. So the next step is to figure out a way to simplify this calculation.

101
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,380
So what is your thought? How do we simplify it?

102
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,950
We have done many examples so far. Right.

103
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:54,660
So why would how would you simplify in the next step?

104
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:05,560
What is the starting point? So.

105
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:29,570
You want. But it is a factor away from the black and white ones.

106
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,980
Okay. Uh huh. Very good. Uh factorial these two terms.

107
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:47,050
Right. That's going to be our starting point. Because you have a Y in this case on our term, and also you have a Y factorial which both involved Y.

108
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,730
That would be the starting point.

109
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:57,790
If you cancel one Y in both the numerator and denominator, what you would have is now becomes a y to the power of k minus one.

110
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,140
Right. And the denominator becomes y minus one.

111
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:09,479
Minus Y factorial. And the rest.

112
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,110
Two terms. All right, good.

113
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:27,490
And what's coming next is now you can consider you start with the case after case after moment of this right now, instead of a case order turn.

114
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:38,470
Your data was like mine as well after. And you can somehow manipulate these terms to make it some piano for some other antivirals.

115
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:46,990
This is going to become, especially if it becomes the piano or another hyper geometric retroviral, you know,

116
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:55,600
that essentially base term wisdom, some of course, wisdom escalation is going to become a claim on this one on our moment.

117
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:06,400
All right. If we can somehow establish the equation or reduce the order by one, then you can use it iteratively.

118
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,180
You got all under a moment for this roundabout? That's the idea.

119
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:18,500
Okay, so it definitely involves some calculation to make sure that.

120
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,560
This term becomes the piano for another hour.

121
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:40,580
Magic distribution. So I just write out the you can do the calculation afterwards to say when I got it and the idea is exactly what I just said.

122
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:47,480
Right. You cancel. You cancel out a1y in the numerator and denominator to lower the order by one

123
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:53,600
constabulary's to be able to get a iterative formula of this case order and calculation.

124
00:15:54,770 --> 00:16:05,060
So after some calculation, you'll be able to say this is equal to and over and some x.

125
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:18,610
X plus one minus 1xxx is denoted as y minus one.

126
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:29,570
All right. If you do a change of variable by setting one minus one to be asked, then you have these equations, particular these acts.

127
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:47,960
From this piano you can see and also follows up our geometric distribution with parameter and minus one and one and minus one and minus one.

128
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:59,780
And I'll leave this metal part, a derivation from what we have to this final result to try it after class.

129
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:09,620
So what that means is you're going to have a small over outcome in the expectation of.

130
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:19,950
This came minus y our moment for this x plus one where this ax follows a hyper geometric parameter.

131
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,280
I'm minus one and minus one and Smollett minus one.

132
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:39,080
So I way you got to it's 4 to 5 can start from take one and gradually increase it to got to whatever order moments that you want.

133
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:48,109
Any question. Again.

134
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:54,050
I want you to work on this part. Okay. After class, it's not trivial, but it's not too complicated.

135
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,340
It's just a calculation. You know, a little bit terrible about that.

136
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:08,689
Two of this. One is how you cancel terms or how you deal with this constant in this second part, in this PML function.

137
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,200
And the second, pay special attention to the limit of the summation.

138
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:22,400
Make sure that this summation is missing from the lower bound to the upper bound for this particular type of chromatic distribution.

139
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:34,040
All right. Okay. So with that formula now, we can write out the expectation and the variance for the hyper geometric distribution very easily.

140
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:47,059
First of all, the expectation we know for y follow up are geometric and respect.

141
00:18:47,060 --> 00:19:04,490
atIon of y is equal to this and over the expectation of x minus one x plus one to the k minus one right says K is equal to one.

142
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,550
So this term is just the opposite of what that means.

143
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:15,500
In this first order moment, it's just that time small over time.

144
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:21,770
So theoretically apply the formula that we just got from the previous slide.

145
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:29,710
I think you are one. Essentially what's inside this expectation just goes away.

146
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,910
That's one. So you have this result, right?

147
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,900
And Baroness, we just need a second order moment.

148
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,580
Right? He just needs this expectation of y squared.

149
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:48,770
Once we have that, we can use the phone in our forbearance to get this final result.

150
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,980
And again, we apply this Einhorn's formula.

151
00:19:53,990 --> 00:20:03,080
We know it's about not why square is equal to and over and expectation of x plus one,

152
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:10,970
where this at all is geometric and minus one at minus one and minus one.

153
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:21,000
And if you're not in a position of formula for this, you have a general matching grant available that is.

154
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:29,460
Minus one. Minus one over minus one.

155
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:37,250
Plus what? All right.

156
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:46,200
Because we know the expectations from the first equation and just plug it in.

157
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:55,950
And that's what we have. And once you have this r e y squared, you just calculate the variance by doing.

158
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:09,460
It's about the final result expressed here.

159
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:21,330
Any questions so far? All right.

160
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,690
So if you look at this various term and the expectation term,

161
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:41,070
if we replace this an overhead by a new parameter P and recall that aam is the number of light balls and is the total number of calls.

162
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:48,750
The other words if we did our P to be the probability of drawing a light bulb from the earth.

163
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:58,140
Now you can say the original expectation now becomes small and times P right and the variance becomes a constant.

164
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,470
Times and times p times one minus P.

165
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:10,770
If you forgot about this constant term. Just think about the mean and the various.

166
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:19,440
What does that mean to. But binomial, okay.

167
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,170
Because binomial or unobservable. Indeed. Has that particular mean an apparent function?

168
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:32,550
Right. Or binomial was total number of trials and success rate p.

169
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:45,610
In this case, success means drawing a light bulb, then the medium for binomial rhinoviruses and times p and the variance is enhanced by one minus p.

170
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,260
So that actually give us some sense about what this geometric hyper geometric

171
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:59,080
distribution can approximate with some of these parameters go to infinity.

172
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:06,520
More specifically, if you consider a scenario where it's large and the total number of balls is

173
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:13,570
approaching infinity compared to the number of balls that you sample from the earth,

174
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:22,270
then this term, this constant capital minus small and abdomen minus one, is going to be approaching zero, approaching one.

175
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:32,840
In that case, this hyper geometric distribution actually is approaching a binomial distribution.

176
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:42,140
So before we actually formally prove that, you can think about why that's the case conceptually,

177
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:47,030
think about how the random variable is constructed in its hydrogen matching distribution.

178
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:52,580
You are sampling from this urn with many white balls and a many of radicals, right?

179
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:03,730
And if you do a sampling with total sample, total sample and small and balls, and why do we care about how many white balls are in those?

180
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:10,760
And balls, maybe you have an extremely large urn with many, many balls not sampling,

181
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:20,090
although you are doing it without replacement in our sample is large enough ways out without replacement doesn't really make a difference.

182
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:27,050
I assume that you have infinite balls in this urn.

183
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:34,910
Although you are doing sampling without replacement. A ray of light falls on a roundabout.

184
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,180
It doesn't really change by doing this small sample.

185
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:44,390
And then essentially this becomes a independent trial.

186
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,780
Every time you sample one balls from the arm and it required whether it's red or white.

187
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:55,000
It is why it was quite successful. If it's right, that's called failure.

188
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,110
Then at the end of this and sampling essentially what the random variable,

189
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:06,920
what is the perpetual metric when available is capturing is how many successes you have out of this trial.

190
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:12,490
That's exactly by how. That makes sense.

191
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:18,040
So that's why if you have capital and total number of balls approaching the entity,

192
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:26,350
the hybrid geometric random are is essentially approximate binomial distribution.

193
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:42,320
With this small end being the total number of trials and the racial are the proportion of white balls in this game to our success rate.

194
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:52,270
So that's why this happened. Geometry approximate binomial and goes to infinity.

195
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,640
So more rigorously we can we can prove it in a second.

196
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:06,220
But before that, let's just take a look at a example and see how this hyper geometry run of our distribution can be used in practice.

197
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:13,400
But consider an example where vaccines are manufactured in batches of size at work.

198
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:23,200
So before the vaccine is put on the market, we should do a quantity check.

199
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:32,260
So the way to do it is use sample and vials in all the vials are okay.

200
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:39,700
If nobody else are defective then we say the batch is accepted and a vial is defective.

201
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,070
We discard the entire batch.

202
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:54,790
So the question is, if you do this sampling, okay, what is the probability that the batch with actual defective vials is accepted?

203
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,650
All right. Is the question clear?

204
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:13,270
So you have a batch of sides and inside this batch capital and are indeed the facts and we don't know which.

205
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:21,610
And so you do a sampling of small vials to see whether you can tap or you can capture any defective item.

206
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:29,470
None of the while, as the technologies that you sample is defective, then you accept this batch.

207
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,980
So one of them comparability stuff, the batch.

208
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:45,810
If you think about this setup tomorrow, it has a hypothetical match with one of our first three questions that we should ask ourselves first.

209
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,800
What is our run of our role in order to answer this question?

210
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,370
How do we start? 1/2.

211
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:02,230
What is the distribution of one third? How do you translate this problem?

212
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,040
The probability of dispatch.

213
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:15,960
Being accepted using the rhinovirus, all that we just said.

214
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,940
Okay, so first question, how do we have this rent available?

215
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,120
What would be the of Marvel. I'll be interested in this problem.

216
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:41,530
You have an acceptance and are defective and you do a sampling of small emails.

217
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:46,150
Yes. The number of defective vials in your sample.

218
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:52,720
Very good. The number. How effective is.

219
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,940
She had to buy a gun and.

220
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:22,910
Samples. We can set lie to be the number of the effective virus in this and samples once we set it that way.

221
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:27,830
That's why you can say it actually follows a hyper geometric distribution.

222
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:35,440
Right. Think about this. Two by two, a table in total in the space you have and vaccines.

223
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:41,540
All right. So the one that are defective now.

224
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:45,740
Defective and that is defective minus.

225
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:56,150
That is not effective. And then you have a sample and not a sample smaller than a stamp called after one minus moment.

226
00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:05,630
Then it's not a sample. And we set the number of Y to be the number of the virus in this sample, in this samples.

227
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:14,030
That is exactly a hyper geometric distribution because it satisfy our set up.

228
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:24,700
And also it's a sampling without replacement. Random sampling without replacement follows that this hammer geometry with parameter and and

229
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:32,870
small and last question what is the probability of the batch is in fact it is accepted.

230
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:40,549
How do we expect that probability in terms of why that is declined?

231
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:44,950
What. What does it mean?

232
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:57,710
That the badge is accepted? Yeah.

233
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:10,409
Like those things are good. I got a zero. All right. That's exactly how we define a bad thing is accept it when you have no violence in this town.

234
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,610
Cause that is the fact factor. Which means why?

235
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:23,860
For a zero. Right. The probability of life on a zero is the probability that the bat is the fact that it's accepted.

236
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:37,420
And from what we have some previously in order to actually calculate the probability of y for a zero with given the top down and small.

237
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:44,770
There are only two steps, right? First, you need to check whether zero is in the support or not.

238
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:58,570
There is not even in the support. What designed by. And zero is not even a support.

239
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:06,540
Of this random variable with some prefixed value and small end.

240
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,120
What does that imply? Sample size is greater than a dozen.

241
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:18,170
Yes. So in terms of this question, depends on whether it's accepted or not.

242
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:25,130
What does that imply? Probabilities? Yes, the probability is zero.

243
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,390
Meaning you will always accept reject.

244
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:35,990
Right. If the probability accept, the accept probability is zero.

245
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:43,880
So you always reject. And if the zero is given the support, then you can use the panel to calculate this probability.

246
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:50,000
So that's a side note. Any question about this problem?

247
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,510
All right. So.

248
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:04,390
Yeah. So this goes back to what I just mentioned in terms of the limiting case.

249
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,639
If you happen to be very large compared to small and it makes sense to consider

250
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:17,830
approximating this probability by sampling ways replacement and if we are doing

251
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:25,209
something with replacement that it is exactly a binomial setup and or binomial we know

252
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:31,750
the piano is has a much simpler formula and the probability of accept the batch.

253
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,020
In other words, the random variable taken about a zero is just a one minus P for the paramount right?

254
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:46,690
P being the probability of the factors in this case Y minus P is a probability of not effective.

255
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:58,000
So that you can easily get this table right with different probability of effective and different sample size.

256
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:03,520
What is the probability? What is the approximate probability that the batch is accepted?

257
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,040
Not a transformation. It's a more familiar kind of show about the eliminate form of the hybrid.

258
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,250
Geometry is indeed a binomial. Binomial.

259
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:24,980
Yeah. And to show that, it just involves some mathematical derivations.

260
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:30,060
So I won't talk about all the details so you can review the materials after class.

261
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:35,340
Essentially, it's a lot of tricks of how you find recombine.

262
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:42,570
These are intrastate terms. We know for Aboriginal magic piano this is the expression.

263
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:59,730
Right. And what do we want to do is to let and it goes to infinity and over n to a constant P and it's simple and it's fixed.

264
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:11,890
So this is set up where you do this approximation we like and it goes to infinity over and goes to a constant P as small as being fixed.

265
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:19,210
But some of the terms will go away since the numerator and denominator are the same order.

266
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,920
And eventually,

267
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:30,580
once you get got is the PMT for the original hypothetical match and one of our ball is approximating the PM out of our binomial random variable.

268
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:40,720
So after the information I'll leave it to you to review and ask any question appropriate about ten office hours to carry.

269
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:51,820
All right, fine. But essentially it's just a bunch of, you know, taking the limit of the ratios if they are all the same order.

270
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:57,100
Then they go to some constant often. All right.

271
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:05,050
And previously, you also say that we have also talked about the limiting distribution for binomial is up us on distribution.

272
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,230
Now we have a full spectrum, right?

273
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:17,650
If you have if you start from a hyper geometric distribution and goes to infinity and goes to infinity and over goes to P,

274
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:21,430
then you've got to find out if you follow or not.

275
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:25,780
You are small and go to infinity and times p goes to a constant.

276
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:32,980
Now you've got a plus on distribution. So that's the whole spectrum of limiting distributions.

277
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:37,630
That's how this three families of distributions are connected.

278
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:44,100
Right. Is this derivation we have already seen before.

279
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,210
So as a summary, here is what I just said.

280
00:36:48,660 --> 00:37:00,800
Papa Joe Mandrake can approximating a binomial if you let this guy approach the limited and binomial to approximate a plus on if you like.

281
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:07,770
And he goes to a constant question.

282
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:24,170
Right. So that's all about the univariate discrete random variable before we move on to the continuous random variable.

283
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:34,930
I just want to also introduce one very commonly use multivariate this random variable which is an extension of the binomial run of our votes.

284
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:44,380
It's called the multinational distribution for the multinational distribution, as the name suggests, and contains multiple outcomes for each trial.

285
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:50,380
Binomial You have two possible outcomes success or failure.

286
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:58,660
If you care about the number of successes, that's about binomial, what if your trial have multiple outcome?

287
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:06,580
For example, consider a drug trial that has three outcomes failure, partial success and success.

288
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:14,140
And he only care about the number of PDA or the number of partial success or number of success.

289
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:22,620
If you care about each one of those numbers, there's no longer univariate roundabout.

290
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:29,910
You need multiple random barrels to capture those three separate counts.

291
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:31,960
All right.

292
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:46,690
And those three separate towns are not independent in the sense that if you conduct trials, you know, this 119293 has to satisfy any equation.

293
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:52,800
That is why one plus why two plus why three must be equal to what?

294
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,479
The total number of trucks I called.

295
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,860
That's the only three horsepower all comes. So that's the setup.

296
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:08,380
The joint distribution for this one one third way. It's called a multinational distribution.

297
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:13,540
In particular, to assume the probability of failure is P one.

298
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,340
The probability of partial success is P2. Probability of success is three.

299
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:26,620
These three numbers has to add up to one. Right? Because again, those are the only three outcomes for each file.

300
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:32,590
If you conduct the trial size and you can have three numbers.

301
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:38,590
Number of BDA, number of successes and number of successes which add up to two.

302
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:46,959
And so the probability Kiana for this multivariate random variable or run them back to her.

303
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:54,810
y1yy3 has the following P.A. That is the probability of y one taking my name as one y to take advantage of

304
00:39:54,820 --> 00:40:07,510
3y3 taking value and three as this phone number and factorial over as one contrast to factor three factorial.

305
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:11,710
He wanted to ask one p to the two to that's to P three to that three.

306
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:17,890
So that's the probability of y y for us one all the way to y.

307
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:25,030
And in fact, we know how to calculate this right from our iconic process.

308
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:33,120
If you conduct in trials as one of them is very ah as two of them as part of success of three of them is success.

309
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,850
How many different ways that you can arrange that outcome?

310
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:43,960
That's what we call the semi-auto arranged sampling problem, right?

311
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:50,380
Think about the range of apples, bananas and oranges on the table.

312
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,950
Right. All of these fruits are identical.

313
00:40:55,270 --> 00:41:07,110
All the apples are identical. All the bananas on. In how many different ways that orange three apples or bananas are is now.

314
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:20,620
I gave you a count starting from right in total out of this and trials all possible outcome is all different ways to compute.

315
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:28,150
The result is um factorial and all of different ways to promote this success.

316
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:35,040
Partial success that there is then factorial divided by as one factor as to factor a

317
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:40,750
three factor because success as are all the same part of successes are all the same,

318
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:46,270
failures are the same, and the probability for having as one success,

319
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:55,660
as one failure as to partial success at three success if this class start at p12, that's one key to the just to keep grasping.

320
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:04,680
So if you multiply both you got the final probability by all that was a PR right about.

321
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:13,470
So that's the multinational distribution.

322
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:22,799
And the multinational distribution can be considered as a generalization of the binomial in the sense that if you only

323
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:30,420
have two categories based piano and this set up essentially reduces to the binomial that I we have just learned.

324
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:35,980
If you just have two outcomes success and failure, right?

325
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:47,490
Then essentially what you have as the PMS is you only have factorial over ask one contrast to factorial times p12 that's 1 to 2.

326
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:57,270
That's two and more specific. And moreover, you have as one plus as two equal to had P one plus P two equal to one.

327
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:04,290
All right, if you replace this P two an asked to buy and minus has one and one minus P one.

328
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:08,130
That's exactly the pmt or binomial that we have learned.

329
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:14,940
So that's how this all reduces. How reduce to the binomial case.

330
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:18,600
We only have two possible outcomes, right?

331
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,330
This multinational can be extended to more than two classes.

332
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,380
And here I just showed you the example with three classes.

333
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:34,820
You can also do it for four classes, five classes and a number of classes.

334
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:41,090
The general pump is given here.

335
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:47,730
If you have classes, the probability of one taking, that's one way to take the test.

336
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:53,330
Two. So on. So far as this expression.

337
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:01,150
And the sum of the size is equal and the sum appears equal to one.

338
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:18,530
All right. And you question the you won't need this distribution when you learn multinational logistic regression, I believe, in the next semester.

339
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:27,620
So that's the distribution that I'm going to need for modeling multi multi-category data.

340
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:35,480
And regardless of whether it's taught in or not, we just want to introduce the definition.

341
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:46,080
Any question. Okay.

342
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,430
So that's all for the disagreement on variables.

343
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,760
Let's continue to the continuous rhinovirus.

344
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:02,100
So first, take a look at the simplest continuous random variable,

345
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:07,350
which is the uniform distribution, very similar to the uniform discrete random variable.

346
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:11,380
A uniform continuous random variable just means the following.

347
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,880
If Y is a uniform run a variable.

348
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:31,080
On this support A to B and just means this random dribble can take anybody with equal probability of this interval from A to B is continuous.

349
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,730
The probability of the right amount will take. Any particular value is always zero.

350
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:44,340
All right. So we can only talk about the price or the probability of the random variable taking values in a small interval.

351
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,750
So say it has equal probability of taking antibody or taking no matter any.

352
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:56,040
Same lens intervals. But here the PDA is a constant function.

353
00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:11,100
At this interval has left B minus A, the PDA as the expression not one over B minus eight or a wide range of equal to a smaller quantity of a,

354
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:18,750
smaller equal to B and sometimes continue doesn't really matter whether it's contained E or not.

355
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:24,540
Okay. You can also say Y is greater than a lesser B, depending on what you mean.

356
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:32,250
It doesn't really change anything fundamentally. So what this PMF looks like, is this a constant?

357
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:40,980
B is its constant and the height of this PDA.

358
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:49,450
It's one over by mindset and I take that particular value because the Bay Area under this

359
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:59,390
area has to be equal to what the integration of this PDA in the real space has to be.

360
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,960
That's why the PDA takes about it was one over minus.

361
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:15,530
So that's how we define a distribution for a uniform, this uniform around a barrel.

362
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:23,839
And once we have this PDF, we can also calculate the CDO by doing the integration from that entity to anybody.

363
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:31,220
Y in particular, your y the y that I want to evaluate is last night.

364
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:35,090
The CDF is what always going to be zero, right?

365
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:40,160
Y is greater than B, it's always going to be a one only.

366
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:45,170
Now there are now one interval is from A to B, and in that case,

367
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:52,010
you are just integrating this constant function from A to what that gave you this quantity?

368
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:56,870
Y minus eight over B minus eight. So that's the CDF function.

369
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:11,390
You draw it. That's a zero everywhere start be a linear function going to reach one.

370
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:26,040
But that's what is the clear function of integration of this constant function in our function.

371
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:34,450
A useful moment for this uniform around available.

372
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:41,330
First of all, the expectation we can calculate the expectations is follow the definition by doing the integration.

373
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:57,520
And so the occasional blue line is the integrated the support of this, right available from A to B, Y times one over B minus a, d, y, right.

374
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,260
That's the definition of the expectation.

375
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:16,340
And if you do the integration, you got two times B minus a Y squared evaluated from A to B and I just give you a plus be over two.

376
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:24,170
And conceptually, that also makes sense, right? Since you are rhinovirus, I'll take equal probability on this entire space.

377
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:34,400
A to B the average should be the middle of this interval is eight plus B over to A Similarly,

378
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:40,490
the variance we can proceed by first calculating t e y square,

379
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:57,200
which again is the integration of y squared over b minus eight in y is give you three times four, you might say y cube A to B, right.

380
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:01,820
And you can calculate what that is and then use the phone that our.

381
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,380
The clear, the final expression for the veterans.

382
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:22,740
And once you do the calculation, you will find that the variance of this uniform random our boys B minus A squared over 12.

383
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:28,070
And. Any questions?

384
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,940
All right. So let's take a short break and come back to.

385
00:50:51,180 --> 00:51:16,200
They are not allowed to have, you know, these things that you know.

386
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:37,860
So I think that I don't know how to get people to be a lawyer or anything else.

387
00:51:40,500 --> 00:52:01,540
And so, I mean, so far, it's not sufficient to get to the heart of what you're using your mouth.

388
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:14,970
The city of Los Angeles, you know.

389
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:21,410
Yeah. So this is important to raise that difference.

390
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:28,260
So that's what I have got to do it.

391
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:35,100
But it's it's important that we have children this way.

392
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:58,890
It's not the same as what we we doing on the hard yards and 800 miles of fence.

393
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:21,299
Yeah. So that's why we, you know, no matter what.

394
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:31,550
You know what I mean?

395
00:53:34,830 --> 00:54:25,170
So what, are you still talking and trying to improve even if you have to use as much on your smartphone or something?

396
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:45,580
We try to think about what we should. You know, how we are trying to help, you know?

397
00:54:46,050 --> 00:55:28,130
Well, you know, you know, even for that quantity, I'm not sure how to respond to some of the best people.

398
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:45,810
I know how to do this now.

399
00:55:48,790 --> 00:56:41,690
And she wasn't you know, I don't think I'd have to give up is not defined by all that, is for sure.

400
00:56:53,640 --> 00:57:04,450
You know, when you travel with my mom.

401
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:23,210
Oh, yeah. That's not true.

402
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:28,910
She's not even close.

403
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:41,470
How's your writing? Probably not because of the change of not being in this country.

404
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:56,130
I spent the last year of an accident in France.

405
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:05,419
And it's why. What's going on all day.

406
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:15,850
And sure enough, I was able to reach out to everything.

407
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:29,450
But even our opportunity to show lactation that's talking about the same small space.

408
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:53,480
So it's basically how you sample, how much you like, to my knowledge, and why am I here?

409
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:07,460
So that means. Oh, here we go.

410
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:12,620
Now, you see, if you haven't considered, you want to, you don't need zero toys.

411
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:23,780
Five, eight, just something different.

412
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:46,550
You can write it that way. I just. I just hadn't seen it other than basically without myself and without the usual.

413
00:59:50,490 --> 01:00:00,890
Literally, I was forced to.

414
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:07,220
Which one is the hybrid company? And why are we making it into this?

415
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:13,470
Pretty much. Just make it into three terms.

416
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:26,870
Yes. Only rewrite this part, which is I want my as while rewriting sometimes.

417
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:34,680
Although it's a collective regret that you are so bad.

418
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:40,130
So. So say that. Say that again. At minus, minus one minus.

419
01:00:41,300 --> 01:01:00,980
Oh. Okay. So you guys action, actually. You would write this as an minus one -1% situation, which will occur on the negative side.

420
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:11,600
Yeah, that's just that's not true.

421
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:17,890
I just have no intuition, so. Yeah, it's not working.

422
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:29,570
All right, so let's continue your remarks or the uniform distribution.

423
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:36,280
Uniform mix tends to be, in this case, the idea of equal likely outcome.

424
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:45,709
Again, as I mentioned, you're equally likely is in the process, are not talking about the probability of the random variable.

425
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:50,540
Take any particular values because that's always equal to zero, right?

426
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:57,170
So when we talk about equal, equally equally likely, it would mean is small intervals of equal length,

427
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:02,660
the random marble taking that interval and another interval with the same lines going to have

428
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:10,310
the equal status right about what we can only define now there zero probably a small dose.

429
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:23,990
And another very important and very simple relation is that a uniform random variable can be bleeding,

430
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,330
are transformed from a uniform red available from zero to what?

431
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:35,820
That's why in most software we generate a uniform run of numbers.

432
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:40,020
It's almost always from the interval 0 to 1 by default,

433
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:47,490
because you can easily multiply a number and add another number to make it a uniform in another animal.

434
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:53,999
You just rescale and shift that you know that right?

435
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:05,760
Available to make a uniform translatable. This constant you multiplied to this random variable is the new length of the interval.

436
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:14,250
All right, you start from the lens y interval. If you want to go to a, let's say 50 interval, you multiply it by 50.

437
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:17,760
You multiply the original undesirable by 50.

438
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:26,370
And then you do the corresponding shift to go from the original starting point zero to some other starting point.

439
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:35,370
So all you need to do to get to another uniform is to do this rescaling and the shifting.

440
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:41,010
Similarly, if you are starting with a uniform and B,

441
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:47,700
you can always do the reverse linear transformation to get it back to the original zero to why interval?

442
01:03:49,920 --> 01:04:01,380
And finally, this is useful for modeling things like individual and riding estimation into our study or anything that,

443
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:09,540
you know, occur randomly over time. So that's why it's a it's a very useful distribution.

444
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:17,940
Okay. And previously, we also know that if you are dealing with a uniform run overall,

445
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:27,150
you can also take advantage of this inverse CDF transformation to get to any random variable with any distribution.

446
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:32,100
And if you know the distribution is via distribution, I'll be right about why you do this.

447
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,150
You see the transformation recall.

448
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:40,230
Make sure you check your previous notice on the change of variable.

449
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:48,540
Now let's take a look at this example and see how we can use uniform random variable to help us answer this question.

450
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:52,560
Again, three steps. First, if by a random Powerball.

451
01:04:52,710 --> 01:05:01,110
Second, find the distribution. Third, translate the original problem into a problem in terms of your run.

452
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:08,490
Suppose during the rush hour process leave with every 10 minutes starting at 7 a.m.

453
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:14,790
Suppose you arrive at the bus stop according to a uniform distribution between seven and 730.

454
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:18,930
What's the probability that you have to wait more than 5 minutes?

455
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:22,680
What about the probability of way more than 2 minutes?

456
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:28,210
I'll give you a couple minutes, cause if you want to. And.

457
01:05:30,170 --> 01:06:17,790
I want to answer this three questions. What?

458
01:06:51,130 --> 01:07:26,520
Yeah. So first question, how do we set up the run America?

459
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:37,460
I thought when we set up the renovation, but we need to consider two things.

460
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:40,730
First, it should help us address this question.

461
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:46,849
Right? Second, you should have a you should have a easy way to define the distribution for this right.

462
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:50,929
About this case.

463
01:07:50,930 --> 01:08:05,690
How do we set up the right environment? It's like prostitution.

464
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:15,070
Very good. A time you arrive at the bus station or more convenient later, we can set it as the time.

465
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:20,710
Fast seven. I'll be your rival.

466
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:36,360
Okay. In other words, if you arrive at 75 with an ax, eight five, zero seven and 21, we do not ask to be quite what height,

467
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:43,410
but the number of minutes after seven, I'll be all right with nine if it's not to be that.

468
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:48,490
What is the distribution of US? Uniform, right.

469
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:56,479
And what is the range for that uniform? It's a lower bound.

470
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:08,140
Yes. Zero 230 zero 430. Very good, because we know that you arrive at the bus stop, only a uniform distribution to between seven and 730.

471
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:11,790
If you arrive at seven, that means access four zero.

472
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:18,930
If you arrive at 730, actually quarter 30, and it can take anywhere between zero and 30.

473
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:24,960
Okay. Now, this question, actually, the tricky part is the last one.

474
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:29,220
How do you translate the wait time is greater than 5 minutes.

475
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:42,500
In terms of these random, arbitrary, justified. What does it mean?

476
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:50,630
That you have to wait more than 5 minutes? Yes.

477
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:58,400
It means that our arrival time is more than 5 minutes or the next.

478
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:04,040
Right. Very good. It's arriving more than 5 minutes before the next bus arrive.

479
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:10,160
All right. And has to be after the previous pass has arrived.

480
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:18,250
I slept. So in this interval, if you draw it right, the boss will arrive at base.

481
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:25,750
You know, at this time, once, if you arrive somewhere, if you follow economy up,

482
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:31,360
if you arrive in this interval, then you have to wait more than 5 minutes.

483
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:36,790
All right. Similarly, if you arrive in this interval, you also have to wait another 5 minutes.

484
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:46,150
Similarly here that I just gave you three intervals of arrival where you have to write and where you have to wait more 5 minutes.

485
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:51,490
And if you translating enhance, that's going to be at school close to the interval.

486
01:10:51,970 --> 01:10:57,880
0 to 5 you and 10 to 15.

487
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:01,750
Union 20 to 25.

488
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:13,590
All right. And finally, just to calculate, the probability of ax belongs to this the union of the three of us who are doing immigration.

489
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:18,700
Okay. So this is a uniform. Essentially, it's a summation of this interview.

490
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:25,110
Let's divide it by the total length of this before you do the immigration,

491
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:31,710
or you can theoretically calculate the ratio between the general and the partizans.

492
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:36,360
That's going to be one over two. Either way, it got the same result.

493
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:41,300
And similarly, you can think about how to express this way.

494
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:46,020
We're all equal to 2 minutes in terms of this random variable that we just defined.

495
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:50,640
I'll leave it to you. Okay. All right. Any questions about this?

496
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,870
So that's one way to do it. Alternatively, we can also do a change of variable.

497
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:04,020
And from this original random variable x, we can define.

498
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:10,950
You write about the legend of a random variable, a function of this random variable W, X or F of x,

499
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:35,640
whatever notation that I want to use to be an minus tea party commands to 0 to 1020 minus t 32, 20 and 30 minus T 40 allowance to 20 to 30.

500
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:49,660
If we define new random variable, basically, what does this type of T represent w of x to us?

501
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:02,390
What is the max represent? If I define it this way.

502
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:14,290
Are you good? Someone say the wedding, right? That's exactly the actual waiting time for you.

503
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:25,180
Because if your actual arrival time is from 0 to 10, you have to wait 10 minutes, whatever that actually is.

504
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:32,590
If you arrive at seven one actually or one, you have to wait at minus one for 9 minutes and so on and so forth.

505
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:36,220
All right. So this study of ants is exactly in the waiting time.

506
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:46,330
And further this way in time, we kind of derive the distribution by these waiting times using what we have learned, the change out parallel.

507
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:50,260
And you will find that this waiting time also follows a uniform distribution.

508
01:13:52,750 --> 01:14:03,220
And the waiting time is always have a support from 0 to 10 and has a uniform distribution on that support exactly right afterwards.

509
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:11,380
And now this problem of waiting, right? Only 4 to 5 minutes becomes the probability of w x greater equal to five.

510
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:20,530
Any conjointly. Right. All the probability. Right. That's five over ten or one over two and w over 9.2.

511
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:26,470
Two is just that what, eight over ten or over five?

512
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:34,310
That's another way. So you can be very flexible in terms of how you define the random variable.

513
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:45,040
You can define y run a variable that gave you easy representation of what was presented in the question and also easy to to draw the distribution.

514
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:51,430
And then you can do a further transformation of that around available so that it can have an easy characterization of the final problem.

515
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:59,350
You don't have to stick to just a y random variable from start to right and do some change of variable along the way.

516
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:06,370
Can you say what is the W of x? W all that is a change of variable you define a function of.

517
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:10,570
So what does it represent to represent the actual waiting time? Okay.

518
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:16,540
The questions. All right.

519
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:21,620
Okay. So that's the uniform distribution. Nice one.

520
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:32,630
Normal distribution. Probably the most important distribution in statistics is first introduced in the 1733 as a approximation to the binomial.

521
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:37,400
Later on, people find that it not only is not only just any distribution,

522
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:47,390
it is a very important distribution that matters or actually capture a lot of scenarios in practice.

523
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:54,740
For example, if you measure the paternal quantity or the error of a particular process,

524
01:15:55,460 --> 01:16:00,650
if you're doing large enough times, you always have this L-shaped distribution.

525
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:13,310
And that distribution actually is the normal distribution. And it is also part of this central limit zero, meaning if for any random variable.

526
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:25,920
If you calculate the distance between the running variable and its population means if you do it for numerous if you if you if you got

527
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:34,070
the distribution for that distance from particular random variable and its population mean that always follows a normal distribution.

528
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:39,140
And that's called the central limit theorem, which we will learn later in the semester.

529
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:51,230
So before so let's, let's take a look at the actual formula or distribution definition of what is a normal distribution.

530
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:56,440
First of all, the support for normal is the real space, okay?

531
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,440
And the normal distribution is defined by two parameters.

532
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:06,530
What is MU? One is Sigma Square in particular MU is the mean, which we'll see in a second.

533
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:11,690
And Sigma Square is the variance with MU and sigma squared.

534
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:14,040
The distribution is fully defined with PDA.

535
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:24,080
Having this Formula one over square out to pi sigma times E to the negative minus new square over to Sigma Square.

536
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:40,750
Although these novel PDA is a formula that you is something that we would everyone we would assume out of everyone to memorize by heart.

537
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:49,960
So this is the time that you definitely want to memorize your own back.

538
01:17:50,590 --> 01:18:01,240
So because it's just so important that you can see the normal distribution everywhere and you're going to use it everywhere if you want it.

539
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:05,500
Want to do a statistics in particular. If MU is equal to zero,

540
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:11,110
Sigma Square is equal to one that's referred to as the standard normal distribution

541
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:22,000
and that has a pdf of one over square two pi e to the negative two by square.

542
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:28,990
That's the price for a certain normal distribution.

543
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:32,780
If you draw. That's your parachute.

544
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:47,160
So the support is on the real space. So you are to show that this is the period.

545
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:49,350
I'm sure it's not very trivial.

546
01:18:50,010 --> 01:19:00,749
You need to show that the integration is equal to what's on the real space and that we're going to show that in a second.

547
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:03,780
But that's actually not a trivial matter to show.

548
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:11,220
It's not very straightforward because you cannot easily write out the original function for this PDA.

549
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:17,640
So the direct integration is not is not readily obtainable.

550
01:19:18,030 --> 01:19:21,570
You have to use some tricks to change the roundabout or change the variable.

551
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:26,190
But. You can just take my words.

552
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:28,530
Found out this is a valid PDF.

553
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:38,520
So anyways, to end and the CTA, although it's a very famous distribution very commonly used, it does not have a close form city.

554
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:47,340
In other words, kind of due to the fact that it doesn't have a closed form or original function,

555
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:55,650
but people still use the PDA a lot in practice and we use the notation this thing acts

556
01:19:56,160 --> 01:20:01,950
to represent the PDA or the standing of the CTA or to the center of the distribution.

557
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:14,970
And it like follows that a novel, which means zero and parents want this PDF or any value else is defined as the specs.

558
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:23,620
And this fire actually you can refer to the table talk at the bottom.

559
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:34,930
Most textbooks would have a table telling you for each variable that's what is the CDF is for this set of normal distribution so that we also

560
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:47,200
we do not have a column form because he's only got the city up values by any given tax or any given cut to start a normal is symmetric.

561
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:53,830
So we also have these relations recall that it's not a normal pre outlook like this.

562
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:14,940
So this is the zero. If this is your house and the area of this [INAUDIBLE] in area is what?

563
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:24,390
All right. If this is a stunt at all, one thing that you can notice is that this is an active.

564
01:21:26,330 --> 01:21:29,880
This area also have the aerial fire.

565
01:21:31,130 --> 01:21:36,000
So if you want to know. Our.

566
01:21:50,670 --> 01:22:02,890
If you want to know the red area, which is not banks are in this notation by ActiveX.

567
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:09,030
Right. That is what one minus is forex.

568
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:15,210
So that's why we always have these relation on a standard normal distribution because of this,

569
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:20,780
because of a symmetry and trade for any symmetric distribution around the zero.

570
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:32,709
You always have this relation for CBA. As for the novel distribution, the man, as I said, is new.

571
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:36,790
The variance is Sigma Square. Again, these are not trivial.

572
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:47,830
You have to show that in order to to say that. It's not directly apparent from the kidney function.

573
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:54,460
You have to actually evaluate the me and the barrenness to see variation in particular for me.

574
01:22:55,030 --> 01:23:11,760
You can either. In order to calculate the mean you can follow that operation by calculating this integration is y times this at y equals.

575
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:18,180
Once you multiply y to this PDR publisher, you should be able to gather all original function.

576
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:20,730
So these y is in the integral.

577
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:31,650
So you can I explicitly evaluate this integration and solve it and you will see that the integration is equal to what I gave you the mean.

578
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:32,490
All right.

579
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:42,090
And also you can do integration by part of its operation, though y squared with not formula, you can get the balance to be a single squared.

580
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:48,150
So that's one way to got this two quantities me on balance for any normal distribution.

581
01:23:50,640 --> 01:24:01,680
Or alternatively you can also calculate the moment generating function and I believe this guy to the expectation of B to the Y.

582
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:17,440
Our Why follows a normal distribution. By definition, that's integration from an active entity to infinity.

583
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:21,360
The way to win over growth.

584
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:25,570
Two Sigma Square.

585
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:46,440
New Square. So how should we simplify this integration little bit of tree centric ness before

586
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:53,040
I try to make this term inside integration to be the PDF of some distribution?

587
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:57,060
So the integration goes to one. All right.

588
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:09,990
And by now, you should be you should have some intuition that this e to the y t should be combined with this term has in this explanation.

589
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:16,740
And essentially, if you take a look at the PDI for a normal distribution,

590
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:23,160
what do we do require is you have a constant multiply exponential inside the exponential term,

591
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:29,280
it's a squared, it's a quadratic function for this argument a lot.

592
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:42,420
So that's when we are trying to create once we combine the first exponential term with the last exponential, hey, we can do this combination.

593
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:51,360
We have two sigma square y squared minus two new y plus u squared.

594
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:58,530
Minus two sigma squared. Eyes wide eyes.

595
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:02,400
Teeth, right. You want.

596
01:26:04,330 --> 01:26:08,530
If we combine the first and last term greatness square, this is what we have.

597
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:15,940
So you have a square. Why? You have to first order terms which can be combined and some constant.

598
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:22,510
So the next thing to do is to complete the square with this new first order term.

599
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:30,819
Now give us any entity or number square to pi.

600
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:35,860
Sigma a square.

601
01:27:11,730 --> 01:27:14,280
Once you complete the square, this is what you have.

602
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:26,640
Now you have a new squared term organic line with a slightly different distance and another constant that is a reduction in the short term.

603
01:27:27,790 --> 01:27:34,000
Now, if you look at the first two parts, that becomes completely out of a new and normal distribution.

604
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:41,740
Now is a new product of removing the original MMU plus sigma squared teeth and the variance being the same sigma squared.

605
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:48,490
And given that the integration of the PDR for normal is what you kind of carried out the first time.

606
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:56,170
Now just give us. Key to the meal tea.

607
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:08,320
Plus Sigma Square Square over to.

608
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:16,740
So you can double check the calculation afterwards. This is the formula for the moment.

609
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:22,590
Generally a function for a standard normal distribution. E to them u t plus sigma squared.

610
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:27,540
T square over to. With the moment on any function.

611
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:32,640
Now, we can easily evaluate the medium, the barrens or any order of moments.

612
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:40,080
All we need to do is take the remit and evaluate our team on a zero and again as an exercise.

613
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:52,920
I want you to try say what Prime Zero is and what double prime zero is and.

614
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:59,240
Just take the derivative with respect to t evaluate t equal to zero.

615
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:08,730
Questions. All right.

616
01:29:11,030 --> 01:29:17,900
Some remarks about the normal distribution similar to the uniform distribution.

617
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:23,300
The normal distribution is also close to the linear transformation.

618
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:30,140
In other words, if you do a linear transformation of a normal random travel, it still is a normal rate of arrival.

619
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:38,420
And you can get any normal random variable from a standard novel variable by doing this linear transformation.

620
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:42,920
Specifically, the way to do it is the following.

621
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:51,020
If you start with any normal distribution with Medium, you and Baron Sigma squared already do it again.

622
01:29:51,030 --> 01:30:02,690
The standard normal is first subtract the mean and then divide this y minus meal by the standard deviation or the square root of the variance,

623
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:10,800
then you end up with the standard normal distribution. Okay, so this is just the first doing the shifting and then doing the risk.

624
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:18,200
Now that's normal. Alternatively, you can start with the standard normal distribution.

625
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:27,650
First, multiply the standard deviation and then plus the mean the got any normal distribution with MIMO and balancing.

626
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:38,060
Right. So that's a very flexible property for a normal distribution.

627
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:45,820
Again, as I said, you can go to any normal distribution from another normal distribution by just doing this routine natural functions.

628
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:56,180
The second property is that for any normal distribution, it's always symmetric.

629
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:00,440
So the skewness is always equal to zero.

630
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:05,900
And also, if you calculate exposes is actually a constant for now.

631
01:31:05,930 --> 01:31:14,329
And in our distribution, always have keratosis equals three at best.

632
01:31:14,330 --> 01:31:17,690
Also how we use ptosis in practice.

633
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:24,030
If you want to use a ptosis for any distribution, you're comparing it to the normal, right?

634
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:32,750
You pass a heavier l, then you have a uh, whether it's higher or lower to ptosis, but it's one direction.

635
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:38,629
If you have a skinny tail, you have another direction of the it's normal.

636
01:31:38,630 --> 01:31:51,380
Always have those as a three. And finally, a very important property of this PDR function is that and integrate to once again this is not trivial.

637
01:31:51,800 --> 01:32:04,400
What that means is the integration of one over e to the negative y squared over to e y is equal to one four.

638
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:08,090
So this is a very important equation. Okay.

639
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:19,580
Alternatively, you can write it this way. The integration of this, the e to the negative y square over two is equal to estimate up to y.

640
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:33,790
And so that's what can be implied from a PDF anyway to one because it's important because you call it this.

641
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:40,930
This is also a so-called karma function, the normal functioning body with zero.

642
01:32:49,050 --> 01:32:53,010
Any question about this properties. All right.

643
01:32:53,010 --> 01:33:02,399
So that's let's try to prove this case. Let's try to show the integration that is actually equal to one for any normal distribution.

644
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:06,630
Since with this linear transformation, we can always get back to the standard normal.

645
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:13,650
So for simplicity, let's just go with the standard normal distribution and look at this integration, right?

646
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:21,840
Because we can always do this linear transformation to convert any standard, to convert any normal to the standard.

647
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:29,970
Now as long as we kind of show a standard, normal, PDA, integrated one, we can show or any normal behavior to one.

648
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:36,900
Does that make sense? So next we just show a set of normal and the integrated one.

649
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:46,020
So that's what we want to show. And so we want to show that this AI, which is the creation of this term, is equal to one.

650
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:52,850
So the idea of this probe is not directly solving this integration.

651
01:33:52,850 --> 01:33:56,540
As I argued, it does not have an original function in a closed form.

652
01:33:56,930 --> 01:34:05,030
So what do we do is we think about this I square because this is a very clever tree.

653
01:34:05,450 --> 01:34:12,890
So consider this chi square and to use different notations, part it is to ask why use ask why is why.

654
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:16,340
So now you have a double integration. All right.

655
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:20,090
So the integration of this term, the XD y.

656
01:34:22,190 --> 01:34:22,450
Right.

657
01:34:24,370 --> 01:34:33,700
And from there, it says, Inside this integration, double integration, we have this X squared plus Y Square that reminds us of the change of arrow,

658
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:46,480
especially in this case, changed our radar Euclidean coordinates to the polar coordinates because x squared plus y squared.

659
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:51,010
It naturally reminds you of this unit circle, right?

660
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:54,910
You kind of have to represent X and Y by this unit coordinate.

661
01:34:56,700 --> 01:35:10,110
So you miss your playing space any xy0 you can also re express it using the you have about.

662
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:40,120
Okay. Well, let's say before 245 is the Sunday after for side of the capital.

663
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:54,470
I think that.

664
01:35:55,630 --> 01:36:09,190
Yes. So let's talk a little about your father.

665
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:19,470
A lot of things going on.

666
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:24,730
Sometimes I don't know.

667
01:36:24,770 --> 01:36:58,090
I don't know how to say this, but it was something I was like, you know what I'm about?

668
01:38:18,100 --> 01:41:06,340
But. And.

669
01:41:13,760 --> 01:42:02,160
And. And.

670
01:42:42,090 --> 01:43:42,290
And. And.

671
01:45:01,690 --> 01:45:46,280
And. And.

672
01:47:10,350 --> 01:47:22,280
And. And.

673
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:34,350
And.
