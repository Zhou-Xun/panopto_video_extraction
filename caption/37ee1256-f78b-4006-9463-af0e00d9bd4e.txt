1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,100
I can get rid of that after all this time.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:15,740
I know it was. But that passion, he's the one who taught me the right.

3
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:26,350
Just his luck. And I don't know how you do a thing about it.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:44,220
That's what it is to its chairman. I would like to express that, like when you've been on top of it for you, as though.

5
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,960
Oh, my God, sorry. No, I didn't. I didn't do time.

6
00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:02,490
I didn't know you had some sort of danger. I didn't see what I did to my agent about it.

7
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:10,410
It's up to you. Who are you? Do I have a right to blow everyone?

8
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:42,060
Let me get that. I just heard she sounds like someone you know right across the street, from what I hear.

9
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,780
You know what?

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,770
I didn't you it during class.

11
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,100
I was right in the middle of the season.

12
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,290
Nothing but our own getting tired.

13
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:10,040
I was like, you know, like to see my jacket.

14
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,889
All right. Let's go ahead and get started. Let me get your put you out of your misery.

15
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:23,370
I'm going to let class out early today. Oh, so today's class is really about this internship.

16
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:31,319
And I prior to you, I think we have to get our campus information in a while before the class starts.

17
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:37,440
And I call it externship paper. So End Campus is called externship, but this is really about your internship paper.

18
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,300
I purposefully put this. I have been reading your papers.

19
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,830
I have been reading your papers. I think you know where I'm going.

20
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,960
You that that's chicken nuggets with Kraft macaroni and cheese and some ketchup.

21
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,990
But I have got papers that have told me that chicken pillows mounted with her aged Himalayan cheddar and Sicilian stuff,

22
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,220
also accompanied with vibrant tomato puree.

23
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:17,760
I've read a lot of things just seconds, and so I'm looking for some really great insight from you on these internship papers.

24
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,090
Why am I saying that? I'm going to I'm going to pull up the internship paper criterion, what I'm looking for,

25
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:30,500
and we'll go over and I just wanted to give you a couple of minutes. Once we share all the questions we need to share, class will be dismissed.

26
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:38,400
But what I'm getting at is what you are doing when you become those next leaders.

27
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:46,910
We are asking you to do a ton, a ton of writing. I know in grad school you will still continue to do a ton of writing.

28
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,140
That's your job. It'll just be for a different boss. It will be a white people for what you do.

29
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,889
And some of something. Sometimes a memo, sometimes the email could be lengthy or not.

30
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,180
You can be doing a lot of writing. What are you writing about? What do you know?

31
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,250
What if you research what have you?

32
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,900
What have you learned from your experience that you can actually provide and give to somebody to help move something along?

33
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,129
So I just I just, I really like that.

34
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:23,730
But there's just fancy way of saying some of the basics. Human resources is really about the basics, not really the fancy words that you hear.

35
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:29,580
And we all believe that we can share and say and sound academic.

36
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:37,679
But I'm just looking for your thoughts, your basic thoughts, who you are, what you've learned, what what can you go back and find?

37
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,640
What can you research? Who can you talk to and share it with us?

38
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,910
And so let me give you a little laugh a minute.

39
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:53,909
And you're listening to Irish pop rock, by the way, I learned that somebody when you told me about music,

40
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,969
I got the Bollywood and a few others that I that I filled up.

41
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:02,650
But who likes the Irish pop rock? Many, many unclaimed that end as well.

42
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,560
No, it's cool.

43
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:14,390
It's all good because you clearly check and you are the one that likes.

44
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:25,830
I mean, how rough is it going forward? So you get to canvas the club, right?

45
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,240
Oh, I do have a word, but I need to share also.

46
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:36,080
It's always a word for you.

47
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:47,629
Information for you. I have several emails that I manage daily and it is so important for me to have you communicate through canvas like I do and

48
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:53,590
can miss some of your emails and I want to give you credit for you telling me you're not going to be in class ahead of time.

49
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,860
Something you need to share with me about an interview or something that's going on with your fellowship.

50
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:04,920
Please, please, please put in canvas and I get that notification and that tells me I need to respond to those things possible.

51
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:12,630
But if you go through my other professional emails or LinkedIn or wherever you're finding, I love it.

52
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:18,410
It might take some time for me to get back to you because I'm, I'm, I'm looking at things differently.

53
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,140
And canvas goes to the top of my campaign, top of my list to respond to.

54
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:34,640
So I got to get back to you this. I'm going to turn the music off this time.

55
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:43,940
And it's just technology and not Outlander.

56
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,350
Anybody or anything just kind of goes anywhere I turn.

57
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,780
So I just thought we share some music together.

58
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,490
Sounds like he's got that.

59
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,440
Okay, so you can find this in canvas as well.

60
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,380
Rico, can you give me a thumbs up if you can see this on the screen? Otherwise, I need to stop here and reach here for you.

61
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,790
Checking in with you, Rico. Excellent.

62
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,630
Thank you. So you'll find this again in.

63
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:31,670
In canvas. It's under your assignments, but the paper should be 12.5 and 12 point.

64
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,830
And Georgia font is what I'm looking for.

65
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:46,600
Also, the technique that I used to use as well was I put my name good on four lines and then with the last line, I quit my day and go down.

66
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:51,990
And so like a fourth of the in the paper is no.

67
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,200
So give me your thoughts. You have it. It's within you.

68
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,210
I know. I believe it's there, you know.

69
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,750
Just think through what you're saying. Give me just a little bit more of you.

70
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,230
I thought the the the last assignment was was very well done.

71
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,890
Couple of things. What I will do is read your paper, look for some insights to look for some basic things that I'm that I'm asking for.

72
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,660
Did you did you just hit the goal on that?

73
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:22,670
But also expanding your thought, you know, there's job analysis could have come through on those last papers,

74
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,200
I think just a few of you hinted on, you know, will the staff matter?

75
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,910
We're talking about physician compensation.

76
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:36,290
You know, I really enjoyed reading from from many of you that, you know, you want to go back and really do a thoughtful review.

77
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:43,519
You're the consultant, right? And oftentimes it's when you're engaged in a committee or in or in your real leadership job,

78
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,320
when you're engaged in that, you're you're almost going to feel like the consultant on doing something.

79
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,060
So what's the bigger picture that you want to bring to the table than just answering the question?

80
00:08:54,110 --> 00:09:03,170
What more can you bring? Tip, absolute tip for you as you're going through your fellowship and you're going through writing your applications,

81
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,430
why are you different than the previous person? What more can you bring?

82
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:16,860
What else can you tell them? What additional value are you bringing to them other than just answering the question they want to know more?

83
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:24,620
Why you, in your fellowship be able to expound on who you are and what you can bring so that your application stands out.

84
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:33,320
So I'm looking for some of those those pieces from you as well, when when you when you write your information back to me.

85
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:41,180
So again, it's really taking a look at your internships, reflecting on that.

86
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,200
This is a.

87
00:09:50,770 --> 00:10:21,339
If you're wondering why it's going to be in a full screen for one of the full screen on the speaker system and some structure on your range,

88
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,570
we then you've got to make sure I get the whole document up on the screen.

89
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,070
Oh, very interestingly, just wasn't in the right scrollbar.

90
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:41,230
Okay. So looking I have placed for you as a reference one, two, two, four, six, six items that you can pull from.

91
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:53,889
I did four of those take some time to reflect on your intention and pull four of these out and explain to me how your internship,

92
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:59,469
from an H.R. perspective actually handling you might need to call somebody,

93
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,230
might need to research some websites, you might need to look at some things.

94
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:13,390
But really working from from an overall perspective in that organization, what do they charge those well?

95
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:20,490
How do you feel H.R. played a role in in these particular segments and areas and people

96
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,120
wanting to hear from you and many of the many of the organizations you worked in,

97
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,700
either my friends, are the CEOs or CEOs or I've worked in.

98
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:40,840
So I'm very, very, very, very, very familiar. So for the most part, I think two of you had brand new internships that didn't have job descriptions.

99
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,830
And so that would be new for me. So I'm looking forward to learning that. But for the most part,

100
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:59,110
kind of knowing exactly what those organizations were capable of delivering on these particular what I consider practices through H.R.

101
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:06,850
And so again, I tried to give you a little bit more guidance on what that might mean in

102
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,870
those particular areas that that could help you write what you need to write.

103
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,740
But I'm looking to hear what you learned. What did you learn?

104
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,970
Because along the way, that's what you're building. What are you learning?

105
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,960
How can you reproduce it? What was your experience?

106
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:30,670
Where can you go with it? And what will, quite frankly, you'll be looking for in these fellowships and moving forward?

107
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:51,340
So this is in Kansas. I need to share screen with all of you to screen and based still.

108
00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:02,000
All right. Any questions about that assignment?

109
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:08,090
I am available via email if you need me through canvas your screen.

110
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,000
But the areas that I'm looking for are H.R. planning and job analysis.

111
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:20,450
What do you know about that? Who could you call and find out about that or the leader that you work for?

112
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,870
Did they have any any engagement in job analysis and job planning for the resources in the work that they're doing,

113
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:32,270
staffing in particular performance management and compensation?

114
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,170
Did you watch anybody go through an evaluation on your leader's calendar?

115
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,849
Were they doing evaluating their direct reports and leads?

116
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,980
And what does that compensation look like?

117
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,490
When you get to an executive level, not just your only physician based compensation will matter or staffing.

118
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:55,820
So yours truly yours employee engagement.

119
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,250
Talked a little bit about that before diversity, equity and inclusion.

120
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,170
And this is diversity, inclusion and belonging. So that is it.

121
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:12,319
Sometimes that's labeled in that way. Going forward, what what did you see from our perspective where the policies were,

122
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,960
the practices there and employee well-being, which we talked a little bit about before as well.

123
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:24,980
So, hi, guys. You guys are the luckiest five people ever.

124
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,650
Glasses over. What? What's what? Just.

125
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:40,130
Just guys. I didn't get anything with it on the icebreaker, but Julie, is there any is there any questions about.

126
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,940
Yes. So today's class is going to end early? I think that is a very interesting what I'm going over is the assignment,

127
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:55,100
the 4 to 5 page assignment that you're reflecting on your internship and you're going to pick four of the six options here.

128
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:03,469
And you can tell me within that role that you had, what what was your visibility on that?

129
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,820
And for me, on those areas, on those topics and from an h.R.

130
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,630
Perspective, how does how does that weigh in presently?

131
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:27,410
Is so there there are times when you're next unless you're going to be the CEO of your own company next year or in the future,

132
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:33,979
you get to drive the strategic efforts and you get to meet with the projects and efforts are and you get to tell somebody,

133
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,810
could you just do an analysis for me?

134
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:48,350
You can, but somebody is going to come up to you and say, Hey, I am really interested in looking at our equity among X job categories that you manage.

135
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:56,780
Could you could you give me something on that? You're going to somebody is going to come up to you with just a one sentence problem,

136
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,129
and they may not have any more information than what they just told you.

137
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,160
And they're going to ask you to come up with a solution.

138
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:13,489
And I'd rather you reflect and think and engage in what you've learned and share with me how you can go and pull and research,

139
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,670
understand not having a whole lot in front of you.

140
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,870
What can you produce?

141
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:32,899
Because if somebody says, let's just say you are in charge of 20 different people in health care setting and leadership, says, Hey,

142
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:41,240
H.R. wants us to come up with some D and I efforts with you and your staff by take care I'm going

143
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:51,560
can say she was a people that she might have more of that I was like oh what were you come up with?

144
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,050
Is it left up to somebody else to come up with? D and I efforts for your 20 people.

145
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,990
This is something you are leading. Reflect on what you know.

146
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,190
That's an experience. Don't be afraid of a challenge.

147
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:21,750
Tell me what you really think. So much, really soft. So I'm going to pause to see if there are any questions to.

148
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:36,410
So again, this is what I had shared earlier that I've been reading and I get the sense what this is,

149
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:44,660
but it's really chicken nuggets that Mitt Romney is using. So word salads, the great mystery going.

150
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:51,590
But gimme, gimme, gimme. What are you thinking? Gimme, gimme your thoughts. Gimme what you know or suggest.

151
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:56,660
What could what could that organization have done better in your life?

152
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,400
So it's 420 and I can get the Irish pop back out.

153
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,040
But that was what I was going to produce today. Questions.

154
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,200
Questions. That's all right.

155
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:20,510
I'm looking forward to the 45 pages. So you guys are looking for something.

156
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:28,010
That's nice. Okay.

157
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:35,070
I'm doing. No, it's perfect.

158
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,870
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What do you mean?

159
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:52,160
You. You just got to make sure that you out.

160
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:09,970
I don't know how you possibly find out.

161
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,810
Let's see how it all.

162
00:19:30,550 --> 00:20:02,260
I. Since that time, I would have been trying to come back.

163
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:09,450
I was like, I will now.

164
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:28,210
And I'm like, you know, I actually love it when, you know, you're like, Oh, yeah, that's going to be out there.

165
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:40,770
I don't think that I needed exactly that.

166
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:44,010
And that's that's probably why you just let me. Thank you.

167
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,260
I'll continue to try to get something. Yeah.

168
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:56,990
Yeah. You doing it?

169
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:06,940
Yeah. I don't really know what I was thinking.

170
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:15,790
I to work on the whole, it's like, oh, it's all the way up there.

171
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:22,030
So I signed up. It's like I am last year it was so it was out there and all these like, yeah.

172
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,750
And I was like, I can't get up there without a car.

173
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:35,770
Exactly. So, you know, I go, Yeah, yeah, I do.

174
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,600
Yeah.

175
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:49,550
You got to keep on, I think, you know, let me get a look at this movie just so I don't know what I'd have to do anything better, if you don't mind.

176
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,870
Do you know what you're doing? It's nice to get my theory.

177
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:57,060
I got to get to know her. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

178
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,570
I know you're going this way. Not a chance.

179
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:10,540
You have friends. I know it's so nice, and you know it's gonna be okay.

180
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:15,760
I wonder if I don't read a book.

181
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,719
I do read a book I get and I look at my little ones.

182
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:29,090
The things that are highlighted in my subconscious I'm not of the number is is over edit info you're going to need to do.

183
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,330
And that's what I want to see. If there's something on the page, you just say it.

184
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,190
Let's find out. Margaret? Yes.

185
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:45,360
All right. I'll get it for you.

186
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,750
You get on that? Yes. Okay. All right. So I turn assignment.

187
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,660
Assignment during the busy fellowships. I think I've decided to do that.

188
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,370
Can I help you? Yes. I assume that all the other ones.

189
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:07,680
Yeah. I don't know how you get assignment to justify this.

190
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,790
You did it. Very much so.

191
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:16,200
Okay, let me check. And I don't want to. You know, I know it's late.

192
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:23,330
Assignment one late. So I didn't want to smooth last name again. And I said, here again, you know.

193
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,170
See? Yeah, I just saw myself.

194
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,459
Did you? Yeah. I'm going to be right there at six. I will be at times three.

195
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,890
And I need assignment three. Not disciplined. I'm not even an assignment today.

196
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,210
Yeah, yeah. Assignment two as well. It seems like the first thing out of killing someone.

197
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,830
I said Yeah, but no, they're on top of that, so I'm not seeing the last name.

198
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:57,310
Yeah, go ahead and submit it. I have to be fair because I've done it with others that it is late.

199
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,930
I can't give you this assignment. It's really good. It's for one. That's why I'm so sorry.

200
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,270
That's okay. It's all right. I'm going to go. Yeah. Thank you for.

201
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,510
Let me know you're on the subject. Okay.

202
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:16,260
Very. Go. I'll let you go. Classes over unless you want. Know I enjoy this time.

203
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,390
I hope that was good. I hope everybody was happy with some time. What are you up to?

204
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:30,500
We got to go do a case conference. Oh, yeah.

205
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,380
Next week. Yeah. So what can you.

206
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:43,379
I can wait and see.

207
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:49,430
That's why I don't say no. That's exactly why I don't like. I'd rather see you because it be like I didn't have time to ask a question.

208
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,010
I mean, explain it to me what I'm looking for.

209
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,930
And I do know that it's been a crazy busy week. Yeah.

210
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:07,350
So given the gift of time, we just go easy on it because I know somebody I don't drive to campus, but those who do, like, have to be competitive.

211
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:11,910
Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, I'm grateful.

212
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:20,129
Oh, I get it. But also, it's like you wanted to learn something today, you know?

213
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:25,650
And they said the same thing. They're like, we ran to class. Like, No, I don't know.

214
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:32,520
Like a good portion of us do have like a large, like four or five hour gap between, okay, okay.

215
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:37,370
I think it's a good time. I can do it. Well, this is the only time that I'm doing that.

216
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,050
Oh, well, then. Okay, this when I said the only time I'm doing okay.

217
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:47,670
Yeah. inJust for the paper to give you some time to ask questions to go from there.

218
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:52,560
So let's forget the midterm will be online.

219
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,860
Everybody knows that for the most part, we have a class.

220
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:01,620
Everything okay? Oh, God. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, I know.

221
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,709
I'll be in focus. Thanks, but thank you.

222
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:11,820
I just. I didn't want to be someone who is just concerned without seeing that you guys need a break.

223
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:18,599
Yeah. No, that's. That was my. Because I think some of our professors are like, we're on this October time, which is incredibly busy.

224
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,129
Yeah, like, insanely busy. ISO people say I am so tired.

225
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:27,250
Yes, but you can even see it in their eyes. Yes. I was like, let me finish.

226
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,189
Let me just give you. Yeah. Then go and get a little nap till 530.

227
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:39,959
Then they get those midday naps. Listen if they want to just build some pods in the school as listen, I'm not opposed.

228
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,950
Tuition dollars can go towards that. Love is love is love.

229
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:50,950
But thank you for letting me know that. And if your colleagues or classmates are, you know, just telling us the only time I was doing that,

230
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:59,489
but really just wanted to impose my words on what I'm looking for in this paper is not the word salad.

231
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:03,400
It is. I hope I didn't write a word that implies means I create.

232
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:09,120
I am naturally wordy. If you said to give us ourselves, that is just me.

233
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:17,249
I am a wordy person of that I. But I mean if if it is a word salad, please call me out because it is rather just has to sync communication.

234
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:24,030
You know, it's all I'm asking. But sometimes it is hard because at the same time as I can be wordy, I can also be straight to the point.

235
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:30,510
And sometimes like getting like a page minimum is like going to saying, I can answer this in like a couple of paragraphs.

236
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,000
That's just me though. I only say when you're stuck, just go to Google and.

237
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,389
Type in a question about what you're writing and see what else somebody can inspire you to say,

238
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,630
Oh, that's what I do, because that gives you more than trying to.

239
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,740
You don't know it all. You don't have it all, so you're not sure how to present it all.

240
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:54,390
And you're trying to answer a question. You definitely want to answer the question, but you also want to give more insight.

241
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,510
And I hope I did that. Let me know if I'm suspicious.

242
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:01,230
Yes, yes, yes, yes. I think I think for the most part, I've been trying to respond to everybody.

243
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,930
Yes. In a submission of sometimes I just minimize like 30 minutes before class.

244
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,790
Oh, so I have an alternative for a minute, though. I don't want to write it this way, you know.

245
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:17,010
Very good. Very good. Thank you kindly. You two go back to me.

246
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:40,530
So. Yes.

247
00:59:25,400 --> 01:15:43,190
Right. In 90.
