1
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:10,850
In this module, we're going to be talking about the nature of the policy process.

2
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:16,542
At this point, we're going to focus on the policy process at a high level.

3
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:22,000
In other parts of your curriculum, you'll be dealing with the actual

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,900
way the government functions, in various aspects of governmental policy.

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,025
What I want to think about today is how you should think about the process,

6
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:36,645
as potential public health policy makers.

7
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:40,605
First issue is, how do you identify a problem?

8
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:43,745
How do you recognize an important issue

9
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:47,495
that would help improve the population's health?

10
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:52,210
Second, once you've identified the problem, how do you set your objectives?

11
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,560
What do you wanna achieve?

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,620
What do you want the outcomes to be?

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,460
In formulating policy, you therefore need to set an agenda.

14
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,720
What's important about an agenda is to set your priorities.

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,700
As we'll see later on, in this curriculum, you can't do everything.

16
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,870
Resources are limited, so you've got to make choices.

17
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:24,490
How you frame and appraise the options will therefore determine which policies

18
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,900
get on your agenda, how you address them, and what results you want.

19
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,950
And finally, there is the process of enactment.

20
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,680
And that is, how do you enact your policies,

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,740
either through regulations that the health department would issue,

22
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,230
or that the state legislature might enact as legislation.

23
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:52,070
But there are other important aspects of the policy process that tend to get lost,

24
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,890
that really, I think, are essential for public health practitioners to understand.

25
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,070
First is the implementation.

26
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:06,970
No policy is self executing, no matter how grand your policy,

27
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:12,320
how noble your objectives, if they're not implemented, they don't happen.

28
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,920
So you have to think about proper room making program design.

29
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,130
Along with that, you must evaluate your programs.

30
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,360
You have to get feedback, make modifications, and then try to match

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,680
the findings of the evaluation, back to the implementation process.

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,400
And then you have to communicate the results.

33
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,358
People need to be aware of what you doing, how you're doing it, and

34
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:41,687
why you're doing it.

35
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:45,269
So implementation, evaluation, and

36
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:49,936
communication are essential aspects of the policy

37
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:54,386
process that you must think about ahead of time,

38
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:59,680
not after the policy has been developed.

39
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,960
So let's look at what we call the demand for policy, and the suppliers of policy.

40
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,070
Who demands policy?

41
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,770
Who wants it?

42
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,860
Well, elected officials, advocacy groups who want

43
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,360
to improve the population's health, individual policy entrepreneurs.

44
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,870
Academics who have research agendas,

45
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,490
advocacy organizations that want to pursue certain policies.

46
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:32,130
The media, very interested in what health departments are doing.

47
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,140
Now who supplies the policy?

48
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,870
Here we have to look at the governmental process, just briefly.

49
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,390
Elected officials, bureaucrats, judges.

50
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,870
Remember, the courts are very active in dealing with the policy, and

51
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,390
having an influence on policy.

52
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,130
Professional associations.

53
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,120
The American Public Health Association, for

54
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,640
example, will enact policy statements every year.

55
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,540
What did they do with them,

56
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,610
how did they get these policies implemented through the policy process?

57
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:12,850
Then there are expert panels, and again, policy analysts.

58
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:21,130
And we will come later in this curriculum to discuss the policy analysis process.

59
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,680
Okay, turning now to theories of politics, John Kingdon,

60
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,858
a University of Michigan political scientist, developed an agenda

61
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:36,391
setting process that results from three factors, what do you call them,

62
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:42,090
the problem stream, the policy stream, and the political stream.

63
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,600
Remember, I said earlier that agenda setting

64
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,560
is a fundamental part of what public health practitioners do.

65
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,370
And Kingdon's theoretical framework helps that process, and

66
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,990
facilitates moving policy from ideas to reality.

67
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,570
Let's look first at what Kingdon calls the problem stream.

68
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,130
Which issues are recognized as significant problems?

69
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,360
Right now, for example,

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,280
the opioid crisis is certainly a significant problem the country faces.

71
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,770
Over the longer term, public health practitioners have to worry about

72
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,818
the ongoing obesity epidemics, and diabetes crises.

73
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:31,490
Along with are recognizing the significant problems.

74
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,490
How do we translate those problems into questions and

75
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,940
issues the government can address.

76
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,660
Remember, the public health department has a lot of problems.

77
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,290
And so the problem stream has to be sorted, and

78
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,330
we'll come back to that in a bit.

79
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,740
In addition, there's always a potential crisis that can emerge,

80
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,140
that will drive the problem stream.

81
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:03,890
For example, you can have an Ebola outbreak in one part of the world.

82
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:09,670
You can have measles outbreaks in Washington state.

83
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:15,280
These crises often take precedence in driving the problem stream.

84
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,288
The second is the policy stream.

85
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:25,930
And what Kingdon talked about here is that ideas float in this stream academics,

86
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,250
with policy is researchers, politicians all the time deal with

87
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,490
different ideas that they come up from the community.

88
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,950
What Kingdon called like noodles in a primeval policy soup.

89
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:46,460
And it's the gradual accumulation of knowledge and perspective among

90
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:52,320
specialists in a given policy area, that will drive the policy stream.

91
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,930
So once we have all of this policies in the policy stream,

92
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:04,460
we have to then look at the wider political environment.

93
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:09,768
The institutions and politicians who decide on policy.

94
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:14,510
As Kingdon notes, the greatest policy changes grow out of that coupling of

95
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:19,620
problems, policy proposals, and politics.

96
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,920
Public health practitioners need to understand that politics

97
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,710
is an important part of what they do.

98
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:33,440
If they want a particular policy to emerge out of

99
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:41,210
this primeval soup of policy streams, you have to get the politicians to buy in.

100
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:47,238
That, again, is part of the policy process.

101
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:54,690
What Kingdon developed here is that there's a window of opportunity.

102
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:00,700
We see that most recently, in the Affordable Care Act, where

103
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:07,110
the idea of health reform had been on the policy agenda for decades, for decades.

104
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,440
But what happened was,

105
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,220
with the election of President Obama, everything came together.

106
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,980
The problem had been known for a long time.

107
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,890
People lacking insurance.

108
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,750
People not being able to afford insurance.

109
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,430
And all sorts of proposals, from conservatives,

110
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:30,310
to have market based health reform, to liberals, to have a governmental

111
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,510
single payer system, to libertarians, who wanted no government.

112
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,520
Lots of policies, but what happened with the election of Barack Obama was it

113
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,350
all came together, in what Kingdon calls the window of opportunity.

114
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,600
And out of that window of opportunity came the Affordable Care Act.

115
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,508
It's important to note that it doesn't happen often in American policy, and

116
00:08:55,508 --> 00:09:00,150
as you'll learn in your other classes, the system of government we have,

117
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:04,080
it's the time for incremental, not radical, change.

118
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,600
And we already starting to see that, with new proposals in Congress for

119
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,720
a green environmental plan.

120
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,090
It will take years before the problem of

121
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:21,200
climate change on the various policies, and then the window of opportunity,

122
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,015
come together to enact a green environmental policy.

123
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:31,545
Once we understand that the window of opportunity doesn't necessarily

124
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:36,095
occur often in the United States, it becomes important for

125
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:41,745
US public health practitioners to focus more on what you can achieve

126
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:47,050
at the state and local levels, where most public health policy occurs.

127
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,210
To do that, you have to think through what the challenges and

128
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:55,640
issues are in your state or local community.

129
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,810
What assets you have?

130
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,610
And the assets include the resources, the community engagement,

131
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:07,550
the political culture, and the environment there in the state or locality.

132
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,880
What are the conflicts?

133
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,290
What are the pressing problems?

134
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,060
Who are the key players and constituents?

135
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,090
How do you talk to them?

136
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:20,650
What are the key events shaping the development of policy,

137
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,890
in your state or locality.

138
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,752
And most importantly, what's the culture of your setting.

139
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:31,150
Is it trending liberal, when you want a little more

140
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:35,560
aggressive in talking about social determinants of health and

141
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,418
governmental intervention to improve the community's health?

142
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:41,516
Or is it trending more conservative,

143
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:47,880
where you have to shape your policies in coordination with the private sector,

144
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,840
and being aware of the market based economy, and

145
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,023
how your constituents will respond to these issues.
