00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:11,270
Hello and welcome back in this session we'll explore the April through July agenda.

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:24,810
Referring to our timeline, April til May will be dedicated to preparing for the GRE in either June or July you will then make  preparation to take your exam.

3
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,210
To gain a better understanding of the GRE it is short for graduate records,

4
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:41,550
examination. The GRE  is an entrance exam used by professional schools to test a student's ability to perform and graduate level courses.

5
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:50,280
There are two types of GRE tests. You your general test and you have your subjects, there is the general test is more widely used,

6
00:00:50,280 --> 00:01:01,440
whereas the subject tests is required for certain areas of focus or can be used to demonstrate your knowledge or expertize in a specific area.

7
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:12,250
The general test consists of three sections. You have your analytical writing, your quantitative reasoning and your verbal reasoning section.

8
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:19,120
Recently, there has been a movement to phase out the exam. Claims have been made that the test is racially

9
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:26,740
biased and is not a great indicator of one's ability to perform as a graduate student.

10
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:36,100
Here at the University of Michigan, the School of Public Health has temporarily removed the GRE for two years in all

11
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:42,880
departments except for the Biostats departement and the Epidemioogy department.

12
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:54,850
So here is a screenshot of the ETS Web site, the GRE is provided through the educational testing services, also known as ETS.

13
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:00,160
If this is the ETS homepage and if you go to the products tab,

14
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:06,880
you will be able to find more information about the various different tests that they offer, but more importantly, about the GRE.

15
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:17,340
And the general in the subject is. Here is a screenshot of the GRE website through the ETS.

16
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:30,470
If once you go to this page, you'll know that you're on the right website. This is specifically for the general test website.

17
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:37,430
So the first step in preparing for the GRE is identify your target areas what parts of the exam.

18
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:43,460
should you focus on the most. The best method for identifying your target areas

19
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:49,160
is to take a full length GRE practice test under a similar conditions.

20
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:57,770
You want the conditions to be as realistic as possible to test day to gain an understanding of your strengths and weaknesses.

21
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:06,440
The ETS website offer time practice exam with the same allotted time as the exam on test day.

22
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:14,720
Also, when taking the quantitative reasoning section, use the onscreen GRE calculator or you can purchase a simple calculator,

23
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,710
a basic calculator to um have one that is similar to the one that will be used on

24
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:28,160
test day. The GREpractice test cannot grade your analytical writing section.

25
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,750
So find friends and family members who are great writers to review your writing.

26
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:45,430
After taking the practice test, compare your test scores to the scores of the program that you are interesetd in. Based on this comparison sign up for a test day.

27
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:53,350
If you find that you may need to do more studying than you expected, plan your test to be towards the end of July to allocate

28
00:03:53,350 --> 00:04:04,480
more time to studying for the exam. Note the GRE is very expensive. Its two hundred and five dollars to take the exam.

29
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:13,720
However, the ETS website does offer a fee reduction program to assist test takes  in covering the cost of the exam.

30
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,960
Visit the ETS to learn more about this program.

31
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:26,050
So after identifying your weak points, create a study plan aimed at improving these areas,

32
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,300
Select study materials  based on how you learn best. Will you need a tutor,

33
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:39,610
will you use the interactive online program, or can you simply use test prep books to prep for the exam,

34
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:45,700
test prep, both use a little bit more cheaper and easier to obtain.

35
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:51,700
You may find GRE study material at a university or a local library .

36
00:04:51,700 --> 00:05:02,740
GRE is a test based on technique rather than results. Familiarize yourself with different study approaches for each question time.

37
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:10,960
For example, the verbal reasoning section, for the verbal reasoning section read for the mode of the sentence or the passage.

38
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:18,130
If the sentence or the passage is trying to convey more of a positive mood, then you want to find or look for answer

39
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,870
Cchoices that are typically positive words, that will fit with that sentence

40
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,850
They have statements or what the passage is

41
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:33,450
trying to convey. Also look at prefixes and suffixes again to understand the other vocabulary being presented.

42
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,470
As stated earlier, always practice using similar conditions,

43
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:45,540
you don't want to use a scientific calculator to study with  because on test day you will not be able to use the scientific calculator.

44
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,740
Do not use Internet to look at word choices because, you know, we're not able to do that on exam day as well.

45
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:58,050
We'll also remember when you take a practice exam, use the same allotted time on the exam.

46
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:06,680
when you are taking the practice exam to make sure that you don't go the time that is allocated to you.

47
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:16,070
June through July, you will go in and take the GRE exam. Given covid-19 prepping for the exam.

48
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:25,130
may look a little different. The information presented on this slide was based on my experience being in person,

49
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:32,090
although students are now taking the exam from home these steps can be modified to fit this new condition,

50
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:38,330
I would still urge you to obtain a valid photo I.D. with your name, photo and signature.

51
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:50,460
You may be asked to send in a picture to the ETS of with a photocopy of your I.D. and also to show it on exam day as well.

52
00:06:50,460 --> 00:07:01,500
Also, getting enough rest, being logging in on time, and having a bottle of water nearby is still imperative when taking the exam at home.

53
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,670
The great part about taking the exam from home is now that you have control of

54
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:11,610
the thermostat so you can make your house as cold or as hot as you want it to be,

55
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,440
remember to still eat a light and balanced meal before the exam.

56
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,950
Also, make sure you have a quiet and neat area to take the exam.  Call your Internet provider or

57
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:29,140
check the strength of your Internet connection a couple of days before the exam starts.

58
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:38,620
If you do not have a quiet or quiet space or have internet available in your home consider using your local library as a place to take the exam,

59
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:46,740
it is important the exam day is stress free, which were heighten your focus for the day.

60
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,290
We have now reached the end of this video and this concludes our discussion on the GRE.

61
00:07:52,290 --> 00:08:03,584
We are now a little over halfway through our agenda. In the next session, we will cover the agenda for months July through September.
