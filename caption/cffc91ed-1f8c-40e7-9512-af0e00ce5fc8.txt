1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:20,500
Those. Well.

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,720
Look, look, all of you guys are doing well.

3
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:42,380
We only have like six or so sessions left, which is always kind of striking at this point in the semester.

4
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,570
I know. It's just like fast and furious for everybody.

5
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,330
Me as well. Also, just a reminder, we have this week and then there's no class Thanksgiving week.

6
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,910
And so I've been getting a few questions like filtering in about papers,

7
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:07,920
but there's definitely I'm available to answer questions if people have some

8
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,170
questions both on kind of how much detail to get into in the interventions.

9
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:23,909
I've had some questions like that and then also like I can't find intervention because there's just a lot of stuff out there.

10
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:31,410
And so depending on how much your topic area has been like the focus of sort of systematic clinical trials and things like that,

11
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:42,570
there may be more or less information out there. So if you're feeling like you're running into confusion or trouble or can't find anything or find

12
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:48,270
things that you're not sure if they're sort of valid or reasonable or tested interventions,

13
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:56,370
just reach out and let me know. And if you don't find anything, that would be a little surprising.

14
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:07,260
A But B, it could also just be like search terms or other other kinds of things you haven't hit on yet, so definitely reach out.

15
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,400
The other thing is like you could be looking at something totally novel,

16
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,210
which would be also awesome, but there's usually something out there that's related.

17
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,209
So that's the intervention paper. And I know that not everybody is like deep into thinking about it yet,

18
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:29,850
but I would just say like spend a little quality time with it over Thanksgiving break so that you're prepared for that.

19
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,799
And it's not a rush rush job. Let's see.

20
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,310
Anything else? Any questions right now on paper stuff, I know that people are kind of like slammed with midterms and other stuff,

21
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,980
but hopefully you're going to let up a little bit. Okay.

22
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:55,290
What else was I going to going to say? I felt like I had another topic.

23
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,109
Now that's I'm checking in about we may be getting a guest speaker, but she may be too busy.

24
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,710
So hopefully we'll have one guest speaker.

25
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:11,100
It's just it's really hard to get like it's possible to get guest speakers over Zoom a little more easily,

26
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,790
but it's really hard to get people to transit over here to the school of Public

27
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,909
Health is just a hard place to get to if you're not like a central campus person.

28
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,880
So and most of my people are like in the med school or further away, so.

29
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,300
Okay. So today we're going to talk through child welfare system a little bit.

30
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,430
Just kind of an overview and I know there's also some overview of foster care in that

31
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,510
mini lecture and we'll talk about foster care and some of the challenges in that system,

32
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,550
foster care. So it's a it's a subset of the bigger, broader child welfare system.

33
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:58,079
And so it's an important one to kind of focus in on. And especially for those of you who are interested in sort of adolescence and emerging adults,

34
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:08,219
there's a lot of really important and timely work happening in that space in terms of aging out of foster care.

35
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:17,280
So we'll talk about that towards the end. But so today, what we'll do is go through a little bit like what is the child welfare system,

36
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,060
how does it work, what are the many, many problems with it?

37
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,410
And how do we sort of think about ways to improve, you know,

38
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:38,190
the system and kind of these articles some of them gave like these to the Leslie lab is really interventions once kids are in the system,

39
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,020
which is important because even if our solution is let's blow the whole thing up and like restart,

40
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,800
like, that's not really a very helpful thing to have as a primary goal, right?

41
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,849
Like a primary goal. Like how do we make things better for kids who are in the system as well as keeping an

42
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,889
eye on the ball of like the system doesn't operate very well as currently structured.

43
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,000
So there's a few different like levels as with many things to think about.

44
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,790
And then we'll also talk a little bit about just kind of the ways that it plays out.

45
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,559
Okay. So starting with just sort of child welfare super broadly, so there's a lot involved in this.

46
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,480
And if people who are not familiar kind of hear the term child welfare,

47
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,120
who does often talk about if you talk to people who have worked with the system.

48
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,530
You know,

49
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:38,780
there's just a lot of emotion around it because it's not it's inherently a challenging space and challenging context because you're talking about,

50
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:45,430
you know, identifying and ideally helping kids who have experienced some really awful things.

51
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,780
So we've talked a lot about trauma, parent separation, child mental health a little bit in this class.

52
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,860
And this system really interfaces with a lot of those issues.

53
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:05,389
So we know that the way that children sort of come to the attention of child welfare is through a few different ways.

54
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:12,230
And has anyone in this class been in a mandated reporter position as far as they know?

55
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,459
Yeah. So some of us. So when you're mandated.

56
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:26,780
Reporter That basically means like you're in a position to observe and sort of assess a little bit like small a assess what's

57
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:35,720
going on with a child and you might be alerted to something that seems off in terms of that child and you might have a suspect,

58
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,700
a suspicion of that child being abused or neglected.

59
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:46,339
And so a lot of, you know, these are sort of some standard ways that kids can kind of come to the attention of the system.

60
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:53,749
So teachers, pediatricians, I've talked a lot about pediatrics as this sort of helpful context,

61
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,250
but it's really important to also note that can be a really stressful context

62
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:05,000
for families because of this reporting requirement that that physicians have.

63
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,410
There are, you know, certainly, you know, in the police and correctional contexts,

64
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:19,550
a lot of mandated reporting requirements and also a lot of dynamics that,

65
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,060
you know, we talk a lot about in public health around police community interactions.

66
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:32,780
You can also get a report from Non-management with a non mandated reporter, but that's less typical.

67
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:41,630
The reasons that a report would be made was would be in the case of the child being suspected to be abused or neglected,

68
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,110
all falling under the bigger umbrella of child maltreatment.

69
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,060
So again, some of you guys might be super familiar with these terms and some of you not.

70
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:56,690
And so I'm just kind of going through these are the kinds of abuse that we talk about in child welfare and health,

71
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:02,990
maltreatment, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse. Just pausing for one minute on emotional abuse.

72
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,469
We've talked a lot about parenting and different styles of parenting,

73
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:10,970
different kind of family set ups and situations and family stressors and things

74
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:16,550
that families may be facing and how we classify something like emotional abuse.

75
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:23,690
I hope you guys, you know, I'm sure everybody appreciates that's a bit of a gray area or it can be a very gray area.

76
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:32,180
And so we're we're we're in a lot of space here where we're just thinking about what's happening with the family and child.

77
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,720
And we've talked about a lot of different ways that that can be complicated to figure out.

78
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,530
And so I think that is something that is really important to highlight when

79
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:45,260
we're talking about child welfare neglect as the other kind of big category.

80
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:53,900
And again, like thinking about things we've talked about in this class, things you probably think about in other areas of public health life.

81
00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:04,220
We also know that neglect is often associated or it can be, let's see when there are sort of social determinants of health like poverty,

82
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:15,530
housing instability, food insecurity, all the things that kind of often go along with poverty that can often be sort of red as shown up as neglect.

83
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,950
Kids may be neglected in those situations,

84
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:25,280
but is it it's a it's a I would say it's an even more gray area than some of the abuse types that we look at.

85
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:33,649
And it may be that the child is neglected because the family is sort of unable to provide for that child materially.

86
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:39,880
So the child may not have a you know, house may not be getting her not a house, but, you know,

87
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,760
a place to live, may not be getting medical care, dental care, all sorts of things.

88
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,610
So like a classic kind of indicator.

89
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:55,920
And one way to play out the situation is like if you're a child care provider of, you know, toddlers and you have a toddler who may be, you know,

90
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:06,320
experiencing neglect and you may think that because they have like their teeth rotting out because of lack of dental care,

91
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,010
sometimes, like parents don't know not to give juice in the bottle at night.

92
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,770
That's sort of the classic way to get a toddler tooth decay.

93
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:25,190
And so if as a teacher, we've talked about, you know, teachers we talked about with ADHD like teacher and parent, you know, input is needed.

94
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:34,740
So in this case, a teacher might notice, oh, this. You know, two year old in my class has most of their teeth have tooth decay.

95
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,819
That's a sign to me as a teacher because I seen lots of different two year olds

96
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:45,450
and I am making an informed decision to bring this to the attention of CPS.

97
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,700
Hopefully that teacher also has a relationship with the parent, and so the teacher could talk to the parent, figure out what's going on at home first.

98
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:58,830
That would be an advisable way to kind of first investigate the situation.

99
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:04,500
But then if it gets to the point that that's not resolved, that may be a situation where we see when we talk about neglect.

100
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,620
Okay. And so just kind of stepping through the process, you get to see the summary here.

101
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,490
But here's how it's supposed to sort of work, right?

102
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:22,049
So the CPS process and the Child Protective Services in some states, it's called DCF for Department of Child Services.

103
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:30,120
So there's lots of different acronyms for this. Governing, not governing, but the body of the system.

104
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:37,079
So first, CPS workers are supposed to investigate any reports that come so from the teacher,

105
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,520
from a parent, from whoever, whomever, in a timely fashion.

106
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:48,839
And I really want to highlight that. So we hear a lot about the system being overburdened and these reports not being conducted in a timely fashion.

107
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:58,260
And this is like a bedrock element of this process, is that if something comes,

108
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:04,530
you need to investigate it in a timely fashion because it could not fall under one of these categories.

109
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:12,059
Or it could. And the key is that if it does, that kid is in danger and that kid is in danger of getting harmed further.

110
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,469
And so you need to kind of figure out what's going on with can you do that by

111
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:22,140
assessing the risk and supporting families to sort of take care of the kid?

112
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,540
That's when if you guys remember swamp nurse and the home visiting program.

113
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:35,400
So like we've talked about home visiting programs, this is great resource and a great source of format for intervention for families.

114
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:45,060
Sometimes those home visiting programs can be mandated because they're put in place as a CPS action.

115
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:50,370
And so you can imagine, like I've talked a lot about parent engagement, parent engagement interventions.

116
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:56,100
If you're the parent who is doing a home visiting program under CPS mandates,

117
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,059
that's going to be a less ideal situation to engage in this home visiting.

118
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,920
So you can see that's like a special circumstance, but it's kind of a common circumstance.

119
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:13,020
So just thinking about all those things about like Find and the other types of interventions in the CPS context,

120
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,980
they're probably interpreted very differently by parents on average.

121
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,409
The other thing, if we do find that there's something going on with the child,

122
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:28,530
you really want to make it an important goal of the CPS process is to provide that child with a safe space,

123
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:34,950
because if the child is not safe in the home, the child is removed from the home or should be removed.

124
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:43,290
Right. And then if the child is removed from the home, we want to have a plan for the child returning to the home,

125
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,550
reuniting with the parents, planning for a permanent situation, ideally with the family.

126
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,170
So that's again, that's how the system should work in this context where something really bad is happening to the child.

127
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:08,159
And then this is just another like schematic kind of showing all these different points of how kind of what happens in the system.

128
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:16,709
So there's this suspicion and this report that some of us probably might have made for mandated reporters, which can be kind of stressful to do.

129
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:21,120
Right, because you're just sort of going, I don't know, I don't have all the information.

130
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,139
This seemed strange to me. It seemed like there was something going on.

131
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:30,719
This child said something. It was a little ambiguous. We've talked a lot about all these developmental shifts.

132
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:39,150
Right. And how kids express emotions, how kids describe situations, kids, you know, orientation to time, kids magical thinking.

133
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:47,040
So like this is really unclear what we're getting in terms of what what we might receive from kids.

134
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,079
So there's a lot of uncertainty just like emanating from the child,

135
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,819
especially if we're talking about like young kids, preschoolers, they say random stuff.

136
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,470
Sometimes you're like, What did I miss here? That did you mean that?

137
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:08,550
Are you talking to reality? You know? So like, how do you get and interpret and use that information?

138
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,170
One thing that I think about, we talked to, you know,

139
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:19,799
like trainees that that may interact with kids about this is that you're like one part of this process.

140
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:27,570
And that's also important to understand. Again, for those of us who may have been or might be mandated reporters, you're like one.

141
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:35,940
Data point, right. And so if you make a report, it's not like you're recommending that that child is taken away from their family,

142
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,880
but you're giving information to the system,

143
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:49,390
the CPS system, that can allow them to then sort of assess the situation in much more detail than you would in your life.

144
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,320
Single interaction with this child who said something funky.

145
00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:04,600
Does that make sense? And so, again, we know there's a lot of problems in how this system operates, but it is there ideally to protect children.

146
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,880
So we make reports and then that report may be screened out.

147
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,010
It may also be that that particular report is screened out,

148
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:23,850
but that family or that child might have ten reports that have been called in like the hyper high school.

149
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,809
But like the the daycare teacher might have called something in the research assistant who they were participating in the study,

150
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:37,750
the neighbor, lots of different reports. And so then the CPS file starts to look a little more like, Hmm, we better go check out what's going on.

151
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,590
Because this family, your child keeps getting called in.

152
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:55,089
Yeah, only one of the readings begins with, like, 50% of children who go to, like, foster care end up being returned to their primary caregiver.

153
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:59,950
And I'm wondering, like, if there are multiple reports.

154
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:08,510
Like you're saying that like it's like multiple reports, multiple reports leading to maybe like involving like CPS,

155
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:16,330
but if there's only like one or those kids still getting like put in foster parents in return.

156
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,830
Like, I just because it seems really high. Yeah.

157
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,150
Which I was surprised by. But I'm just kind of wondering, like, what's going on?

158
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,540
Yeah, yeah, it's a good question. So. Ah.

159
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,690
And I'm not sure which, which I know I gave a lot of is some of these readings are a little bit dense I think that.

160
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,550
Yea and Wildmon reading this one is really good. It sort of goes through a lot of the key info.

161
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:48,129
And so I don't want to like I don't want to state some statistic that will be wrong.

162
00:17:48,130 --> 00:18:01,690
Right. But in terms of process, the likelihood that a child would be all the way to foster care with one report unless it's really,

163
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:07,170
really clear you know is low Israelis.

164
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:18,200
And so what we know is that, you know, the more reports that are sort of submitted before a family,

165
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:23,030
the more likely that one would be investigating the family.

166
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:32,270
We know also that this process, like there are certainly issues of like disproportionality of who is reported.

167
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,030
And so that can also play into who's investigated.

168
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:44,270
We also know so here, if we're like following this, like so safety concerns exist.

169
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:49,300
That sense and risk and significance would generally prompt an investigation.

170
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:59,180
Like if that single report shows, gosh, you know, this child looks like they have you know, they have bruises, they're unexplained.

171
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,800
They were in an E.R. The parent seems to be, you know, intoxicated.

172
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,060
There's not, you know, lots of factors that make it maybe a single incident,

173
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:13,910
but a lot going on in that incident like that and sort of uncovering a lot in terms of what the family is experiencing.

174
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:25,940
So then there would be an investigation. And in that investigation you can have two outcomes which are substantiated case and substantiated.

175
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:31,650
And that family may then have a closed case, but then they may pop up again on the radar.

176
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:43,069
So, you know, there's this whole kind of situation up here where it's there's a lot of different ways that people can get into the system,

177
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,500
like all the reporters, all these reporters.

178
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:52,370
But then there's also these bigger social contextual factors like race and poverty that sort of drive people into the system disproportionately.

179
00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:00,149
What else? I guess the other thing here, like we've spent like in this class,

180
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:06,570
we spend a fair bit of time right here talking about like what's going on with family is what's parenting look like,

181
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:14,460
you know, what is, you know what what's happening in the family context that can kind of stress out the family unit and parents and kids.

182
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:20,520
And so, again, this whole investigative process is really complicated.

183
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,959
And I think that's the other thing that this just, you know, maybe that sounds really, really obvious,

184
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:32,970
but it's just really important to highlight because we know that it's under kind of, you know, staffed system.

185
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:41,130
Any person dealing with one CPS case or suspected case of child abuse like that is a huge amount of stress, right.

186
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:47,979
For one for a person, because you're trying to, you know, figure out whether a child has been abused.

187
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,600
You're witnessing maybe a child who's really been abused, which is stressful.

188
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,569
Right. And it's hard to not take it that stress.

189
00:20:54,570 --> 00:21:02,100
And so I think, you know, there's a lot of kind of research and I think that's really important work, intervention, work,

190
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:11,160
looking at sort of burnout and secondary trauma amongst CPS workers because it is a very challenging job and position.

191
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,200
So again, like they're working in a system that's far from perfect.

192
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,990
Lots of imperfections in the system we'll talk about.

193
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:26,010
But they're also doing a job that is just very, very difficult and just brings in a lot of stress.

194
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,590
Um, okay. The other place for rethinking this class we've spent a fair bit of time is like youth services.

195
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:40,710
And so like what would one recommend to support a family who's in this situation of,

196
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,909
you know, maybe their child is at risk for abuse that may be there?

197
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,270
And that's like nothing's really happened to this child.

198
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,589
But I see like this mom is highly stressed. They're living in poverty.

199
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:57,450
She has no supports, you know, social supports in the community, you know, family support.

200
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,609
This child really seems to have behavior issues that are causing you know, they're getting sick all the time.

201
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:03,629
Mom can't go to work.

202
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:11,220
You know, like all these things are sort of piling up and that feels more like a risky situation, like something could happen here.

203
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:15,900
And so let's get this parents, this mom, in this case, some supports.

204
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:22,500
And that's where we kind of go into lots of directions that I talked about with the home visiting or parenting classes or all these other things.

205
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:33,430
So ideally, you know, these kind of things work and then the family leaves the system and then here you're sort of in more of the space of,

206
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,300
okay, the child has been harmed, there's a risk for maltreatment.

207
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:45,000
You know, the family can do voluntary services. The family has them has treatment.

208
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:53,310
And then all down here. So I'll just for you guys can't see necessarily here so it may be that the child there is abuse,

209
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,960
there is treatment and it's successful and the child is reunified with the family.

210
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,920
And that is what we want, right? That's what the system is trying to work towards.

211
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:10,020
You can imagine this takes a lot of time. And when we've talked about child separation and trauma and so even under the best case circumstance,

212
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:18,629
if there is abuse or if there is a substantiated case, it's going to take some time for that process to work its way through.

213
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,810
And so there's again, at this university,

214
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:28,260
there's a lot of really great people who work with the family court system and like train

215
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:33,299
incoming or lawyers and training who are going to be working with family court around,

216
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,320
hey, this parent child relationship is really important. Like let's try not to disrupt it.

217
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,570
That's actually a really valuable thing. It's not nothing to take a one year old away from their family.

218
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:48,540
So I think you guys could all go to that, you know, the other kinds of situations.

219
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:55,559
So here, custody is granted to a relative. And we talked about kin care with incarcerated families here.

220
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:01,950
Parents rights are terminated and that case could go to adoption or legal guardianship, not of the parent.

221
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,969
And then here, this is a child in foster care.

222
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:11,850
So then the child is just out of foster care at age 18 and goes to independent living.

223
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:19,830
And so you can imagine like those are really different outcomes for a child and for a family who gets involved with the system.

224
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:27,000
So any questions, thoughts about that, it's complicated.

225
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,280
And, you know, it doesn't always work perfectly this way,

226
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:40,140
but this is sort of the goal so that you guys have that what is permanent legal guardianship look like in this one?

227
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:51,450
Yeah, well, until the child turns 18 that adults who is the permanent legal guardian is responsible for that child's welfare.

228
00:24:52,920 --> 00:25:00,710
So. But they may not necessarily need to adopt the child to be in that circumstance, in that role.

229
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:05,480
But that makes sense. Yeah, I'm just was trying to wonder, like, who that is.

230
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:13,850
I guess that would be like it. Like, things still go like a foster care home, and, like, that person would have the legal guardianship.

231
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,690
It could be. Or it could be kin. I mean, ideally.

232
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:28,460
Mostly. Usually. Ideally, it would be kin. So like a sister, an aunt, you know, usually female kin, a, you know, parent wouldn't really.

233
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:37,040
That's probably a level of legal complexity that I don't have it in terms of the parental rights or terminated for one,

234
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,300
that would just go to the other parent.

235
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:46,940
But legal guardianship, like if you guys have ever like recruited for a research study and are trying to recruit kids into a research study,

236
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:54,800
you have to know if that child's parent has the legal right to sign them up to be in a research study,

237
00:25:54,860 --> 00:26:00,139
let alone for medical procedures and that kind of thing. So that's that legal status that someone can sign.

238
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,950
It's okay for this child to do this thing because I'm no legal guardian.

239
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,090
So that's like a Guardians perspective. Does that make sense?

240
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,750
Yeah, I guess I. I was, like, confused since.

241
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:16,910
Since it was like in some box. I was, like, trying to think of like, who who else could.

242
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,610
Yeah, yeah. I mean, a range of people could, could step in to that too.

243
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:28,489
Um, one of the main differences between like having countries and not is kinship there,

244
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:35,070
but unless the rights are terminated, like you still have to get parents to sign all of like permission slips.

245
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:39,930
Yes, medical forms, everything like that. That's true. Whereas if that someone has a yeah.

246
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:45,080
If someone's a permanent guardian, then that person has to start signing like all the official forms.

247
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,990
And that usually only would happen like after the parental rights are turned.

248
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:58,350
Right. So even if like think about last week, so even if a parent is incarcerated, that certainly doesn't mean their parental rights are terminated.

249
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:05,069
So that's a temporary situation where exactly that situation like somebody has physical custody of the child,

250
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,610
but not that sort of ability to sign them up for these legal,

251
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:16,889
legal things, including and I mentioned the research study thing again, because this this isn't one of these things that can happen.

252
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:22,469
The child can be in this situation that they signed up for the research study here.

253
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:30,900
Right. You have a longitudinal research study and then some of your participants, parents or the parent themselves, are become incarcerated.

254
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,040
And so, you know, technically, is the child still enrolled in your study?

255
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,999
Do you have to read consent form? You have to read consent would be incarcerated parents.

256
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,260
So it's just it's a nuance that is really important, but it's in this in-between space.

257
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:55,860
It's a really good point. Nick. I think that you have that come in and that's why I'm living at home right now, because I have no money anyways.

258
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:04,180
We have we are in a legal guardian guardianship situation since the kid came over from China.

259
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,269
So. The parent is Chinese.

260
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:16,440
So we had to take legal guardianship child because he was living in his home.

261
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,350
So for other guardianship reasons.

262
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:25,450
Yeah. And I think some people also choose to give up their children.

263
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,980
That's not. Forced to give up their children to.

264
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,180
I don't I know that's kind of a terrible thing to.

265
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,690
Like in this situation, it seemed like they didn't want.

266
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:48,310
Yeah. I mean, there's. Yeah. I mean, usually if you're in this system.

267
00:28:50,540 --> 00:29:00,080
This is kind of coming as a command, but it could be presented as a potential choice to a parent.

268
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:10,490
I think the other. Well, we'll talk more about this aging out piece, but that's something that's really important, because just think about, you know,

269
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:20,830
being an 18 year old, especially an 18 year old who's kind of not had, you know, the they've had a fairly rocky family experience to date.

270
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:30,490
And so I think that's a really important like developmental period for intervention that's getting increased attention as appropriate.

271
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,669
And just thinking about, you know, being young adults, right.

272
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:43,910
And trying to afford living and going to school and all these things that young adults do on your own without support is really, really hard.

273
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,760
So, yeah, so let's hear you guys do a little discussion.

274
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:59,990
But I wanted to also just point out so here's just, you know, child trends that are anti Casey kids count always a great source for data.

275
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:09,340
So I think in the mini lecture the data I had, we're just sort of going on before 2020, but look what happened in 2020.

276
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,979
So what does that what do you guys think about that? Are we just doing awesome?

277
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:21,790
And there's so many kids who are not in foster care. That's.

278
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:29,480
Yeah. And I worked in foster care and I know that for a while people were having to do,

279
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:37,070
like home visits virtually, like you would get a call about the child abuse and that was really pandemic.

280
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:46,910
Like you would be asked to do a face time and walk through like a parent's home or a child is potentially like being abused.

281
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:50,840
And I just think that that is like ridiculous because how are you supposed to

282
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,980
get an accurate representation of like what's going on or support the parents?

283
00:30:55,490 --> 00:31:01,550
And so I think that because of that, there was a low number of kids going into foster care,

284
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,360
which is great because if you have kids, just stay with their parents. But in those like serious situations, that wasn't great.

285
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:14,719
But I think a lot of foster parents were also worried about opening their home up to having kids coming in

286
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,570
and out because a lot of kids don't necessarily stay in foster care for like months or even years at a time.

287
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:26,450
They're like in and out and they're in different homes and you can have multiple different kids coming in and out in a week.

288
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,380
So I think that was really hard to get kids placed in foster care when there's a limited number of homes.

289
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,260
Mm hmm. And so in that covered context, just in every way, just uniquely affected,

290
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,610
you're also like when kids weren't at school, so they weren't seeing, like, teachers and everything.

291
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,610
Yeah, really? There's so much than that. Mm hmm.

292
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,390
And yeah, I know, but. Yeah.

293
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:56,200
And I imagine being a parent to like, okay, you're going to have this evaluation, but it's by face time and you're controlling the phone.

294
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:05,300
Like it just it's sort of nonsensical, like you said, Oh, no, I was just not going to work in school anymore.

295
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:12,080
See your doctor. And so like you weren't interacting with any of these workers to with reports.

296
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:21,169
To the same point. Yeah. So like all those people who were the mandated reporters, we're not seeing the kids.

297
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:30,410
Right. And so kind of in those first weeks, like you said, week of COVID, when it was sort of becoming reality, that like, wait a minute,

298
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:35,209
nobody's going to go anywhere and see anybody in person except the people that they happened to be with at

299
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:42,530
that moment that like struck panic into the hearts of a lot of child welfare folks because they were like,

300
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,790
oh, my gosh, what is going to happen to these kids?

301
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:54,560
And in terms of the data like this is kind of what happened and that's the most up to date that they have right now.

302
00:32:54,560 --> 00:33:02,750
But I mean, it's basically like half the number of kids who are being put into foster care compared to beforehand.

303
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:13,750
And so and we'll we'll we'll talk a little bit more about COVID, but thinking about this definition which anyone else, I haven't had any lecture.

304
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:21,969
What do you guys think about this as sort of foster care members of this, of the kids who are over here, you know, with a substantiated case?

305
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,550
They're not with their family and they might go into foster care.

306
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:32,650
Anything that sort of strikes you guys about this way to think about this definition?

307
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:39,040
Yeah, I think it's a temporary learning situation, I think can be true in some cases.

308
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,190
But I feel like from personal experience with the people we know,

309
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,470
we're foster parents and then they ended up being in a situation where they were able to adopt.

310
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,750
So I think at first we mean it's like a temporary little situation, but it's not always where like.

311
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:00,420
Foster parents can have an opportunity to adopt. So it's interesting to see what we're reading.

312
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:07,530
Yeah. Yeah. So there's that time element for which for lots of reasons may or may not be temporary.

313
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:22,660
Other thoughts? I'll say one other thing about timing.

314
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,830
It's often not only one situation, but it can be many.

315
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:34,360
So depending on kind of placement and availability, which we'll talk about, that many kids might go to multiple situations.

316
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:39,549
So. It's you know, we know about the transitions, right.

317
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:47,890
And kids and separations and stable environment. So like if it's one situation that's better than if it's multiple.

318
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:56,080
But for the reality, the reality for many kids, not all, but is that there are many different temporary living situations.

319
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:05,110
And so just thinking about developmentally what that implies for a kid already who's having stress trauma, separation from their parent.

320
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,030
Yeah. Any other thoughts and definition? Yeah.

321
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:17,680
Caroline Yeah, I was just thinking about other kids who are also in a similar like in temporary living situations,

322
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,250
whether it's like well placed together in a foster care situation or just like interacting.

323
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:30,520
That can be good because. Shared experience like.

324
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:41,680
But also I have to Gen-X and like I don't know if there's other kids that have been really traumatized and they're all together.

325
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:49,300
What's how that could play out? Absolutely. So one kind of care setting is a group home.

326
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:56,709
And certainly that's that's the case for older kids. It's one thing to get an infant out of foster care from foster care.

327
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:01,720
And it's a different thing to be a foster parent to a 13 year old or a 16 year old.

328
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,040
And so that group home setting is often where those older kids end up.

329
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,260
And that is something that can happen.

330
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,519
Yeah, you know, just something else I was thinking about doing it is just the part where it says like, these parents can't take care of them.

331
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,340
And things like the need for care has come to our attention.

332
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:24,640
And so I think, like sometimes it's like who is then defining like that the parents can take care of them and.

333
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:33,230
The need for care is more like me for resources, like in a family context, in order to be able to take care of the child.

334
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:39,180
So I think sometimes it's just like, you know, there's like crises instead of actually really helping.

335
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,580
Maybe like the root of the issue, they just sort of take the child away in foster care.

336
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:50,320
But like, are you really helping like the parent maybe get what they need in order to be able to take care of their child?

337
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:55,879
So just something that I thought was interesting. Yeah, yeah, definitely.

338
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:04,440
Definitely. Yeah. Carly, I was sorry. That's what I was thinking too, about how it's very child focused, which is good, but, um,

339
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:12,379
the need for care, it should be like, need for care for the child, but also focus on the parents.

340
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:21,290
So this is a temporary situation instead of just becoming a solution to a problem because then, sure, the need for care is still there,

341
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:25,490
but are they going to be getting the care that they really need if they're not only there temporarily?

342
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:32,180
Mm hmm. Yeah, absolutely. And so and that's that sort of that that neglect piece, too.

343
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:38,540
And if you guys think about like, right, like towards the beginning of this class, there's that video of like sort of parents,

344
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,910
you know, executive functioning skills and parents stress and how that impacts, you know, their ability to parent, to parent.

345
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:50,500
And all of that is super relevant here. Right.

346
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:57,110
So yeah, there's the temporary piece in lots of ways is important to consider and like

347
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,950
deconstruct a little bit and then come to the attention of child child welfare staff.

348
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:12,000
Yeah. Yeah. Um, I also think that Vicki but like, there's no attention to like quality or like prepared that the child experience,

349
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:18,620
like you may remove them from a potentially unsafe condition, but then are you going to put them in a safer spot,

350
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:24,280
or is it just going to be something to someone who maybe looks like they have it more together, you know,

351
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:30,540
really kind of like foster care situations where they're not really doing much better than that often.

352
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:40,129
So yeah, and so definitely some things to know and I think I used to kind of delve into this.

353
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:44,390
But you know, there is a vetting process for being a foster parent.

354
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:48,710
There is support offered. As you can imagine.

355
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,579
It's not. Foster parents aren't paid very much to do this.

356
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:57,400
They're paid a little. And it's an under-resourced system.

357
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:03,920
Right. So that Leslie Love article is talking about some of the interventions that we can think about in terms of supporting foster parents.

358
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:09,950
And some have really been super effective in terms of looking at impact on child outcomes.

359
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:17,029
And so, yeah, that quality piece is also missing in terms of where people go.

360
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:22,580
So there's nothing really about it except about temporary. Um, so that's a really good point.

361
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:34,550
And I think that this is just important to kind of keep in mind to this idea that, you know, there is, it's an imperfect system.

362
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:49,040
There is a often, especially when there are multiple reports, if the risk is determined to be more severe in terms of family context,

363
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:54,169
that the child has been experiencing maltreatment, but it's not a perfect system.

364
00:39:54,170 --> 00:40:03,680
So I just want to point that out. And then I thought what we could do is have you guys break out a little and think

365
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,979
about some of these things and really consider so this is foster care specifically.

366
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:18,049
I think that foster care group home placements. So like when the child is removed from the home, it's supposed to be the option of last resort really,

367
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:22,100
because keeping the child with the family is where we want to be and what we want to accomplish.

368
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:27,799
But thinking about, you know, what? What would we need to do to be able to keep the child of the family?

369
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:34,340
What kind of supports thinking about the separation and then of the separations impact on the child?

370
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:38,780
So even if like I was talking about last week, kids who have an incarcerated mom,

371
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:46,250
they may have experienced abuse from that mom, for example, but it's still their mom.

372
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:54,200
And so that child still carries in their head, you know, their parent or their representation of their parent.

373
00:40:54,890 --> 00:41:02,390
And so thinking about what the separation of the impact is on the child and how we want to manage that,

374
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,270
we know there's racial disproportionality which came up in the number of the readings

375
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:13,790
and who is investigated and policed and like what supports are put in place,

376
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:19,729
you know, for families. And then we've talked a little bit about placement challenges.

377
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:23,270
So like who's available? Is it a high quality situation?

378
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,120
What's happening for like older? Kids versus younger kids.

379
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:33,860
What are the different placement challenges, like imagining being the foster parent and thinking about, okay, can I take an infant?

380
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,100
Can I take a grade schooler? Can I take an adolescent?

381
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:49,790
Okay, so thinking about this overburdened system, we know supports are needed, but I'd like you guys to discuss what they should be.

382
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:58,520
And what would you like? Recommend sort of prioritizing in terms of ways to make this system work a little bit better.

383
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:06,560
Again, without just sort of saying like, we're just going to start over, which we also could do like knowing, you know, what is just now.

384
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:18,980
So we can just sort of break out in our little groups where we're sitting in this room, but maybe pairs would actually work best for the moment.

385
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:24,590
So do you guys want to pair up? So this involves sort of by twos already.

386
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:39,439
And then you guys, let's go over to are you guys going to have a group of three that also physically works out turning around?

387
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:51,380
It's just fine. All right. So what we're you going to figure out?

388
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:58,230
I feel like.

389
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:07,990
Was. Now.

390
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:23,250
They are not in the center here. Your.

391
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:36,340
I think that means that, you know what?

392
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,950
Maybe I learned something. I mean, I wish.

393
00:43:49,850 --> 00:44:04,830
Like yourself, the border with Syria.

394
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:21,989
But I think if they want to.

395
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:31,950
But I don't think that's the right.

396
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:42,720
I know. Just like many.

397
00:44:48,540 --> 00:45:10,660
360. I was born on July four, nine years old.

398
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:24,060
I do not believe that. Was like yeah I don't think I ever myself to have.

399
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:34,180
You just can't be a part of your current strategy.

400
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:55,300
The other two is not right for everybody.

401
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:15,200
How do you like. You know, you see, like.

402
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:33,400
That gives me a feeling that they can communicate with their current family around this time.

403
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:41,850
But the people I truly care about is not just that.

404
00:46:56,610 --> 00:47:03,640
That's what I learned.

405
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:20,040
That's all I know. That's usually more.

406
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:36,150
Not only from. They have not.

407
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:47,060
The each incident in her life. I guess you could probably say that.

408
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:58,680
Her grandmother.

409
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:24,290
I just wasn't able to figure out what I was doing.

410
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:48,670
There's something else. There something.

411
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,150
And here, here's my.

412
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:05,920
You know it comes out with husband and I like.

413
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:14,250
On the other. I think that.

414
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:22,350
Really? I've been.

415
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:33,630
I have no idea. Whatever they.

416
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:43,220
Yeah. And like I don't know how is so it's that.

417
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:59,680
It's a great story. I think you guys could wrap up in a sec and think about what our recommendations might look like.

418
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:16,470
Yeah, I don't think anyone ready with a recommendation.

419
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:24,350
I think the other thing with recommendations is think about for whom the supports are needed, something like that.

420
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:46,690
All right. So let's see what sort of recommendations are for whom supports to be put in place, what any specific.

421
00:50:50,160 --> 00:51:01,230
But yeah, we talked a lot about how you can't really factor for potential biases that like a foster parent may be, in fact the child.

422
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:12,560
We also have a situation my cousins have been in and out of the foster care system, a lot of like child being separated from the parents.

423
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,920
But in my cousin's cases, they were also separated from each other.

424
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:26,280
So siblings being separated is huge. And we talked about how like you should try to keep the siblings together if possible,

425
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:34,230
and also in a safe place where like viruses are not negatively affecting on them even more.

426
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:41,940
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Yeah. So those are, like, two really specific recommendations of foster care placement.

427
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,299
So, like, before we're even in the system trying to keep those siblings together because know we were talking about that as well.

428
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:53,129
So that is a huge issue. And that's been, again, like increasing attention to that.

429
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:57,360
But because of sort of capacity issues, not always able to be met.

430
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:05,250
But try like that is also a really important relationship that especially in times of stress and trauma,

431
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,959
that relational health is really important and that can certainly be a sibling.

432
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,900
And then again, if you're separating, siblings are kind of, you know, bring up the relational damages.

433
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:19,230
So. Absolutely. Good point. And then with the foster care parents.

434
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:28,770
Could we put some more supports around, you know, bias, anti-racist, you know, training?

435
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:33,540
What is that? But like, okay, is that a goal for foster care, parent training?

436
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:38,670
Yeah, maybe that should be a goal. You know, part of the kind of supports available.

437
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:44,640
Awesome. Okay. Any other ideas? Recommendations from another team?

438
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:53,810
Sure, Kenny. Just thinking about, like the parents who are having their kids removed.

439
00:52:54,680 --> 00:53:02,810
I think they need so many more supports because of an like a very long list of things that they have to be hired to get their kids returned to them.

440
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:08,839
But then you're also asking them to like maybe go to therapy or have to go to like a court meetings.

441
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,710
And they have to maybe go to like addiction counseling and think after hearing

442
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:18,000
one plus of your parents get paid like monthly stipend to care for the kids,

443
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:25,330
and what can you do monthly stipends to the parents as they're trying to get themselves into a better place to get their kids back.

444
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:34,150
Like then, you know, if they have to miss work to go to court or they have to miss work to go to their treatment or therapy to start

445
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:40,850
have like money to even just buy their kids beds when they move back in or like have enough money for groceries.

446
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:46,520
If you're also getting like four kids back into your house on like a random Tuesday, that's like hard to plan for.

447
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:51,500
So yeah, we were talking mostly about like supports for parents and stuff like that.

448
00:53:53,050 --> 00:54:01,810
I love it. And thinking about if we were able to and I know I said we're doing it here now because when kids are already placed but like if we could

449
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:13,780
get make that a big focus of the parent pre removal set of activities because if we can imagine if a child has been taken out of the home,

450
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:21,850
that parent was probably not functioning optimally in the best way that they could for lots of reasons.

451
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:24,040
Right. That's probably likely.

452
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:32,560
And so then again, that parent is not going to be sort of placed with these additional activities and proving your parents,

453
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:37,990
you know, your parenting worth and all these things that we put on parents whose children are the system.

454
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,979
And a lot of those things are really good and supportive and important.

455
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:46,400
And not to say that they're not important, but thinking about that burden like, yeah,

456
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:51,280
your kids are not in the home, so you can maybe turn attention to these things.

457
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,640
But it's, it's, it's more supports could be needed.

458
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:58,780
Um, political will for that. I don't know. That's a challenge.

459
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:03,660
That's a big challenge, right? Because we like to blame parents a lot for everything.

460
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:10,899
So yes, there is an equitable standpoint to making sure that like parents who are incarcerated,

461
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:19,720
are also getting those same resources, because if they're not, then you're just kind of like creating more divide or like.

462
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:28,840
Yeah. Mm hmm. Yeah. There's a lot that we place on parents who are already operating under, like, non optimal conditions.

463
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:34,220
And then what supports are there on the back end like a reentry?

464
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,640
Yes, absolutely. Oh.

465
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:44,489
Oh, sorry. I thought you had. I mean, I can tell when we kind of talk.

466
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:49,680
So we talked about, like, giving us something for, you know, like, kind of like those,

467
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:53,250
like on the cusp parents, you know, kind of giving us support for now.

468
00:55:53,610 --> 00:56:00,059
But then we also talked about how, um, for, like the parents who do foster children kind of,

469
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:03,959
instead of just looking at the capacity of that specific family and looking at their

470
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:09,480
like social support systems and the community around them and also support that family,

471
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:16,350
you must be comfortable how like the families that are able to do that often have the support systems in place,

472
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:21,090
you know, that allow them to be able to take care of multiple children that are not.

473
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:28,770
They're also making sure that they have those support systems in place and the people that they can reach out to so that,

474
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:33,780
you know, it's a community effort. It's not just the burden having a family.

475
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:41,459
Yeah. Yeah. And I think I talk about you guys and knowing that they're going to get a kid who's maybe at the least,

476
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:47,520
like, stirred up and kind of stressed out, if not really suffering from trauma, maltreatment and abuse.

477
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:52,120
And so they're not and it's not their own kid.

478
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,839
Right. So they just don't have a history of that kid.

479
00:56:54,840 --> 00:57:05,100
There's lots and lots of reasons that that's not like your typical parenting day and made me think of something else as you were talking.

480
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:11,010
Oh, yeah. That, you know, foster care is really considered like an intervention.

481
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:18,059
Right. And to function as an intervention, we've talked a lot about like parenting interventions.

482
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,790
When you have to provide support, you have to provide transportation,

483
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:25,980
meals and childcare and all these sort of things that we want to provide so that an intervention works.

484
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:35,100
And if we think about foster care as an intervention for, you know, the kids, the families, how do we, you know, kind of work to make it better?

485
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:38,280
And that would be an important way to support those foster care families.

486
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,690
Yeah. I mean, any things that haven't been mentioned so far. Yeah. Yeah.

487
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:47,190
Talked about was actually I was brought up in a reading, I don't know, maybe it's weeks ago,

488
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:54,059
but really looking at like the legal system and like the definition of like languages and because we were talking about kind of like some of

489
00:57:54,060 --> 00:58:03,420
the discrepancies of like cases of like the horror stories that you hear that like aren't the found and then also the ones that you're like,

490
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:12,929
I slept in and my child was taken for three years. So thinking about like the descriptions say is like theoretically like there should be a many

491
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:20,370
like checkpoints that would like prevent some things from happening but with like without clear,

492
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:26,579
like language in the legal system and like it's up to a lot of people's like moral like opinions and

493
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:31,800
values and like what the judge may decide or whoever the person is that's like doing the reporting.

494
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:40,260
Um, and then also like the legal system itself is like the legal process is like super overwhelming,

495
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:45,989
confusing, and the language that's used is really challenging.

496
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:49,350
So like, from like a parent standpoint, like going through that process,

497
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:57,250
there should be some more support to understand the legal process and also like quality representation and um,

498
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:03,160
all that stuff since it's a big legal process. So it is a big legal process.

499
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:07,950
Yeah. And if any of us think about like, you know, we're trying to take in information and you're stressed,

500
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:13,169
you don't take in information very well and it's hard to remember stuff and it doesn't really sink in.

501
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:15,870
And there's a lot of just deep, yeah,

502
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:28,690
complicated process jargon and really impactful and meaningful decisions that are being made that may not entirely clear up to the people affected.

503
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:36,920
So yeah, that's a really great point. Is there any did you have any other thoughts?

504
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:43,380
I like the supporting the parents, the the origin parents more, the foster care parents, the child themselves.

505
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,849
Lots of different spaces for improvement. Yeah.

506
00:59:47,850 --> 01:00:01,660
Caroline sketched out and we talked about like maybe it is training or training for like a foster parent, but also just like felt like, oh yes, yes.

507
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:05,489
So that at the beginning of that system is like think about prevention.

508
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:13,260
So if we could do that, remember back also to that preschool article about the like preschool African-American boys who were expelled at higher rates.

509
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:20,840
Great opportunity for interaction as well. Yeah, just like we've talked about, like the system being overburdened.

510
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:28,579
So we talked a little bit about just like using funding maybe like for like social workers who are also overburdened by like having a lot of

511
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:35,930
cases and maybe like that also contributes to maybe like not adequately like going through an assessment and like rushing kids into foster care,

512
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:40,010
maybe because they're overburdened and like trying to get kids out of situations that they think are harmful,

513
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:46,460
but also thinking about like maybe for like the stipend that their foster families get.

514
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:50,240
Like if maybe that is improved, then maybe more people would be willing to foster,

515
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:55,250
maybe keep siblings together because they're able to go to other homes where there's not other children and avoid like from home,

516
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:58,290
which sometimes cannot be great situations for children.

517
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:05,650
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Absolutely. So a lot of you know, a lot of the things that are similar to what we talked about in other venues.

518
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,820
Right. And of course, it's all interrelated.

519
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:17,329
But this is a really kind of specific context with lots of different challenges and intervention points and that overburden piece.

520
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:26,959
Right. So that someone is not. So the decisions are made similarly that their data based and you know, again, this is all in place.

521
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,280
It's just not just but the implementation is like where it falls away.

522
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:40,760
So a lot of it is policy regulated, but it's not implemented and it's often not as tightly regulated as it could be.

523
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:48,979
So. Okay. So lots of good ideas in terms of what Reading said.

524
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,720
If people are interested, this is a good report.

525
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:59,630
So the Child Welfare Child Welfare Act is a good place for resources and like publications and factsheets and all kinds of things around,

526
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:04,069
you know, depending on where you fit in this larger system.

527
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:07,219
Like they have things for preschool teachers, educators, you know,

528
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:14,270
K through 12 and then this was a report that they did on Mr. Disproportionality with recommendations.

529
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:25,010
And then again from this Chris Wildman article, we know that if kids are, you know,

530
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:29,960
statistically kids who have experienced foster care are more likely to enter the criminal justice system.

531
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:36,110
And so that articles really focus on like, how do we kind of disassemble that, how do we break that cycle?

532
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:43,460
And so things we've already touched on. So we want to have sort of stability and permanency.

533
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:52,009
Um, and ideally, usually ideally again, I would say usually ideally because like if the skin care situations are a total mess,

534
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:56,720
you don't want to bring the kids to that kin care situation. But if it's not, you probably do.

535
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:06,439
So that's a key recommendation. Yeah. Yeah, I just the child ever get a choice like if they want to stay with the foster family because for example,

536
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:12,380
like if people have a divorce, the child usually. Which part they want to go there.

537
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:19,070
I was just curious if the argument is like you want to return the child to reform.

538
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:25,700
Right. If the child doesn't want to reform it. Are you, like trying to force that relationship back?

539
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:30,450
No longer considered an attachment. Mm hmm.

540
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:40,470
Yeah. So I definitely do not know the legal standing on that.

541
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:48,310
And I know that when I have talked with my colleagues who work with Family Court, it's usually with young, young kids.

542
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:54,270
So because you wouldn't expect to take the preference of a three year old necessarily.

543
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:58,010
And there are often situations where a child has been, you know,

544
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:03,329
with a different living situation and goes back to the parent and doesn't really know the parent.

545
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:06,030
And we've talked about that also with incarceration. But that does happen.

546
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:21,540
If you're talking about a 13 year old, I'm not sure what what the what the roots are for that child's voice to be entered in.

547
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:31,140
I believe there are more than enough of others. No, I'm just trying to think what I've heard from my like family court people.

548
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:35,580
So it's a good question. And I don't know the answer. I don't know.

549
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:40,290
I don't know if you've had that experience. Yeah. There's like a guardian ad litem.

550
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:43,530
Oh, yeah. A lawyer that all the kids have.

551
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:50,940
And so on behalf of the kids to talk to about what you want and then they are like representative in court.

552
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:59,700
Yeah. And sometimes the kid is older like they'll still like to talk and important things, but usually it's like their guardian ad litem.

553
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:05,670
Yeah. And I think that, I don't know, I've never seen a case of like a kid isn't returned to the parent.

554
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:10,409
But I think there's a lot of foster families that still have really close relationships with kids.

555
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:13,530
And maybe that's true. They would be like if a kid runs away, like, you know,

556
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:20,339
to go check out their old foster home over there or they are like heavily involved in their life in other ways.

557
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:25,530
Yeah. Usually still highly encouraged to like live with the parent, be back with their family.

558
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:29,459
Yeah. And yeah. So I know.

559
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:38,520
Yeah. Like if the guardian ad litem is able to do that, I think I'm thinking through like the legality.

560
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:47,700
Like at what point does the child's preference is that given legal weight and that.

561
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:54,060
I do not know that that's a good question. So it's important to ponder that again.

562
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:59,210
Yeah. So well investigate. Um,

563
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:04,200
I think the other kind of recommendations that they tick through in here are good

564
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:07,799
ones and we like we talked about legal supports already and certainly housing,

565
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:17,970
employment and these are things for older youth and for, I would say, foster care families who are working with for younger kids.

566
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:22,500
All of those things, all of those areas would be important.

567
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:28,709
And then this Leslie Web article talking about just really the interventions and this this should sound

568
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:33,000
pretty familiar to like lots of different populations of kids who might have experienced stress and trauma.

569
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:41,670
So reduce disruptions and transitions because we know that consistent, stable environments are good for kids.

570
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:48,930
And so they've already had at least one big disruption, but ideally reduce the number of placements because there's a lot of data to show.

571
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:53,670
The number of placements that you have is highly predictive of poor outcomes.

572
01:06:54,780 --> 01:07:02,519
So that's really important. Provide support to caregivers that you've mentioned and then making sure that both caregivers and

573
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:07,620
parents are trauma informed and just sort of take a trauma informed perspective with that idea of,

574
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:18,690
you know, interpreting a child's tantrum as maybe coming from a deeper place than just, you know, defiance of the foster parent, for example.

575
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:24,419
Um, and as well as CPS workers and I would say also mandated reporters.

576
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:27,270
So lots of the things that you guys come up with,

577
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:38,520
which is good and particularly again that that Chris Wildman article is good and that researcher has also done a lot with incarcerated families.

578
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:42,600
So again, lots of similarities to what we talked about last week around that.

579
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:46,170
And let's see. Okay.

580
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:52,920
So I just want to say a few other things around like how we get here and how we get to this different disproportionality.

581
01:07:53,880 --> 01:08:02,520
So there are certainly, you know, I think we talked about this a little bit when we went over.

582
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:09,030
Yeah, like the free range kids debate this idea of like who gets to be out in their neighborhood

583
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:15,389
and like who gets to take a nap and have their kids go to the playground and be like,

584
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:22,890
Oh, I didn't realize where my kids were. Like, It's, you know, wealthier, whiter populations living in richer neighborhoods.

585
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:35,540
Right? And so this idea of like. The mandated reporters and that sort of, you know, type bias training or something for mandated reporters.

586
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:44,000
But this was just an example of like, you know, a supermarket situation, right, where we've all seen a kid have a tantrum in a supermarket.

587
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:48,920
And we've all either, you know, been with the kid and been like, oh, gosh, this is awful,

588
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:55,370
or watched it and been like, I'm so glad I'm not that parent because it's a highly stressful situation or can be.

589
01:08:55,940 --> 01:09:01,729
And so, you know, this is a situation where this was like grabbed from a news story.

590
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:06,050
Like I think he was like pulling her hair on the, you know, on the cart.

591
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:10,879
And it just sort of brings up these issues of like who's a mandated reporter because like

592
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,320
people in the supermarket basically called and called the police and the police came.

593
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:22,310
And so, like, what can you do in your parenting in public and compared to behind closed doors,

594
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:27,200
thinking about sort of like where our parenting is observed and whose parenting is observed more.

595
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:33,220
And this idea of if you are the person in the supermarket or, you know,

596
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:39,980
at a public park or something, and you see something that you go, Huh, what's going on there?

597
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:46,850
That doesn't seem ideal. You know, see if you can have some empathy for the parents and where they might be coming from.

598
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:52,340
And then this example of like, you know, the home alone thing about like, oh, we love this kid.

599
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:58,160
And, you know, and that's someone here at your father who works a lot in this space and is very aware.

600
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:06,950
Like if we had been in a different, you know, socioeconomic or race situation, that situation would have turned out perhaps very differently.

601
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,909
So I think that's we can all appreciate that,

602
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:17,510
but it really plays out a lot in the parenting realm because we really love to blame parents for lots of things.

603
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:21,920
Okay. And I think this is also related.

604
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:33,530
So Annie has noted, like, you know, during the pandemic, like the number of reports just shrunk because, you know, people didn't see kids.

605
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:42,650
And so there have been some articles that have come out and said like that was actually great for a lot of parents who were like over,

606
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:55,610
you know, reported into the system. And I think what we want to know, like kind of as we go forward and look at the data, was this great?

607
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:02,180
We don't know. I would say we don't know yet. We do know that COVID was causing a lot more family stress.

608
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:09,590
So on average, I would imagine and there are certainly studies to show this like interpersonal violence went up,

609
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:15,560
you know, more firearms are in the home because everybody was purchasing firearms like crazy.

610
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:23,900
You know, lots of different COVID driven family stress and family process changes.

611
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:29,600
Parents were working and so kids were less supervised, as we've talked about before.

612
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:41,330
But for parents who are living in sort of the overly policed state by CPS, like maybe this was a welcome reprieve, right?

613
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:51,319
So I think it's an interesting question to think about how the sort of lack of reporting might have this article is about

614
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:59,300
like basically building neighborhood supports for parents who are stressed and might be at risk for abusing their kids.

615
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:06,050
But if there's a better sort of neighborhood social support system, that risk decreased.

616
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:10,010
So I think I just present this to be like, we don't know,

617
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:15,350
watch this space and let's see what happens in terms of the data, because this is a space where we collect a lot of data.

618
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:25,280
Okay. I think we've talked about some of these things here, but I'll just say a few key placement challenges.

619
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:29,120
I think we've actually mostly touched on many things, which is good.

620
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:34,160
So older kids are harder to police than younger kids.

621
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:40,069
And that that piece that Greyson mentioned around adoption and a lot of foster

622
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:45,320
care parents can end up maybe adopting an infant that is placed with them.

623
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:52,580
If the parental rights are terminated early on, usually that sometimes parental rights can be terminated at birth.

624
01:12:53,210 --> 01:13:01,460
This is, again, a changing space. But it used to be much more common that if parents had evidence of drugs and not alcohol and drugs in their system,

625
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:05,570
then parental rights would just be terminated kind of automatically.

626
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:11,060
And that is less common now, but it's could still happen.

627
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:16,879
So more group homes, less adoption for older kids, sibling separations.

628
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,770
We've noted we haven't we didn't totally talk about the experiences of youth in foster care,

629
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:25,880
but we definitely know there's a growing literature on youth.

630
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:35,990
We haven't also explicitly noted yet that kids who run away from home are more likely to end up in foster care.

631
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:42,530
And so a big reason for some kids running away from home is that they are LGBTQ

632
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:46,240
youth and the rainbow light from home because home is not accepting of them.

633
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:50,570
And so what kinds of foster care placements are they going into?

634
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:54,980
That's more to think about minority youth.

635
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:01,610
Same thing may experience challenges and then rural placements are sort of desperately difficult to come by.

636
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,610
And so that's another consideration.

637
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:15,410
And I don't know if anybody has been following the New York Times series on just sort of rural child welfare and other things,

638
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:21,560
but that's a pretty good series. I can post a link to it, but that's certainly been been the case for a while.

639
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:30,800
City is just awesome, even though there's a lot of going on with cities, but they generally have more resources than rural parts of the nation.

640
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,410
And then just to sort of find out, you know,

641
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:42,829
talk about aging out because this is the area that I was talking about like is getting appropriately more attention.

642
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:46,100
Kids who are aging out of foster care. And I appreciate it.

643
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:49,460
And his comment of just like the random Tuesday that you get your kids back

644
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:54,800
because the random Tuesday that you turn 18 is when you are out of foster care.

645
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:59,600
And so you are basically your foster care parent.

646
01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:04,639
Foster care caregiver is not getting any money, any more money to care for you.

647
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:12,650
And they are, you know, required to kick you out basically at age 18.

648
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:17,030
So that can occur at any time. Obviously, in the year it's not the end of school.

649
01:15:17,030 --> 01:15:20,300
So a child might have to transition in the middle of a high school.

650
01:15:24,030 --> 01:15:26,970
This that that is sometimes true, that varies by state.

651
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:33,000
So anyway, what we know is that there's a lot of work to do in this transition aging out space,

652
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:42,300
because kids who are in the system at age 18 and have spent kind of their teen years in the system are really in a disadvantage.

653
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:50,610
Again, statistically, there's a lot of data showing that kids in that setting, in that situation can have worse outcomes.

654
01:15:52,590 --> 01:16:04,379
And I will end with talking about there's a great local program example here at U of M that does provide really specific supports,

655
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:10,050
like along all of these lines for kids who've experienced foster care in their teen years.

656
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:14,400
And so if anybody, again, is interested in this space,

657
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:23,069
this is a really great group and they just provide lots of different kind of wrap around emerging adulthood,

658
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:34,500
appropriate services like mentoring, housing support and just sort of like how to navigate the U of M space if you have had this experience as a teen.

659
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:41,640
Okay. Any other any thoughts?

660
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:50,200
Comments on the aging out piece? Um, I guess a space where lots and lots of improvements need to be made.

661
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:54,650
So if anybody's interested, this is a this is an active space.

662
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,870
These guys are great. Okay.

663
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:08,240
So, yeah, next time we'll talk more about mental health and there's a little mini lecture I just have through, like, diagnostic stuff.

664
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:17,960
And again, relating that to this idea of assessment is really hard and assessing kids as they change on all these,

665
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:25,580
you know, criteria that we need to meet in order to get them a diagnosis that is reimbursed is difficult.

666
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:30,860
So that's the kind of mini lecture. And then we can talk more broadly in class about public mental health.

667
01:17:31,280 --> 01:18:06,770
So thanks. So on Thursday that's when the office hours typically are very 1 to 3.

668
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:12,049
I have. Yeah. Yeah. And it goes in full too.

669
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:16,730
So I just want to let you know that I will be coming back later this coming Thursday.

670
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:20,989
Yeah. Yeah, I know. Sometimes you mentioned complex. I yeah, I know.

671
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:25,700
I tend to agree with that. Let me make sure. Okay.

672
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:29,570
So you have something til two. Yes. Okay, so let me.

673
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:34,330
And if that doesn't work, we can can we do 233.

674
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:40,920
Okay, let's do that. Because some people reach out, get a lot.

675
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:50,270
Okay. But let me just do a little quick search and then it will pop up very quickly at 23.

676
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:54,370
Okay. Yeah, that's perfect. Okay.

677
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:58,580
And I will make that in our half an hour, too. Okay.

678
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:03,890
Awesome. Thank you. Yeah, I saw a question about the user response.

679
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:08,280
So you. Yeah. For right. Yes, for a seven person.

680
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:13,600
And then if we get like, oh, go ahead and then four and I've done like I've got like two ones and the check is that.

681
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:17,600
So that's 101.

682
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:22,100
Okay. That's probably my canvas of the thing, but that's a good point.

683
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:25,580
Do you know which one is the check I can show you? Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah.

684
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:34,280
Yeah, I think I added the ones that were three.

685
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:37,850
You could get three. I went through and did. Did the other ones. Those ones.

686
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:41,630
I've got something listed as a check. Oh thank you. Yeah.

687
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:44,810
I just wanted to make sure that. Oh yeah, that should be the same thing.

688
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:49,240
Yeah, let me show you good points. Points.

689
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:53,810
So sorry. Okay, so.

690
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:58,230
So I've got like, this one.
