All right. Hello, I'm Warren. I will be interviewing Ken for a position with the EPA on Vietnamese dioxin exposures.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:18,630
Correct? Yes. Perfect. So my first question for you is, why are you interested in this global EPA position?

3
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:27,390
I'm interested in this position because it ties together both of my interests in environmental health as well as global health.

4
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:38,520
A big reason why I chose this position is because I share a cultural connection to Vietnam, the Vietnamese, myself, and overall.

5
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:47,440
It's exciting. Part would be to apply all the public health knowledge I gained.

6
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,910
Graduate studies and see if I'm able to make a positive change on the world.

7
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,240
If. It's a small contribution in order to get larger.

8
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,460
Collaborative effort. Thank you. Very nice.

9
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:20,760
What are some of your strengths and weaknesses, would you say? Given my prior experiences both from a community aspect as well as.

10
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:35,160
Laboratory. I think I have skipped a wide range of skills, both analytical and interpersonal and could.

11
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:46,490
This position. I am very attentive and I have an eye for very small.

12
00:01:48,350 --> 00:02:03,850
Especially given my prior work. This very large Excel spreadsheet and time for one outlier and literally a thousand cells.

13
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:13,400
But with this attention to detail comes. A tendency to get very locked on.

14
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:19,190
On a certain task I definitely do suffer from.

15
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:31,080
Time blindness in the sense that if someone asks me how long I should anticipate any task to take, I couldn't really tell them.

16
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:40,920
And in recent years, I've learned to under-promise and overperform.

17
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:47,620
That if I personally think that a test should take me one hour to do.

18
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:57,270
Tell my superior I will finish in 2 hours, which gives me a couple people 2 hours to do all that work.

19
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:04,040
A hurry. Okay. Okay. Why should we hire you over other applicants?

20
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,860
I would like to say that my graduate degree from the University of Michigan.

21
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,360
It helps to establish a solid.

22
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:28,900
Foundation and public health. A personal skill that would set me up from other applicants for this position would be I.

23
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:41,730
Cultural. To. Mission disposition as well as my interpersonal skills, both in English and as.

24
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,650
Yeah. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you.
