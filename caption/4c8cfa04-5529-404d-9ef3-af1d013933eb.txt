1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:35,780
I don't know. Good afternoon, everybody.

2
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:46,310
Good afternoon. We'll go ahead and get started.

3
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,270
How you're doing today. Well, it's great to be back.

4
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,830
And I want to take a moment to thank Hyun for leading the discussion last week.

5
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:08,250
Thank you and I appreciate it. Today, I will start with some announcements.

6
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:15,120
I go back to talking about our plans for today and then get started with the lecture.

7
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,730
So our first announcement was still opens today after class and is due on Friday about 1159.

8
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,950
The quest for this week is a little bit different from last week because it

9
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,330
covers epidemiologic concepts as it relates to as it relates to data collection.

10
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,570
And we will have a moment to talk a little bit about things that you consider when you're doing data collection.

11
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,150
So even though we are talking about publicly available data sets, the data have already been collected.

12
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:56,100
But as you everything that I tried to interject some questions and some thoughts about what the

13
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,170
process may have been for that particular data set that we may have been exploring at that time.

14
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:10,920
Just to keep you reminded about how those data were collected and how they were applied to maybe if you were collecting data for a small study.

15
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,400
So for today, we will introduce the Demographic and Health Survey Program.

16
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,070
We will talk about data collection considerations.

17
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:30,110
And then now that you've started working on your group project, we will talk about some tips, you know.

18
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,210
Maybe you're in the middle now and these tips might be helpful.

19
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:40,290
And then if you want to work on your group project with the time remaining, you can do so.

20
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,840
If not, if your group has already assigned people, it's a task to do different types.

21
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,710
Then you want to leave. That's fine. But we will be there after the tips for final project.

22
00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:01,120
If you want to stay. So for us that we'll be talking about a demographic and health surveys.

23
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,570
We've talked primarily about data and data collection in the US.

24
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,050
Now we'll talk about data collection in other places,

25
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:15,190
some of the challenges and some of the advantages of having those datasets available and how those can be comparable,

26
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,470
or at least compared to some of the statistics that we have in other countries.

27
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:30,069
So it's a start. And to think about how the demographic and health surveys are started is that based

28
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:37,810
on a projection that was done of an estimate of the population over a certain period.

29
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:46,180
So there were three estimates generated. One way it was the low estimate, a median estimate and a high estimate.

30
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:58,270
And then just looking at the high estimate of around 30, 36.4 billion by 2300, it became concerning what resources are we going to have available?

31
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:07,570
How is public health going to be in this setting where you have the extreme scenario where you have the population just growing exponentially?

32
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,190
We see that we are more than the median estimate.

33
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:21,730
And that's why exactly because it's going to be higher at this point, but definitely not close to what's here,

34
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:29,200
but definitely in the cost of some individuals to be concerned about the availability of resources

35
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:36,130
and maybe lack of resources in how that will impact population and how that will impact health.

36
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:45,520
So that with the concern that if we follow the trend of the high population estimate, there will be concerns about population growth.

37
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:57,550
There were some conferences held where India affirmed the right of couples to decide to have children and to decide how to space their children.

38
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,370
But over time, it became clear that even though couples have the right to do so,

39
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,800
but maybe providing some information on their ability to control fertility, it would be helpful.

40
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:14,450
So there were a series of conferences that were held to get to this approach that, a,

41
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:21,730
we will track fertility across different areas and we will use that information to inform

42
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,560
public health and also to inform the different government agencies associated with this type.

43
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:36,820
So we've talked about data collection in the U.S. and how births and deaths are almost

44
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,440
entirely covered in the U.S. This is not the case for certain areas of the world.

45
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,780
So you will see the percent of children under five register in that region.

46
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:51,370
So many birth registration, registration.

47
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,710
You'll see that in different parts of the world. You have different levels of coverage.

48
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,159
And you see in eastern and southern Africa, you have around 37% compared to Latin America, where you have 93% coverage.

49
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:16,510
So very vast differences between how covered the registration of births happened to be in different parts of the world.

50
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,400
So sometimes it makes it difficult. If we're making comparisons between one region to the next,

51
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:32,440
we pretty much may be comparing either the entire coverage of one country compared to a certain percentage just covered, you know, different country.

52
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,280
Similar situation for coverage of death.

53
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,080
So they die if you cover two or 28.

54
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:49,380
And you can see areas with the red and orange and colors.

55
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:59,910
These are areas where you have coverage of less than 25%, particularly for the red, compared to areas where you have close to 100% coverage.

56
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,180
So you can see how if we are comparing rates of the prevalence of certain conditions,

57
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:14,930
how accurate this information can be, pretty much using what's what is available compared to the total coverage pool.

58
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,630
But to get your.

59
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:27,420
So we'll go back and talk about a little bit about the history of some service that led to the current demographic and health surveys.

60
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,410
So the first one was the World Fertility Survey.

61
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:40,799
And this survey was really to collect information about volume and policy fertility

62
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,220
and to inform these countries about what was happening in their country.

63
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:48,210
So that allowed them to be able to do family planning for these countries.

64
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:56,100
So the second one is the contraceptive prevalence survey and we've a slight overlapping period.

65
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:05,340
But because it started in the late seventies, the program was really intended to guide family planning programs.

66
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:12,150
So they put the questions and the type of information collected overlap between the two surveys.

67
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,390
But the contraceptive prevalence survey was a shorter survey.

68
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:24,270
It was more intended to be able to produce rapid information that would be able to inform programs readily.

69
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:33,600
So for some of these surveys, in addition to having overlapping questions, some of the surveys were conducted in the same countries.

70
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:39,720
So you have some countries overlapping with the World Fertility Survey and the Contraceptive Prevalence Survey.

71
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:52,140
So out of that came the demographic and health surveys, and the series was originally intended to collect information on fertility.

72
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:59,880
Well, when you think about the data collection process, how expensive it can be, how time consuming it can be.

73
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:07,860
You will find out quickly that in addition to fertility, a lot of other information are collected.

74
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:15,600
Because you have an opportunity, you find a person that you get. Interview is a waste of time or money to just ask just questions about fertility.

75
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:22,139
So the the survey quickly expanded to other factors in addition to fertility.

76
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,890
But it was originally intended to collect information on fertility.

77
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:35,830
So as you can see, the topics that are covered by the survey, fertility, which is the key reason for which it started.

78
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,930
They also collect information on infant and child mortality,

79
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:47,620
and I have an example that I will cover also information on diarrhea, immunization, maternal mortality.

80
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:57,570
And they use this is the whole matter. So in the US we have a system that will give that requires a birth number,

81
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:07,240
death certificate to be filed within five days after a dead body is discovered or after a person dies in some of these places.

82
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,580
This is not the case.

83
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:19,150
And so we showed a map where coverage was not high compared to the U.S. But there are some other ways that data on mortality can be collected.

84
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:30,190
So where is the sister letter? So a woman who was interviewed at that given point in time is going to be asked about her sisters.

85
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:38,530
And if any of her sisters died, particularly they died around pregnancy, either during pregnancy or sometime shortly after pregnancy.

86
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:43,479
So it's not the same as collecting information as we have in the U.S. What is a

87
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:51,100
way to collect information about mortality using individuals who have sisters?

88
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,180
What would be someone in limitations with this type of methodology?

89
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,310
Yes. As ugly.

90
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:16,379
As ugly. So you can see that it's not entirely covering all potential cases, but it is a start and at least give some information,

91
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:22,650
at least among those who have a sister to be able to report information about and the maternal mortality.

92
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:28,790
Relating to her systems. So there's also information on violence against women.

93
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,100
And and we can talk about this later, but we can start the conversation now.

94
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:39,770
If you're collecting information on certain types of information, you have to be careful how you ask,

95
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,190
where you're asking and who you're asking to collect the information.

96
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:51,080
So if you wanted to collect information on something sensitive, would you do that in a in a setting where maybe other people can hear?

97
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,400
Even if it's family members,

98
00:11:53,090 --> 00:12:00,710
you wouldn't want to do that because then not whether you want to be particular about protecting the people you are interviewing,

99
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,030
you also want to be particular about the type of information you are getting.

100
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:14,300
So if someone is going to be sitting next to maybe a family member who maybe they don't want to, so you at least know what they're doing.

101
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:19,710
You might get some information, but it will not be accurate. So there are two things that you need to be concerned about.

102
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,460
First, your participants safety.

103
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:30,980
And then the second thing would be creating an environment such that you are able to collect accurate bodies close to accurate information.

104
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,580
They are also collecting information about malaria and bayonet use.

105
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,580
So for those of you who are not familiar,

106
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:51,110
they have bednets that they have treated with insecticide and people can use those bed nets at nighttime to sleep under.

107
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,360
So they ask people whether they own bed nets and then whether they are using

108
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,550
them and whether they use them consistently or maybe just at a certain time.

109
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:12,710
They also collect information about nutrition. And in our scenarios that we'll discuss later, we will talk about some of the things to consider.

110
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:18,110
When you are collecting information and nutrition in the population, you are asking information.

111
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:26,280
Then we have biological measures and this is restricted to us kids.

112
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,880
And then there also anemia, testing and then biomarkers.

113
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:39,240
So most times when you're collecting biomarkers, it can be very expensive.

114
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,979
So sometimes you may have to select some of your participants or maybe a smaller group of individuals to collect

115
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:55,140
biomarkers rather than the entire population or even the group that you are enrolling for your your survey or your study.

116
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:03,910
So those are things to consider. Yes. Donald Trump has a rather.

117
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:13,950
So how it works because the may go to certain households and then the house so you'll see in the

118
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:20,700
slides coming up that they go to a household and a household will then interview all women.

119
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:27,780
They select some men or women. And then for the domestic violence one, they interview one woman.

120
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,790
And then if the household has casing it, then they'll make the selection based on that.

121
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:43,540
So the objective here is to provide decision makers in these countries with improved information.

122
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:53,650
And I emphasize improved information because there's still some amount of data collection happening within those countries.

123
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:58,059
But it may not necessarily be systematic, maybe a clinical one,

124
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:05,920
and might be collecting information just for the clinic, not necessarily thinking about having to be standardized.

125
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:13,720
They can be combining across locations. So with this improved information, then they are able to standardize the questionnaires.

126
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:20,710
They're able to train the people who are collecting information. So it's done consistently across settings.

127
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:31,300
And then they're also aiming to improve the data collection socialized, comparable across other countries that are collecting the data.

128
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:38,499
Another goal is to make sure that they are training the individuals in these

129
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:44,920
countries to be able to conduct high quality demographic and health survey.

130
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:54,910
So not only collect data, but also leave them with the skills that they're able to apply to other data collection processes in that country.

131
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:04,209
And of course, with surveillance, the ultimate goal is to be able to analyze the data and then disseminate the information.

132
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:14,240
As such, data can be used for public health. So so far there's been eight phases of the Daesh data collection.

133
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:26,689
They are currently in phase eight. And you can imagine with COVID, there were some delays in some countries and then some countries started,

134
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:32,290
but then maybe they didn't collect the full scale of data that it normally collects.

135
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:38,000
So for the Internet, that is. But a lot of the countries have started collecting data again.

136
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:46,880
So we have 90 countries that have nationally representative samples, and these countries, most of them have repeat surveys.

137
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,820
And we know the benefit of having repeated surveys. We are then able to see how things are changing over time.

138
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:57,770
Again, they're repeat surveys, but they're not on the same individuals, they are on different individuals.

139
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:07,490
But we are still able to then see trends happening over time for the particular measures that we are interested in their model.

140
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,800
QUESTION Years and years. Question is changed from face to face and we know there are problems with that.

141
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:21,620
When you have questions changing from face to face and then there are optional modules that also change from face to face,

142
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:33,399
and these optional modules could be ones that might be speech specific to a particular region, may be something that's a problem in one country.

143
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:41,630
It may not necessarily be a problem in a different country. So they will then allow those countries to add questions specific to their region.

144
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:50,090
Like we see for the referenced survey, you have the ability to add questions specific to your area.

145
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:59,180
So for those of you who remember those of you from Michigan and those of you new to Michigan, there was the Flint water crisis.

146
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,650
So when they eventually entered the drinking water supply.

147
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:12,290
So I imagine for Flint, if Flint was interested, that Michigan will ask questions about that, but maybe Ohio will not be interested in that.

148
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:21,590
So you have the ability to ask questions specific to your local area that will inform public health activities in your region.

149
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:33,100
So for countries that participate in the DHS program, there are countries that receive U.S. aid assistance.

150
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:42,100
And then there are some other countries that contribute to the surveys found out that in certain countries and at different times.

151
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:49,749
So as I said, many countries have multiple surveys and that can be really exciting because you can look at trend over

152
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:56,830
time and you can see how well certain programs are working to evaluate the effectiveness of this program.

153
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,640
So not all countries have the same number of survey.

154
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:07,240
Some countries will participate certainly as and some countries have data for all all of the eight service.

155
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,399
So this is just a map that gives you a sense of visual because it's more visual

156
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,990
than being able to read the countries of where the dogs program or operate.

157
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,710
You can see a lot of countries in Africa.

158
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,900
Some countries in South America.

159
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:35,290
But again, this allows us to have data that we can compare across regions that would otherwise not necessarily be available.

160
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:47,970
So to use. So in terms of implementation, the DHS program staff will work with the existing agency in a given country.

161
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,190
For some countries, it's the Ministry of Health.

162
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:59,190
For some other countries, it will be a non-governmental agency that may be interested in women's health or maternal and child health.

163
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,860
When they set up the program,

164
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:11,640
collaborate with any institution in that country that may be working on similar topics or have information related to what they need.

165
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:21,840
And then they work to be able to generate the data. The primary users of the data are family planning organizations and ministries of health.

166
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:27,370
What is also useful for this information to be sent to the World Health Organization?

167
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,300
Again, when you're generating data across multiple.

168
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:41,870
So for the symphony design you are the goal is to have the sample be representative at the national level,

169
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,350
at the residence level and then also at the regional level.

170
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:50,060
So that usually they use a stratified two stage cluster design.

171
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:58,060
The first stage, they get information from the census form and this is where working with the local agency.

172
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,510
So it will be the Ministry of Health.

173
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:08,660
It could be the demographic office because they need the census files to be able to work their sampling design strategy here.

174
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:17,990
So they have enumeration areas which they get from the census files and then they get from the enumeration areas,

175
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:24,410
a sample of households drawn from a list, and this is done by the DHS program.

176
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:33,470
Whereas the first step is information that they are getting from the national office responsible for generating census data.

177
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,460
So for the survey, they also use sample weights.

178
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:44,750
So we talk about some of the other publicly available datasets where they use up a weights and this is required in an.

179
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:55,360
So how so? Might be slightly different in terms of how is defined in the US compared to some of these locations.

180
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:03,700
So a house is a person or group of related or unrelated persons who live in the same dwelling.

181
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:11,560
They acknowledge one adult as the head of the household and they share similar housekeeping arrangements.

182
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,720
Those are usually people meeting this category or will be considered a household.

183
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,200
So how do they go about identifying whether people are from the same household or not?

184
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:34,000
Some some of these locations you have a compound sometimes is referred to there, and within the compound you might have multiple houses.

185
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:44,080
So it's really important that you have a fixed definition of what constitutes a household, because if not, it becomes a little bit gray quickly.

186
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,979
So they have these questions that if people answer yes to these questions,

187
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:57,910
then they're able to put you in the same household and is helpful such that one person who is asking the question will be doing this process.

188
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,470
Similarly for somebody who's asking the same questions in a different area.

189
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,520
So they ask if you reside in the same compound.

190
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:13,210
If the answer to the same household here, if they had the same cooking arrangement.

191
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,650
So the answer yes, it is question that they consider to be in the same household.

192
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,290
Another important distinction in terms of defining who's a member of the

193
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:31,090
household is whether the household residence are the usual household residence,

194
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:41,710
which they call this year. And then if the members who are going to be entered on the survey, whether they just stay there last night.

195
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,700
So sometimes you have guests from other places staying for the night.

196
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,420
And those are counted in the surveys when you're collecting the data.

197
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,999
But they make the distinction.

198
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:01,329
So when we're analyzing the data, we know whether we were referring to the usual residents in the house or people who just happen to say,

199
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,450
in addition to the usual individuals who live in the hospital.

200
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,919
So but the question here, they have the household question here.

201
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,780
So after they've gone through the first step and the second step for the cluster design,

202
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,670
then they have the household questionnaire where any adult member of the household

203
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,120
who is capable of providing information can fill out that questionnaire.

204
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:31,460
And then you have people, like I said, people who say that the night before they're eligible to participate in the survey.

205
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:36,020
You just need to make sure that they indicate that they stayed the night.

206
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:45,350
And then you have information on people who are women who would have ever married, and they're looking at 50 and older and less than 49.

207
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,210
But it varies for men and they are eligible for the individual questionnaire.

208
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,150
And then any child who is 0 to 5 years will be eligible for anthropometric measurement.

209
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,100
It may be eligible for anemia.

210
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:09,470
So for the women's question here, you'll have one or all eligible women who would be able to complete that question here.

211
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,420
For the main question here, you have a select group household.

212
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:20,270
And then for the bio micro questionnaire, you have selected households as well.

213
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:28,880
Again, biomarker measurement can be quite expensive, so is restricted to select households.

214
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,379
So I did research looking at cytokines and to quantify side effects can be

215
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,360
very expensive in the measure up to 20 to 20 biomarkers on these individuals.

216
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,820
So is understandable that they will restrict the biomarker questionnaire to select households.

217
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:51,980
Now for the domestic violence models, only one woman in the household walked to complete that.

218
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:58,430
Any thoughts about why this could be the case? Why only one person will complete that information?

219
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,220
First of all, domestic violence information will be considered. What type of information?

220
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:21,690
Domestic violence information that you wanted to collect on domestic violence.

221
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:28,100
What type of information would that be? Yes.

222
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:38,350
So let me let me clarify. So domestic violence in terms of is it would it be sensitive for the US in opening with people around?

223
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:49,660
So sorry, L.Z. And then would it be one that you as an OBE, would you ask this maybe in a 1 to 1 setting?

224
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:56,170
What kind of information are you going to be able to get if you're asking for domestic violence?

225
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,060
So it will be sensitive information. You know, you want to make sure that.

226
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:13,450
So imagine if a woman lives in a household and she's being abused in a domestic violence situation.

227
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:21,880
Most likely the abuser might be around. So imagine how you're going to set up this interview to collect information.

228
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:29,940
One of the key things will be first and foremost to make sure that the person you're interviewing is safe.

229
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,410
The second thing would be to make sure that you.

230
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:41,430
Have an environment where you get truthful information, because if you're asking this information where their visa might be around,

231
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,820
then that person might just say no to the question you're asking.

232
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,160
So you are collecting data, but the data may not necessarily be accurate.

233
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:53,850
So are some. In some cases it's better you have no data than to have data that tells a different story.

234
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,810
So we need to be mindful of a certain kinds of information.

235
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:03,660
So it could be domestic violence, it could be drug use, it could be immigration.

236
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,690
Those types of topics can be very sensitive.

237
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,530
So we need to be careful and mindful how we are asking those questions,

238
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,830
who we ask the questions, and then the setting that we have for people to connect with.

239
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:22,240
So in this case, you have some of these households where you have multiple lives.

240
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:32,899
So if you ask the domestic violence of only one woman, then unless she shares that she was asked this question or questioned about domestic violence,

241
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:37,250
nobody else is going to know compared to asking all the women household.

242
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:43,400
Then it becomes clear somebody must have talked about what's happening in his household and you put somebody at risk.

243
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:52,310
So for domestic violence, one only one woman is asked, and unless she talks, nobody else is going to know that she was asked questions about.

244
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,830
So there are other indicator surveys that are also collected.

245
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:11,420
So you have the AIDS indicator surveys, and these surveys are useful in giving us information about HIV AIDS.

246
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:23,690
And these surveys inform the prevalence, the needs, and how different programs might be helping with AIDS control in some of these countries.

247
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,889
And because you're using similar information to standardize surveys,

248
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:32,900
you're then able to compare across countries the information you're collecting from these surveys.

249
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:42,830
Then there's the Malaria Indicator Survey. This allows these individuals to collect information about malaria.

250
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:48,290
So it could be that net use being at ownership and then also using these.

251
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:52,270
So and then there's the multiple indicator cluster surveys,

252
00:29:52,280 --> 00:30:02,160
which has over 120 indicators that we use Apple Pay across countries for some of these surveys.

253
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:11,809
You have some overlapping information where it can be useful because in certain areas you might have challenges

254
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:17,990
in getting across the rural areas because of maybe extreme weather or maybe because it's the rainy season.

255
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:24,200
In some of these countries you have rainy versus dry season, that snow versus summer.

256
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,830
And because when you have a rainy season, sometimes you have problems with the roofs,

257
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,900
you might have flooding and you may not be able to get to certain areas.

258
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,770
So for some of these surveys, they are conducted at different times.

259
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,040
So they complement each other because they are collecting information,

260
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:48,949
either doing one time of the year and another one is collecting information at a different time of the year, particularly for malaria transmission.

261
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:54,620
In cases, you want to be able to collect information during the dry season, in the rainy season,

262
00:30:54,620 --> 00:31:02,480
because this water that's not running can be a factor in terms of the growth of the the parasite.

263
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:11,850
So for data availability and analysis, the data are publicly available to registered users.

264
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:18,600
So you go to the site, you're able to register and become a user and have access to the data.

265
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:31,780
Just a reminder, a sample weights required when you're using analyzing the data and you are able to create maps and tables without registering.

266
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:40,860
So you'll be able to see what data at the level of the country you're interested in and the indicators that I've them.

267
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:52,020
But before going through the process of registering, you might want to know what types of data available so they have model data sets that

268
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,610
you can go and practice on and decide whether this is something that you want to use.

269
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:05,160
It is helpful to become familiar. Before going to the step of registering, you can download a model data sets also on a website.

270
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:17,430
Anybody here who is going to be using data from an international source for their CAFS, then you would you mind sharing to your research question?

271
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:22,980
Okay. But HIV doesn't.

272
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:30,140
Okay. Sounds interesting. Yes. Which is usually.

273
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:38,290
Okay. So, first of all, I think we have to go back to.

274
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,690
Okay. So sub-Saharan Africa and Europe would be working in India vaccines.

275
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:54,160
Any particular vaccine allergies or infant mortality that's in such a technical one advantage?

276
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,420
Okay. Are you going to do it? I'm sorry. Are you going to add COVID to it?

277
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,290
COVID vaccine. I have no Niue.

278
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:06,530
Are you going to add COVID vaccination among kids? I don't think.

279
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,930
I think it is going to happen.

280
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:17,260
So I can only scarce I just curious and it might take a while for the data to become available.

281
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:24,140
Yes. How is that set up?

282
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:27,580
Oh, are you going to be working with Nancy?

283
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,879
Oh, great. So awesome. So interesting.

284
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:39,070
I, I know you all are using different data sets, but just to know that that interest for other sources of data outside the U.S.

285
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:50,349
So in terms of publications, we have DHS reports that publish regularly and then they have additional peer review publications.

286
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,230
So if somebody is interested in using data from us,

287
00:33:53,560 --> 00:34:04,410
they can go register to have access to the data and then be able to run the analysis and write a publication using the data as data.

288
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:16,220
So I go over two examples just briefly to kind of give you a sense of how you may start with one sample size.

289
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:24,110
And then by the time you get to the key variable that you're interested in, you might have a far smaller sample size than when you started with.

290
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:31,280
So this is a study that members of the faculty here publish.

291
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:38,870
So intimate partner violence IPV affects school attendance at most recent delivery among women in Kenya.

292
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,980
So this started with the data that we're going to be using on 9865 households.

293
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:51,650
Four of those households, they had almost 9000 that were occupied.

294
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,810
And then they had 8770 eligible women.

295
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:03,910
Then you see, as I mentioned, that not all women are a minister in the domestic violence module.

296
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,200
So you see the sample size drops drastically because some households you have multiple women.

297
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:21,890
So so for nine, almost 10,000 households, you now have just close to 6000 people who completed the domestic violence measure.

298
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,090
And then of those, you have 4500 who ever married.

299
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:31,850
So your sample size keeps getting smaller. And since the question was about the most recent delivery,

300
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:40,670
you have just a little bit over 1000 people who had had a delivery in the year prior to when they were collecting the data.

301
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:48,560
And then a total sample size of 975 where there were not missing information on priority religion and normal visits.

302
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:55,010
So keep in mind, if you're using some of these data sets that you might start out with a big sample.

303
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:58,100
But by the time you get to that particular variable that you're interested in,

304
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:03,330
you might have a far smaller sample size, and there's nothing wrong with that.

305
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:08,239
But just be mindful and think about how you're losing these individuals and how

306
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,260
that might be impacting who eventually makes it to your final sample size.

307
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:22,140
And then another example factors associated with attitudes toward IPV against women.

308
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:26,040
A comparative analysis of 17 sub-Saharan countries.

309
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:32,280
So again, the cool thing that you're able to ask the same questions across different countries,

310
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:35,310
and then you can do some comparisons across across countries.

311
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:44,850
So for the questions, where percentage of women who believe that intimate partner violence against women is justified by difference in areas,

312
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:50,490
so you see that blue, dark blue, say the person goes out without telling the spouse.

313
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:56,610
People are answering that. Intimate partner violence is justified.

314
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,350
The person neglects their child, argues with their spouse.

315
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:05,550
If the person refuses to have sex with their spouse, if the person burns the food.

316
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:16,830
So you see, unfortunately, that it varies for some countries with high percentages of people saying it is justified.

317
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,910
And in some countries where you have a lower percent of people who believe that the IPV is justified.

318
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:28,410
But this gives you a sense of what's happening across countries.

319
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:35,069
And in a situation where you have the World Health Organization kind of investigating IPV,

320
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:47,150
then you have some information to then focus on some of these countries with higher percentages where people believe that IPV is justified for giving.

321
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,410
Any question about DHS coverage data collection.

322
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,150
Okay. So I'm going to cover a few slides talking about Liberia, West Africa.

323
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:15,760
I happen to be from Liberia. So I want to share with you the information on the 2019 to 2020 survey in Liberia.

324
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,870
Liberia happened to be one of the countries earlier in the cycle.

325
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:25,300
Because don't keep in mind, that is from 2018 to 2023 for phase five.

326
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:30,210
So Liberia happens to collect the information prior to COVID 19.

327
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,060
So for the most part, they were not affected by COVID 19.

328
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:40,180
Unfortunately, some of the other countries were affected by the pandemic.

329
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:47,470
So the data collection period was October 16, 2019 to February 12, 2020.

330
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,690
The Ministry of Health authorized the survey.

331
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:59,800
Remember, the DHS staff will work with the agency that is responsible for census and then health information.

332
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:09,700
So the funding for this particular cycle was one that was provided by U.S., the CDC and a number of other organizations,

333
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:16,090
including the United Nations Development Program, Global Alliance for Vaccine Immunization.

334
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:23,080
So all of those organizations pulled their resources to be able to form the data collection in Liberia.

335
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:32,170
So the most recent data collection is the fifth in a series of surveys conducted in Liberia.

336
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,790
The previous ones were 1986, 1999, 2000, 2007, and then 2013.

337
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:46,480
So the collected data on HIV prevalence fertility, which is the key reason why this program was established.

338
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:56,049
And then other information on maternal and child health and other information that are very useful to the as the year,

339
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:06,860
which is the Sustainable Development Goals. So this is Liberia, shown right here in red against the backdrop of Africa.

340
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,290
So Liberia's on the west coast of Africa.

341
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:23,270
And Liberia has a number of counties with the capital city being Bolsonaro County, where you have Monrovia, the capital city.

342
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:32,660
So you have all of these counties, and the DHS program will collect information from the different counties together.

343
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:41,870
So for this one, in 19 2020, they used the tool in the 2008 National Population Housing Census.

344
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:49,309
Remember, the DHS program works with these agencies to use the census data that they have because that's how

345
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:56,660
they use the information to create the the clusters from the two states plus the sampling design.

346
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:02,810
So the 15 counties were going to have to form five geographic regions, so three counties per region.

347
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:12,050
And if counties were divided into districts and districts into plan and each district was each player was subdivided into enumeration areas.

348
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:16,340
So the enumeration area is determined by the census group.

349
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:28,300
And then the DHS will come and use information based on what the Census Group has done independent of the DHS program.

350
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:34,100
So for this, I'm playing the use two stage cluster design.

351
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:41,900
The first one will involve selecting sample points, which will be considered clusters,

352
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:48,260
and each enumeration area was drawn with a probability proportional to their size,

353
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:53,260
meaning the bigger the error, the higher the probability those those particular errors would be addressed.

354
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,600
Smaller errors had a lower probability of being selected.

355
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:00,290
So you have a total of 325 clusters.

356
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:11,870
And then after that first stage you had a stratified sampling for stage two and then the when to do a systematic sampling of households.

357
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:24,199
And for each one ish sampling, you had an average of 129 households in each cluster, so a total of 9745 households.

358
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:30,980
And keep in mind, depending on your question, you might have a smaller sample than what you've studied.

359
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:37,700
So the results are intended to be representative of the national, urban and rural areas.

360
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:42,200
So more across the capital city and then beyond Monrovia.

361
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:49,190
There are other urban areas. So the results are intended to be representative of all of those areas, including rural areas.

362
00:42:52,330 --> 00:43:03,850
So based on that, so you have the first table. So results of household individual interviews, so you have the total number of household interviews.

363
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:06,880
So the households selected 3605.

364
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,860
The number of occupied households 3401.

365
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,490
And then households will wish to conduct their interviews.

366
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:27,070
3321. So you can see here that you have eligible women and then eventually those who were eventually interviewed.

367
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:31,930
And then you see you have a smaller number of men,

368
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:36,700
which corresponds to the fact that in the household you might see like just one meant

369
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:41,820
to be interviewed or in the household you could interview more than one woman.

370
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,470
So for registration of birth of children under age five.

371
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,680
So the percentage of de jure children,

372
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:02,350
so children who are normally members of that household under age five who births are registered with civil charities.

373
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,750
So in some cases you can have some births that register, but individuals may not have a birth certificate.

374
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:18,310
So for children under age two, you have around 67% of those children will register.

375
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:23,750
Their birth were registered, but 28% had a birth certificate.

376
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:28,090
And then around 39% did not have a birth certificate.

377
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:35,140
So you can see how different this number is from the coverage of birth registration in the US.

378
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:44,200
And then you also see some slight differences by whether the child was under two or between two and four.

379
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:52,840
And then also, what are for males versus females? And then you also see information for what is urban versus rural.

380
00:44:53,290 --> 00:45:05,979
And I suspect that you will see a lower percentage of kids had birth certificate compared to those who were in urban areas.

381
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:14,440
So 32 versus 28 2%. So information on child mortality rates.

382
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:26,380
So this figure shows a trend in early childhood mortality rates from 1986 to the 2019, 2020 vicious cycle.

383
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:33,970
So infant mortality, you can see that this color is from 1986, 2007.

384
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:39,640
This Irish dark orange, green and yellow for the most recent.

385
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:45,970
So it's good to see that infant mortality rates having to be decreasing over time.

386
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,500
And then also child mortality in under five.

387
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:54,910
We see this a slight uptick year for the most recent.

388
00:45:55,990 --> 00:46:04,030
It's not clear why this is the case, but in a few years prior to this data collection effort, there was Ebola in Liberia.

389
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:10,150
So it's possible this may have contributed to the infant mortality rate in addition to other factors.

390
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:23,780
Then our information on maternal health care. We see trends in maternal health care from 2000 2007 to 2019, 2020.

391
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:28,490
And we see the data having to be going in the direction that's favorable.

392
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:34,070
So prenatal care by a skilled provider, we see this is going up over time.

393
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:41,520
Birth occurred in a health facility. This is also warming up over time and in birth attended by a skilled provider.

394
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:51,910
This is going up over time. So as I said, we're collecting this information could be very useful because you are then able to see trends over time.

395
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,180
You are then able to then interject if a program started at a certain time,

396
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:06,680
whether that program happens to be associated with improvements in the key maternal or child indicator that you might be interested in.

397
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:15,979
So very useful information that the program collects and not only for the country level,

398
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:24,500
but be able to compare across regions, across multiple countries, I think is a very, very helpful public health.

399
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:35,800
Benefit. So as a summary dish, is this a great source of controllable data for countries that participate?

400
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:41,079
And these data would not otherwise be available. There would be some sort of data available,

401
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:46,620
but maybe not at this level where you can compare across regions in the country and then also across

402
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:53,770
regions outside of the country as the methodology allows for comparisons across country and over time.

403
00:47:54,250 --> 00:48:00,880
But you have to be careful that whether is applicable, some countries have data for certain period and some countries do not.

404
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:08,670
So you need to be able to be specific about which variable you are interested in, which time frame you're interesting,

405
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:14,290
and recognize that some countries will fall out your list of countries with data and then

406
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:17,410
some of those countries will get back if you are looking over a long period of time.

407
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:32,420
Any questions about the issue? So a next turn to data collection strategies and considerations.

408
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:39,290
And just so we can talk a little bit about certain things that you would need

409
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:45,470
to consider if you are collecting data and which group you are targeting,

410
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:50,840
what type of data you collecting, and what you need to do to make your study feasible.

411
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:54,259
Technically, on paper, you can collect anything right on paper.

412
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:59,270
If you are designing a study on paper that you didn't have to implement, you can collect anything you don't have to worry about.

413
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:03,860
Cause you can say I designed a study and wanted to collect data on everybody in other.

414
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:07,190
I can just see that in reality it's totally different.

415
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:14,510
So think about how you would proceed if you are collecting data for a large sample size.

416
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:21,920
So if you are collecting data on a large sample, what would be some of the things that you would do?

417
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,250
Would you do a survey?

418
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:29,960
If you were doing a survey? Would you do an in-person survey?

419
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:33,890
Would you do a Web survey? Would you do a telephone survey?

420
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:37,550
What will be your thoughts if you are collecting data on a large sample?

421
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:02,819
Can be creative says I have and said exposure outcomes.

422
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:08,190
So you can say, for example, if I have this exposure, if I have this outcome, yes.

423
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:20,770
Your likes to staff will make a lot of money.

424
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:49,750
A lot of service. So yeah, you know, if you had a scenario where you didn't have to worry because you know that you can go ahead and do that,

425
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,430
that's one way that you can go about that.

426
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:58,330
And what example do we have where we're collecting data on a large sample,

427
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:03,610
like large population, based on what we've covered or any example that you may have?

428
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:19,950
35 costume design.

429
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:35,019
Yes. So for a large sample, you could use a stratified method where you are trying to have people be representative of that population.

430
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:41,820
Now you're interesting because then it's really difficult to go ahead and interview everybody in the population.

431
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:49,960
So you can use a stratified sample sampling approach to have people be representative of that population.

432
00:51:50,530 --> 00:52:03,070
We see for the in his program, they have weights that they have and they assign people based on who they want that person to represent.

433
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:11,800
So like you said, for such large samples, you can then do weights to not interview everybody,

434
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:16,390
but interview enough individuals to represent the population you're interested in.

435
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:26,320
Let's say if you wanted to interview or collect information on people, you know, entire geographic area, say,

436
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:34,150
for example, if you wanted to interview everybody in ABA, what would be the the limits in terms of what you can do?

437
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:38,140
Would you go ahead and try to collect samples on everybody?

438
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:45,430
Or would you then say, since we know for this particular study, if for what we want to do, we want to collect information on everybody,

439
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:52,290
would you restrict that, suggest maybe an interview or questionnaire, relatively questionnaire and samples?

440
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:09,740
So most times in very large sample sizes, those study designs can be limited to just an interview.

441
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:15,469
So you see, for breakfast, we have people I just call the individuals in their self-reporting so they're

442
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:20,150
not coming in and then trying to collect information on these individuals.

443
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:23,540
They are calling and they're asking you your last doctor's appointment.

444
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:29,160
What was your weight or were you told that you have high blood pressure?

445
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:33,200
They're collecting information because it's a whole lot cheaper to ask people

446
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,750
to either complete a survey in-person or by telephone a Web based survey.

447
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,430
If you are collecting information on a very large group of individuals.

448
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:55,640
So the data, the sample size for us is totally is far outnumber by is larger than what you get for.

449
00:53:55,650 --> 00:54:04,520
And he's in his you're getting around 5000 individuals for a particular year compared to versus what you have,

450
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:09,920
you know, over 40,000 people being interviewed maybe for a given state.

451
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,700
So keep that in mind that for a very large sample size,

452
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:19,340
you want to be mindful about what information you're collecting and how you're collecting that information.

453
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:25,790
Now, what if you were collecting data on quantify plus like biomarkers?

454
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:32,810
Are you going to use the entire sample or say after collecting information on everybody in other,

455
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:43,340
would you then say maybe we should just collect blood samples so we can quantify what the interest any or maybe you go ahead and select a subsample.

456
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:57,610
A subsample will be the way to go. This is not to say that some studies don't quantify biomarkers on everybody in the study,

457
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,920
but to start with, some of those studies are not so large to start with. Sensitive data.

458
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:15,540
We should talk a little bit about if you're collecting data on abuse, immigration.

459
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:22,979
Sure. I can use you. You can think of a difference in areas where people may be hesitant to share that information and would

460
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:29,340
definitely be even more hesitant if people are within the area of the question and answer session.

461
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:34,290
Sometimes it can be you asking information from a teenager.

462
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:40,770
If the parents happened to be around, then they might be mindful or not want to share the information.

463
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:45,200
So among adults maybe they will be comfortable sharing that their smoking.

464
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:53,160
But maybe for teenagers you want to be mindful because if the parents are around, maybe they don't want to share that information.

465
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,890
And you will see sometimes when people go to the doctor,

466
00:55:56,490 --> 00:56:01,170
the doctor might ask the parent to leave so they can then talk to the teenager so they can collect the information.

467
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,879
Because if they add that information with the parent, it might get an answer, but it may not be accurate.

468
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,790
So they try to get accurate information and to do so,

469
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:17,070
they have to create the environment for to protect the person who is giving the information and to get accurate information.

470
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:20,560
Yes. So I.

471
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:27,340
Okay. All right.

472
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:39,970
Know. I know that a lot of times, actually, you know how.

473
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:42,250
So how would you go about that?

474
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:56,080
So the question I think email that Talia mutilation and is a very sensitive topic because they're asking individuals particularly

475
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:06,760
girls or females about whether they've had some of their private parts cut to or to tradition or the custom in a given area.

476
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:10,840
So the question is sometimes the procedure is done.

477
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:17,230
An individual has no idea, has been done. So how would you get information about that?

478
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:24,040
That's a very, very interesting question and very tricky one, because how do you collect the information?

479
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:29,490
You could go ahead and ask people like you say.

480
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:33,760
Some people know and some people don't. Some people were told that that was done to them.

481
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:46,090
So that, you know, another approach would be to recognize that the estimates of the prevalence of that is grossly underestimated.

482
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:51,880
It's almost taboo to to go and say so, you know, you're not going to get information.

483
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:59,710
A longer term process will be more creating an environment where it's comfortable to talk about.

484
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:06,069
But that's going to take a long time, you know, to to to tell people this is not okay.

485
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:13,240
And we need to be able to document is going to take a longer time so you can still go ahead and collect information on it.

486
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:17,290
But you always have to put there this is the information we're able to get,

487
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:25,660
acknowledging that you have a smaller number of people reporting that this has been done to them.

488
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:31,719
Another way that you can try to collect more accurate information, you may not have the total prevalence,

489
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:40,440
but you might be able to say in your question, you could say, do you know that this has been done to you, what you're told you don't know.

490
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,000
So you want a lot of people into it, yes or no?

491
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:49,030
Because if you lock people into yes or no, then you're stuck with somebody that would just say yes or no.

492
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:56,380
But if you give people options where they can then clarify, then you're not mis counting people who are not sure.

493
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:08,050
But there's always going to be that part of the data collection where it remains an issue because some people don't know it's taboo to talk about it.

494
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:17,410
The people who are practicing this, they are usually elders, traditional elders, and they're not going to talk about it.

495
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:30,850
So I think it's just being particular about how you draw up your questionnaire and then making room for people to not want to say yes,

496
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:40,210
no, don't know, but to also have open to answers so they can inform maybe how you can then ask the next question that you develop.

497
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:45,430
So it's not straightforward. You just have to be tactful in terms of respecting the culture.

498
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:52,900
But doing some amount of education with the process and letting people know it is very important to talk about is.

499
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:59,400
Great question. Then in the U.S.,

500
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:09,210
we forget that is important to collect mortality data because we have a system where we collect mortality data routinely, automatically,

501
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:17,730
while in other settings this is not available as we saw with the map showing where we have less than 25% coverage for death in certain areas.

502
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:26,220
So how do you collect data in settings that lack the National Virus Statistics System equivalent?

503
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:36,020
How would you go about collecting information that. Yes.

504
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:57,050
Recently. Ezra Klein So does this the whole matter would be one or another one would be if, you know,

505
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:00,680
sometimes the settings can be a little bit smaller, so you can go to a mobile home.

506
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:06,830
If you're tracking somebody, you can ask, the person is not there as family members,

507
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:11,750
you know what happened to the person and then you would be able to get information on those types of things.

508
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:17,120
What I said this so we understand that in the US is one way,

509
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:23,629
but so we have a broad sense and broad appreciation for how these data are collecting in other places.

510
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:29,480
So it'll automatically assume NVIDIA says it's here, it has to be an MP somewhere else.

511
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:39,590
That sometimes is not the case in and in practice, in public health in these areas come with so many, I'll say,

512
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:47,600
opportunities to be creative in terms of collecting information that you can then use to understand the burden of disease,

513
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,960
the needs for those particular areas, and what can be done about it.

514
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:57,890
Then what about collecting information from individuals who are severely ill?

515
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:01,040
So let me let me create a scenario.

516
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:09,890
So if you have somebody who is severely ill, how comfortable would you be asking them to participate in a study or to collect data from them?

517
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:25,870
Anybody can guess that this is not comfortable and is difficult for people who are really ill to to ask them to participate in a study.

518
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:31,840
And for those of you who have done this and who maybe will do this in the future, in your career,

519
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:39,790
you will see that the RB can be really strict about what you are asking of people in general,

520
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:45,670
but particularly for people who are severely ill for vulnerable populations or pregnant women, children.

521
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,740
I just research in pregnant women.

522
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:55,569
So sometimes you have long questionnaires and they are b will ask you to shorten the

523
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:59,139
questionnaire because it's just too low because you have people collecting samples,

524
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:03,879
you're collecting information. It is going to be more than 2 hours.

525
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,710
They will ask you to make some adjustments to that.

526
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:14,350
So for individuals who are severely ill, we want to also be able to collect information on those individuals.

527
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:18,850
But we need to be mindful. We need to be sensitive to what they are going through.

528
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:26,200
While still acknowledging that it's useful to collect information for all what they are going through,

529
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:30,760
to see how that information can then be used to see how we can help them in the process.

530
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:37,660
So people who are severely ill, you want to be mindful that you are not giving them a very long questionnaire.

531
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:46,720
So for a certain type of question is where you have maybe a shortened form or the long one where you have a lot of other variables.

532
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:56,050
You want to narrow it down to certain questions that will give you the information that you need quickly rather than be long,

533
01:03:56,080 --> 01:04:00,370
and where people would just say, No, I can't. You don't want people to start in not finished a questionnaire.

534
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:07,300
So there are certain things that you need to take into consideration when you have people who are severely ill who will still be.

535
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:15,130
It will be useful to be able to ask, to ask questions, to find out all at least the answer to that research question.

536
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:19,390
So if you have a questionnaire actually shopping, go ahead and use a shorter questionnaire.

537
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:26,440
If you think that the individual who might be in a better state one week later

538
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:31,060
and it is not going to interfere with the research question in terms of,

539
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:34,630
you know, how is the person reacting after getting a chemo?

540
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:39,130
It won't be okay. They go ahead and do what we do rather than have that person gets the chemo.

541
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:47,080
So digest certain things that you may need to take into consideration depending on your research question and important for populations.

542
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:54,670
It could be children, it could be pregnant women, it could be people who have mental health issues.

543
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,870
You need to put certain protections in place,

544
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:03,520
so make sure that you are protecting them and also that you are able to get the information

545
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:09,430
that you need in in this situation where protection versus the information you need,

546
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:16,720
the protection of the participant is always going to be the key thing that will decide how you proceed.

547
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:22,960
And then if you are collecting information on communicable disease spread how we do that,

548
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:30,970
we've had first an opportunity to look at and see how are we able to collect information on communicable disease?

549
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:44,790
Yes. As in silicon, a lot of people by phone,

550
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:49,260
we can do contact tracing for individuals who may have been exposed to a certain

551
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:55,620
communicable disease and we are then able to let them know they've been exposed,

552
01:05:55,620 --> 01:06:01,980
or at least they were in a setting where somebody may have been diagnosed with that communicable disease.

553
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:06,730
So there are multiple ways that we can do this. We can ask people to do a survey.

554
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:20,639
We can call people. We can email people regarding letting them know they've been exposed or individuals who were previously diagnosed.

555
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,470
And you want to go back in time to see where they may have been exposed.

556
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:29,520
Any questions about the different data collection scenarios?

557
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:34,590
Just examples. So you can think broadly about how we collect data because this is where.

558
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:42,310
The question would be kind of centered on data collection strategies.

559
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:54,209
All right. So the last thing that I would cover before you have the opportunity to call your day or to work

560
01:06:54,210 --> 01:07:01,170
on your final project is to just talk a little bit about certain tips that will be helpful.

561
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:12,270
So when you are reviewing these studies and you're evaluating them, is okay to use your AP skills, don't think because it's published.

562
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:19,620
That is all correct. If something seems to be different from the AP skills that you've learned, investigate it.

563
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:23,219
Don't take at face value because sometimes it might set a new.

564
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:32,070
I was thinking that it was it didn't sound correct, but maybe you thought, oh, it's published so meaning is path all the different critiques.

565
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,500
So if your thing is something is not correct, use your AP skills to critique that study.

566
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:45,510
So you need to be able to fully describe the objective of this study.

567
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:52,379
Ms. All of the outcomes evaluated because some studies do evaluate more than one

568
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:57,510
outcome and then clearly identify how the variables were connected and utilized.

569
01:07:57,510 --> 01:08:01,770
So we can then understand that you have a full understanding of the study.

570
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:10,620
Now we've talked about what analysis has been necessary for studies that use a cluster design.

571
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:26,970
So if your study, this is just an example, but if your study used data that requires way to analysis, make sure that you will talk about that.

572
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:32,790
Not if the people you happened to select didn't use with analysis by issue have been used.

573
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:40,950
Make sure to also critique that. So you need to use your so describe what was done in the study.

574
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:46,950
Do not copy and paste the study description or the methodology.

575
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:51,030
Use your own words to then describe what was done in the study.

576
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:59,160
And then when we when you talk about limitations or advantages for this selected dataset.

577
01:08:59,610 --> 01:09:01,920
You need to make sure they apply to your study.

578
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:18,540
So one example will be if you were talking about maybe a study not using actual samples, make sure that particular problem applies to your study.

579
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:25,170
So don't just use the limitation or advantages of a study. If it's not applying to study, it needs to be specific to your study.

580
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:30,810
Now for one of the questions, you need to propose a new research question.

581
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:37,980
Make sure that the question that you're proposing that they are not similar to the ones already evaluated.

582
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:41,120
If you feel strongly about particular question,

583
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:48,990
then you have to be clear in identifying how the question that you're proposing is different from the one that's already addressed in your study.

584
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:52,799
It's just better to a totally different question.

585
01:09:52,800 --> 01:10:00,750
But if you feel strongly that there were flaws spotted and quite addressed something, then you have to be clear in in making that distinction.

586
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:11,600
So you need to follow this, the data source, so that somebody who's just speaking of your paper, if they haven't had any experience.

587
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:20,890
So we were able to understand the data source that. And just a reminder to keep the promise in your write up.

588
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:26,500
So for each question. Yes, sir, your you put your answer at the bottom of that prompt.

589
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:32,080
So do not delete it and make it seem like you're writing a term paper or something like that.

590
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:43,580
And then make sure the alternative data set that you select would at least address one of the limitations in the data set of your article.

591
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:45,860
So don't just go and select another data set,

592
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:56,840
but make sure the one that you selecting is going to be able to fix something that's associated with the limitations of your selected data.

593
01:10:56,940 --> 01:11:01,550
If the article's any question about the final version.

594
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:09,260
All right. Always remember to refer to the rubric, the rubric.

595
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:14,810
We have descriptions for, you know, exactly what should be in each section.

596
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:20,360
If you have questions, please reach out to us. But you also have some guidance providing.

597
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:33,410
So next week we will cover chronic disease surveillance and the week after that it will be infectious disease surveillance.

598
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:41,220
So for now, you have time to work on your group projects or if you are sick.

599
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:44,030
With that, you can call day.
