1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:14,360
I'm gonna the recording.

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,740
okay. alright I it's Wade with various title

3
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,840
for this. talk whether it was complicated

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,920
whether it was fun. it's sort of all of be a pause in

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,700
very in cancer of the genealogy and I talked today about

6
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,840
some of our current work. I'm home. basically and published

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,340
work. I'd like to start. I recognize my collaborate or

8
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:51,540
mountain hike in the top corner and the

9
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,620
blue and then Alison Lee this is really the start of this because she's been

10
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,665
doing really all the heavy

11
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:07,205
and so first I'm gonna give you some background about ovarian cancer which is critical

12
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:12,245
to understand the way the field has changed over the past

13
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:18,145
twenty years since I've been doing this a little about the at the genealogy and then I'll focus

14
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:23,525
the rest of my talk on mama possible permanent therapy and service.

15
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:28,625
and then if there's time at the end. I'll talk about in the apartment.

16
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:39,125
so very cancerous. just to orient you

17
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:44,365
to. is there at his store clean.

18
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:49,605
this way we thought about this disease. was about

19
00:01:49,605 --> 00:01:57,771
ninety percent of deal the Leo and the mortgage

20
00:01:57,771 --> 00:02:02,811
surfing line free but every time. there has

21
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:08,131
been a change in our understanding and really.

22
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:13,151
so he also is gonna give

23
00:02:13,151 --> 00:02:18,331
us a call when get you. we really started off this view

24
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:24,371
that very in cancer don't start in the very end.

25
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:33,891
in the recent review we had in the chair.

26
00:02:33,891 --> 00:02:38,931
so no contribution. and there's a peer review or call me back. was at take

27
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:46,431
out all the accolades for Louise leave that to his mother. I hope

28
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:51,791
you're I can say that he really was a leader in this area. so

29
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:58,941
what we done now is which

30
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:06,801
end of the flip into plays a critical role in ovarian cancer

31
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:12,301
and we now understand the situation.

32
00:03:12,301 --> 00:03:17,781
the majority of cancers about seventy percent. most of them arise

33
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:22,881
in the Philippians two and what we also understand now is that the

34
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:29,101
other two most common in history. so likely arrives out of and Demetrius

35
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:35,381
which is next topic. in the atrium. attendees throughout the perch.

36
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:40,621
literally. so this

37
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:45,801
is really changed. the way we think about the disease and it's highline

38
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:51,381
manager from different genetic medications

39
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:56,421
underline the disease. but the other

40
00:03:56,421 --> 00:04:01,443
notable fact well Mary this is survival

41
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:06,523
is quite small. your forty six

42
00:04:06,523 --> 00:04:12,063
percent of women is really driven

43
00:04:12,063 --> 00:04:17,503
by the stage a diagnosis for the disease and that differs.

44
00:04:17,503 --> 00:04:23,083
five eight for what we call was just tired. but they really are just busy.

45
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:28,363
so you can see that the bank accounts are over eighty percent

46
00:04:28,363 --> 00:04:34,843
or diagnosed at stage three or four which is not a good

47
00:04:34,843 --> 00:04:40,743
date to be where it is real common. sense

48
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:47,043
more than half and nearly sixty percent of all our tightness in stage one.

49
00:04:47,043 --> 00:04:52,043
just the highlights that when you look at five year survival. that's the most

50
00:04:52,043 --> 00:05:00,697
common one which does not happen

51
00:05:00,697 --> 00:05:05,797
survival is eight percent. so once you get to stage three and four where most

52
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:10,797
cancers occur survival is well below the forty six

53
00:05:10,797 --> 00:05:16,497
percent that we talked about. overall.

54
00:05:16,497 --> 00:05:23,017
now move into that that the genealogy

55
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:29,097
about one. four percent.

56
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:35,137
that as we talked about is a rare cancer and I'm calling chance or

57
00:05:35,137 --> 00:05:42,037
different on your exposures show

58
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:47,677
is late as a varying cancer across

59
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:58,543
Florida. our combinations of risk factors and then

60
00:05:58,543 --> 00:06:04,383
the Brown.

61
00:06:04,383 --> 00:06:09,523
and then on the other side. we have frequency of the risk factor

62
00:06:09,523 --> 00:06:18,203
combination. I just wanna show you.

63
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:23,463
bye. have a great and that matters because these

64
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:28,603
are women who would be considered. average lifetime roof. but

65
00:06:28,603 --> 00:06:34,195
in fact their risk is actually out. what we consider

66
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:39,395
so the more we can understand about this actionable I mean actually have your slip and shoes

67
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:45,115
and room. so the more we can understand about the disease.

68
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:51,855
the more we can really advise maybe at much higher rest.

69
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:57,215
so what do we know about. so very. well we

70
00:06:57,215 --> 00:07:02,835
know that this message. bye. watch except for Sam. our

71
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:07,835
risk factors are associated with all types with oral contraception use

72
00:07:07,835 --> 00:07:13,815
the first item parity. July vacation tomorrow.

73
00:07:13,815 --> 00:07:19,095
family history increases your risk of also high. but there is a lot more

74
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:24,175
research and other factors. most

75
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:29,295
it see with you. so very counselor. I can't

76
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:34,695
get there time to talk without talking about oral contraception. it is

77
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:45,822
one of the things. Rosemary's number perfect team. each

78
00:07:45,822 --> 00:07:51,302
if you've used that five euros or more. which is pretty profound. so

79
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:57,362
we have an exposure that will prevent pregnancy. and

80
00:07:57,362 --> 00:08:02,662
reduce your risk of ovarian cancer which isn't to say there are some

81
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:08,222
side effects associated with it but it's fine Marge. I'm a big fan. so this

82
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:14,422
closure that occurs during the pre- menopausal period. it's an next is for Mono exposure.

83
00:08:14,422 --> 00:08:19,562
when I wanna talk to you about today. what about other

84
00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:24,622
things I Janice for. namely one and then the post menopausal

85
00:08:24,622 --> 00:08:29,762
period and not post menopausal hormone therapy. which can be given as estrogen

86
00:08:29,762 --> 00:08:34,842
alone or estrogen must purchase. why do women

87
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:40,322
take my mom. well flash.

88
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:45,786
I don't know I'm not there yet. but

89
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:51,006
I have friends and colleagues who I sit in the room with Alan they.

90
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:56,926
I mean pouring on someone second trip off almost all their photos

91
00:08:56,926 --> 00:09:01,926
and then fifteen minutes later. all the clothes are back on and so for women this

92
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:07,226
is a really such

93
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:12,686
having hormone therapy replacement and

94
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:18,406
really another main reason for Beaumont

95
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:23,806
to protect against from Overman

96
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:29,426
therapy has a pretty interesting history and says it first.

97
00:09:29,426 --> 00:09:35,406
my wife will be back in the nineteen sixties and it was delivered as an estrogen. only

98
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:40,586
at that time. bye. use and since the late seventies. what

99
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:46,002
we found is that women were having their bowling protected and

100
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:51,502
their hot flashes and the only reason they were getting in her

101
00:09:51,502 --> 00:09:56,842
and that was a pretty big deal. so what happened at that point is

102
00:09:56,842 --> 00:10:03,822
purchase was added to the hormone therapy to protect the end of me trim.

103
00:10:03,822 --> 00:10:09,102
so that way and then the late seventh. it was just delivered

104
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:14,162
as a sequential purchase. so it was given seven to ten days. have I

105
00:10:14,162 --> 00:10:19,242
them on. where's the estrogen is given every day and it was thought that that

106
00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:25,182
would be an effort to protect Dimitri from the post master.

107
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:32,422
but it wasn't totally clear that that was the case. I believe

108
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:37,522
another regimen became wisely. can you send that's continuous after gym class

109
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:42,982
projects and that's when the. the project is given along with the estrogen

110
00:10:42,982 --> 00:10:50,672
basically everyday two

111
00:10:50,672 --> 00:10:57,292
hundred and nineteen ninety three the balance health initiative began.

112
00:10:57,292 --> 00:11:04,072
and those results available. around.

113
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:09,192
two two three. and what you saw it was. I finally use

114
00:11:09,192 --> 00:11:14,672
the form and replacement therapy. because what was observed in the women's health initiative.

115
00:11:14,672 --> 00:11:19,952
as the after gym class projects for non- therapy.

116
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:27,872
please assist us with an increased risk of breath and so use

117
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:33,992
and what

118
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:39,012
California. we really saw mostly afternoon. your child can

119
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:44,244
use that to. so a lot of

120
00:11:44,244 --> 00:11:49,584
little talk about today I mean first still five million or more women using them.

121
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:55,004
so. it does have an impact on a very in cancer risk. if

122
00:11:55,004 --> 00:12:00,404
you are because of your other lifetime exposure history is in that higher

123
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:05,704
than average lifetime risk. but it also helps us understand he

124
00:12:05,704 --> 00:12:11,544
does biology and dizzy. so what about is very in cancer.

125
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:16,644
well two thousand nine. in the field with an important year.

126
00:12:16,644 --> 00:12:21,844
still early for me. I will talk about. the first thing

127
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:27,244
that happened was a paper that we've been working on for quite some time. was published

128
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:33,164
in town. it was met in Dallas.

129
00:12:33,164 --> 00:12:38,264
the publish literature and we showed very clearly. the estrogen therapy

130
00:12:38,264 --> 00:12:43,478
was associated with increased risk of pretty

131
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:48,518
Mike. have I another four spot like that show you later if I have time but it's

132
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:53,558
pretty beautiful. and these are both case control and

133
00:12:53,558 --> 00:12:58,678
everything lines up pretty well. we also looked at

134
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:05,578
after gym class project done and what we have here. we

135
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:10,918
did it was associated with increased risk but that increase risk was fifty to clear

136
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:16,046
by then what we observed with estrogen alone

137
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:21,046
not really piece our interest because as I mentioned after gym class

138
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:26,166
projects and to be Joe's sequential lease or continuously. so it

139
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:32,886
made us wonder whether or not. if it was due continuously

140
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:39,486
would just increase dress. go away. set

141
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:44,486
back to two thousand nine. that paper came out. the other thing that happened with

142
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:49,646
my son was born. I'm waiting nine years. have a reason to put a picture

143
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:54,726
of him in mind. I showed him last night he was thrilled he feels like

144
00:13:54,726 --> 00:14:00,746
I start today I told him he was the start. the thing other that I was in

145
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:05,746
there I. submitted a couple times

146
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:10,806
and I wanted to look at the relationship between home therapy you know very cancerous and it was

147
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:16,306
fun. few days before since birth. yeah.

148
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:21,459
about forward to two thousand eight Rock concert which

149
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:26,799
tells you he is now in the fourth grade he got braces last week.

150
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:31,959
and shockingly George. just in this message.

151
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:38,219
this message in class project and staff. this is a nine year journey for us.

152
00:14:38,219 --> 00:14:43,359
there are many news and some of about what long and I say

153
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:48,479
ready submit to because this manuscript is been out to collage. we

154
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:53,659
have obviously I denies about it for many years. but I wanted to present these results

155
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:59,459
here today day because you guys are living and breathing very in cancer and

156
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:04,579
I would love your feedback. I'd love to hear your feedback. that

157
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:09,899
it looks perfect.

158
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:15,039
way that we couldn't meet tomorrow. I could have an amazing

159
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:20,079
weekend. but more importantly we really want to get this right and that's why we

160
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,237
spent so much time on so I encourage your feedback. I copy for

161
00:15:25,237 --> 00:15:30,397
questions as I go through this. if you got something burning that would

162
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:36,857
be better answered in real-time and set to go on this journey.

163
00:15:36,857 --> 00:15:42,317
first of all I have now is nine hundred. this is George and my colleagues

164
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:47,397
there. this is at an International Consortium. comprise now is more than

165
00:15:47,397 --> 00:15:52,617
seventy five cruise around the world studying very cancer who have agreed

166
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:57,757
to purchase. Hayden collaborative analysis. and this work wouldn't be possible

167
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:04,857
without them. alright so

168
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:10,377
nine years to publish anything about. we

169
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:16,677
probably won't time to still publish on the risk between estrogen only.

170
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:21,951
my problems are very this papers at

171
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:28,231
at J N C I for good. waiting for a decision.

172
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:33,271
the ultimate decision. as you can see that it was published in obstetrics and gynecology was.

173
00:16:33,271 --> 00:16:38,351
it was not accepted. so it came back to us and as we were refinancing

174
00:16:38,351 --> 00:16:43,651
it out came to another classroom.

175
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:48,851
working on it. looking

176
00:16:48,851 --> 00:16:54,251
at menopausal per month for you. okay. service. so we got

177
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:59,391
a bit. but then the last.

178
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:04,771
this is Susan with associated

179
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:09,971
with increased risk. but interestingly it only have to some type serious and

180
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:15,391
then to me that was consistent between our two groups. and it's surprising

181
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:21,093
for example the Internet analysis. we saw increase because

182
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:26,253
you're together may have to buy a person in the case.

183
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:31,253
I'm not gonna talk to you much more about this because this is been published now for a couple of

184
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:36,353
years. the only thing I will say about this and the result was

185
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:41,513
no issue with duration of use which is a little curious

186
00:17:41,513 --> 00:17:47,273
where as we did find duration of and facts I'll talk about why that maybe

187
00:17:47,273 --> 00:17:52,513
later. alright. what about

188
00:17:52,513 --> 00:17:57,733
Susan Christian. this is really

189
00:17:57,733 --> 00:18:03,593
been wet this Johnny. it's about in term

190
00:18:03,593 --> 00:18:08,853
study design. will

191
00:18:08,853 --> 00:18:14,033
help our monster which is not as easy

192
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:19,113
to come by and if you might. so what exactly we needed to know the type of regiment was

193
00:18:19,113 --> 00:18:24,419
it continuous was sequential we needed to know for each woman.

194
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:29,639
use the form on therapy. was it sequential continuous did she also use

195
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:34,979
estrogen therapy. I think Shavon could talk much more. it's only about this but

196
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:40,279
when at least in our studies. tend to use multiple types

197
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:45,919
of regiment and there is a switch.

198
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,039
we only include the consolation control studies. all that we have. we

199
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,239
do not have cohort. participants we do now but we got

200
00:18:56,239 --> 00:19:01,419
we started. we only have a parent or Sonoma. so that

201
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:07,559
means that they were feeling ill in nature and invasive.

202
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:13,379
we included women who are post menopausal women who are not

203
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:18,699
me. that's really the group in which you seven after gym class projects

204
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:24,421
and as indicated. if you don't have a uterus

205
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:29,481
you can use estrogen alone. I'll send another outcome is giving the stock today it's

206
00:19:29,481 --> 00:19:35,021
my son now knows what a hysterectomy. he was present during the conversation yesterday

207
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:40,141
and he said what is that. so I explained it and he said. okay I just need to know

208
00:19:40,141 --> 00:19:45,741
that I

209
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:52,101
got pros and cons. alright. then we also

210
00:19:52,101 --> 00:19:57,257
have agent nine o'clock date because we were quite sure what the effective agent

211
00:19:57,257 --> 00:20:03,037
menopause would be but we wanted to be able to look at that. so

212
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:08,717
if this is a pregnancy data. I will show you in Dallas with over

213
00:20:08,717 --> 00:20:13,817
at eleven thousand two and eighteen thousand controls.

214
00:20:13,817 --> 00:20:21,217
but in this study because you had to have such healthy

215
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:26,757
studies they're all US study and we're down now to

216
00:20:26,757 --> 00:20:32,397
a little less than two thousand controls in about fifteen hundred cases. so you can

217
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:37,397
call to do a detailed analysis in ovarian cancer. you need

218
00:20:37,397 --> 00:20:42,657
to collaborate and even in doing. you can have some

219
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:52,837
pretty small numbers. alright so I'll just walk you through.

220
00:20:52,837 --> 00:20:58,728
so we Silver

221
00:20:58,728 --> 00:21:08,328
solution what you had to be a customer possible so that drops out some case but that.

222
00:21:08,328 --> 00:21:14,728
so that who women have a hysterectomy. for the reason that I

223
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:19,888
said and then we excluded women who

224
00:21:19,888 --> 00:21:24,968
would ever use estrogen alone therapy. and the reason is that

225
00:21:24,968 --> 00:21:29,968
we know the estrogen the loan is associated with increased risk and we want you

226
00:21:29,968 --> 00:21:35,108
to really understand what was happening with the estrogen plus projects. so

227
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:40,888
if you use menopausal estrogen therapy. were you excluded

228
00:21:40,888 --> 00:21:46,048
now we also wanted to understand continuous after gym class projects

229
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:51,088
done. so that was our next exclusion. if you wish to use any other

230
00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:56,148
type of estrogen pass projects and which is basically sequential

231
00:21:56,148 --> 00:22:01,148
therapy. you were you were foreman therapy high

232
00:22:01,148 --> 00:22:07,788
performance review or excluded solution.

233
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:13,068
although we've done sensitivity analysis around messages that we excluded women.

234
00:22:13,068 --> 00:22:18,288
please only use of CE PTA or continuous after gym class

235
00:22:18,288 --> 00:22:23,368
projects done. if it was before nineteen eighty five. because we know that

236
00:22:23,368 --> 00:22:28,548
this regiment really was not in use. prior to that.

237
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:33,548
we done it. talk to you later. bye. changes. but we're

238
00:22:33,548 --> 00:22:38,708
just trying to get at the most kind of clear

239
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:45,048
view of this relationship. the other is

240
00:22:45,048 --> 00:22:50,068
you as continuous as you can prosper

241
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:55,068
Justin with prior to menopause. and the reason is that we know from our country sectors

242
00:22:55,068 --> 00:23:00,250
that you up or month before menopause. it's protected and we didn't wanna

243
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:05,610
model that how is we end up with our

244
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:10,670
or small status. alright and then

245
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:16,170
just to do fine. you must reach us.

246
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:21,550
we'll just find using both components at least twenty five days

247
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:27,410
of the month. so if you go twenty five thirty one

248
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:32,610
in Dallas. we save ways to analyze

249
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:39,150
this case. we strive five study citation education level and ethnicity race

250
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:44,730
which then means that we're doing a conditional logistic regression. with those straight

251
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:50,750
and then we all adjusted. my number. other

252
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:55,830
concept is you be on my way to litigation and the mattresses in Jamaica pause

253
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:00,878
in parity

254
00:24:00,878 --> 00:24:06,438
alright so there were a few issues that we have addressed. one

255
00:24:06,438 --> 00:24:11,458
how we dealt with missing each menopause because although we required were studies

256
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:16,498
that we included to have agent menopause data. there

257
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:21,498
with Jill. it's the only variable that have more than one or two missing values. in

258
00:24:21,498 --> 00:24:26,838
fact three hundred twenty nine. and we're in menopause. so we have also

259
00:24:26,838 --> 00:24:31,978
done a million cents dividend policies around us including

260
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:37,318
excluding them and including them trying different ages

261
00:24:37,318 --> 00:24:43,618
not a pause assignment but not leaving what we did is that for users.

262
00:24:43,618 --> 00:24:49,998
they're eight or nine o'clock. I'm starting form on therapy

263
00:24:49,998 --> 00:24:55,018
or at the age of fifty. which ever was earlier. for never

264
00:24:55,018 --> 00:25:00,790
use the original deposit was. if they were lessons.

265
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:05,970
when they entered the study or fifty. we've done different top points to forty

266
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:11,310
eight fifty two fifty five for a signing agent menopause and it doesn't matter. quite frankly

267
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:17,130
if I don't even just for agent menopause. it doesn't matter. but we thought it would

268
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:24,010
and we think it's still important to

269
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:29,250
you in town. already said that we only counted.

270
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:34,410
you said after the agent menopause.

271
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:40,670
alright. what did we find. alright so bye.

272
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:46,830
is overall which is actually at the bottom down here.

273
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:51,870
the only difference in seasons is quite confusing amongst that's all now really how

274
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:58,180
to present these results. but overall we have

275
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:04,060
not a free dress. as a very account services.

276
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:10,120
with ever use of continuous performance.

277
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:15,880
it is. it's usually none of these values

278
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:25,440
from each other. we're high

279
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,060
based on use. so there is.

280
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:36,648
are smart ourselves. hey I

281
00:26:36,648 --> 00:26:41,868
seriously know us back.

282
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:47,308
we still don't have a huge number of cases.

283
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:52,408
so I have say that we like this and so far as it

284
00:26:52,408 --> 00:26:57,788
was what we had. I talked to side. we probably people think that projections are good

285
00:26:57,788 --> 00:27:02,928
from another parent cancer perspective there's a lot of speculation about it. this

286
00:27:02,928 --> 00:27:08,468
message serves to

287
00:27:08,468 --> 00:27:13,508
use post menopausal he was good and it was also to some extent

288
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:18,708
in line with our prior meda in Dallas. the next thing that

289
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:24,668
we did was walk for duration of. and also the fact.

290
00:27:24,668 --> 00:27:30,188
how recent to the time of your diagnosis. you

291
00:27:30,188 --> 00:27:35,817
so four months. so where

292
00:27:35,817 --> 00:27:41,437
the where you're there.

293
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:47,577
please there is no duration. if overall if you use less in five years.

294
00:27:47,577 --> 00:27:52,697
the OR was point eight four and if you use more than five years it was point

295
00:27:52,697 --> 00:27:58,737
eight three. not pretty flat and that's at least consistent

296
00:27:58,737 --> 00:28:03,897
with for current and past users and so there's also no recent.

297
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:09,277
have a sack and association either.

298
00:28:09,277 --> 00:28:15,297
so that was pretty confusing to us. because if it was really protected.

299
00:28:15,297 --> 00:28:20,337
we would expect like we saw with the possible estrogen therapy that we would have

300
00:28:20,337 --> 00:28:26,037
a purchase or generation of fact.

301
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:31,757
so now I wanna bring him back to

302
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:38,603
me. call afternoon Group. shes aware of that okay

303
00:28:38,603 --> 00:28:45,823
group. I bring you back. there's a paper that they published in two thousand.

304
00:28:45,823 --> 00:28:51,023
and basically what they worded in

305
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:56,023
there. was that both the estrogen alone and after

306
00:28:56,023 --> 00:29:01,163
Jim which was and

307
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:06,663
that is consistent with what we saw for estrogen alone but not

308
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:12,543
consistent with what we saw

309
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:17,883
message as said he's results

310
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:23,043
of the lab

311
00:29:23,043 --> 00:29:28,143
or for our studies ceo test studies here. so

312
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:33,143
our results are clear so and he's actually lining

313
00:29:33,143 --> 00:29:39,659
out there will be very few minutes in this case. so and many of them will actually end colorectal

314
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:46,219
primary. which is a known problem and you know this

315
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:51,259
it's free. you need to meet you right where we do

316
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:56,579
not see the same thing.

317
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:01,719
and just reminder that between these two groups our

318
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:06,719
estrogen regional loan result was basically similar with the

319
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:11,739
exception of the duration. so I think I

320
00:30:11,739 --> 00:30:17,579
know that collaborative group.. better than any paper I've.

321
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:23,979
so because I've spent a lot of time trying to

322
00:30:23,979 --> 00:30:29,439
why this would be different and this is in many ways. why this papers.

323
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:34,479
so long as we really cannot publish a paper without having some next

324
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:40,473
1 nation for see when I have here is

325
00:30:40,473 --> 00:30:45,513
a table as the primary difference. there are quite a few but these are the

326
00:30:45,513 --> 00:30:54,933
primary difference between Carl and Alice and.

327
00:30:54,933 --> 00:31:00,013
so in our analysis we've only included in the

328
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:05,413
only accounts. where at the club group. included

329
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:10,453
everything. which is not just base

330
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:15,513
about the little bit off and on. illegal tumors which we now have a completely

331
00:31:15,513 --> 00:31:20,833
different ideology. as well as borderline. also

332
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:25,853
called low malignant potential tumors which are also quite different. but

333
00:31:25,853 --> 00:31:31,093
the fact of the matter is that when we use the on analysis use

334
00:31:31,093 --> 00:31:36,663
and bring in those tumors. it doesn't change. our read

335
00:31:36,663 --> 00:31:43,283
so we don't think that that's a likely

336
00:31:43,283 --> 00:31:48,303
major. so that is a real

337
00:31:48,303 --> 00:31:53,723
difference with most recent regimen use.

338
00:31:53,723 --> 00:31:59,643
so the real difference between us and them. where the controversial

339
00:31:59,643 --> 00:32:04,863
comes in. you have to study. and this difference is actually

340
00:32:04,863 --> 00:32:10,003
only a month. is that so our results are consistent with what they find in case

341
00:32:10,003 --> 00:32:15,523
control study. I am almost not completely

342
00:32:15,523 --> 00:32:21,643
but there is driven by

343
00:32:21,643 --> 00:32:26,703
and an issue with the analytic approach that they use. as

344
00:32:26,703 --> 00:32:32,303
they take the most recent regiment for a one

345
00:32:32,303 --> 00:32:37,429
regimen you must closely to her diagnose and so if

346
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:43,689
the woman had been on a different regimen

347
00:32:43,689 --> 00:32:50,169
and did some switching. then you would

348
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:59,949
be very.

349
00:32:59,949 --> 00:33:05,009
you know we think we do case control studies pretty well. bye. you all.

350
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:12,627
of course I through. I don't give in North after many lecture on difference between

351
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:17,707
would you bring my calendar with picture eight books. every

352
00:33:17,707 --> 00:33:22,967
image of height of menopausal hormone therapy. where an

353
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:28,927
interview set up for hours. with the life calendar and the participant.

354
00:33:28,927 --> 00:33:35,247
so that your health

355
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:40,367
questionnaire and that questionnaire could be only given one. depending

356
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:47,847
on the study or repeated over time and also with different reading levels.

357
00:33:47,847 --> 00:33:53,267
almost all question. I mean any questionnaire included

358
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:58,707
here with differentiate between traditional loan and estrogen plus project Justin

359
00:33:58,707 --> 00:34:06,947
that's probably not in the detail whether it's continuous or sequential

360
00:34:06,947 --> 00:34:12,562
issue so we only included

361
00:34:12,562 --> 00:34:17,623
in our group. women whose only use a four month therapy was

362
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:23,462
continuous. so if you would you sequential.

363
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:28,482
so if you have previously used. estrogen therapy alone. we did

364
00:34:28,482 --> 00:34:39,242
not include you know where

365
00:34:39,242 --> 00:34:44,403
type of estrogen plus purchase. as well as

366
00:34:44,403 --> 00:34:51,242
anyone who also use estrogen.

367
00:34:51,242 --> 00:34:56,442
so where does that get it. so

368
00:34:56,442 --> 00:35:01,962
the first thought we had was that maybe sequential

369
00:35:01,962 --> 00:35:07,663
ass gym class projects. do not protect

370
00:35:07,663 --> 00:35:13,219
in the way that continuous does so we don't have big numbers.

371
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:18,619
just a question you. much more time in Europe in the collaborative

372
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:23,719
group study population. especially the course studies are largely made up

373
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:29,379
of European study. so we thought that

374
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:34,979
when we move much until after the. only.

375
00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:41,379
we don't see a proof of fact or I know.

376
00:35:41,379 --> 00:35:47,019
we only have eighty five users. twenty nine control service. but this

377
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:53,499
does not look like the smoking gun explaining the difference.

378
00:35:53,499 --> 00:36:01,119
so the next thing that we looked at what

379
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,819
surgeons cost per child. either sequential or continuous. including

380
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:12,957
prior use of estrogen center this is me

381
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:18,437
March. we actually see

382
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:23,757
an increased risk associated with Aster jump off her chest therapy.

383
00:36:23,757 --> 00:36:29,817
I have the same magnitude of what for

384
00:36:29,817 --> 00:36:35,656
now. it's a little bit tricky because

385
00:36:35,656 --> 00:36:40,837
women. realistically should use

386
00:36:40,837 --> 00:36:46,397
after gym class projects done first and then if they have a hysterectomy

387
00:36:46,397 --> 00:36:52,437
they would switch station alone. however as my call.

388
00:36:52,437 --> 00:36:57,497
tell me. it doesn't always work that way and we know in our date it doesn't always work

389
00:36:57,497 --> 00:37:03,637
that way. so we ask

390
00:37:03,637 --> 00:37:08,957
one nation. but there are still a few additional

391
00:37:08,957 --> 00:37:16,066
complicating factors.

392
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:22,487
the first is the women's health initiative. although

393
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:27,826
primary point was breast cancer is also listed many other points including ovarian cancer

394
00:37:27,826 --> 00:37:32,967
this is obviously around I was calling to try also the other

395
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:38,046
day to find non- increased. so very in

396
00:37:38,046 --> 00:37:43,146
cancer. this is a bit concerning to us because at the end of the day we

397
00:37:43,146 --> 00:37:56,207
really wanna just put into the sure things that.

398
00:37:56,207 --> 00:38:01,406
so we know that the WH I included the prior

399
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:06,735
users of estrogen therapy. that could be one explanation

400
00:38:06,735 --> 00:38:11,815
another explanation is that this is actually been some very few cases. this was

401
00:38:11,815 --> 00:38:17,094
not did not set out as a very cancer and point.

402
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:23,275
call me all one small numbers

403
00:38:23,275 --> 00:38:29,075
and then the other issue in the W H I formulation

404
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:34,575
is lower than what was likely use. most

405
00:38:34,575 --> 00:38:39,854
of our parts. we know that because in our LA data. we

406
00:38:39,854 --> 00:38:45,155
have all the brand information. so we

407
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:50,515
we know that during this kind of contemporary time what the dose was in

408
00:38:50,515 --> 00:38:55,635
the direction seeing you. so

409
00:38:55,635 --> 00:39:01,375
maybe you need a big enough dues of the purchase. to

410
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:06,375
block out the back of the church. so that is another

411
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:11,584
possibility but

412
00:39:11,584 --> 00:39:17,044
of course we have the obvious

413
00:39:17,044 --> 00:39:22,205
first question here is do we have a selection bias issue and

414
00:39:22,205 --> 00:39:27,764
that is really in our study. as a frequency

415
00:39:27,764 --> 00:39:33,604
for a month or two. I am. however

416
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:39,324
I would you urge that I don't think that's a problem given that we have

417
00:39:39,324 --> 00:39:44,665
seen the exact same association with the estrogen therapy for about.

418
00:39:44,665 --> 00:39:49,865
so you'd have to come up with a pretty complicated way to see you can get it right

419
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:56,445
with estrogen therapy but not with estrogen.

420
00:39:56,445 --> 00:40:01,625
obviously recall I could be going on but that would lead

421
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:07,304
to. I mean there's no reason to think that it's actually reporting by us.

422
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:13,044
so that's likely. bye. on

423
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:18,425
and all potential can founders I mean we have to justify everything that they adjusted

424
00:40:18,425 --> 00:40:23,425
for and the other. Hope for the analysis as well as

425
00:40:23,425 --> 00:40:28,425
one system. so we don't think that that's a

426
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:33,765
likely explanation and then there issues about the analytics strategy

427
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:39,725
and I think that those relate more to a generalized ability issues then a potential buyer.

428
00:40:39,725 --> 00:40:45,524
we have just exclusive use of continuous estrogen pills for Justin's

429
00:40:45,524 --> 00:40:51,345
and and so I don't think that that is

430
00:40:51,345 --> 00:40:56,406
creating a problem. but we issue where we don't

431
00:40:56,406 --> 00:41:01,805
see it do that that was a little

432
00:41:01,805 --> 00:41:07,185
confusing to us. I think probably in part because we want.

433
00:41:07,185 --> 00:41:12,285
we are high office. listen it would be. but if you

434
00:41:12,285 --> 00:41:18,365
think about our results we actually have no results. overall

435
00:41:18,365 --> 00:41:23,685
and particularly in zero seven and let me trio eight. there are quite close

436
00:41:23,685 --> 00:41:28,705
to one. it's really in clear so and you sent us where it's protected and that's what

437
00:41:28,705 --> 00:41:33,765
the collaborative Group. bye. we this

438
00:41:33,765 --> 00:41:38,985
happening. given that there is no duration of fact is that

439
00:41:38,985 --> 00:41:44,285
it's not that using an estrogen plus purchase and

440
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:49,565
print. is. it's having a project and the action

441
00:41:49,565 --> 00:41:54,674
and opposed ostrich just me. you know

442
00:41:54,674 --> 00:42:01,354
as soon as Shannon or rather no increased risk associated with using that ostrich.

443
00:42:01,354 --> 00:42:07,013
set what is the papers the other day.

444
00:42:07,013 --> 00:42:12,374
it doesn't increase their income service. and we think that the answer

445
00:42:12,374 --> 00:42:17,734
and then we talked about that we think

446
00:42:17,734 --> 00:42:24,753
got the answer wrong which we said and as polite as the way.

447
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:30,174
I'm in Albert Lee. very promising Cancer Research in Oxford and I'm anticipating

448
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:37,493
an angry call which is happening to other people. that's why it was like complicated

449
00:42:37,493 --> 00:42:43,394
but ultimately exciting. so that's where we are today.

450
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:48,974
so I left my feedback from you.

451
00:42:48,974 --> 00:42:54,273
this is big check tomorrow

452
00:42:54,273 --> 00:42:59,473
my career. other than that. my colleague Cathy Cho and top colleges here has

453
00:42:59,473 --> 00:43:04,473
developed the best and model for ovarian cancer where it takes

454
00:43:04,473 --> 00:43:09,573
her my year to street actually develop a very cancer and so we've got this

455
00:43:09,573 --> 00:43:14,793
window of being able to test different

456
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:20,033
exposure as to whether or not. bye. rest. so we're treating the

457
00:43:20,033 --> 00:43:25,293
end of the newly funded or. with estrogen alone with Astrid and prosper Justin

458
00:43:25,293 --> 00:43:30,553
and then we can see whether the mice and all

459
00:43:30,553 --> 00:43:36,594
that. I all of the women who

460
00:43:36,594 --> 00:43:57,454
might be happy to take

461
00:43:57,454 --> 00:44:10,594
hi

462
00:44:10,594 --> 00:44:23,533
this is

463
00:44:23,533 --> 00:44:28,753
Sue. I don't know for. if that is an explanation for

464
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:33,813
a very cancer we have investigated that as best we can

465
00:44:33,813 --> 00:44:40,094
in our data because for some of the studies. we

466
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:45,594
I mean I guess actually for all of the studies we know when they use relative to the original

467
00:44:45,594 --> 00:44:50,733
menopause. at least for the majority of women where we know in the pod. and that

468
00:44:50,733 --> 00:44:56,458
is not we thought you might but

469
00:44:56,458 --> 00:45:28,538
send. any

470
00:45:28,538 --> 00:45:34,038
questions please don't come to look at that.

471
00:45:34,038 --> 00:45:39,177
we just in the last year through different brands that we

472
00:45:39,177 --> 00:45:44,397
have I have changed the diet data for all

473
00:45:44,397 --> 00:45:49,438
of the studies here and have large number of another study and we

474
00:45:49,438 --> 00:45:58,016
are in the process of coding out new trends.

475
00:45:58,016 --> 00:46:04,296
so maybe I in am one of the things about the collaborative group

476
00:46:04,296 --> 00:46:11,176
studies. they have been a bit less

477
00:46:11,176 --> 00:46:16,696
rigorous which studies. they include in particular analysis

478
00:46:16,696 --> 00:46:22,236
which I completely understand it's a bit of a political issue that somebody has contributed there and

479
00:46:22,236 --> 00:46:27,416
expect to have Thursday to you. and so there's you know for sample

480
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:32,590
there study center. simply call church

481
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:38,709
where Pastor Jenkins. might be more common

482
00:46:38,709 --> 00:46:44,530
ones but they don't provide

483
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:49,889
only some sexy on control case for homework studies.

484
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:55,229
also don't have detailed date as we have and some of their studies

485
00:46:55,229 --> 00:47:00,750
happens back in six. he's in the seventies quite

486
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:07,149
include and in the past. that is also no

487
00:47:07,149 --> 00:47:28,769
well. ya

488
00:47:28,769 --> 00:47:35,388
[INAUDIBLE]

489
00:47:35,388 --> 00:47:40,548
is on me Jeff. cell

490
00:47:40,548 --> 00:47:45,848
phone same faster. but it says the variables that we try

491
00:47:45,848 --> 00:47:53,688
to find on. which is you know basically like doing. I'm not

492
00:47:53,688 --> 00:47:59,648
in Dallas. they say.

493
00:47:59,648 --> 00:48:06,088
the only strategy. be on. so

494
00:48:06,088 --> 00:48:11,628
I don't see it now because when we are transportation

495
00:48:11,628 --> 00:48:17,848
factors only. bring BMI as the certification factor. it doesn't change.

496
00:48:17,848 --> 00:48:26,558
so that's why I

497
00:48:26,558 --> 00:48:35,458
you know

498
00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:57,618
there.

499
00:48:57,618 --> 00:49:07,739
so

500
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:28,587
just let you know

501
00:49:28,587 --> 00:49:34,087
yeah I need an hour to see how you was.

502
00:49:34,087 --> 00:49:40,386
was it very interesting. we have we we went through in our

503
00:49:40,386 --> 00:49:47,187
Horsham. it's a little over two or three years. of sitting every model

504
00:49:47,187 --> 00:49:52,187
in multiple putting multiple. essentially a little model

505
00:49:52,187 --> 00:49:57,207
interaction with terms to deal with the variable. we thought should be strong to fight

506
00:49:57,207 --> 00:50:03,547
on strata five model. and it just did model and

507
00:50:03,547 --> 00:50:09,906
we never put it in to every paper but we certainly did every analysis

508
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:14,987
every able that way and it was matter

509
00:50:14,987 --> 00:50:20,646
which doesn't mean it doesn't matter at all. that we could set up

510
00:50:20,646 --> 00:50:26,047
an hi Chelsea they usually. trying to find

511
00:50:26,047 --> 00:50:31,087
even more variables. so we are trying to find. you can

512
00:50:31,087 --> 00:50:36,747
have an informative street and then you can be included. a lot of

513
00:50:36,747 --> 00:50:42,567
people. so they

514
00:50:42,567 --> 00:50:50,267
generally

515
00:50:50,267 --> 00:50:55,707
we offer online education level as well. but

516
00:50:55,707 --> 00:51:00,747
in the data center this small. it's a bit tricky. so

517
00:51:00,747 --> 00:51:05,847
I. I didn't know how soon you want Susan their analysis that

518
00:51:05,847 --> 00:51:11,247
I probably can't even pick out because they didn't make it into

519
00:51:11,247 --> 00:51:16,267
them. when I went and when it comes out. is

520
00:51:16,267 --> 00:51:22,458
that I will get a call from Bowser and we will negotiate

521
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:27,678
heard doing the analysis that she had at least a subset

522
00:51:27,678 --> 00:51:35,512
of study. she

523
00:51:35,512 --> 00:51:48,515
just wondering if you guys all. thanks Lisa. very
