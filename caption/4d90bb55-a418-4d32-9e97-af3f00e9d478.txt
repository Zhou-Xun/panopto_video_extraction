1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,020
The old interface. There we go. All right.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:11,910
So we'll be talking about implementation in the next couple of weeks and evaluation and then we're easing into your group project.

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:17,430
So the idea there is that everybody should be able to work together in a little

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,270
group and applying some of the things that we've taught you throughout the class.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:29,069
So don't panic about that. We'll be talking about that in our Wednesday class in a bit more detail and helping you form some groups.

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,140
You get to choose your own groups for that. So okay.

7
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:43,050
Today I'm going to be talking about climate change and disaster response, disaster preparedness as well in the context of policy implementation.

8
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:54,960
So policy implementation is something that I study pretty closely because it's it's quite important to me.

9
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:02,010
Now, I want to test your understanding first. So what do you think policy implementation is?

10
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,210
Because I'm using that word, but maybe not everybody uses that word the same way I do.

11
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,550
When I start talking about policy implementation, what on earth do I mean? Please.

12
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,500
Hopefully these things are working. That you get. I.

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,550
The oh no it is the enforcement of policies after a policy has been pastor turned into a law and how it's put into practice.

14
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,150
Yep. So here we have a policy implementation as a car.

15
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,370
The implementation is the important part because the car's not going anywhere unless

16
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,690
somebody bothered to put the wheels on and maybe check this checked for safety.

17
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:51,230
This car was not quality tested properly in the factory, so after policies decided implementation is everything that happens,

18
00:01:51,240 --> 00:02:00,270
do put it into practice so you can think of this as actually the biggest part of the policy process that nobody ever talks about.

19
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,000
That's why this makes these kinds of issues make me frustrated.

20
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:12,240
After a law has been passed or a policy has been decided at the executive level, you have to do things to put that policy in place.

21
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,660
There have to be guidelines drawn up so everybody knows what they're doing.

22
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,740
There have to be some tough time, some regulations that come under the primary law.

23
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,540
Those guidance and regulations have to be put into practice. That requires money.

24
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,689
So money has to be acquired to implement the policy.

25
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,400
And if you don't fund a policy, that's actually a great way of shutting it down.

26
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,270
And people who don't like public health policies like to do that,

27
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:42,090
that we passed the policy and then we don't provide the system with any money to actually put the policy into place.

28
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:56,969
So. Why might policies in practice differ a bit from what is stated in the law or in the regulations

29
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:02,130
or in any other documentation that tells you what the policy is when we put it into practice?

30
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:08,010
Why do we not always get the results that we want? There are lots of different reasons here, but maybe we can touch on some.

31
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,060
They're the same things we say every week in this class, if you need a hint.

32
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,490
Sorry I've gone blind this morning. There you go. Thank you.

33
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:40,050
Maybe like, if it's like a partizan thing, like people on the other party are, like, purposely trying to make it not happen in practice.

34
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,870
Even if it was passed. Yeah, so that's definitely true.

35
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,270
Partizanship gets involved and sometimes that's in the form of cases and things.

36
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,560
So people change this because they don't agree with the basic idea and they haven't

37
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,500
another opportunity to challenge it in court after the laws have been passed.

38
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:05,990
What else might be some reasons why we don't get the policy that's written on paper in practice?

39
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,910
Please. Oh, right. That was like maybe like funding.

40
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,260
And if it's not, like, properly funded or funded differentially, like across the board.

41
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:24,590
Yep. Yeah. So another issue is you get funding in different places is is a little bit different.

42
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,120
So when we're talking about the United States, for example, we're talking about a federalist system.

43
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:35,330
And so one state might have better resources and capacity and funding to implement something,

44
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,649
whereas another state or jurisdiction might have a different situation.

45
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:46,670
That can make a really big difference because policies are often designed assuming that everywhere in the country is pretty equal.

46
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,620
As we know, that's not the case.

47
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:56,660
There's different infrastructure, capacity, levels of funding, and some governments are just more competent than the others as well.

48
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,560
So here's my list. So.

49
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:08,330
The reason. We as the public don't tend to pay a lot of attention to all the stuff that happens.

50
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:14,720
But if the funding if the policy is not fully funded or if it differs,

51
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,600
the funding differs by place or maybe by the target population that can introduce some extra disparities.

52
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:29,150
Some people might get the benefit of the policy, while others don't. Sometimes it's just a lack of a clear authority to act.

53
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,860
Right? This could be. Is this a federal issue or a state issue?

54
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,650
So it could be an issue of federalism and conflicts between the state governments and the national government.

55
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:45,920
Or alternatively, but less commonly, conflicts between local governments in the state government.

56
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,540
This could also be the case between different government agencies.

57
00:05:50,540 --> 00:06:01,460
So the COVID 19 pandemic is a great case of this. You have one set of agencies, predominantly the CDC and HHS, focused on health and public health.

58
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:07,090
You have one set of agencies focused on emergency management, which I'm going to talk about today.

59
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:12,829
So there you're talking more about agencies like FEMA and the two agencies.

60
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:18,319
If they don't talk to one another. You're going to have real implementation problems on the ground.

61
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:25,100
Right, especially if there's some confusion about which agency has the authority to act.

62
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,940
Poor fit. So sometimes the policy just is bad and it doesn't actually reflect the way that the system works in practice.

63
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:43,000
Maybe it doesn't reflect the way that the health care system works, or it doesn't reflect the way that people affect their environment.

64
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:52,749
So a lot of environmental policy has this problem. Maybe the this there's not a good fit with how businesses operate or how communities work.

65
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,000
Right.

66
00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:05,200
So this is one of the reasons why we're having you respond to in policy memo two to a call for public comment and those public comment opportunities.

67
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:13,180
Part of the reason that they exist is governments have a hard time understanding what's happening in different parts of the private sector,

68
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,430
in different communities around the country.

69
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,600
And so governments are dependent on that information to create a policy that is a good fit with current practice.

70
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:31,490
If you go and create something a bit too radical, the wheels can come off pretty quickly, as you can see.

71
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:37,030
Sorry, because I'm British. I've been following this obsessively. The British change of Prime Minister.

72
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,450
The list just produced a really great budget.

73
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,620
Wonderful budget, or it was terrible. Put it into practice.

74
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,150
It did not fit with anybody's expectations. It caused a huge problem.

75
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:56,290
So if the policy doesn't fit with expectations or realities on the ground, you're in serious trouble.

76
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:03,079
I think the UK is still going to have a long way to go to make up for that Â£70

77
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,720
billion worth of debt that they accrued just by announcing the wrong budget.

78
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:13,300
Anyone wants to talk about that with me later. Feel free of discretion.

79
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:22,000
Discretion is a tricky one because sometimes we want to give government officials some discretion because of questions of fit.

80
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:29,950
Right. Government discretion for different officials at different levels can be a way to make a policy fit a bit better on the ground,

81
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:38,740
even if it's poorly designed. But discretion is a problem when the person exercising that discretion might have particular biases.

82
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:47,049
So here I'm explicit, explicitly talking about when officials might use their discretion to enforce the law

83
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:52,230
in such a way that it either reinforces existing bias or actually introduces bias,

84
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:59,110
more bias into the process. So then you end up with a discriminatory policy, which is is not what we want.

85
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:06,280
I'm kind of connected to that idea, is also how the issue gets portrayed in the media.

86
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:13,450
So we're going to talk about this briefly in a minute. When we talk about disasters and climate change, the way that different groups,

87
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:21,880
different individuals get depicted and different parts of the country as well get depicted in the media influences, political decisions.

88
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,300
It influences how policies get implemented by officials.

89
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,520
And so, again,

90
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:36,880
you're talking about a situation where you're either reinforcing disparities or an injustices or you're creating them via implementation.

91
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:45,370
In this case, influenced by the way that the media portrays people involved in that issue and then public opinion more generally.

92
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,990
So you're again stepping quite a bit further away from.

93
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:58,220
Good good practice as we would like to see it finally pull capacity and coordination.

94
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,709
Sometimes governments just lack the capacity to implement something. So it's okay.

95
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:10,190
Passing a law that seems ethical, seems evidence based, seems what we want to see in public health.

96
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,030
If then the public health system doesn't have the capacity to actually implement it.

97
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:20,080
So there are big questions right now about the ability of local health departments to to

98
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:27,260
really deliver on on some given the workforce shortages in local public health right now,

99
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,190
it's difficult for them to deliver on some of the functions.

100
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,670
And during the height of the pandemic, we saw things like inability to actually conduct adequate contact tracing.

101
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,049
That kind of stuff really matters and it really affects people's lives.

102
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:49,880
It's a question of implementation, though, where, again, as a society, we don't necessarily pay as much attention to this as we should.

103
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:57,409
So the other type of poor capacity is failing to coordinate effectively.

104
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:04,040
So if you don't have a lot of capacity yourself as a government or an agency, and even if you do,

105
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:08,630
I would hope that you would try to coordinate with other agencies that might have a stake in this,

106
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:18,860
and in particular other interest groups that might have knowledge of the problem and help you to be informed and implement the policy in a decent way.

107
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,620
Especially you should be contacting and forming these relationships over time, not at the point where the problem arises.

108
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:37,610
So again, the other reason the implementation is difficult to deal with is it relies on forming trusted relationships over time.

109
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,830
And for the issue we're going to talk about today in terms of climate change and disaster preparedness,

110
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:52,010
these have to be quite often local trusted networks and there has to be trust between government and citizens and and people in the community.

111
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,090
And that's really hard to build up and it's very hard to build up at the last minute.

112
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,880
So hopefully you can see there are so many different ways that policy can go wrong after you've actually passed it.

113
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:13,219
So I hope that this inspires more people to think about what happens after the laws put in place,

114
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,240
because normally a lot of people do that much advocacy and then they stop.

115
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,420
So I would urge you to continue.

116
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:34,519
We're going to talk a bit about a particular form of disaster today, sort of talking about situations where there's an emergency declaration.

117
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,710
We've actually defined this as a disaster. There are ways that that's defined in policy.

118
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:51,020
And here we would say so. We have some cases of obviously, very sadly in the last few years, quite frequently wildfires, flooding.

119
00:12:52,340 --> 00:13:00,229
We are really concerned right now. The people I work with who's at the Army Corps of Engineers are really worried about heat,

120
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:07,880
excessive heat, protecting people from that, of course, and saying, of course, this is horrible.

121
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,300
A lot of these problems are worse if you personally have poorer capacity.

122
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:20,240
Right. And one of the issues we're talking about here is what should be the collective response to these disasters?

123
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:28,610
And can we collectively respond to these disasters in such a way that we reduce the burden which falls

124
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:33,410
predominantly on people who have fewer resources to begin with or may be marginalized in other ways?

125
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,050
So. To talk about what a disaster is.

126
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:49,599
I would say we're talking about man made disasters here because there's a tendency to think in climate change that this is not beyond our control.

127
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,460
But we as a society think about how cities are engineered.

128
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,560
We engineer communities and buildings and roads in certain ways.

129
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:06,970
We also determine the policies that are responsive to these things, both in the moment and over time.

130
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,979
So one of the reasons I'm sick and emphasizing the human element here,

131
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:19,150
it's not necessarily an argument about climate change, although I do think climate change is caused by human activity.

132
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:29,530
But also the responses to things like climate change that can result in disasters are to do with things that we can do and we have control over.

133
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:37,870
So the other problem here is that not all disasters are framed in the same way.

134
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,230
We might very well think that it's a disaster.

135
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:46,000
If there's a tornado going through town, it could be very visible.

136
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,559
We might not think or know that it's a disaster.

137
00:14:50,560 --> 00:15:00,340
If poor people in that town are, or people who are experiencing homelessness cannot find shelter when it's this excessive heat.

138
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,790
That might be a much less visible disaster. Right.

139
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:10,210
So if there is well, if there are wildfires on the news, if there's flooding, if there's a hurricane,

140
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:16,450
we have a lot of footage that we can see and peruse as a society and we focus on those problems.

141
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:26,320
There are other things that are disasters, that are the causes of morbidity and mortality that we don't necessarily focus on as much.

142
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:32,350
But I think we should obviously, I'm going to say this all disasters are political.

143
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,489
This is a very. Very political issue.

144
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:45,229
And again, it's mostly around shaping the response both long term and in the short term to these disasters when they occur,

145
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,420
as well as deciding what is a disaster and what is it.

146
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,620
The national conversation and the media conversation plays into that.

147
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:59,720
So it's definitely also politically framed. And by that, I mean it's about who has power in this situation and who doesn't.

148
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,960
And the other problem with some of these disasters is we focus on the part where the streets are flooded.

149
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:14,390
We don't focus on the years after that where people's houses are rebuilt, hopefully, or infrastructure downtown is rebuilt.

150
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,370
We tend to focus less as a society and in the media on the aftermath of these things.

151
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:27,400
And so the disaster period, officially in policy and in reality for the people affected,

152
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:33,999
can often last a lot longer than we think because this might only be coming to our attention over a matter of days.

153
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:42,530
Right. And we're not solving currently any of the problems that are causing these disasters.

154
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:53,650
I think so. There needs to be not only a lot of adaptation, but a lot of adaptation at the systemic level and societal level.

155
00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:01,060
I think that we still put far too much of the burden on the individual to be adaptive and resilient in these situations.

156
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:11,110
So now if you are all thoroughly. This is some emergency management language.

157
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:19,510
So anybody done any projects or been engaged in any of this stuff before and in environmental health or emergency management at all?

158
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:24,340
Well, this language is weird, but we're just going to introduce you to a couple of key terms.

159
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,950
There's mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery.

160
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,580
And I'm going to talk about a fifth, which is resilience. Don't worry.

161
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,030
You don't have to write this all down, right? The second, a slide for each one.

162
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,170
So mitigation. This is the YMCA, which is pretty near my house.

163
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:53,720
And here. We're talking about measures that can reduce the impact of a situation that's to do with climate change and weather patterns.

164
00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:05,120
So in this case, you can sometimes you see people putting into their their properties or in these municipal buildings better drainage,

165
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:12,889
different planting to soak up water. And also in this building, they're doing what we hope that more buildings do,

166
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:20,150
especially if we're talking about affordable housing in areas where they're not traditionally as desirable because they might flood,

167
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:27,380
put the car park on the ground floor, put the parking lot down here and the more important stuff at the top.

168
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,790
So there's some design elements and and things here.

169
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:38,180
Mitigation is anything we do in this vein to try and lessen the impact of a disaster should it occur.

170
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:42,140
Right. That's a bit different than preparedness.

171
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:53,600
Preparedness is basically planning in this regard. So there's a lot of evidence that planning doesn't work as well as we would like it to.

172
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,700
We try to we have emergency plans.

173
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:05,029
We hand emergency plans for pandemic. It turns out a lot of the emergency plans for pandemics in many parts of the world,

174
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,499
we're actually preparing for a flu pandemic rather than a coronavirus pandemic,

175
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:17,510
which was a huge problem because what you might want to do for a flu pandemic scenario is probably not what you want to do for a coronavirus pandemic,

176
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:23,059
it turns out. So nevertheless, I would say I think preparedness is important,

177
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:31,370
especially if it forces you and especially government agents to think about who they should be partnering with ahead of time.

178
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:38,210
Should they? Do I need to know the number of my local emergency manager if I'm in the public health department, yes.

179
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,310
Do I need to know who I should be bringing on board from local health systems?

180
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:49,340
Yes. Do I need to know what community groups and representatives I should be engaging with

181
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:53,520
to try and understand how people are going to behave if I have to evacuate them?

182
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:01,310
Yes. So there's some aspects of this which even if the plan is wrong or the plan fails, which it does,

183
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:06,260
unfortunately, more than we would like, the connectivity part of this is is important.

184
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,420
Response.

185
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:21,640
So this is Donald Trump throwing some, I think the kitchen rolls of toilet rolls at some people distributing, you know, distributing aid or whatever.

186
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:28,830
This is a this is an issue because this is the part that is very visible.

187
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:37,350
Response is really visible because we see on the news, okay, there's been a hurricane that's severely affected Puerto Rico.

188
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:47,100
And then we see things like this photo opportunity where politicians or whoever distributing and or doing a visit,

189
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:53,190
you see the president flying on his plane to wherever the difficult part of this is.

190
00:20:53,430 --> 00:21:00,480
That response needs to go on for a lot longer, responses in this case, solving immediate problems.

191
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:06,810
And that's very attractive from a political perspective. And also, there's a bit of a.

192
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:14,760
I want to say more glamorous, but that's not quite the right word. More glamorous tinge to this immediate response.

193
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:26,250
Rather than people doing the hard work to build better infrastructure over time, or following up three, six, 12 months, three years after the fact.

194
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:35,670
Right. So sometimes the response can create new problems because it is of all of these parts, probably the most politically motivated.

195
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:42,690
So if you decide as a president that you're not that interested in the problems of people in Puerto Rico,

196
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,870
but you're much more interested in the problems of people in Texas.

197
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,180
And I'm using those two specific examples because they were to places that had severe hurricanes,

198
00:21:51,660 --> 00:22:02,790
and the US response in Texas was much quicker and gave people a lot more money than the US response in Puerto Rico, which was frankly depressing.

199
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:12,450
And that's the kind of thing that you can get with response, because it is a politically motivated part of this puzzle.

200
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,200
Hopefully we want to see some recovery.

201
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:23,790
So we want to see the community return to the same or hopefully even better over time if you have to rebuild things.

202
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:28,739
We would hope that things there's some consideration and planning going into that

203
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,340
to try and improve the systems that weren't functional the first time around.

204
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,960
However, that doesn't always happen, as you can imagine in practice,

205
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:44,250
because of the different interests and capacities of local people, local businesses and local governments.

206
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:50,310
And I'll talk a bit more about that in a minute, but hopefully we get to recovery.

207
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:56,640
But this is the less glamorous or politically sexy part because it has to go on a lot longer.

208
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:07,739
And so this this guy, this there were some students who graduated in this town after basically all their houses burned down.

209
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:14,640
There were wildfires there. And so I want to be careful using this word of resilience.

210
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:19,760
So anybody heard this before or has it been discussed in any of your classes?

211
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,850
How would you define what resilience is?

212
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:30,290
Please. Who's got the cube? Thank you.

213
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:38,900
You have enough to make it. Thank you. The way that I see resilience is the ability to kind of bounce back after some sort of issue.

214
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,740
Yeah. So that would be exactly what I would define as.

215
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,660
And why I want to be careful here is that it sounds great, right?

216
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:52,900
Resilience. We'll all be resilient and we'll just somehow magically be more resilient,

217
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,059
even though we're the same people with the same position at sea and the same

218
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,800
resources and maybe even fewer resources if the economy's not going so well.

219
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,119
But somehow, if we can just strive to be more resilient, we'll be able to fix some of these problems.

220
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,810
Right. And I'm saying this on the individual level,

221
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:15,290
you can also say this on the community level or this jurisdictional level, like we should have resilient communities.

222
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:21,370
We should have a resilient health system. We should have resilient cities.

223
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:33,140
Right. So the idea here is to is that a resilient system or community should be able to keep going and maintain basic functions,

224
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:44,960
even though there's a crisis in this case, a disaster. But I want you to be careful, because the emphasis on individuals is a bit misleading.

225
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:50,809
It's very hard to be resilient if you don't have the resources or capabilities to do that.

226
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:58,100
Right. And so I think people's capacity to be resilient, it varies a lot and the same for communities.

227
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:04,970
So we have to ask some of these important questions around this response model.

228
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,200
There are a lot of political scientists, as I said,

229
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:16,310
to focus not on the recovery part or the mitigation part is that the boring parts that nobody pays attention to.

230
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:22,310
But on this sort of response part where it's the US federal government or whoever to the rescue.

231
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,050
Right. And the problem is that at that point, for some things, it's too late.

232
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:34,750
There are actions that should have been taken prior to that point. Also, we got to be really careful.

233
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:40,780
Like, what does it mean to build New Orleans better in that context?

234
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:44,230
Who is it better for? Is it better for everybody?

235
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:51,879
There are huge equity questions there, right. If we are rebuilding people's homes in coastal Florida,

236
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:58,060
where they're like very likely to be flooded and destroyed again or there's erosion, is that responsible?

237
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:02,290
Is that a responsible use of resources? And this poor gentleman.

238
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,659
And is this is paradise? Which is the other reason that got so much news.

239
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,310
Attention is the name of the town.

240
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:22,149
Should we be celebrating this paradise graduation in 2019 in the way that we did, which was very much like, look at these heroic, resilient students.

241
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:31,990
Isn't that amazing? Rather than. Unpicking the reasons that caused them to lose their homes in the first place and pay more attention to that.

242
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:40,210
It's kind of a nasty discourse to say, Oh, look at these great individuals that have succeeded,

243
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,560
but the system has failed and the system has failed them,

244
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:51,970
and it's still failing people in places that have been affected in the last five or ten years by these situations.

245
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,040
And we don't pay as much attention to those issues as a community.

246
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:02,460
Does anyone have questions? I'm making a really strong political argument here.

247
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:14,090
Maybe I'm missing some things. No.

248
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,940
All right, here's the housing example. So.

249
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:29,570
This is an example of the long term effects of a disaster.

250
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,430
You can see here, there's just two buildings there left standing.

251
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:40,140
Well, they're not left standing. They're rebuilt. And everything else around it not rebuilt.

252
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:49,320
One of the issues is that the rebuilding happens again with with disparities built into it.

253
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:57,240
So you've got some sites where the the predominant businesses are going to be rebuilt,

254
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:03,060
more expensive real estate, where the land is more expensive, it's going to be rebuilt first.

255
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,950
And the affordable housing, which is often inland.

256
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:15,420
That's not such a great development prospect and is more likely to be flooded or destroyed by whatever.

257
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:23,040
We tend to put affordable housing in those places where the real estate environment's already less desirable.

258
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:29,490
So maybe the affordable housing doesn't get rebuilt and maybe not quickly or at all.

259
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,240
So the differential impact on those people who would be in that affordable,

260
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:40,310
affordable housing versus a more expensive residence, they're going to have a longer impact.

261
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,400
It's going to be more severe.

262
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:52,650
Being displaced is a huge problem for long term sustainability of your life economically, socially, in terms of things like education and training.

263
00:28:52,650 --> 00:29:00,240
So it's a huge loss. In addition, in terms of upward mobility for potential for those populations.

264
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,659
And then the other problem is that your local support network is disrupted.

265
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,880
So you can see. If you live here.

266
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:21,690
What infrastructure you have left. Right. So imagine that also socially in terms of where is your school, where is your faith community,

267
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:28,809
where are your neighbors, where are the people who you might relate to in terms of your identity, your language?

268
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:34,330
Right. Disrupting those networks has a really important negative impact.

269
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:40,720
And again, it's going to be worse for some people rather than others, particularly if you're already marginalized in some way.

270
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:48,040
And the other thing here is the developers see this as a clean slate, which is a huge problem.

271
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:58,010
So you're going to get affordable housing or less costly housing replaced with more salable prospects in some cases.

272
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:05,079
Right. Developers buying up the land, using this as an investment opportunity, which is not by itself necessarily bad.

273
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,209
But if enough of that happens across the community,

274
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:14,560
you can see that that's really going to change the shape of of that place and maybe in some some negative ways.

275
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,460
So Public Health and emergency management.

276
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:30,780
I'm drawing a bit here if you want to hear more about this. I have a really amazing student working with me whose name is Kasha Classer,

277
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:39,640
and her work is exactly on the COVID 19 pandemic and looking at the relationship between public health and emergency management.

278
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:45,430
And part of the problem is that there's not much of a relationship between public health and emergency management,

279
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:54,100
and that's a huge issue at the federal level. You have competing bureaucratic agencies, as I've said.

280
00:30:54,790 --> 00:31:06,640
FEMA, for the most part for emergency management and then CDC or other parts of HHS and the two agencies don't necessarily coordinate well at the top.

281
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,910
But we're also talking about different competing professions with different characteristics.

282
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,690
So these are both kinds of stereotypes of public health profession professionals and emergency management professionals.

283
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:26,290
So I'm painting with a very broad brush, obviously, but public health is a longstanding profession.

284
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:33,669
It's not new. We provide a lot of ongoing services for the community as a lot of direct health care and other things

285
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:38,680
that gets done and care coordination in addition to like public health surveillance and prevention.

286
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,870
And the idea, at least I think, in our discipline,

287
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:49,060
is that we all agree we will try and act on the basis of science, although that goes wrong sometimes.

288
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:58,690
And there's a lot of, I think, more of a culture of collaboration. Engagement doesn't always work, and it's not always perfect across the discipline.

289
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:02,380
But when we compare it to emergency management, those things are more prominent.

290
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:08,890
You know, emergency management doesn't use terms like social determinants of health, for example.

291
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:12,940
So emergency management is a much newer profession.

292
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,890
There's a lot of engagement from the army, from the military, from the police as well.

293
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,780
And so people get recruited into emergency management from those professions.

294
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,630
There's a focus in the profession on fast action.

295
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:37,030
So the the sexier part of this being the response in the moment, rushing to the rescue kind of thing.

296
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:45,760
And again, I think we have more emergency managers than we used to, especially at the municipal level.

297
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,839
A lot of those people who are doing a lot of good planning work the rest of the time,

298
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,850
but they don't necessarily get engaged or funded well until we have a big crisis.

299
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:08,440
And frankly, a lot of what emergency responders would do is under emergency conditions, where sometimes the normal rules and behaviors are suspended.

300
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:19,690
So there's also a lot of discretion in there, which is a big problem. So the two the difference between the two fields is also logistical.

301
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,900
Right. Unfortunately, what my Ph.D. student is finding is that public health nationally,

302
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:33,850
our ability to have the logistical capacity to deliver things that communities need is is poor

303
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:39,340
when compared to emergency management who don't have the workforce because we're underfunded,

304
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:47,980
we don't have the distribution networks needed to always deliver vaccines or other treatments on time.

305
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:53,380
So the pandemic has kind of shone a light on some of these things, whereas emergency managers have.

306
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,510
For the most part, access to better distribution of resources and logistical capacity.

307
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,530
But they don't have the public health ethos.

308
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:12,190
So that causes a lot of problems in a situation like the COVID pandemic, where there's not enough coordination between the two.

309
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:24,620
I have to include this part because it's kind of important actually in an emergency situation, we look to the Stafford Act,

310
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:32,030
a piece of legislation that lets the federal government declare a state of emergency, but the state has to request it first.

311
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,440
So this is a nice bit of politics there you.

312
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:45,000
Already running into trouble if your governor doesn't think a state of emergency is going to benefit them politically.

313
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,190
And that's a huge problem.

314
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:54,390
Even when people are in great need, the state of emergency might not be declared when it should be, and that could have some serious outcomes.

315
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:00,959
So the state of emergency is quite important because it unlocks funds that are held by the executive.

316
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:09,570
So you don't have to like appropriate new money to try and put this pay for this emergency action and.

317
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:17,690
It's administered by FEMA, which is a very partizan agency, basically.

318
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:25,200
You know, a lot more of a Republican biased agency is created to.

319
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:33,370
Basically respond to these disasters. It gets better or worse funded depending on who's in government.

320
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:41,950
And it's frankly messed up a lot in terms of implementation and responsible for poor delivery.

321
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:50,200
In a lot of cases, the lack of capacity in FEMA personally in the work that we did during the COVID pandemic,

322
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:55,450
the lack of ability for FEMA regions to really do much was surprising to me,

323
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,680
and I already am very cynical about government's capacity to respond to emergencies.

324
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,540
So there's a lot of federal discretion about what can happen.

325
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:09,520
If we're talking about a public health emergency, the status isn't as clear.

326
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:15,730
There is a separate public health emergency fund, and you can make a public health emergency declaration.

327
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,640
Sometimes that fund doesn't have enough money in it.

328
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:30,400
As we discovered in some recent disasters, that was very small amount of money there for responding to natural disasters, and that's a huge problem.

329
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:40,180
But you can unlock some some big indirect money. You can get a waiver to operate your health system in your state in a different way.

330
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,110
That may be really helps a lot of people without as much fuss.

331
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:52,780
Yes. So the public health emergency fund for Zika had $57,000 in it, which is not enough money, I can tell you that.

332
00:36:55,570 --> 00:37:05,080
Yeah. So if only we if we planned more regularly and prepared, that might solve some of the issue.

333
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:12,370
The other thing here is that the stuff that's not very good on equity, unsurprisingly,

334
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:20,709
it says explicitly that FEMA has to distribute the resources that it distributes

335
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:25,570
in response to a natural disaster or other emergency in an equitable way.

336
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:30,430
Nobody has defined what that is. There's not a lot of jurisprudence on it.

337
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:37,990
And also it's kind of only talking about the distribution of, I don't know,

338
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:45,700
food packs or the the beds and things that they sent up in stadiums or medicines

339
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,850
or anything else that might be administered in an emergency situation.

340
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:58,270
It's not talking about any of the underlying stuff. It's it's not the same as saying FEMA must act in an equitable way.

341
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:02,500
FEMA must only distribute in an equitable way.

342
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,350
So that was one thing that drove me up the wall.

343
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:16,780
I have to say, in in doing some of this work to organize picture takers, the executive underneath that legal framework,

344
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:29,320
you have a lot of different agencies that are working together, DHS, the Department of Defense, CDC, FEMA, the State Department, etc., etc.

345
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,800
And then you've got governments at other levels also trying to coordinate.

346
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:40,270
And these agencies have different incentives, different accountability, different processes,

347
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:45,790
which means this is more cumbersome than you would like for an emergency response.

348
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:51,530
And that part of the problem is that the expertise held by that agency,

349
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:57,260
the resources the agency had and its legal powers to act don't often match because we've

350
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:01,490
created these agencies over time and they've been modified by successive governments.

351
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:09,650
And that's a huge issue. If you don't have if you have more money, but you don't have the authority to spend it in a way that would actually help.

352
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:14,330
That's a huge problem if you have the authority, but you don't have the money.

353
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:20,870
That's also a huge problem. Every government bureaucrat dreads having a mismatch between their authority and their funding.

354
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:27,890
And that's before we even get to questions of who has the scientists or scientific expertise to

355
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:33,230
correctly respond in some of these situations where environmental science is incredibly important.

356
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:39,330
So this is just to remind you that this is a political.

357
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,540
This is a political matter at the executive agency.

358
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:54,880
So Mr. Cain was an Obama era official that was put in charge of emergency response under the Obama presidency.

359
00:39:55,510 --> 00:40:00,160
And at that time, there was an outbreak of Ebola in the United States.

360
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,540
Okay. I'm speaking to a of public health people. What do we know about Ebola? What kind of disease?

361
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,270
How much does it spread? How does it spread? Please.

362
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:19,489
Yeah. Oh, sorry. Little bit too ambitious that it doesn't spread super easily.

363
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:23,240
It spreads through, like, bodily fluids, but it's incredibly fatal.

364
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:28,100
If you do get the disease. Yeah. So if you get it, it's very bad news.

365
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,480
If you. However, in order to get it, you have to be in the contact of the bodily fluids of an infected person.

366
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,410
There's quite a high bar for that. So like you said, it doesn't spread very easily.

367
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:47,599
So the Republicans really got into the idea that Ebola was a bad, bad thing,

368
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:54,350
a very significant threat, and they were using this as an issue to blame the Obama administration.

369
00:40:54,890 --> 00:41:00,770
Does anybody know how many people got Ebola during this outbreak?

370
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,519
Or want to guess. You can even put your fingers up.

371
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,759
How many people to close? Four.

372
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,260
Yes, four is right. So, like, this is a handful of people.

373
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:19,270
Obviously, it's very serious for those people. And it's a it's a serious public health threat that shouldn't be ignored.

374
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:25,960
I don't want to make light of it. But there was political activity to try and frame this as a much more serious issue.

375
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:34,540
And in particular, the political advantage that the Republicans saw was that they could blame the Obama administration stoked people's fears that

376
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:41,350
there was this horrible communicable disease that you were going to catch if you walked out your door and we all died of Ebola.

377
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:45,910
And it would be a terrible disaster and it will be the Obama administration's fault.

378
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,570
That was the argument that was put forward by people like Ted Cruz.

379
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:57,969
So he was saying here, Mr. Kane, so this Obama official, he's not a doctor, he's not a health care professional.

380
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:03,640
He doesn't have a background in these issues. This administration is incompetent with the implication of that.

381
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:14,719
Right. So I just think it's kind of. Interesting for us to see that the political pendulum has swung the other way on coronavirus,

382
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,000
which is a disease that spreads much more readily, that infected and killed a lot more people.

383
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,920
And is it a serious public health threat that we should take seriously?

384
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,100
So on that position,

385
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:38,480
you can see a lot in a lot of the political science polling in the beginning when Donald Trump as president says this isn't a big deal.

386
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,500
We've got to play this down. It's not a big problem. It's going to be fine.

387
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,639
My government can solve this. Republicans have a very different strategy.

388
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:56,780
They're supporting the president. They're trying to say that this disease is nonsense or fabricated, even in some cases,

389
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:01,770
and trying to downplay that impact because they see the political advantage in doing that.

390
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,870
So I don't know whether the Democrats would act in the same same way in a different if the positions were reversed,

391
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:11,540
they probably would to some extent.

392
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:20,840
But just to show you that the framing of this disease or in terms of disaster response is very politically motivated in this case.

393
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:30,310
Anybody have questions about that? One day you guys have questions and I'll be shocked.

394
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:39,080
Now. I enjoyed it. You know, you guys do pay attention. So the executive really matters to response.

395
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,080
And let's look at this in the example of the Hurricane Maria.

396
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:52,820
So this is work that Scott was on this paper, some of my colleagues, Melissa Curry and then Charlie Wilson, who was my former Ph.D. student.

397
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:58,520
She's now a student at Cornell. They she did some testimony around this as well.

398
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,300
They did some papers looking at the responses to different hurricanes.

399
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:08,780
So they're looking at Irma. They're looking at Maria.

400
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:18,110
And they're looking at Harvey. So. The What do we notice here immediately by looking at this chart?

401
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:25,050
The yellow blocks are money in survivors pockets after Hurricane Harvey.

402
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:35,100
Please. Where is my cube? Is it me or is it incredibly hot in here?

403
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,620
I'm so sorry if you're all wilting because I am, like, boiling.

404
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:42,770
So, Harvey, it mostly affected Texas.

405
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:49,160
And obviously it seems like there was a ton more money in survivors pockets in Texas than in Puerto Rico.

406
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:55,760
Yeah, that's that's exactly what what the point that they're making here is there's a difference here.

407
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:02,150
So you see days pass post landfill, you see more money early on.

408
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,610
In survivors pockets.

409
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:16,620
So even here at the 30 day mark and then by the time you get to 150, 180, where I would have expected most of the money to have been dispersed.

410
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,240
There's, again, big, largely unequal distribution.

411
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:26,850
The other thing. It's not just about money, obviously.

412
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:32,210
So here we see federal personnel on site.

413
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:37,480
And this actually disturbs me probably more than the other chart.

414
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:43,640
So we've got again, Harvey is in orange. Irma is gray and Maria in this chart is yellow.

415
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,660
So initially, you see.

416
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:53,570
A lot of personnel on the ground, 1 to 9 days after.

417
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:03,290
And then people show up for Harvey a bit later and fewer people show up to deal with Maria.

418
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:13,510
And they show up later. And yeah, that's a big problem, because there's not necessarily a, I don't know, response.

419
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:17,200
Reason for this is not necessarily a scientific reason for these differences.

420
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:25,180
It's to do with the timing and the prioritization by the agency for this these responses.

421
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:35,360
And so unfortunately.

422
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:43,050
Disasters can bring communities together and they can show some of the best qualities in people and communities.

423
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:51,750
But I wanted to talk a bit about the media here, because this fits in with the Ted Cruz comment.

424
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:58,020
This is from another paper that Scott wrote with my other student, Phil Singer,

425
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:03,150
which is he's a pretty awesome professor who does this work at Utah University.

426
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:10,980
So you see over time, this is between August and October, and you've got the lightest grades.

427
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:20,580
Democrats very or somewhat worried about Ebola, the slightly darker gray Republicans very or somewhat worried about Ebola.

428
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:26,880
And then Democrats, not very or not at all worried. And Republicans not very or not at all worried.

429
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:32,410
So here. The the polling is pretty obvious.

430
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:37,990
So this is looking at Fox News in data from Fox News.

431
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,910
But you can see over time that the Republicans become more worried about Ebola.

432
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:44,709
And in the paper,

433
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:52,600
they're talking about how that correlates with the statements and the rhetoric that's being put forth by the Republican Party at the time,

434
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:59,440
deliberately trying to make people more worried about Ebola because they see a political advantage in it.

435
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:04,660
And at the same time, you see Democrats become less and less worried about Ebola.

436
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:09,420
So. It's kind of an interesting statistic.

437
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:16,440
And even in the October there, there's still a very big percentage point gap between the Democrats and Republicans on this.

438
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,880
If we look at a different example, there's clearly.

439
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:25,829
The Democrats are much more worried.

440
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:32,100
And still now Democratic voters in polling much more worried about COVID than the Republicans,

441
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:38,489
and that it's shifted somewhat at different points of the pandemic, especially in the beginning.

442
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:46,170
It was that Partizanship was not as strong. After a few months, though, with media outlets framing this in different ways,

443
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,549
the political scientists really do think that this there's been a media effect that

444
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:55,980
polarized people's opinions in that way and polarized it along the lines of party identity.

445
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:02,130
So party identities, not everything is a lot of other factors in there, like where you live.

446
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:08,400
Urban, rural is a very big divide, but again, that's correlated with party identity as well as some other things.

447
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:23,260
So. In the media, there are some incentives to to make this seem a little worse than it is or maybe stoke people's people's views.

448
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:31,720
This is a particularly bad one. So in the top one here, we have almost exactly the same text.

449
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:44,940
It's produced on the same day. And unfortunately, in the top one, they've emphasized that the young man is looting a grocery store.

450
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:54,330
And then the bottom that you've got two residents who are finding bread and water, bread and soda from a local grocery store.

451
00:49:54,900 --> 00:50:00,660
How ingenious of them. So, unfortunately, this is this is really bad.

452
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:11,670
So you can see a lot of this kind of bias based predominantly on skin color in the the media reporting around Hurricane Katrina.

453
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,040
And it's these small things do add up and are cumulative.

454
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:21,000
And so people's different media consumptions do make a difference.

455
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:27,330
So if you consume Fox News consistently, you'll get different messages about who the people are,

456
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:35,639
who are who are doing certain things in a disaster situation or all the victims of a disaster

457
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:41,370
situation than you would if you were consuming media from the center or from the left.

458
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:52,060
So. The framing of the problem is is very important in the in the media.

459
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,730
I want to talk a bit more in the time that we have remaining about.

460
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:04,520
What might work. And I'm going to have some thoughts about what works.

461
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,000
I'm going to back up. So I want to ask you guys first.

462
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:13,860
Maybe take a minute person next to you or a couple of people next to you.

463
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:18,510
What are some things we should be doing to try and address this situation?

464
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:22,330
Because, as I said, the disasters are not going to stop coming.

465
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:29,700
There are some more issues to do with climate change in the frequency of these kinds of events is likely to increase.

466
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:37,320
So with that knowledge in mind, what are some actions that we might take to improve our ability to respond to

467
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:44,580
disasters and lower the the damage that this might do to individuals and communities?

468
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:52,050
Just take a minute. Talk to your neighbor. A low key assignment and I'll check in with you in just a moment.

469
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:25,050
This time, however, it's going to slow down.

470
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:42,830
Oh, yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure.

471
00:52:49,310 --> 00:53:14,200
So it's going to look like everyone else is.

472
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:46,650
Halfway through life was an excellent experience for me.

473
00:53:47,700 --> 00:54:23,050
And and I say, this is who I am.

474
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,610
I mean, that's that's clear me.

475
00:54:39,370 --> 00:55:47,150
He's someone that you think, oh, god, I was in high school.

476
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:01,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

477
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:11,809
And no one really cared.

478
00:56:11,810 --> 00:57:07,720
For instance, I mean, it's not like I want to talk about the things I feel like my face.

479
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:22,490
I mean, I am scared.

480
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:59,480
And I think, you know, this is something that's very nice, isn't it?

481
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:36,700
I think it's important for you to do is to see that.

482
00:58:44,830 --> 00:59:05,700
So this is something that we all picture.

483
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:11,610
This is what makes this show.

484
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:23,590
Okay, so let's hear it. I was able to talk to a couple of groups over this site.

485
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:35,800
What do we think about this question of how can we do something about this and improve disaster response in these these cases of natural disasters?

486
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:41,900
I've heard a few things and I can chime in, but I want to hear from you guys. Over the.

487
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:48,600
I'm just going to distribute this to the time. I'm going to go on here.

488
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:52,170
Yep. Yep. Thank you.

489
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:59,430
So we were talking about, like you mentioned, how communication between federal agencies was a big slowdown.

490
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:07,890
So we were talking about just combining a bunch of them to try to lessen the communication issue.

491
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:12,240
I mean, that was the idea behind the Department of Homeland Security.

492
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:20,310
That went great. No, no. I think there's definitely got to be good relationships between the different departments.

493
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:25,110
One of the issues has been recently a lot of the departments are kind of hollow.

494
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:28,020
Right. It's difficult to get good people in position.

495
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:35,700
And so a new president coming in and people rotating out and retiring, that those people are not being replaced.

496
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:46,410
So there's got to be some good, careful thinking done at the federal level around what are the incentives for people to do government work,

497
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:53,340
which include better pay, but also better conditions. And it's not a terrifically glamorous job.

498
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:59,190
So how do you fill in those departments and then exactly that, how do you connect them up?

499
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:04,530
Like we could squish them all together in the Department of Homeland Security.

500
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:07,829
That really caused a lot of problems. I think they're better now.

501
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:20,909
But please, we talked about having consistent funding that cannot be touched or taken away for other other needs,

502
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:24,510
like it just needs to be there for when disaster does happen.

503
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:29,670
CIA making sure that it can't be decreased or put towards something else.

504
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:35,880
Yeah. A friend of mine works for a well-known federal law enforcement agency,

505
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:43,020
and I was surprised to learn that they had folks like going out to different offices

506
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:47,159
to check the stockpile in the beginning of the pandemic and trying to figure out,

507
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,190
well, what do we have in our own stockpile and can we redistribute it?

508
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,210
It turned out they didn't have enough in their own stockpile to give it to anybody else.

509
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:03,480
So, like maintaining. Knowing what you need is one thing, and that's always, not always correct, but then trying to maintain what you need.

510
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:07,110
That consistent funding is such a big piece of it. You must have been hearing this.

511
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:13,380
You must have been hearing this in a lot of different classes where we're talking about public health functions and support.

512
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,910
Right. We provide funding when we think there's a crisis.

513
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:25,080
And as we know, like when we think there's a crisis as a society is not always when people who are affected think there's a crisis, for one thing.

514
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:33,509
And then even after we solve that problem, we take away the funding for public health funds to functions,

515
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:38,070
especially in times where we think there's not a crisis, which is also an issue.

516
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:42,600
So but you're on the on the money there, literally and figuratively.

517
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:46,020
So who else wants to contribute? Yeah.

518
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:50,510
Thank you.

519
01:02:52,550 --> 01:03:02,570
We are talking a little bit about maybe like making laws, incentivizing building and wall in terms of like working in building infrastructure.

520
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:09,740
That's not going to be so damaging and costly to whatever state it is or the U.S. in general.

521
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:16,560
So incentivizing people to not build their houses on the coastline where the DEP,

522
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:21,850
like if this is going to keep happening, that the damage is just going to be so extreme and cut.

523
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:27,680
In general, just making better infrastructure that is more prepared for disasters.

524
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:32,420
Yep. And I wonder what's going to happen with the infrastructure funding.

525
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:38,900
Thank you. Yeah, the infrastructure funding at the federal level that was authorized this year.

526
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,980
There's a lot of talk about investing in communities and climate change.

527
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:48,380
And we're going to talk about Justice 40 in a class next.

528
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:57,340
I think it's next week. And a lot of that is about can you invest now in a community to try and build better infrastructure?

529
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:07,210
The incentives part, like I feel like I was talking with this group over here and that's a permitting issue in part, right?

530
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:13,330
There must be more that could be done at the local level to incentivize certain kinds of building and not others.

531
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:17,530
And I think the difficulty with that is that the people who have the power and the money and the people

532
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:22,860
who want to make more money by building more properties and so very nice properties right on the coast.

533
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:35,170
Right. But what can you as a government do to ensure people's safety, peoples, the community's overall health by curtailing some of that activity?

534
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:37,629
That's a very important question.

535
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:44,290
If the government doesn't have the will to do that, you're going to be left with a much weaker, less resilient place than if they do.

536
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:48,340
So that's going to vary a lot by by location. All right.

537
01:04:48,340 --> 01:05:00,350
What else? Just looking for one more.

538
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:13,889
Here's my list. So on my list, I've got I've put local networks of trust.

539
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:20,940
And we were talking about how it's very easy to put local networks of trust on the slide, but very difficult to rebuild that trust.

540
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:24,030
And one of the question marks here that we don't know much about yet,

541
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:34,830
although the early political science data is predictably worrying on public opinion polling, is how has the pandemic affected trust in that way?

542
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:43,950
So if you think about it, the pandemic involved telling people what they could not do and telling people what they had to do,

543
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:48,180
which a lot of people here and in other places around the world.

544
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:50,790
But a lot of people here don't like to hear.

545
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:59,190
And so I think people's relationship, maybe in their trust in organizations, might have changed or become different.

546
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:04,020
And also to for all the different reasons that people could be vaccine hesitant.

547
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:11,220
If you're a vaccine hesitant or you have been in some way I could imagine you transferring that over to being hesitant when someone tells you,

548
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:17,190
oh, you need to do this for in order to be safe during this this disaster.

549
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:23,970
And so that would be interesting to see. I suspect it's probably going to become more partizan.

550
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:28,020
People's trust in government, even though it already kind of is.

551
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:34,200
You trust the government when the people you agree with are in power and you hate the government when the people

552
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:41,280
you don't agree with are in power is is a general and unfortunately solidifying rule in public opinion polling.

553
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:48,360
So planning plans failed, but the planning does help, as I said, to bring people together and convene them.

554
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:51,930
And so more of that is needed.

555
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:59,430
And especially coordinated planning between public health and emergency managers is desperately needed.

556
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:03,879
And there needs to be effective executive action.

557
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:09,420
So the people at the top, whether we're talking governors or whether we're talking the president,

558
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:13,030
it does unfortunately matter a lot in these circumstances,

559
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:19,510
whether or not they lead competently, whether or not they say crazy things that aren't supported by science,

560
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:26,889
whether or not they who they listen to in terms of scientific expertise and

561
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:33,219
when and how quickly they decide to take action in matters of response and how

562
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:38,050
much they decide to prioritize things like the expensive infrastructure spending

563
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:43,960
that you you might we might desperately need in many of these communities.

564
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:49,000
So finally, we need to fix FEMA. They got to be competent.

565
01:07:51,250 --> 01:08:01,180
Much of the US is just either too exposed or too poor to handle these recoveries without big time assistance from the federal government.

566
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:09,969
And so the federal government, also a lot of U.S. policy actually doesn't help with mitigation.

567
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:16,870
It's not the nice infrastructure spending we want to see. It's actually consolidating the existing patterns of inequality.

568
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:22,959
So how do we fix that? Bear in mind, all these things I've just said when we talk about Justice 40,

569
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:29,320
because that is the solution that is being offered by this administration to a number of these problems.

570
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:36,190
I want us to be able to cast the same critical eye over that and think about it carefully when we talk about it next week.

571
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:40,300
All right. Thanks for listening and for putting up in this hot room.

572
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:41,860
I will see you soon.
