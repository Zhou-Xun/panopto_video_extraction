[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:09,882
At this point in the discussion,
I wanna delve deeper into one of our

3
00:00:09,882 --> 00:00:13,874
socioecological levels of influence and
that is the family environment.

4
00:00:13,874 --> 00:00:16,864
So especially for
young children, parenting and

5
00:00:16,864 --> 00:00:21,492
what opportunities are available in
the home for healthy eating and physical

6
00:00:21,492 --> 00:00:26,498
activity make a great deal of difference
to an individual child's weight status.

7
00:00:26,498 --> 00:00:31,081
So there are many things we know parents
can do to prevent obesity in their young

8
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:31,784
children.

9
00:00:31,784 --> 00:00:35,029
We think about what opportunities
there are for eating in the home.

10
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:37,077
Are there healthy foods available?

11
00:00:37,077 --> 00:00:41,030
Foods that aren't calorically
dense like fruits and vegetables.

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,617
We also know it's important for

13
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:45,919
parents to limit the availability
of unhealthy foods in the home.

14
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:48,109
We advise parents to limit soda and

15
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:52,347
other sugar-sweetened beverages
available to their children.

16
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:53,405
Limit sweets.

17
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:57,837
And again, really promote foods that
are nutritious and healthy and not so

18
00:00:57,837 --> 00:01:00,875
calorically dense that
children are over eating.

19
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:05,271
Family meals are another component of
families that we know are incredibly

20
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:09,540
important to healthy nutrition and
to healthful weight gain over time.

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,821
We encourage families to have their
meals together as often as possible.

22
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:18,145
We don't know what it is about family
meals that seem to make such an important

23
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:22,004
difference to obesity, but
we're really consistently seeing that

24
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:26,548
families who eat together on a regular
basis have children of healthier weight.

25
00:01:26,548 --> 00:01:30,194
We can also think about things like what
are the physical activity routines of

26
00:01:30,194 --> 00:01:33,200
the family and is there a support for
physical activity?

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,170
We like to see families out being
active with their children,

28
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,200
engaging in activities together.

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,080
We know that's protective against
obesity among young children.

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,590
Another really interesting area that we're
learning about in terms of prevention of

31
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,290
obesity among children and

32
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:52,130
how families can help prevent obesity
in their children is the area of sleep.

33
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,152
So we know when children are able to
obtain an appropriate amount of sleep.

34
00:01:56,152 --> 00:01:57,463
They eat less.

35
00:01:57,463 --> 00:02:01,846
They choose healthier food and they're
more active which we all know is important

36
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:04,654
to their weight status,
and their risk of obesity.

37
00:02:04,654 --> 00:02:08,080
So thinking about all these
things that parents can do.

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,600
We have to think what are public
health interventions that can help

39
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,360
family do that?

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,448
Family are under an enormous
amount of stress these days.

41
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:22,016
Many families have two parents who
are working or lead by a single parents.

42
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:26,482
There is competing responsibilities
from school, from work and

43
00:02:26,482 --> 00:02:30,863
a lot of other stress and
it's difficult for parents to do what we

44
00:02:30,863 --> 00:02:35,427
believe they should do to help
prevent obesity in their children.

45
00:02:35,427 --> 00:02:38,137
So we need to think about
how we can help them.

46
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:41,463
There's starting to be some really
innovative obesity prevention

47
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:43,456
interventions working with families.

48
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:46,799
The key to successful obesity
prevention interventions with

49
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,140
families seem to be meeting
parents where they're at.

50
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,110
That might be physically going out to
the home, evaluating the home environment.

51
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,225
Working with parents to try to improve
children's sleep environments or

52
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:02,554
try to get healthier food onto
the counter into the fridge.

53
00:03:02,554 --> 00:03:06,079
Another part of meeting parents where
they're at is really listening to

54
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:07,242
parent's struggles.

55
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:11,782
Listening to what their barriers are to
getting healthy meals on the table seven

56
00:03:11,782 --> 00:03:15,984
nights a week and working with parents
to make incremental changes to help

57
00:03:15,984 --> 00:03:18,236
improve those healthy environments.

58
00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:22,267
We're seeing a lot of success from these
public health interventions that are going

59
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:25,058
into homes,
that are meeting parents where they're at.

60
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:28,451
That are listening to what
parents are experiencing and

61
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:32,783
trying to move them to provide
healthier sleep routines for families,

62
00:03:32,783 --> 00:03:36,482
healthier meal routines and
healthier activity routines.

63
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,788
A recent study that was conducted
with preschool aged children that

64
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:40,548
did just that.

65
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:45,260
That went into the homes and worked
with the parents over a few months found

66
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,896
that children who's families received
these home visits had healthier

67
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,399
BMI trajectories over a year
after the intervention.

68
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,183
So working with parents and

69
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:59,840
helping them establish healthy
routines around eating, activity and

70
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,121
sleep seems to be a really promising
obesity prevention intervention strategy.
