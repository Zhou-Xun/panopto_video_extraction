1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:10,920
Well, it's interesting. When I brought the 30, $30 and I could hear pretty early, like, you know, like it's really going to be trying to say that.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,960
I wasn't sure it's true. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,030
We're going to get started. Welcome back.

4
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:31,230
Happy Friday. So I hope, everyone you got through school and I've actually already just sifted through.

5
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:40,790
The abstracts are looking really great. And today what we're going to solely really focus on is abstract things.

6
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:49,780
So that's what we're going to do today before the. Okay.

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,830
Okay. Well, there was a slide I have that last week.

8
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,180
You had a a prompt, right.

9
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,780
Prompted you to think of a goal for yourself for the semester.

10
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:10,370
And they're all written here on these index cards here, actually telling them all up and had the different categories that popped out.

11
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,549
And I thought I maybe I set myself the wrong sort the slides,

12
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,650
but the categories that that popped out, let's see if I can think of it off the top of my list.

13
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:29,259
Actually, they're here. So a lot of them actually had to do I think the most one was just presenting yourself your professional expertize.

14
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,860
So I think that was the most popular category and it came up in a lot of different venues.

15
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:43,280
We talked about the E portfolios. Some of you talked about that LinkedIn was brought up and then even like the cover letter as well.

16
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,700
Another popular thing that you guys wanted to felt like working on was networking.

17
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,250
That was actually quite popular as well.

18
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,870
Professional communication, mostly in the form of communication, was also another one.

19
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:05,209
And I'm trying to think of some of the more popular ones. Interprofessional collaboration.

20
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:17,510
So thinking about working with other professionals and getting practical experience, and I thought there was one more I wanted to bring up.

21
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:28,820
Negotiation, like working on negotiation as well. So so those were some of the things I just wanted to bring that up because you know something that

22
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,710
you might want to maybe talk to peers like how are you going to network this semester or this year?

23
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,810
How are you going to work on like presenting your professional expertize?

24
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:50,240
Can we practice together, things like that. So I just wanted to bring that up, but it's not here on this slide deck so I can post those to.

25
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,710
This is what? This lame duck.

26
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:13,740
Sorry. In trouble here. I don't know what this is, but it is not my slide deck for today.

27
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,810
See if I can.

28
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,570
Sorry, guys. Hang tight. Just give me a couple of minutes to see if I can send myself the appropriate slides up.

29
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:53,540
You ready to leave?

30
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:16,500
I just. He's yet to file for command.

31
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:39,730
Posted an incomplete slide deck to canvas. I'm really sorry about the news I was talking about.

32
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:54,540
Yeah, I'm your brother, so we get a lot money, so can I start with you?

33
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,129
Okay. All right, everyone. Sorry about that. Thank you for your patience.

34
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,030
Okay, here's. Here's these categories that came up.

35
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,610
I think we talked about all of them, maybe professional writing.

36
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,580
That was one that also came up as well. All right.

37
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,159
So what we're going to do today is first,

38
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,280
I'll just ask you really generally if there's any questions about the abstract, the poster mainly about the abstract.

39
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,510
But if you want to start thinking a little bit ahead to the poster, the poster session, that's fine.

40
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,250
And then we're going to do just a little bit of a discussion on peer evaluation.

41
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:37,860
I think this is really important. I know you've probably done it in other classes, but maybe not actually talked about the purpose of peer evaluation.

42
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:44,550
And it's something as a professional, you will do forever, right, if you are a professional in public health.

43
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:52,080
And then we will spend the last half hour just peer evaluating.

44
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:00,620
Okay. All right. This is just what I want to do first.

45
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,190
Do you guys have any general questions? Yes.

46
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:13,700
Well, my question is about developing the abstracts, because I know we have like the consequences and I know that's a big part of the poster.

47
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:20,450
We also we figure out that with the abstract dealer around like essentially saying

48
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,720
how like and the like skills available to that be related to the composition.

49
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:34,700
Exactly. Yeah. So really in like the competencies and work products on the rubric component,

50
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,620
the suggested headers I gave to you I think were for products and skills.

51
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,760
Development skills and competency is sort of like the same thing.

52
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,969
So that's where you would want to try to work that I guess to like add to that.

53
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:55,730
So in the examples you gave us, like they were very brief on that kind of information,

54
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,870
but in the rubric it makes it seem like you want to list like what competency we use and explain it.

55
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,530
So I wasn't really sure which way, like how much detail you got there.

56
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,760
I went more general just because that's what the examples had. Yeah, yeah.

57
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,760
You can go either way and you don't have to use those competencies.

58
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:24,139
You can you can talk about them in your own words if you want, but you can do it either way for the yeah.

59
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,410
For the work products and skills or competencies.

60
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:36,530
I think that one can be pretty straightforward and pretty brief in terms of this is the product I developed, it represents this competency.

61
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,509
Okay. So for the poster, are we making this online?

62
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,460
Like I didn't go to the poster session last year, so I'm not exactly sure how the poster is looking like.

63
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:56,060
I know we got or at least I did got the quote back for it.

64
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:05,370
So how is like how are we going to be making the poster or printing stuff out and literally pasting it on this giant poster where, okay,

65
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:14,210
you can go to the poster, draft and poster final poster assignments and there's directions in there you'll be making it through PowerPoint.

66
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:24,740
And then once the poster is final, you send the the file, the PowerPoint file to that place and they print it out on a big.

67
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:34,600
It's also about the posters. I know some students and I were talking, are we expected to pay the invoice or not?

68
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:42,450
Okay, so you will provide a shortcode and the shortcode you know as well, take money out of it.

69
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,550
So, yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I should always be back there.

70
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,549
You know, they're just general questions. The questions are silly.

71
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:01,030
I mean, there's some people I've never done that to a poster session before, so I'm really happy to be here.

72
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:10,129
Yep. That's I have some of the examples in the past that were kind of disgusting skills that they learned by doing.

73
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,140
But could you talk a little bit about like, is that okay?

74
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,470
Should we try like kind of like the separation between the tasks and the skills of others?

75
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:28,150
Yeah. And like, yeah, yeah. The tasks that the tasks face is like the opportunity to just talk about what you did right.

76
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,959
Like you didn't just do a competency, right?

77
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:39,080
You, you were involved in daily tasks. Like what? What did your daily job look like on a week to week basis?

78
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:47,750
What did it look like? So that's like the opportunity for students to read about, okay, what am I going to be doing when I if I do this internship?

79
00:09:48,710 --> 00:10:01,620
That makes sense. So I'm looking at the poster requirements it says include appropriate visual representations of your final apex products.

80
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,810
So if one of my is like a manual, like I'd say I can't have the whole menu on the poster.

81
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:15,629
No. So just like the cover page, the cover page, or maybe a page that you feel as if you are allowed to use it about what that kind of represents.

82
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,780
Some of the work, really. Like the whole thing there.

83
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,880
No, you don't need to if you want to bring in like it doesn't be on the poster,

84
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,240
but if you want to bring it in and show people, physically show people.

85
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,900
I don't think students do things like that before. Awesome. Thank you.

86
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:41,050
What if some of our products are like videos? How would be present if you can bring it up on the on your phone?

87
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:47,820
You could do that. You can just put like a screenshot of the video on the poster.

88
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,709
Yep. This is a very specific question, but one of my products,

89
00:10:52,710 --> 00:11:05,040
I did a PowerPoint could I think like can I paste like would I be able to print out all of the slides and then paste them on there?

90
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,040
So let's go through it. I've had people do that. Okay. So, yeah, if you if you think it'll work out fine.

91
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,880
Yeah, that's that's fine, too. Great question.

92
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:26,520
This. Just let me know if anything else comes up.

93
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,810
We just want to make sure that you all feel comfortable going into this.

94
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:41,840
All right. Okay. So today we are going to evaluate and I think period evaluation is this great

95
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,520
exercise that you can really practice certain aspects of professionalism.

96
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:52,280
Excellent. Throw this question out to you guys. What skills do we practice when we hear evaluations?

97
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:59,959
Yeah, we want to give constructive feedback. Yeah, constructive feedback.

98
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:15,230
Developing constructive feedback, empowerment of our peer and absolutely empowerment of the peer building that your attention to detail.

99
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:23,180
Attention to detail. Absolutely. Well.

100
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,570
I'm applying the suggestions, like actually being able to do that.

101
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,350
Absolutely. Applying suggestions. So thinking of peer feedback and peer feedback is a two way street.

102
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:45,860
Like offering perspective. Like we don't really necessarily know what we're what the other person is speaking about.

103
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,670
So like we can really fill in like obvious gaps, potentially.

104
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,610
Absolutely. Figuring out what the gaps are,

105
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:03,410
bringing in someone else's perspective on making sure that other people understand what what your you're and what this person's trying to convey,

106
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:10,810
that you're the person receiving it. You can practice your listening skills, absolutely active listening.

107
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:17,720
So again, the two way street, the person receiving the feedback has lots of things to practice as well.

108
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:26,180
It goes both ways. I learned a lot from peer review other people, but I learn a lot.

109
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,880
Yes, absolutely. Just reading someone else's work.

110
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:40,820
You can learn how to do things you might want to incorporate someday or modes of writing or whatever of the peer to peer feedback is whatever product,

111
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:52,260
your feedback, peer review. Anything else when you're getting verbal feedback, making sure that you're using razor blades for deploying?

112
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,900
Absolutely verbal feedback when you're actually articulating the feedback, which we are going to do today.

113
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:06,300
Just thinking how the tone. Right. How are you presenting that feedback as is proofreading?

114
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,700
Yep. Proofreading. Just your editing skills in general.

115
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,440
Oh, good. Excellent. So I just have a list here.

116
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,639
So, I mean, obviously communication is right.

117
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,210
There's a lot of types of communication going on here.

118
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:38,020
Reviewing, summarizing, being able to summarize our information, being able to self-reflect in terms of like diagnosing information.

119
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,530
Right. We talked a little bit about that,

120
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:47,420
like identifying gaps in knowledge or misconceived knowledge and fixing about the collaboration skills, active listening.

121
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:49,730
Yeah.

122
00:14:49,740 --> 00:15:00,740
And I think, you know, all these activities just really deepen and help reinforce learning in general for both the giver of feedback and the receiver.

123
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:12,799
Okay. And so this is it's almost like the question before thinking a little bit differently, though, but why is peer evaluation important?

124
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:21,320
And you can think very broadly and generally or think about specifically like today what we're going to be doing peer feedback on the abstract.

125
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,100
Improvement. Yeah, absolutely.

126
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,770
All these abstracts are going to be good. There's going to be good elements of them, but there is always going to be room for improvement.

127
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:42,510
That's. I feel like you have to promote.

128
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,310
Do you? Sorry. Say that again. That's like an informal collaboration.

129
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,020
Absolutely. Promoting collaboration. I'm playing off that a little bit.

130
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,760
I'm just thinking about networking and I'm going to pair you with just a random student.

131
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,210
I did it totally randomly. Maybe it's someone up here you've never talked to before.

132
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:09,240
You need to make a connection so you can gain an outsider perspective and maybe you're misinterpreting something on the rubric.

133
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,240
The peer can help you with that. Absolutely.

134
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:20,340
I think when I first developed this question, that was the first thought that came to my mind was getting someone else's perspective.

135
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,240
Right. Because you guys are all engaged in this internship.

136
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,730
You are the experts on what you did.

137
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:34,500
But you need to make sure when you're conveying that, that whatever the audience you're targeting can understand it.

138
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:43,560
And that audience is going to be someone who really doesn't have any video searching over those instincts.

139
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,890
So excel here. Absolutely. Yeah.

140
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:51,340
So even if you read something a thousand times, you're just apt to miss something.

141
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:59,280
So just making sure you can be lean on whatever productivity again from someone outside of your own brain.

142
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:07,590
Okay, I think that was great. And you can see it. We kind of repeated some things we talked about in terms of skills, but overall,

143
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:12,030
really just getting out of your own head and getting someone else's perspective.

144
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:21,600
Okay. So when we do provide feedback, these are some characteristics that are really important to think about.

145
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:30,710
And first is feasibility. So just thinking about the situation that you are given in terms of peer evaluation.

146
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,850
So thinking about this abstract in terms of the feedback you give,

147
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:43,440
make sure it's feasible for student your peers to address within the week because in a week the final abstract is due.

148
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,230
So that's an example specificity.

149
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:58,440
Make sure the feedback is specific so your peer can understand what they need to do to make changes or to improve and then be positive.

150
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:04,740
So this is something that's really important because again, all of these abstracts are going to have strengths.

151
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,130
So point that out like empowerment of your students.

152
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,900
Right. Pointed it out so students can know what their strengths are.

153
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:23,190
Negative feedback can influence the perceptions of an individual regarding their own abilities.

154
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:31,080
Right. So especially if that feedback is sort of so low, but they think that they're capable of.

155
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:38,730
So, although on negative feedback it does elicit self reflection, it really does.

156
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:47,550
Sometimes that negativity can ultimately put up a fence and a tear up here from actually making changes.

157
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,839
So there are a lot of models of giving positive feedback.

158
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,530
Probably one of the most common. Many of you probably heard of this is the feedback sandwich where you start with something positive or what.

159
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:06,060
Well, and then trying to figure out the right tone and wording in terms of improvements.

160
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:13,350
Right. So something like this, I'm giving you these comments because like high expectations, I know you can reach them.

161
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:18,990
This would be even better if. Right. So just thinking along the lines of that.

162
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:28,970
And so we really just want to make sure the peer evaluation doesn't put up a defensiveness.

163
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,379
Right. And that's always of course,

164
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:39,480
I'm going to encourage you guys as the receivers of feedback to just be really aware of like how you're feeling when you receive feedback.

165
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:47,189
All right. And then relevance. I'm going to just for the nature of the assignment,

166
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:54,780
make sure the feedback you give is relevant to the guidelines within the rubric and the guidelines in general.

167
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:02,310
And then professionalism. Of course, we just talked a lot about the the skills that we intend to develop.

168
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:11,850
But also when you go out into the field, your boss might very well say, hey, can you evaluate a colleague?

169
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,960
And you have to do a peer evaluation and then you have to turn it into your boss.

170
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:23,250
So you want to make sure what you turn in is appropriate and the boss would approve of it.

171
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,930
Anything anyone else would add to these? These are the same things just in the rubric.

172
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,030
Yeah. Like the ingenue. Say that again.

173
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,069
So don't just say subconscious and then expect.

174
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,250
If you're not genuine about impossible, it doesn't work.

175
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:55,330
So be generous. Make sure it's truthful or it's coming from your.

176
00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:01,450
Not from your heart, but from your brain. Something else.

177
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:06,900
I mean, one would have. Oh.

178
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,590
Right. And so now we're thinking about being the person who's receiving the feedback.

179
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,319
And really, we've already talked about this, but active listening.

180
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,410
Right. That's a really important skill when you're receiving feedback.

181
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,840
Being aware this is a really good chance, a safe space just to think about.

182
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,220
And I'm prompting you to think about how you react emotionally and cognitively when you are receiving the

183
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:44,330
feedback and just really taking the time to think about it rather than putting up a wall of defense.

184
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,110
And just remember, we're just getting someone else's point of view.

185
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:54,740
It doesn't mean what you did is wrong or not good enough, but bringing in the other person's point of view,

186
00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:02,810
also just in terms of like constructive feedback, you could really go through the whole thing and just say, great job, great job, great job.

187
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:08,720
But again, there's always room for improvement. It might be great, but you keep bringing up different perspective.

188
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:14,840
There are always ways to give constructive feedback to improvement.

189
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:23,569
Okay. And I actually just want to give you guys like 30, 45 seconds to read through these.

190
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,330
These came from a teaching workshop that I went to.

191
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:34,060
And immediately I just thought, oh, well, this is this is nice regarding peer evaluation that relates to it.

192
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:39,710
So just take a few seconds to read through before we get into peer evaluation.

193
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:14,719
Okay. And especially the last one there when I just said, you know, you could say great job for everything,

194
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:21,410
even as the the peer evaluator, again, as yourself for working on critical feedback.

195
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,990
I think, you know, think of this, right, in terms of critical feedback.

196
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,930
Don't just say great job.

197
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:36,610
You can say great job, but then add in a different viewpoint or something along those lines that can help in terms of this atmosphere.

198
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:45,130
Okay. All right. So any questions or anything any one wants to add before we start?

199
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:56,830
All right. So what we're going to do and the next slide, I have pre assigned peers and I think everyone is here today.

200
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,610
But if you cannot find your peer, just let me know.

201
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:08,200
And we can always do a group of three. So what I'm going to do, what we're going to do is take a couple of minutes,

202
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,490
find your peer exchange, whether it's email or you brought in a paper copy.

203
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:21,460
And then on the peer evaluation assignment for the abstract, I do have the document there so you can do it on your computer.

204
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,339
I also brought enough paper copies for everyone.

205
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:36,430
So the front office has the app, the app, the rubric, and the second page has the the actual peer evaluation that you engage in.

206
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:42,670
So either way, if you want a paper copy or do it online, whatever your preference is.

207
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:50,890
And so then fill out the peer evaluation worksheet also in that 25 to 30 minutes, just reread your feedback.

208
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,640
Think about what you want to say out loud to your peer.

209
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:02,410
And then we'll take about 10 minutes to articulate that feedback to your peers.

210
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:10,029
And I'm going to I'm going to give you guys I'm going to check back in in about 20, 25 minutes.

211
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,940
I can also just sort of visually see when you guys are wrapping up,

212
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:24,500
but I prefer if you wait for the articulation part until we all do it together just for a chance to everyone be on the same sort of same tiny.

213
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:31,390
Yeah. And then yep. And then you have to upload your so the peer.

214
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:42,670
Oh yeah. So the peer evaluation that you fill out, you do have to upload it to the abstract peer even peer evaluation assignment.

215
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,970
So myself in the grade are just going to make sure that you were giving constructive feedback just to ensure and I think it's like 15 minutes,

216
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:57,130
so just make sure you upload that. If you do a paper copy, just take a picture or scan it on your phone or whatever.

217
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:09,460
Oh, did you have a question? I was just asking just confirming that we are uploading on our canvas that our peer review of the other person.

218
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:13,890
Yes. I now that when he sent it to me and. That's right.

219
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:26,760
Yeah, yes. Great clarification. So the other question is, do you have any.

220
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,940
Yeah. All right. So find your peer.

221
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:43,190
And there is one group of three because I think there's an even number. Oh.

222
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:57,700
I'm going to. Okay.

223
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:10,330
Let's just take. She said planned a.

224
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:22,350
I just think that magazines like.

225
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,390
You know, I think.

226
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:50,110
I need you to tell me what's going on here.

227
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:55,070
If you want to try them, you know?

228
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:02,070
Yeah, exactly.

229
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:09,560
I'm so sorry. I just.

230
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:18,230
I don't know. I guess it's all for you.

231
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:38,840
Oh, yeah. So that's one thing that we're interested in.

232
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,300
The body of work that you might develop is going to be like.

233
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:54,270
I don't really think it will be.

234
00:28:54,330 --> 00:29:23,440
For a while I was like, Oh, I can't remember because I don't know.

235
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:35,540
I think I don't think it's a good thing, I guess, like, whatever.

236
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:40,360
Right? Yeah. Yeah.

237
00:29:43,270 --> 00:30:22,660
Like, you know, it's like people are struggling with these things all the time.

238
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:29,930
There's like I've been in here for. It's like, oh, my gosh.

239
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:49,100
I mean, like, I'm sure. Do you like the second page?

240
00:30:53,450 --> 00:31:02,190
Yes, I just. You just make.

241
00:31:05,700 --> 00:33:44,840
Yeah. Oh.

242
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:53,230
All right.

243
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:48,380
Not just. If you want, you can use this website.

244
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:52,780
Okay. Can help.

245
00:47:02,110 --> 00:54:56,370
Okay? Yeah. Right, everyone, it's been about 25 minutes.

246
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:08,260
If you are ready to talk to your partner, go ahead and start articulating the information and I'll come back in about 10 minutes or so.

247
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:16,910
So what happens is that your story tells you that you are.

248
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:24,460
Absolutely. Three years ago, we were like, No.

249
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:29,970
I know. It's really good to see you.

250
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:49,710
So I highlighted something like this about the fact that I feel like it just sounds like it's not like it's not it's not supportive.

251
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:53,700
Yeah, it's all the way.

252
00:55:53,700 --> 00:56:14,280
I just like, straight out like like where I want to that it's my parents I didn't know was right about the way

253
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:31,520
you know and it's like I'm not like the person I wrote it down here to tell you didn't do it.

254
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:43,710
Yeah. That's comes down to how do I know you got another way to like.

255
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:58,060
You know, if she's set up this project.

256
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,530
I think it was just in the last year that I'm like, Yeah, no.

257
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:09,780
But like, that's ultimately has made me like, oh my God.

258
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:47,330
Like, I'm not like, you know, you're suggesting that no matter what anybody else is right about that, that I was like, I find something.

259
00:57:49,040 --> 00:58:08,080
Yeah. I mean, it's like, I think the reason to be like that somehow is that part of the reason I'm actually like,

260
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:22,570
I was like, okay, I like why my first item is why?

261
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,089
Well, why don't you think I told you about that?

262
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:43,910
So I was like, I mean, I want to make it my interpretation, you know, I really like that was like when I had my husband,

263
00:58:44,110 --> 00:59:06,940
I was like, yeah, you know, I think that we're all all these different far.

264
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:24,080
I would say that I feel like I'm gonna freak you out.

265
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:30,820
And I was like, Oh, I'm sorry.

266
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:58,970
I like, I, this was not the kind of person that I ever got.

267
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:18,400
So I was like, Oh, yeah, I can imagine how hard is yeah.

268
01:00:20,440 --> 01:01:05,510
And I want to go to like I'll be for them to cover something.

269
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:13,320
And I would just like he's like, yeah, okay.

270
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:17,710
Oh yeah.

271
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:43,570
Well, and then like I have an outing as I understand it, just so you know.

272
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:54,380
I don't like how they're not like I don't think it is.

273
01:01:55,170 --> 01:02:25,770
And I think I just, you know, I think people might feel like this supposed to be about, you know, I just wanted to look at it.

274
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:37,580
And I like I said, I wasn't thinking about the idea of it.

275
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:46,770
It was like, you know, I don't know.

276
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:52,240
I'm yeah, yeah.

277
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:56,520
I don't think so. Yeah.

278
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:15,670
Like, internships is the last thing think you can do?

279
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:27,430
Explaining that he was surprised to hear.

280
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:33,250
I have to ask you about that.

281
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:43,430
Kind of like my. Hi, how are you?

282
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:59,310
So you have Tonight Show down.

283
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:09,920
There are things happening now.

284
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:22,670
I was so impressed.

285
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:31,180
No, no, I was just saying it like it is unique and it's the same.

286
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:46,160
And so, you know, it's like, oh, I was there.

287
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:57,480
I do my thing, which is also the first time.

288
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:13,900
So I just I thought they had just taken my life.

289
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:31,770
I mean, she's like, I like I really, you know, you know, all of, you know, like,

290
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:46,350
I don't want to say that what we have here is like a lot like on both sides.

291
01:05:48,390 --> 01:06:06,490
I think it was time because I like I don't know.

292
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:35,340
I think I mean, I think you're right because I was like, yeah, I, I, you know, I don't know.

293
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:45,700
I guess it's like, you have to wait.

294
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:58,530
That's like a small thing.

295
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:14,219
I know. I think, wow, those are the type of things, my friends, you know, I don't really.

296
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:30,260
Right. So I'm like, Yeah, I don't know either.

297
01:07:32,650 --> 01:08:11,520
But I think it's just like I think it's hard to maintain.

298
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:25,030
You can really make it here and touch it for a second.

299
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:29,800
I was like, Oh, I see, some people are finishing up,

300
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:34,420
but I'll stick around for like ten more minutes for everyone to finish up and just upload your

301
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:42,400
you're a peer evaluation that you fill out to your assignment because I do have a few before you,

302
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:47,320
but I know everyone was here and everyone was engaged, but just make sure you do upload that.

303
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:54,300
So just some reminders of due date. So next week the final abstract is due out.

304
01:08:54,370 --> 01:09:02,769
Myself and then the grader are going to give you feedback by Monday morning, probably by Sunday evening, we'll be done with that.

305
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:10,599
So just, just understand, you're going to get instructor feedback and the draft, just as a reminder, is worth 50 points.

306
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:15,820
So we are being more critical with the draft. So you can have that final abstract.

307
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:28,059
I'm ready for publication into the abstract booklet for next week's work and then the poster draft is due the following week.

308
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:32,660
Next week, I think I have this on the next slide next week.

309
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:34,900
It's really just going to be a working day.

310
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:45,460
We're going to talk a little bit about poster development, but then the class action is really going to be dedicated for you to work on your poster.

311
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:50,380
Sometimes students do have a lot of questions. Thank you. The first time they're making a poster.

312
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:57,610
So I just want to make sure you have space and time to work on it, because I also know it's a short turnaround time.

313
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:02,200
So we'll dedicate that class session for just poster time.

314
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:13,090
And then other information is if you have not received an invitation for the Intro to Interprofessional Education Module,

315
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:19,000
please let me know a pending invitation should it be in your canvas.

316
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:25,750
And that module actually opens up on Monday. So if you have time and you want to do it, you can on Friday.

317
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:31,060
It's not it's open until October 2nd. So it's actually it's due by October 2nd.

318
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:40,540
Once it closes, we don't open it up again. So you just have to know that it's open for this period of time and again.

319
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:45,550
It should only take like an hour or so. And it's asynchronous.

320
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:54,010
Do you know, like where in campus that would be? If you can't find it, let me know.

321
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:58,299
It should just be on your class list somewhere or at the top.

322
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,450
It should say you have an invitation, pending invitation.

323
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:04,749
But if you don't see it, then I see the assignment.

324
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:07,870
I'll look for it. I think my sense that it's not yet available.

325
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:14,469
Yes, it's going to be. Oh, that may be the reason it's going to be published on Sunday night or.

326
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:18,790
Oh, really? Okay. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. Yeah, yeah.

327
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:25,420
That's not going to set you back. Any other questions?

328
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:31,450
Okay. Finish off the peer evaluation if you need to. If not, you're free to go.

329
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,240
So in front of us, we're going to have some.
