1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,380
Thing is you fit like several different test models in your in your regression on the same data set.

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,440
Exactly. And then you have ten of them and you say, okay, now let's take five.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,090
Yeah, I elaborate on that a bit more.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,249
Just, just give me a second.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:46,640
I want to make sure I see these. To say.

6
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:02,760
Okay. Yeah, go ahead. All right, so let's just see.

7
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,150
It looks like so mobile testing would not apply to the idea of testing several different outliers.

8
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,140
Firstly, you don't test. I didn't know. I didn't like testing.

9
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,840
I don't I never mind. But like, yeah.

10
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:30,140
So for multiple testing is as you exactly just know that on the same data you test and at one classic exemplar or something,

11
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,740
one classic example that I would be disappointed.

12
00:01:40,550 --> 00:23:03,790
The. I.

13
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,910
So it's better to get.

14
00:24:21,960 --> 00:25:31,600
I have. It's like.

15
00:25:35,500 --> 00:28:13,320
Yeah. Now.

16
00:29:31,310 --> 00:30:01,450
Yeah. But that.

17
00:30:23,760 --> 00:31:51,580
Mr. Look.

18
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:21,090
Oh, my God. That's so. So I.

19
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:50,740
I just. I didn't make it.

20
00:37:20,800 --> 00:46:13,710
But. Is that?

21
00:48:16,690 --> 00:54:07,640
Yeah. I just.

22
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:45,290
Yes. Something I thought of.

23
00:55:53,340 --> 01:00:52,790
Yeah. I.

24
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:35,840
You have. I saw that.

25
01:10:30,070 --> 01:13:45,860
So. Yeah.
