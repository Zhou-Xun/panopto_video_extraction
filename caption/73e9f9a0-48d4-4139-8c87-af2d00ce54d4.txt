1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:19,549
I think. All right.

2
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,500
Good morning, everyone. We have a few logistics to accomplish today.

3
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:32,750
The first item of business will be I'll hand back the exams and we can discuss the exams for a few minutes.

4
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,220
You're welcome to hold on to the exam and check it out during the whole class period.

5
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,930
At the end of the class period, I'll ask you to return them to me on your way out.

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:52,970
After we get through that, we can talk about the proposal that was assigned and go through that and see if there's any questions.

7
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,739
And we'll kind of revisit the calendar, make sure we're all on the same page going forward.

8
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:03,360
We have a break coming up and then we'll actually get into a little bit of material kind

9
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:09,680
of pick up on the exposure modeling topic that Professor O'Neil started on Tuesday.

10
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,360
All right. So with that, I will begin with apologies in advance.

11
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:22,010
I'm doing okay on names. But please, if I call out your name, just raise your hand and I can come and give you your exam.

12
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,250
And I understand there's also a few folks that are here today as well.

13
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:35,360
I don't think as it is here. I think Emily not considered but me.

14
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:49,490
She just came. And then tell me everything.

15
00:01:52,440 --> 00:02:15,520
Story of the yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:42,659
And and this about your time is, uh, Morgan and Madeline de Molina.

17
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,820
Uh, thank you.

18
00:02:47,880 --> 00:03:00,450
Yeah, my name is that came.

19
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:19,580
Can you trust the process?

20
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:32,120
After what? Amy Christie.

21
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,620
But. I know that a few folks walked in as I was passing them out.

22
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,410
Like all your name. Give me a break, Andres. Kathy. I still think about hearing that side of me.

23
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:06,670
Emily, your name is Matt is being in the air and sort of taking attendance today by default, right?

24
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,730
I came here with that.

25
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:20,420
All right. So if you are here and you didn't get your exam back, raise your hand.

26
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,610
Everyone's got their exam. Okay. All right, so let's talk through it.

27
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,810
First of all, you see some scribbles along the top, right?

28
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,940
What that indicates is that if you recall,

29
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:45,710
I mentioned when I created the exam that if there were any questions where more than half the class got the answer wrong, got the answer incorrect.

30
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:53,180
I basically blame that on myself for not teaching it well enough in that you remove the question from the scoring.

31
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:02,870
So that happens with one question. And so it's why you see a score over 98 instead of a score over 100.

32
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:11,780
And then I converted that into a percentage. And that was what it was posted to the canvas site as your score for the exam.

33
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,610
Did anyone have difficulty accessing the exam scores on campus?

34
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:24,230
Okay, perfect. I know folks are often interested in just, you know, what was the mean?

35
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:32,630
How did I fit in that type of thing? The mean on the exam was 89.6%, right.

36
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,240
So kind of after accounting for that removed question.

37
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,950
Speaking of the question, let's actually talk about it.

38
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:47,060
I can have another teaching moment and I think I get to blame a little bit on Professor Neitzel because this was on one of his lectures,

39
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:54,890
so I'll mention it to him. But it was Question 21 and it was a to answer.

40
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,560
So was talking about humanistic health effects and ionizing radiation.

41
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,540
And the first part of it is the first answer is stochastic health effects.

42
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:12,710
And most of you got that correct. Uh, are those that occur long after ionizing radiation exposures.

43
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:20,690
And the second answer is, and the probability of health effects increases linearly with increasing dose.

44
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,640
And most people put in some things that along the lines of severity.

45
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,329
So yeah, it's kind of on the right track, but it's not the correct answer.

46
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,890
And so since I think nobody actually got the correct answer, that's how bad this was.

47
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,710
So that was removed from the exam scoring.

48
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:47,839
But anyway, from a learning perspective, the correct answer is it's the probability of the health effects increased linearly.

49
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:57,479
With that said, overall, I thought the class did pretty well at 89.6.

50
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,130
This is pretty typical for this class for the exam.

51
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:11,120
So so kudos to you all. I mean, a little bit of commentary if you didn't do as well on the exam as you were hoping.

52
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:16,740
Don't worry too much. The exams only worth 30% of the course grade.

53
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,120
Right.

54
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:29,210
That means that they're 70% of the grade left and lots of opportunities to score, you know, if you did do as well as you were hoping on the exam.

55
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,399
Nice work. At the same time, it's only 30% of the course grade.

56
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,930
Right? So so keep working as we move forward in the course.

57
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,470
That's and again, you have the exams to look through, you know, during the whole class period.

58
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,650
Are there any questions that people have that they'd like to raise right now and that I could address?

59
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,550
I will say there's also even though I'll ask you to hand the exam back in at the end of the class period,

60
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:09,800
if you would like to meet with me and go through it in a little bit more detail or ask questions, I'd be happy to.

61
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,960
Just. Just shoot me an email and we can schedule a time.

62
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,320
Whatever is convenient if it works for you to do it after class. Right?

63
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,130
If not, we can just find a day and time that works and get together and talk about the exam.

64
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,040
All right. So thumbs up overall.

65
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:33,440
Thanks for your hard work on this so far and just continues.

66
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:44,120
Right. And now we're onto the next one. So what was posted last night and again, hopefully folks saw this over here,

67
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:50,750
used to say proposal aside without a link, now there's a link and it goes to the assignment.

68
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,170
I will say actually right off the bat that I adjusted the due date.

69
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:07,700
I originally had it as November 8th and and actually my original intention was for it to be three weeks for you all to work on this.

70
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:17,240
It was just the way that the different the guest lectures and things sorted that I, I expanded it to maybe like three and a half weeks.

71
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,650
Dean Boman sent an email out just a few days ago reminding folks of Election Day, which is November eight,

72
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:31,880
and encouraging instructors to not have big assignments do or to not hold exams on that day.

73
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:37,730
So I took that to heart. I hope you all do whatever you need to do and get out and vote.

74
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,890
And I also understand it's, you know, perhaps a a stressful or anxiety,

75
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:48,530
anxiety inducing day for people that have, you know, voting issues that are close to their heart.

76
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,630
And so I went ahead and moved. I just extended the due date by a couple of days.

77
00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:00,750
So now we're out to November 10th, which is up for a full four weeks from today.

78
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,280
So you got quite a bit longer than I would had originally intended.

79
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:13,940
I think that's fine. And I you know, I also I feel for, you know, the due dates are random.

80
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:19,850
And I understand or I appreciate that the longer you have to work on it, you generally keep working on it, right?

81
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,470
So it's almost I don't want it to like extended unnecessarily, right?

82
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,380
And then just like belabor the the agony of working on the assignment.

83
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:35,470
So even though it's due on November 10th, you are absolutely welcome to submit it at any time before that.

84
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,440
I haven't actually submitted yet. I haven't created the assignment and canvas.

85
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,310
That will be the mechanism. I'll be an assignment and canvas.

86
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,720
You simply upload your file and that's how you submit it.

87
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:56,870
You don't need to wait until November 10th to do that, but that is kind of the revised due date right prior to class that morning.

88
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,860
Okay. So let's talk about the assignment itself.

89
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:06,890
I have this pulled up. So it's an individual proposal.

90
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,390
Right. So you're working on these alone? Absolutely.

91
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,370
And the reason that I make a distinction is that the third assignment in the class is a group debate.

92
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,450
So you're actually purposely working with others. That's not the case for this one.

93
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:29,270
So make sure it's your own work and you're responding to a mock call for proposals from the state of Michigan.

94
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,260
And this is kind of simulating a real world scenario, and it's actually from a professional development perspective,

95
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,469
it's pretty common that like a state will receive some funds and they need

96
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:48,140
to disperse them because they're only eligible to be used by a certain date.

97
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,220
So they have a quick turnaround time. Okay, we have this issue.

98
00:11:52,580 --> 00:12:00,890
We know that we're struggling managing chemicals in the environment right now and their possible exposures to communities.

99
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:07,220
Let's get a leg up on it and improve our our ability to respond to these issues.

100
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,629
So we're going to put out a call for proposals and get some expert opinions,

101
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:16,610
some expert input from people like you, all that are emerging exposure scientists.

102
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,560
And so you've got four weeks to work on this call.

103
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:31,459
So the call for proposals is I mean, this is a fact is that Michigan, like many other states, but unfortunately,

104
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,230
Michigan was one of the earlier ones, kind of similar to the lead crisis that occurred in Flint.

105
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:42,140
And then subsequently there's been, you know, additional land and water issues identified elsewhere in the country.

106
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,570
On the west side of Michigan, in the small community of Rockford, north of Grand Rapids,

107
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:59,810
was a very large legacy contaminant of that was that was found going back decades but only found maybe five years ago or so.

108
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:10,400
So in your proposal. So the state is looking for ways to improve its exposure, assessment,

109
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:17,540
preparedness and ability to respond in the event of future community false exposure incidents.

110
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,790
And particularly the focus is on two.

111
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,280
And so P force is a broad category of chemicals of for needed substances.

112
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:40,580
This call is has a specific focus on two per floral boxing sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid with regards to exposures.

113
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,560
So in your proposal, one will walk through it as a rubric down at the bottom.

114
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,000
We'll go through that carefully.

115
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:56,270
But you'll be asked to briefly introduce and describe kind of the historical problems of us as a contaminant and community settings,

116
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:03,950
and then describe your proposed exposure assessment methodology in the event of a following.

117
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:09,050
Hypothetical occurrence is that residents within a specific Michigan community

118
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:16,010
took it upon themselves to go and have their blood sampled and tested or passed,

119
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:24,830
and they found that p levels in their blood were elevated compared to US population levels.

120
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:31,910
Right? So now there's a cause for concern. So in your proposed methodology,

121
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:40,160
we're asking you to consider and discuss what the possible exposure pathways might be and the

122
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:47,300
likely routes of exposure to these residents and to the community as a whole in which they reside.

123
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:54,800
Here's where you have a little bit of freedom. You can choose a real Michigan community.

124
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:04,260
It's up to you. You can also choose a make up to be a fictitious community of your own design, whatever.

125
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:12,650
It helps you to actually work through the issue. So as part of this proposed methodology,

126
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:20,720
you're asked to describe potential exposure measurements and other exposure data collection approaches and opportunities,

127
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,430
and very importantly, discussing the pros and cons of each.

128
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:32,179
If you recall, that's kind of been a theme of how we presented a lot of the material on the course is saying, yes,

129
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:38,810
there's personal exposure monitoring that can be done, but here are kind of the burdens or challenges for actually conducting it.

130
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:44,570
Here are biomarker sample opportunities that can be collected, but here are challenges and burdens, right?

131
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:48,290
Each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages.

132
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:55,430
So I'm asking you to flesh those out as you consider exposure data collection approaches.

133
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:02,239
And so approaches that would be or allow for a feasible but rigorous and comprehensive

134
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,700
exposure assessment to estimate total exposure across all sources and pathways.

135
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:13,280
So when I say feasible, don't be too constrained by logistics.

136
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,070
Okay. Feel free to think outside the box.

137
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:24,350
Perhaps your budget isn't limitless, but you know you can pretend that you have quite a bit of money to throw at this.

138
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,549
Just make sure you're including this in the in the advantages or disadvantages.

139
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,800
Right.

140
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:37,130
As you're describing an exposure assessment approach or data collection approach that maybe is very expensive or maybe is very resource intensive.

141
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:42,350
Say that, right, that this is one of the challenges of it. However, I think it's the best way to do this.

142
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,460
And then finally, I'm asking you to present and describe this is important.

143
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:56,210
What would be the primary uncertainties involved in your proposed approach?

144
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,889
Right. So we weren't talking about this.

145
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:07,670
We're actually talking about a little bit today about uncertainties in that data and how does this community and

146
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:14,030
these residents that have found elevated levels in their blood and what you're proposing for exposure assessment,

147
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:24,740
how do exposure standards and regulations that may or may not exist, uh, play a role in this hypothetical future incident?

148
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:31,070
And how would they inform how you would interpret your, your data results?

149
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,380
All right. So now let's get to the rubric and kind of some of the specifics.

150
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,080
I'm asking for an 8 to 10 page proposal.

151
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:50,780
So not not terribly long. This is is both of a challenge and a occurs is at the same time is it.

152
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,370
Right off the bat, people think, oh, my gosh, 8 to 10 pages. How am I going to like.

153
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:02,820
That's a lot to write. But once you get into it, it's easier to just keep writing to to say related everything you want.

154
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,980
So it's, it's a challenge to also write concisely.

155
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:13,740
Uh, so I think that's probably how you'll find what you want to dig into it is that you'll need to get all of this down within that range.

156
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,950
People always ask, you know, what font size, double spacing, single spacing, whatever.

157
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:29,370
So I'm kind of spelling it out here, 12 point font, one and a half line spacing in your document, uh, references.

158
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,760
Do you need to be provided? Right.

159
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,310
So, and there's going to be a mix of resources available to you.

160
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,810
The peer reviewed literature is going to have the latest information.

161
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:49,440
So don't be afraid to dig into journal articles, right, to talk about an exposure assessment.

162
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:58,620
At the same time, you will also probably find, uh, kind of some government document based resources that you can utilize as well.

163
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:05,870
But please make sure that you are listing these resources, these references, in terms of the format of the references.

164
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,000
It's up to you. Just pick something and be consistent.

165
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,929
Right. If you want to kind of footnote it at the bottom of every page, that's fine.

166
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:20,250
If you just want to have a reference list at the very end. That's fine. The important thing is that you're actually citing these works.

167
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:28,830
And then also importantly, those references, including any data tables or figures that you might include,

168
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:34,140
do not count in that that 8 to 10 size range.

169
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:43,979
So in terms of the rubric, uh, so that introduction to past contamination talking about kind of like the history,

170
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:49,170
what do we know about it in communities that is worth 15 points out of 100?

171
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:56,290
Uh, the gist of the proposal is really component number two here worth 50 points.

172
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:01,900
So half of it, which is really the meat of the, the proposed exposure assessment methodology.

173
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:11,610
Right. Talking about that sampling strategy, you know, which exposure methods are you proposing and other data collection activities?

174
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:20,940
15 points for being able to identify and describe the uncertainties associated with your with your proposed exposure assessment.

175
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:30,150
Ten points for describing applicable or relevant standards that may or may not be present in this case.

176
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,700
And you actually get points for for hitting that appropriate proposal length.

177
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:40,830
So coming within that 8 to 10 age range and that gets us up to a total of 100.

178
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,570
So with that as kind of an overview, we'll stay down here.

179
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,520
I'll stop and see if folks have any initial questions about.

180
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:09,060
Yes. You may have said this already, in which case I apologize for like citation type or any of that in terms of format.

181
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:17,440
Yeah. Like APA MLA, you have complete freedom to pick whichever format you like, just pick one to be consistent throughout the document.

182
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:24,980
That's all that I ask. Any other questions?

183
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:36,920
Yes. Just just clarifying that our methodology is like doing something in addition to the blood testing.

184
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,330
That was already done. Correct. So making sure that I'm.

185
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:46,160
Yeah. Yeah. So good question. So I'm just to clarify.

186
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:54,320
The blood testing wasn't done as type of as any type of assessment by any type of organization.

187
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,470
These were just some residents in this hypothetical scenario that, like you all, you know about people.

188
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,390
Right. And if you had reason to be concerned,

189
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:10,370
you maybe you know that there's a lab nearby that you can go and submit a blood sample and you might be concerned about your exposure.

190
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,020
So that's what these residents did.

191
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:20,419
I'm going to say a handful of them did this and, uh, they were kind of spreading the word right to their, to their community.

192
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:26,080
Hey, we went and got our blood tested, and it's high end because this is a problem, right?

193
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:30,950
Where is this coming from? Why is it high? Uh, and how are we being exposed?

194
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:43,160
So that's kind of the that's kind of the setting. So in comes you all as the experts to figure out to help the state in this future incident.

195
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,550
Right. If this were to occur and they need to respond quickly.

196
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:55,160
Right. Uh, how would you propose an exposure assessment methodology with this hypothetical community?

197
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:02,640
Yes. So then is this like a retrospective, retrospective type of study?

198
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:06,870
Like why? How they got high blood levels or.

199
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,580
It's a little bit of both. Right. So the fact that it's hypothetical in the future is kind of prospective.

200
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:18,470
Uh, but, but yeah. So, you know, playing out that scenario, uh, it, it might be a little bit of both.

201
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:23,400
Those are questions to ask. Is it historical exposure?

202
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:32,520
Is it ongoing? And what type of exposure approaches would you propose to help determine these things?

203
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:44,690
Any other. The point here of this assignment is, you know, we're learning about,

204
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:52,130
like all of the fundamentals for exposure assessment and here's a chance to actually apply it to to a real world scenario,

205
00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:02,440
demonstrate your your understanding of it. Any other initial questions that are coming to mind?

206
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:15,150
All right. Well, as you get into the assignment, right, you got four weeks to work on, and I'm sure the questions will come up.

207
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:21,900
So don't be afraid to reach out to me. Shoot me an email if it's helpful to actually meet and discuss it.

208
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:31,260
Uh, we can do that. Uh, also, there's what often happens is someone will ask like a really good question and I'll be able to answer to you.

209
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,490
But if it's also like a relevant answer to share with the whole class, I will do that as well.

210
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,430
All right. So that was agenda item number two.

211
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:52,390
Think before we got into today's material, I just wanted to look at the calendar here and make sure make sure we're on the same page.

212
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,499
As I mentioned.

213
00:24:53,500 --> 00:25:01,840
In a moment here, we'll talk about we'll continue talking about exposure, modeling and looking a little bit at personal exposures more specifically.

214
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:07,000
Next Tuesday, our class will not meet on the 18th.

215
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:11,350
This as part of the university's fall break. So hooray for you.

216
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:17,350
Hooray for all of us. No classes are held on either Monday or Tuesday of next week.

217
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,629
We will reconvene on Thursday the 20th.

218
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,470
So a week from today, another array moment.

219
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:32,350
You don't have to listen to me lecture on that day. We do have a couple of different exercises.

220
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,340
We have our next installment of Exposure Science in the News.

221
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:41,139
So that assignment is linked here, same format as the previous.

222
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,860
To find an article, bring a summary. Make sure to read the assignment.

223
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,780
I'm adding what you're responsible for to articulate from your article.

224
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:55,180
With each one, we're getting further and further into it. I will also, since it's going to be the break,

225
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:00,790
I'll send a reminder out early next week just to make sure that it's still on folks radar to come to class prepared for that.

226
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,920
We will also, uh,

227
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:14,470
and so we'll spend half the class period ish on the exposure science and the news article or assignment for the other half of the class period.

228
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:20,980
Uh, we'll actually introduce our third assignment in the class, or really our third and final one,

229
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:27,280
which is the class debate and the group debates which occur in the last few class periods of the semester.

230
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,220
I'll post those debate instructions. So this will be linked by a week from now.

231
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,820
I will also post the debate groups. Right?

232
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,980
So who's assigned to which group and which debate topic and which date of the debate and so forth?

233
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:52,090
And then I'm also really aware that it's hard and people are super busy and it's hard to find time to meet.

234
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:57,969
So we'll actually allocate a part of that class period for the debate groups to

235
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:03,580
actually get together and kind of break out and talk about how you want to tackle this,

236
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,270
what's the best way to organize it, what's the best way to communicate and so forth?

237
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,750
Will there'll be some allocated time class for that as well?

238
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:16,960
All right. Any questions on just kind of the calendar of the course?

239
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:27,840
All right, let's get back into some exposure modeling.

240
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,610
And actually, I'm just remembering I had another in my first slide as the title slide is.

241
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:42,510
And now the point that I wanted to make folks aware of and again,

242
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:49,049
since we're not meeting on Tuesday because of the fall break, I wouldn't have a chance to to advertise this.

243
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:54,629
Then I wanted to let folks know about this event that's happening next Wednesday.

244
00:27:54,630 --> 00:28:07,470
So right following the fall break from 10 to 1, just right across the entryway, here is the the Cornell Community Room here on the first floor.

245
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:18,480
And the school's hosting kind of a reflection, an event that is interactive and engaging and has some activities built into it.

246
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,020
I'm almost positive it's got some like food and drinks built into it and so forth.

247
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:31,110
But it's this part of a multi-year process within the school is kind of the university has its own overarching diversity,

248
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:35,790
equity and inclusion kind of plan that has been unrolling for several years.

249
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:47,969
The School of Public Health has its own more, more locally focused, and this is going to be kind of sharing, but also moving forward with that.

250
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:53,610
And so I schools inviting everyone and I know many of you are public health students.

251
00:28:53,820 --> 00:29:01,740
Some of you are not. I'm assuming everyone is invited. So don't don't be afraid to look into the event if you're interested.

252
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,809
Okay. Now we get to some exposure modeling.

253
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:13,469
So today we're going to understand some indirect methods and we'll look at that schematic.

254
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:17,340
If you recall, there were some that are direct methods of exposure assessment, some that are indirect.

255
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,840
We're going to understand some of these indirect methods of exposure assessment.

256
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,930
And on that side of the graph includes things like environmental modeling,

257
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:35,040
in addition to monitoring that can inform exposure models as well as questionnaires and diaries.

258
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,900
Right. That are kind of indirect approaches, but that also could be informing exposure models.

259
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:47,920
So along the same lines, understanding that, understanding the types of exposure data that we need to be able to do.

260
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:58,110
So your modeling, understanding the methods for assessing personal activities and time spent in different environments or micro environments,

261
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,490
and we'll talk about what a micro environment is and then again,

262
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:10,470
talk a bit more about the role of uncertainty and even variability and how this plays into our ability to model exposures.

263
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:24,290
All right. So for assessing exposures in our options that we usually have in front of us include monitoring, right?

264
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:33,530
So actually making measurements in the field, whether it's in an occupational setting or in a community setting or modeling.

265
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:40,850
Right. Which basically means, you know, some sort of code based computer model that inputs data into it.

266
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,750
Some assumptions are made and, you know, some output comes out and that's how we arrive at some sort of exposure estimate.

267
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:52,730
And then in some cases, both, right. We can do some modeling and some monitoring.

268
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:57,500
And Professor Neal, I think O'Neill got you off to a great start on that on Tuesday.

269
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,320
Right. With that becomes a breakout exercise. What are some of the considerations?

270
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,860
What would be your data sources? How would you validate a model and so forth?

271
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:11,890
So modeling is is pretty much indispensable.

272
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,920
As much as we would like to measure everything.

273
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:23,920
We simply can't because of so many logistics that prevention, including how resource intensive it is in a lot of cases.

274
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:30,130
And again, when we're looking at something that's prospective in the future, we can't we can't measure the future.

275
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,930
Right? We can only measure the present.

276
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:41,230
And so modeling involves in our only way to account for or to try to assume what some site specific factors are,

277
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,690
where a prospective evaluation has some strengths.

278
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:53,290
Modeling allows us to predict a wide variety of scenarios so we can vary those assumptions in our model, right,

279
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:59,590
and see how our exposure assessment might change based on those assumptions and also allows

280
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:06,580
us to kind of found our our model in terms of what those exposure outcomes might be.

281
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:18,400
Yeah, I mentioned the logistics and simply the expense of getting on site and off site data from a measurement perspective.

282
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:24,460
And then also, we have in an ideal world, we're screening, right?

283
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:33,250
We, we look at a hypothetical occurrence, whether it's a chemical product or a task on site in a workplace.

284
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:40,880
And we need to do a kind of a preliminary evaluation to determine whether this is something that should should go forward or not.

285
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,640
Right. So this applies to things like consumer products or manufacturing products.

286
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:51,969
And again, there are lots of perhaps different options or scenarios involved that that modeling

287
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:58,210
can occur and iterations can be done just as a screening tool for assessing exposures.

288
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:04,750
Okay. So here is that diagram. Right. We've looked at a bunch of these.

289
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:11,710
We've kind of gone through direct methods, biological monitoring or biomarkers, personal monitoring.

290
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,819
We have that became models, dose models over here.

291
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:21,820
On the indirect side, we've talked about questionnaires and diaries.

292
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:28,450
We have talked about different ways to to make measurements, to assess exposure, take a sip of water here.

293
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,740
But down at the bottom is what we're kind of focusing on today.

294
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,870
Continuing to talk about those exposure models.

295
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:50,960
And it's important to note and I'll note it now in case they do so poorly later in the lecture that both sides of this graph inform exposure models.

296
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,719
Right? So these indirect methods where we're kind of focusing on today, we can make measurements,

297
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:03,780
we can collect data through questionnaires or diaries, can inform exposure models, but also this side as well.

298
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,850
Those direct methods can also be informing exposure models.

299
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:18,010
This one is a bit redundant. We've talked about it a couple of weeks ago,

300
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:30,070
but as a reminder that the measurement or estimation of exposure that relies on four key components, right?

301
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:35,470
So the magnitude, how much of that needs and concern is present?

302
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:46,870
The frequency. How often does contact with that agent occur in duration or how long does that contact occur?

303
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,160
And then being able to identify the relative exposure, right?

304
00:34:51,550 --> 00:35:03,160
How does that your agent enter our bodies? Then the exposure ends up being a function of both the magnitude, the frequency and the duration.

305
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,490
And importantly, knowing what that route of exposure is.

306
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:13,570
Okay, so you've probably been missing our good friends, person A and person B, right, that we met a couple of weeks ago.

307
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,089
Let's kind of revisit that that scenario as a way to through some examples,

308
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:27,220
to kind of talk through these these indirect methods and how we might assess their exposures by incorporating some exposure modeling.

309
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:40,990
So just as a refresher, we've got Person A here who works within that LED smelter and we have Person B who lives in a community nearby at smelter.

310
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:47,840
So let's say that we can't do personal monitoring on either person.

311
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:52,670
Right. Given that, how can we model their exposures?

312
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,260
All right. So, you know, we did talk about personal monitoring previously,

313
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:05,810
and these would be sampling devices that can be, you know, physically attached to a person.

314
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:14,340
The example image over here is an air quality bag attached to a caller go near the person's breathing.

315
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,839
So, right.

316
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:23,360
This would be giving a direct this would be a direct measurement to estimate what that person's exposure to some contaminants in the air might be.

317
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:30,980
Another approach, and again, this is burdensome, is perhaps expensive to do on every single person.

318
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:35,210
One approach that we can take is to use area samples, right?

319
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:41,660
So these generally are stationary devices that are set up in one place.

320
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:46,610
And I think I've used this example like in our classroom, it might be that you might take a stationary sample,

321
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,070
you know, put it up here in the front of the classroom, let it run during the whole class period,

322
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:58,159
and then use that as some sort of representation of what our collective exposure is to all of us in this room,

323
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,000
even though none of us are actually wearing the personal measurement device.

324
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:12,230
So this approach is convenient, uh, especially when the device is large or otherwise uncomfortable or burdensome to wear.

325
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,459
Uh, but in that case, we need to do some extrapolation, right?

326
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,760
And we make some assumptions and monitor here in the front of the classroom.

327
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,130
We're kind of assuming that is representative of all of us. Maybe it's not right.

328
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,890
Someone who's sitting way in the back, someone here who is much closer to it.

329
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:41,780
We would have to make some extrapolations there. The exposure would likely be underestimated when people are generating exposure by their activities.

330
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:54,320
So, uh, if you know, the monitor is up here and I'm over there in the kitchen doing something right and generating some sort of contaminant,

331
00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:00,890
I'm being exposed over there. But this device is probably not doing a very good job of capturing it.

332
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:11,150
So in that case, it would be underestimated. Inversely exposure might be overestimated when devices are placed near the point source, right?

333
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,319
So if we come in to the classroom and we're really concerned, we're like, okay,

334
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,270
there's something over there in that kitchen that is probably a risk to us.

335
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,570
And so we're placing the monitor right there in the kitchen. We're monitoring the whole class period.

336
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:28,040
But we're all sitting over here, right? None of us are actually over there in the kitchen.

337
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:37,940
In that case, that exposure assessment is likely to overestimate what we were all actually exposed to with the fire alarm.

338
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:43,880
So we give you an example of the overestimating, our exposure to something.

339
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:48,350
Yeah. Who is actually present in the building during the the fire alarms.

340
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:53,810
Yeah. Apologies for that. And it wasn't my fault personally, but I feel your pain.

341
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:57,770
I have been. I was not. Fortunately for me, I was out of the building at the time.

342
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:03,110
But as you might imagine, I've done that drill way more times than I would would care to.

343
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,100
It's often like nothing. Right.

344
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:13,640
It's just like a glitch in the system and the alarms going off and the rules are everyone still needs to exit the building.

345
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:19,550
This one was real. It was there was an in one of the labs on the seventh floor, one of the autoclaves.

346
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:30,580
Uh, I don't know what had to do with, like, you know, it, it, it cleans icb very hot water and something wasn't functioning right.

347
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:35,719
And so that triggered the alarm. So it was, it was genuine.

348
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,350
And so good job for those of you that exited the building.

349
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:45,890
Yeah. I mean, that's a little bit different, right? Because it's a it's I did say that there was like one room with Steve,

350
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:54,800
the entire building for sure that everyone to building because there might be an issue with for anyone within like ten feet of your place.

351
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:58,160
Right. Yeah, I see your point for sure.

352
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:09,810
Okay. So sticking with some of these indirect methods, we've got person A and person B, right?

353
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,120
Person is within the line smelter, person vs in the community nearby.

354
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:20,740
So within the facility we might use area samples.

355
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,420
Collected in in the work environment.

356
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:32,880
And maybe we have like a personal monitor or something that small and mobile, and we don't have enough to do every worker.

357
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,060
It's burdensome. People don't agree to it, whatever it might be.

358
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:44,640
But we can still place that monitor somewhere in the area, in the vicinity of multiple workers and get some sort of assessment of their exposure.

359
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:50,190
And again, we have that same issue of my, you know, not great kitchen example here in the classroom,

360
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,070
which it's just bizarre to me that there's a kitchen in the classroom.

361
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:59,010
But I know and I think there's a sign right outside the door that says no eating or drinking in the classroom.

362
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:03,930
Right. Lots of conflict going on. Yeah.

363
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,560
Like I just mentioned in the kitchen, for example, scenario,

364
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:14,730
the exposure would likely be underestimated when workers are generating exposure via their own activity.

365
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:20,430
Right. So we can set the area monitor up in the in the middle of the workspace if someone's over there,

366
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:23,880
you know, actually doing the job tasks, generating the exposure.

367
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:27,930
And over here in the middle of the room is where the measurements made.

368
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:32,670
So it would likely underestimate. There's some other things we have.

369
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,689
Uh, we maybe let that sit for the whole workshop for 8 hours,

370
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:45,900
and it's kind of integrating over 8 hours and we get a time weighted average, right, with the average exposure over those 8 hours.

371
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,430
But we've got all these workers that are perhaps coming and going during that time.

372
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:55,500
Maybe they were exposed on their task, but maybe they were only at their job test for an hour.

373
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:01,379
Right. And so is that eight hour time weighted average representative.

374
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:10,910
So in the case of person A, was that person in the area that long for the full 8 hours during that day or even every day in the case that we want to

375
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:19,140
take that measurement and extrapolate it as the norm for all days in the workplace for person B who is in the community,

376
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:29,129
we can also take area samples and this is pretty common in community settings at the smelter fenceline, right?

377
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,370
So you kind of got the facility and it's secure.

378
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:37,320
And then just beyond the security issue, you're back into kind of the public space.

379
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:42,900
And so you can set up a monitor right at the fence line. And this is actually done.

380
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:48,870
It's quite common in the real world with one of these fixed air sampling pumps.

381
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:57,240
Right, to assess when in the air. We would also have the question about other environmental pathways.

382
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,750
What about the soil and the community? What about water?

383
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:06,600
Uh, what about the food? Right. Where is it being grown and how is it being sourced and ingested?

384
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:17,760
In this case, it is set up at the fenceline purposefully to kind of be representative of a worst case scenario.

385
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:24,749
Right. And the community with the understanding that most people live further away from the facility than the fenceline itself.

386
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:35,520
So in this case, an area monitor is likely to overestimate the true community exposure, since the sample is being placed nearer to the point source,

387
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:41,610
nearer to the lead smelter itself than where most of those receptors or community members are residing.

388
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:51,570
It's also pretty common in those scenarios to collect a 24 hour average, to set the monitor up, let it run for a full day.

389
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:56,280
And again, we're kind of back to a time weighted average over that 24 hour period.

390
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:03,839
But then it's a realistic question, uh, is person be actually at home for 24 hours straight, right?

391
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:09,299
Do they have a job? Do they go to school? What other activities take them away from that community.

392
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:14,670
So there's a question there about how representative that area sample might be in the community setting.

393
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,820
For Person A And this is generally the case in occupational settings.

394
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:27,400
Even though we're talking about how we might use exposure modeling, it's not very common.

395
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:36,760
And the reason is because in most workplaces there are opportunities to make real measurements of personal measurements,

396
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:45,010
area measurements, etc. And so we're not really trying to do exposure modeling or environmental modeling within a workplace.

397
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:51,490
It does happen, but it's not common for community settings.

398
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:59,650
It's very tough, a kind of for reasons we've talked about before, if it's a worker, it's part of their job.

399
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:04,870
Their employer kind of insists that they wear this exposure monitor or a ways to get data.

400
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:09,010
And hopefully the workers are concerned about what they're being exposed to.

401
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:18,399
And so the burden of doing it is is more easily overcome in a community setting.

402
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,180
Right. This isn't very practical to say, okay, we have, you know, who knows?

403
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,660
Well, at least thousands of people probably do live in this community.

404
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:32,050
We're not going to be able to attach a personal monitor to everyone, even if we had the resources to do it.

405
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:36,070
Most people are not are not going to agree to do it because we need to meet.

406
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:46,420
So in this case, environmental models are very common and deployed in a lot of settings where we're concerned about community exposures.

407
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:57,600
Per person within the lead smelter facility.

408
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:01,400
Again, I mentioned, you know, typically we're relying on measurements.

409
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:07,550
Sometimes there are mathematical models. So this would be, you know, an exposure model.

410
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:12,950
It could be used it might be a simple box model within like a workspace and

411
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:17,450
some multi-zone models that might involve some computational fluid dynamics.

412
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:21,740
Right. Depending on perhaps airflow or something within the facility.

413
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:32,840
Or person B in this case, it's basically him hitting upon what Professor O'Neil focused much of her lecture on on Tuesday.

414
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:40,639
Models that are proximity based. Right, where if someone were where does someone live?

415
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:47,120
Where did someone spend their time at school, whatever it might be, it generally involves a lot of spatial interpolation.

416
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:54,590
Right. Remember, she talked about opportunities for land use, regression modeling, opportunities for dispersion modeling.

417
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:59,809
Right. If we know information about emission sources, she talked about roadways.

418
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:07,730
Right. And emissions from vehicles. So a lot of this involves kind of geographical information systems and spatial

419
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:12,590
interpolation to come up with with estimates of exposure within a community setting.

420
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:21,510
And there are there are places to start it.

421
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:26,520
This is posed to us. We don't need to build our own exposure model.

422
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,050
There are resources that we can tap into right off the bat.

423
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,980
So here's an example of one with regards to environmental model modeling.

424
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:44,040
The EPA has a center for exposure assessment modeling so we can tap into these are publicly available groundwater models.

425
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:51,719
Models of food chain surface water models and then actually multi-media models, right.

426
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:59,820
That take into account multiple exposure pathways knowing that this is often a reality for many contaminants.

427
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:15,049
So talking a little bit about uncertainty within that led smelter and this scenario over person A typically

428
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:22,520
the uncertainty around the estimated concentration is relatively small and it's again because we have access,

429
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,030
because we're able to kind of control for many things.

430
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,920
People are in a defined space that we can characterize relatively well.

431
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:39,620
So because of that, the uncertainty ends up being relatively small for person B and in that community setting it's a little bit different.

432
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:43,960
The uncertainty tends to be fairly large, right?

433
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:51,860
Because we're making so many more assumptions and there are so many more variables that we can't control or that are difficult to account for.

434
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,450
Professor O'Neill talked about the role of topography.

435
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:02,450
How available is that? Gives data things like weather.

436
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,080
Right. So if you're talking about a lead smelter in a community,

437
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:11,330
just simply which way is the wind blowing is that is a huge variable that impacts

438
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:17,840
what that receptor concentration is of lead in the air on any given day,

439
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,590
you know a specific agent, there are so many variables.

440
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:29,180
So with that area monitor as a surrogate of exposure within a community setting,

441
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:34,730
there tends to be a large amount of uncertainty around that estimate that we

442
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:38,600
that we get from that notion that we might try to incorporate into our model.

443
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:48,270
All right. So let's let's talk about how we might utilize information from questionnaires

444
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:56,100
or diaries to help inform our exposure models within that workplace setting.

445
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,550
Are things like work history questionnaires or time activity diaries.

446
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:12,840
We use these to obtain information on exposure, frequency and duration information, and we kind of touched upon these examples earlier.

447
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:22,650
Of course, we might be able to get a detailed history on each job and the associated exposure related to it.

448
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:31,050
And also we might be able to solicit information about other potential sources of exposure beyond their workplace.

449
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:36,870
In that community setting, there are the same types of opportunities available.

450
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:43,230
So questionnaires on how long have you lived in this community right in the first place and where have you lived previously?

451
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:49,850
What's your work history? Where have you worked? Those same type of time activity diaries.

452
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:55,480
Getting a sense for when we have an area monitor we measure for 24 hours.

453
00:50:55,490 --> 00:51:00,200
We want to know how much time this person be spent in the at home or in the community.

454
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:06,680
With the Time Activity Diary, we might be able to actually quantify how much time they spent and know how much to attribute.

455
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:16,820
Generally speaking, whatever histories we get around jobs and our ability to kind of get a handle on exposures is much more crude

456
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:24,170
with a community based questionnaire versus more detail that can be honed in on within a workplace setting.

457
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:29,389
But we do also have the opportunity to those questionnaires to address other potential

458
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:35,000
sources of exposure of things related to their hobbies and past experiences.

459
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:45,690
Within the workplace settings, doing questionnaires and diaries to get this information.

460
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:53,610
It might supplement or even help us to validate with employment records.

461
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,480
Right. So this is what the person is telling us through the questionnaire.

462
00:51:57,870 --> 00:52:01,690
We also might have like a separate source of information right from the employer,

463
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:11,850
and we can reconcile the two and either validate the information or even add to the information for person B in the community setting.

464
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:18,830
There's a big focus on evaluating distance from the source, right?

465
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:25,110
So we can get this information. How far away do they live and how long have they been in the residence?

466
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:32,430
We there might be some other sources of data that we can supplement or validate the information that they give us on the questionnaire,

467
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:38,790
for example, like a property tax record. Apparently, these are kept perhaps over long periods of time.

468
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:45,540
Who lived in a residence for how long? Because that's the person responsible for paying taxes on the property.

469
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:50,460
That might allow us to kind of validate the information we get from a questionnaire.

470
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:57,150
And again, we might be able to supplement with with additional gas information that may or may not be available.

471
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:05,560
So time activity diaries are kind of what are they, uh, and how are they useful?

472
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,200
They allow us to assess temporal variations.

473
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:18,280
So what people do, what their activities are over time.

474
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,100
And importantly, characterizing which microenvironment they spend their time in.

475
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:29,440
Right. So what's a micro environment? I'll give an example.

476
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:37,120
Just because I like our class so much, uh, we might like we have this data and people say, Where is Tim?

477
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:45,940
Most of the time, well, he is a faculty member at the university, so he spends most of his time on the campus in Ann Arbor.

478
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:51,190
You can define with a pin right on a map and assign a latitude and longitude.

479
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:54,810
The University of Michigan campus. Okay, that's great.

480
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:59,170
That's useful information. If I'm completing a time activity diary,

481
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:07,930
you would be able to characterize the different micro environments that I spend time in right now, from 830 to 10:00 in the morning.

482
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:13,000
I'm in the micro environment of room 1659 of page one.

483
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:21,820
So right. So it's an immediate kind of small scale environment distinct from from a larger environment.

484
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:31,450
And we might be able to identify different micro environments for define them depending on the hazard that we're concerned about,

485
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,840
what the exposure pathways might be. And then again, the likely problems of exposure.

486
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:48,340
And we'll talk about some examples that follow. And it you know, it can help us assess how how people move through space over time.

487
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:59,440
But as you can imagine, it ends up being a bit crude because there are defined categories, right, that we're kind of trying to track.

488
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:08,980
And so, you know, maybe the questionnaire or the time activity diary for mine simply says office, lab, classroom.

489
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:20,139
Right. And so I checked 830 to 10 classroom. There's not information on which I already actually given that some examples.

490
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:24,940
This slide is just more examples of different types of look, micro environments,

491
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:31,330
rates of workplace, you know, where you spend time, where you spend time in public spaces.

492
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:36,580
You're at the mall. You're at a restaurant. Transportation right here on the on the bus.

493
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:42,580
All of these could be defined as different micro environments where we spend time over the course of our days.

494
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:48,790
It could be it could be characterized through a time activity diary.

495
00:55:51,250 --> 00:56:00,520
And so the types of information obtained from the time activity data are relevant to specific exposure pathways, right?

496
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:09,080
So for if we're concerned about exposures within the air, within that exposure pathway, uh,

497
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:19,420
we would be interested to know how much time are we spending outdoors versus indoors kind of kind of basic information for water.

498
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:32,200
We might be concerned with trying to quantify through that time activity assessment how much water is consumed right for food.

499
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:37,690
As you can imagine, you know, the amount of food, the type of fruit products that would be consumed,

500
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:42,610
uh, for soil, you know, again, the amount of contact time,

501
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:52,840
if we're concerned about a person who works on a farm or a person gardens a assessments of perhaps potential pesticide applications and so forth.

502
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:07,540
So so why do we why do we have it as a goal to actually quantify these different time and activities and different microenvironment?

503
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,180
Here's an example of why we might do that.

504
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:22,310
So here's some information, uh, from a particular study by Michelle Bell looking at airborne concentrations in different micro environments.

505
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:29,560
So we can take monitors and set them up in all different types of microenvironment and measure an airborne concentration.

506
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:38,440
And this found that 50 for this particular study was looking at volatile organic compounds.

507
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:48,190
And 54% of that velocity concentrations came from commuting, right?

508
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:56,800
So in a car, in a, in a bus, etc., Uh, 17% came in the office.

509
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,880
Only 7% came from outdoors.

510
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:06,850
So there were low velocity concentrations outdoors and about 22% came from in the home.

511
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,739
But then when we actually look at the exposure profile,

512
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:19,540
so the time activity information of the people in the study and where they were spending their time.

513
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,850
71% of the time was spent in their home.

514
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:34,540
Right. So this is important information to know. Only 8% of their time is by commuting from the exposure, from the airborne concentration.

515
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:37,680
So we might say, holy cow. Commuting is a huge problem.

516
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:43,330
This is where most of the concentration of this video is coming from.

517
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:49,030
But the person is only spending 8% of their time in the day actually commuting.

518
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:52,510
So this would inform our exposure model. We can build a model.

519
00:58:52,960 --> 00:59:00,420
It takes a high concentration with with wind in this microenvironment, but then absorption it to only a very small percentage.

520
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:07,000
It reflects how much time they spend in that environment, clearly, because they spend 71% of their time in the home.

521
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:10,800
It would be really important to know what that home exposure is.

522
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:18,130
So knowing that airborne concentration, whatever it might be, high, low, medium, etc., this is where they're spending most of their time.

523
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:22,060
So having that information that's going to help to remodel.

524
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:29,690
I will actually pause for a moment and just see if folks have any questions thus far.

525
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:41,620
Okay. And as just to encourage you, please don't ever hesitate to interject me at any point if something is not clear.

526
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:49,510
So short term time activity diaries are commonly used.

527
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:59,470
And this is looking at periods of maybe as few with a timescale of minutes to a timescale of hours.

528
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:07,570
It might be used in a when we're talking about exposure through ingestion, doing a dietary recall.

529
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:13,450
Right. And having someone record what they ate and drank all day long.

530
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:17,830
Right. For an entire full day for a work activity log.

531
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:25,660
Right. It's having that worker log exactly what they were doing during each time period of their workday.

532
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:30,550
These would be examples of short term time activity.

533
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:39,970
There are also longer term time activity, diaries or questionnaires, staying with a food ingestion example.

534
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:47,439
There are food diaries, less detail, but they might span a full week.

535
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:52,690
Right? So here's the we keep a record of what you're eating and drinking over the course of the week.

536
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:57,280
Here's another one looking at a calendar.

537
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:03,430
So this might be looking at a period of days to really unlimited on the length of time.

538
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:10,330
It might be a questionnaire aimed at assessing ingestion, estimating exposure, going back decades.

539
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:20,290
All right. So there is another type of an indirect method called expert judgment.

540
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:28,750
And this basically means there are people like yourselves that, again, are emerging experts in this field.

541
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:34,780
We can actually bring someone in to provide an expert assessment.

542
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:37,660
Right. So it's not relying so much on the measurement.

543
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:44,559
It's someone who is well informed and has a great deal of understanding of when and how to apply

544
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:53,310
various assumptions to an exposure scenario so that in a workplace you might use the expert excuse me,

545
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,060
judgment of an industrial hygienist.

546
01:01:55,390 --> 01:02:05,050
So this is a person with expertize in occupational health and safety to estimate in the case of person A maybe what the concentration is,

547
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:09,910
what their frequency is, what the duration of exposure is.

548
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:22,630
And if it does, it acts as a surrogate measure of actual environmental monitoring or asking the worker about that through a questionnaire or a diary.

549
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:29,740
So again, this is someone who's trained on specific job sites, job tests, etc., and could come in and kind of provide their own.

550
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:39,940
So it relies on their knowledge of work practices, of facility conditions, you know, different processes, how things change over time.

551
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:47,230
As you might imagine, even though this person is an expert, that assessment approach can be highly uncertain.

552
01:02:47,890 --> 01:03:00,970
Or could just be flat out wrong because they used one key wrong or assumption for person B in that community settings.

553
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:05,880
We could use the expert judgment of environmental researchers.

554
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:12,850
Right. So like Professor O'Neill, bring in someone who knows how to put together and access data to estimate concentrations.

555
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:19,330
And this does happen in real world scenarios. But it's really it's a challenge.

556
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:25,180
It's difficult to do. There are so many variables that are difficult to account for.

557
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:33,580
So things like estimating the frequency and duration of person B's exposure in this scenario.

558
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:43,050
We do have with regards to frequency and duration within communities, right.

559
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:51,480
If we don't have information specific to person B, there are ways to kind of help inform and make good assumptions.

560
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:57,390
We can utilize that Exposure Factors handbook that we talked about a couple of weeks ago where,

561
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:04,559
you know, based on age, gender, we, whatever it might be,

562
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:13,890
physical characteristics, we might be able to make some assumptions around ingestion or inhalation rates or how much water they consume and so forth.

563
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:20,790
Within the workplace setting, we're typically not doing that again because it's a much more controlled environment.

564
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:31,620
We have a bit of a captive audience, so to speak, and so there's typically other ways to get more specific information about the job type tasks.

565
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:39,330
Okay, so we kind of step through and here we are an exposure model.

566
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:46,290
We can utilize these indirect methods as well as the direct methods to inform exposure models.

567
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:55,360
There are different types of exposure models and in some very broad categories we have statistical

568
01:04:55,360 --> 01:05:04,180
models that are based on multivariate statistical associations between the input and output variables.

569
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:08,650
There are types of exposure models that are deterministic.

570
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:16,950
This means that they're based on logical constructs of physical environment and human behavior.

571
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:21,400
What people actually do. And then there are probabilistic models.

572
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:33,280
And these are based on a deterministic model combined with probability distributions on those input variables.

573
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:40,750
So there are there are several different broad categories of exposure models that can be assessed.

574
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:45,899
So and I think we're getting to a little bit yeah,

575
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:55,260
this is a bit of a summary here with regards to exposure models and some of the results that would make it either application of both scenarios.

576
01:05:55,260 --> 01:06:04,650
Right. Then the occupational. So in the lead smelter workplace in this example and in the communities surrounding the smelter.

577
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:07,290
So for person A in the workplace,

578
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:15,810
we might be able to estimate their personal exposures if we we can use information on their duration of exposure, the frequency of exposure,

579
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:21,540
the magnitude of exposure based on some of those area measurements we might be able to conduct

580
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:26,790
in the workplace questionnaires and diaries that we didn't ask of the workers in this case.

581
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:33,809
Person, Hey, we might be able to use some of those mathematical models about airflow within the facility, right?

582
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:38,490
With regard to lead, that might be in the air. And then again, we can bring in that expert judgment.

583
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:45,180
We can tap into the knowledge base of that industrial hygienist to help inform the assumptions going into this.

584
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:49,980
And so your model. Per person be within that community setting.

585
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:54,240
We can also estimate those key characteristics.

586
01:06:54,450 --> 01:07:02,820
Duration of exposure, the frequency exposure and the magnitude of the exposure from some of those environmental monitoring results.

587
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:10,680
We might have that measurement. We can conduct questionnaires or diaries to get information on their time,

588
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:19,290
activity or history of living or working in the community, spending time with the community and the Exposure Factors Handbook.

589
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:22,799
Right, where we don't have information about specific people,

590
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:30,750
we can make some informed assumptions by referencing that exposure handbook and then we're talking about exposure models,

591
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:32,910
but separate from that environment models, right?

592
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:44,610
So we get looking at specific pathways of air, water or soil or even multi medium models within the environment to help inform that exposure model.

593
01:07:49,240 --> 01:08:01,390
So statistical models used to estimate exposures are actually similar for both occupational and community assessments.

594
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:08,290
Big picture wise, they're all looking to combine information on the magnitude of the duration,

595
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:15,190
the frequency, as many other factors as possible to explain or account for the measured exposures.

596
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:27,640
Based on that, we're in a good place to construct a predictive model for cases where we don't have measurements available to estimate one's exposure.

597
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:34,210
And some common modeling approaches include linear regression.

598
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:39,070
Again, Professor O'Neill talked about some some good examples of linear regression.

599
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:44,860
Another is logistic regression and another is Bayesian regression.

600
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:55,000
I know you all are at various stages in your in your biostatistics coursework and understanding of some of these modeling approaches.

601
01:08:57,310 --> 01:09:02,770
So trying to pull it all together. At the end of the day, we basically want the same thing,

602
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:10,059
whether we're talking about a workplace setting or community saying we want a quantitative assessment, right?

603
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:19,330
So a numerical value in the end estimate of the exposure of an individual within a study or some sort of assessment.

604
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:25,600
There's a lot of barriers in this process that can make it a challenge to get to that point.

605
01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:31,180
And so oftentimes we have to settle for less than ideal, right?

606
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:42,090
So poor measures, we might have to categorize exposure classifications, high, medium or right.

607
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:47,950
Because we don't have true values available to us or binary.

608
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:52,870
Were they ever exposed versus they were never exposed either yes or no.

609
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:55,900
Or that's the only option that we have knowledge that we have.

610
01:09:56,890 --> 01:10:00,100
Or we might be missing one of the three parameters that we need.

611
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:07,240
We might know about the magnitude and duration, but not how frequent the exposure occurs.

612
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:18,250
An important takeaway is that there's in almost all cases, there's more uncertainty associated with exposure modeling,

613
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:22,959
estimates of exposure within community settings versus in workplace settings.

614
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:28,780
Just because we generally have access to more information and quantified variables.

615
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:34,390
And as with all things, you know, the quality of the output,

616
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:42,090
the resulting exposure assessment is very much related to the quality of the input that goes into it.

617
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:45,340
Right. So the is this garbage in? Garbage out.

618
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:55,450
Back to talking a little bit about the prospective exposure model, right.

619
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:58,490
So in this case, it's designed to assess something in the future.

620
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:12,540
What is proposed or various scenarios there generally based on possible scenarios that we have some information on that describe, you know,

621
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:23,540
maybe emissions sources or different activities and they reflect a range of conditions, usually going from worst case to best case.

622
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:29,510
Right. So we're able to kind of what those exposures might be prospectively.

623
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:33,560
These are often required to obtain.

624
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:40,640
I'll look at construction or an operating permit from a government agency further at the state level or a federal level.

625
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:47,690
And it's both exposure and risk assessment also might consider equity aspects.

626
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:55,790
So issues around environmental justice and fortunately, these are much more common now than they have been historically.

627
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:10,700
For that perspective, again, forward looking, future estimates of exposure modeling the steps, generally speaking,

628
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:18,920
would be a scoping analysis, just kind of defining the boundaries of the issue or the problem, developing a scenario.

629
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:28,210
Right. So what are the chain of events that might lead to exposure developing exposure assumptions?

630
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:37,190
Right. All of the models require us to make assumptions as part of the input into it and then really importantly, doing an uncertainty analysis.

631
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:47,000
So we come up with a result. It's a quantified number, but how confident are we in that results in being able to put a balance on our confidence,

632
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,600
see what uncertainty analysis is very, very valuable.

633
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:59,230
So with regard to uncertainty, it's a defining characteristic of exposure.

634
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:09,070
In order for an exposure assessment to have any value, it needs to have an understanding of the uncertainty associated with that.

635
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:14,800
So there are two different elements to consider here. One is variability.

636
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:20,470
So we talked about all of those variables and the key things that change over time.

637
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:24,730
Things that change over space are differences between people.

638
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:30,940
There's also an element of this is truly just lack of knowledge.

639
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:40,930
So we might simply poorly understand or poorly measure various conditions or variables in this process.

640
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:48,430
And we're we're there's often a challenge. We don't want to miss real exposures.

641
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:55,180
But at the same time, we don't want to waste like just tons of resources trying to capture anything.

642
01:13:55,180 --> 01:14:00,760
And everything simply wasn't right or even in the hands of exposures that don't exist.

643
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:06,880
So trying to find a sweet spot within the team is really challenging.

644
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:16,420
Modeling approaches are driven and limited by the uncertainty.

645
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:24,990
Right. And it's also often an iterative process with tradeoffs, again.

646
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:36,040
Or we might have to settle for poorer quality to actually get a result, some important distinctions.

647
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:41,870
So we have these phrases that we use that might be confounded or not.

648
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:48,190
And so just to clarify what we mean, uncertainty versus when we mean variability.

649
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:58,840
So uncertainty is indicative or represents our lack of knowledge about factors that are affecting the exposure.

650
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:12,930
And it can lead to inaccurate or biased exposure estimates or variability which which again adds spread to our data or our estimate.

651
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:22,260
It actually arises from true heterogeneity that exists, whether it's across people, across a space or across time.

652
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:29,550
So it can also affect the precision of our estimates or how generalizable our results are.

653
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:34,270
And then, you know, an approach to estimating uncertainty.

654
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:39,760
One of them is through a probabilistic analysis such as a monte Carlo analysis,

655
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:49,210
which can account for uncertainty in select parameters as we evaluate the range and probability of various plausible exposures.

656
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,000
That is the end of the material.

657
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:59,540
3 minutes early. Wow. That doesn't happen very often.

658
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:11,120
You folks have any questions? And again, about today's material, about the proposal, assignment meeting.

659
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:18,110
And also, as a reminder, please make sure you gain access and your real questions about anything at all.

660
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:30,290
All right. So with that, I want to wish you a restful recovery and build all break.

661
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:36,440
And you can look forward to not having to see me for an entire week because all.
