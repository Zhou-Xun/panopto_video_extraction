1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:21,410
I know. But they also say something like this, by the way.

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:31,700
Well, you know what they say about the country's financial crisis.

3
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:57,120
All right. So we're going to start out with you after after two summations, essentially all one word about we start with starting from the tax policy.

4
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,720
Toward the end, we produced the definition of a roundabout. So starting from today, over and over, so run a variable,

5
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:16,590
have different transformations and different statistics for roundabouts through the course of this course.

6
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:26,140
So we're going to cover the following topics distributions of functions of a random variable expected values,

7
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,310
moments, moment, generating functions and differentiating on the growth side.

8
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,580
So the differentiation and our integral side are going to be separating materials.

9
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:48,450
Now we do later review the material. Most of that material are going to be review materials from Talbots or multivariate counters,

10
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:58,410
but won't have time to go over that because we'll focus on this fact about in a moment the distribution of functions.

11
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,460
All right. All right.

12
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:10,550
So to start with, can anyone tell me what is the definition of a random variable result?

13
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:22,110
What is a random variable? That's something that we should always keep in mind or talk about.

14
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,420
Function. What is a random variable? Anyone?

15
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,830
It's a specific function from our sample space to our event.

16
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,970
So it's a function, right? It's a mapping from the sample space to the real space.

17
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,290
That's what a random variable is. We talk about a random number.

18
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:53,550
Always think about the random. Our like the map is a relative function maps the original sample space to the real space.

19
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,129
So because it's a map and we can define probability for this right.

20
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,130
Available based on our original probability space.

21
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,760
Right. So that's right.

22
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,830
About now let's take a look at the function of a random variable is args is around a

23
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:23,520
normal Benji of x which is a function of this random variable is also a random variable.

24
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:36,329
Okay. And if I didn't define this y another notation to be equal to this g max, then we can also define probability for this new random variable.

25
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:44,670
By using this relation, the probability of Y below or outside a is equal to the probability of g.

26
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,480
All that belongs to this same barrel sign.

27
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:56,340
And the reason why this transformation, any transformation or any function of the random variable is a still running variable.

28
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,629
Again, it goes back to the definition recall. This is a random variable.

29
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,230
What it means is that it's a mapping from the original sample space.

30
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:14,520
So the real space right here, you have another function, G, that maps the real space to the real space.

31
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:23,760
Now you can composite this to it's still going to be a function that maps the original sample space elements.

32
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,640
So that's why this job is still up in the air.

33
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:36,870
So maybe this post asks us to satisfy these appropriate conditions.

34
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:43,010
You can verify that this shell bags also satisfy all of the foundations so that it becomes a house.

35
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:53,220
But graphically, this is what was really happened. A by a transformation on the random way is essentially just having another transformation,

36
00:04:53,640 --> 00:05:01,799
having another function always oh when we are doing here is just compiles it is to make a new wrapper and

37
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:13,440
we denoted by something some some new using some new notation generated by Y that becomes a new available.

38
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:23,040
And as we said, this probability is defined in this way.

39
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:30,689
The probability of live animals that can be always defined as the probability of g of acts belongs to the same sex.

40
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:38,630
That's by definition. And what this means that belongs to a is essentially the same as AX belongs to this to Emerson.

41
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:48,270
But since G is a function from the real face to the real space, you can also define the inverse function as g inverse.

42
00:05:52,020 --> 00:06:00,750
Once you have this inverse function, you can properly define what it means to map somewhere else that a in this space,

43
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:09,490
in this real space, two of these are not set. So they must pay back to this university.

44
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,290
And we know what this is. Right. Well, the probability of access belongs to us, said the university.

45
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:23,600
It spells out for us that in the real space for any acts, go to this the university.

46
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:39,310
Essentially what it means is the probability of all the sample funds such that this tax of Omega is in this the inverse, right?

47
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,270
That's the original definition.

48
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:53,450
And so now we can also define probability for this transformed right of arable that defines the probability distribution of what?

49
00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:06,070
So you can go back to the previous lecture notes and verify that every single control, ICM or this new probability distribution also holds.

50
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:15,820
So it can be proved that this is indeed a random variable and indeed a valid probability distribution.

51
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,740
But the focus of this part is going to be.

52
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:28,270
Now we know with the transformation, with some function, we can define the new random using the original variable.

53
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,890
And the focus is going to be if we know the distribution for the original random variable X and we

54
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,770
very quickly very easily derived the distribution for the transformation of a random variable,

55
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,570
that's going to be the focus of what's what's coming next.

56
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,540
Okay. And that's a very frequently asked questions in practice.

57
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:59,110
So you may find something to be more maneuverable in the first place, but eventually you find something else,

58
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:05,469
some transformation of that origin around about what is actually way more interesting than how you

59
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:11,110
quickly got the distribution for this information not provided model from the distribution of the origin.

60
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,930
But that's what are we going to focus on?

61
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,910
And recall that far to the right of our global distribution can be fully characterized by CDC or PMI for PTA.

62
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:32,740
So that is to say what we're trying to do is given and that's CDF or PTA, PMA of Acts.

63
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:38,180
How do we derive the CDF or PTA piano part of that?

64
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,720
So that's our focus. They are to drive it.

65
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,490
Let's discuss different scenarios first.

66
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,450
Consider the case where both of our bodies are desperate.

67
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:06,070
And so far, at this point out of our eyeballs, we know we have characterized the distribution using CDV or Kianna and for piano.

68
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:12,840
Essentially it's just the point mass. The probability of each sample pulling even with the right amount.

69
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,960
As long as we know the PM, we know everything about the distribution.

70
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:30,720
Right, about. So given the distribution, given the piano for X, how do we derive our Y, which is a transformation of X?

71
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:41,010
So that's our question. If I think about this derivation of the piano, what do we need to know?

72
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:49,230
What is the probability of this new random variable taking every possible value, as I as we know that we know the piano.

73
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,780
All right. That's how the map is defined.

74
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:05,730
So in other words, what we are trying to find is the piano, which is denoted by this small F function,

75
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:15,150
subscript Y, indicating this is a piano or roundabout or a line of small line evaluated at this small.

76
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:27,270
This is where we are after course define as the probability of this savannah variable y taking variable small that is greater on arrival.

77
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:47,250
And from the previous notation we know what y equal to small y means is the same as the probability of x taking value from this inverse of y.

78
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,370
So that's how we define the probability by this new roundabout of a lot.

79
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:02,060
Essentially using the original real space for the roundabout acts.

80
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:12,950
How we define a probability for y sequel to this quantity x belongs to the st inverse block says X is also at this

81
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:21,680
free right available so it can be read and rewritten as a summation of all possible x belongs to this g inverse y.

82
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:37,750
The PMA of X embodiment of this expatriate writer's.

83
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:46,959
And since we know this pump function for ice, all we need to do is to decide what this g imus y,

84
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,780
his or each y and then sum up all this pmt values for x,

85
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:04,030
and then we can gather the PMA for y and this small y against this is for every y in real space.

86
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:10,779
And of course, since it's at this point available, we now are going to look at every single number on the real space.

87
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:17,290
We're only going to look at the most finite contemplate finite or infinite amount of.

88
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:31,060
Bodies in the space and all the other bodies will have to have been going back to these is at most.

89
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,250
So this is a generic abbreviation for the PMO.

90
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:52,320
But why? If we know how X and Y are both described, we can always follow this logic.

91
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,920
Follow this definition to derive the PMI for Y.

92
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,000
Given that the map for X, this is a generic formula. All right.

93
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:12,260
Any questions so far? Only we to also derive the PM of the City of or Y at any small value.

94
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:22,180
Y you call that the PM of the city of is defined as the probability of y last or equal to one right,

95
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:33,290
and that equal to the probability of x balanced two or three inverse active infinity to this small one.

96
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:42,110
And that is the summation of all qualified acts in this set.

97
00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:02,980
Again, this is a bit sad, but you can also at most contemplate.

98
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:17,080
Either drive the PM out or drive the city of the order to fully control the distribution for this new roundabout.

99
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:27,680
Boy and everything that I'm writing here is just following the definition of how we define this original amount of Marvel and this transformer.

100
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:40,410
So this is a generic, generic formula for the CDP and transform roundabouts if there are discrete questions.

101
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,490
All right.

102
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:54,570
So with this generic formula, we are we can already try some examples that say how to derive the PDF or pump our city out of the transport roundabout.

103
00:14:54,590 --> 00:15:02,750
For example, let's look at this. In this case, suppose accent is a random variable phone of binomial distribution with parameters unknown.

104
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:09,410
So we will talk a little bit more about what binomial distribution is and subsequent actions.

105
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:27,680
Our final point to know is, is a distribution and a means is the number of successes in an independent trials.

106
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:39,810
And each trial as the success rate of people.

107
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,870
These are the few parameters define defining this binomial distribution.

108
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:53,280
It acts represent a number of successes in independent trials where each trial has success.

109
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:59,610
P. Then this as follows a distribution and that distribution is called a binomial distribution.

110
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,050
And for that particular distribution, the p that PMR is defined in this way.

111
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:18,240
Actually, you can, you can calculate this PMR based on this definition, if you have acts, is the number of successes in trials.

112
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:23,970
But each trial has some known for any smaller number or any number acts.

113
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:33,120
First of all, the range or the possible variable is one zero 1 to 3 all the way to small,

114
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,580
because that's the most number of successes that I can got and trials, right?

115
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,810
And if I had taken these values,

116
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:54,900
the probability of this run available equal to this small X as entries x those many different ways to define your acts successive times.

117
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,640
Peace of the power of acts times one, minus the minus x.

118
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:06,360
So that's the probability for this random variable taking this very small X.

119
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,370
So that's not the point of all the random violence.

120
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:21,210
Okay. Now the question is, if we define Y to be a minus X, what is the PMO or CDF?

121
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:27,480
Why would we want to, you know, output? What is the distribution for this transform roundabout?

122
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:38,270
Is the question clear? So we know the original random variable has following a binomial distribution which has a piano in this followed the.

123
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:45,480
Now we define that transformation of our in a roundabout event variable Y equal to this small minus x.

124
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:51,090
The question is what is the distribution for this new random variable?

125
00:17:53,320 --> 00:18:04,740
Right. So I'll give you 2 minutes. So using this generic formula, try to derive what this $1 distribution pays for this new round of our most.

126
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:07,500
In the end, you may want to write explicitly, write down explicitly what the transformation is, what a functional form of operation has.

127
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:29,810
I was going to need that inverse transformation. That.

128
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:59,380
And we got it first hand first.

129
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:06,050
So let's define what the transformation is. Right. This new round of a Y is defined as a minus x.

130
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:10,429
That is to say Mr. T y or to JL barracks.

131
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,520
And let's see how that is essentially minus X.

132
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:20,210
That's the transformation. Right. This equation essentially gave you the transformation function.

133
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,740
So G is equal to M minus X. That's a linear function.

134
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:34,970
And once we have that, we can use the formula that we just derived to kind of for y equal to any value.

135
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:47,570
But says ax is this great? Only taking this with 012 all the way to n y is also this is why is that linear transformation of x.

136
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:58,000
So what are there possible that a y. What are the possible ideas for this new roundabout?

137
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:04,150
What is the same as X?

138
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,390
I cannot take anyone in that's negative and cannot take anybody that's greater than him.

139
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,000
So that's the first thing that I need to decide.

140
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:26,610
A wrench or later on, as we introduce the support for this transport random variable, which is zero two and this implies one integers, right.

141
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:36,370
For anybody outside this range. We don't need to calculate the piano we know directly about a the PM is going to be equal to zero.

142
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:45,280
All we need to do is to calculate the point of all this neuron variable and these values and plus one values.

143
00:21:46,450 --> 00:22:00,080
So for any white or any value in this in this set, the piano y by definition is the probability of this capital y equal to small but.

144
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,330
We now need to use this transformation.

145
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:22,150
It's equal to the parents, equal to or belong to whatever notation they want to use this g inverse model that says we know this to minus x.

146
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:30,070
What is the inverse equal to her minus x?

147
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,570
That's the functional form plus g. Inverse y.

148
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,570
What's the inverse? Functional black and white and minus y.

149
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,560
Right. That's how you calculate the human function.

150
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,850
So this is something that sounds familiar to you.

151
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,140
Make sure that you go back and do your calculus to make sure.

152
00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:00,730
Since we're going to need this inverse function a lot. So this is an easy case where you just have a leaner function.

153
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:06,580
They are going to deal with more complicated case where we still need to calculate the inverse function.

154
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,810
So now we have this image form. We can just plug it in.

155
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,440
So that becomes the probability of X in this case.

156
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:22,180
That's that only contain one element. So roughly equal to N minus one.

157
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,640
And this random variable has taken value and minus one.

158
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,879
And what is the probability of that? Oh, that's the pump that we need to use right now.

159
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,320
It's just the piano that's evaluated this way.

160
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:47,220
And all we need to do is to plug in this value and might apply to the PMS function,

161
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:58,350
which gave us and shows why we need to the minus y one minus P to the minus and minus Y.

162
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,070
Okay. And they can simplify it. All right.

163
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:15,330
And chosen minus one is the same as interest Y, and this is one minus P to the power of Y times p to the power of a minus persistence.

164
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:30,450
And this formula is the piano for this transform run of our line or any Y close to zero one all the way through it.

165
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:43,680
And now give us a pump on this transport roundabout again directly from this generic formula are basically roundabout of you all got it correct.

166
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,150
Take a look at this pump for this roundabout of a light.

167
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:56,190
One thing that we notice that that is that is very similar to the pump of the original of the original roundabout.

168
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:07,650
And all that different is we switch the position of this one minus P right in our original key and I forgot about the notation that we use.

169
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,740
We can use X or Y or Z, whatever.

170
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:16,230
That's that doesn't matter. What really matters is this a function of form.

171
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:23,450
So as you can see, if you switch out of this one minus P in the original key, I'm not exactly clear this new.

172
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:33,810
So what that means is this new roundabout of a y also follows a binomial distribution with parameter n and a one minus p,

173
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:40,620
and now you replace the original parameter P with this my one minus p.

174
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:52,860
So this is what what this tells us is y also follows the binomial distribution with parameter and one minus P and in fact that is,

175
00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:01,800
that makes perfect sense because if we find the new random variable to be M minus X because actually what that means, what this new roundabout means.

176
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,890
Let's say that again. It's very good.

177
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:16,190
The number of failures it acts is a number of successes and trials.

178
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:20,240
The mine is going to be the number of failures in trials.

179
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,660
And what's the failure rate? Success rate is paid, in your opinion?

180
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,510
It must be. Why? Must be. So now everything makes sense, right?

181
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:37,040
That's why this new random variable life is a binomial distribution with trials.

182
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:48,200
And each time you have a event rate of one minus that's capturing the theory that are the number of meetings and trials.

183
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,990
So that's why we have this distribution and any question.

184
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,730
Okay. So that's the discrete case.

185
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:11,820
Relatively speaking, this case is easier since we only have finite R and most of a number of features or values to to worry about.

186
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,140
But for continuous case, things can be slightly more complicated.

187
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:21,120
Since now, we can not just simply add up those probabilities,

188
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:31,650
but rather we need to use integration and be very careful about the intervals where we want to integrate with our original PDA.

189
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:38,790
So let's consider the case where both X and Y they are continuous and y is equal to this g of x.

190
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:52,229
The question is how do we derive the CDF of this new roundabout of a line of a continuous right about all the CDF?

191
00:27:52,230 --> 00:28:00,780
Maybe more handy than the PDA, because PDA later on we will say that there are special cases where sometimes PDA,

192
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:06,510
we can have explicit formulas popping up, but most often we do not have explicit photos.

193
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,860
A city of is always well defined and the property is fine.

194
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:20,700
If we want to characterize the distribution of this transport roundabout of a lot the city of this how

195
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:28,590
to have a y value out of this small value of what is defined as the probability of this new variable.

196
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,790
Last I told you this small value y. That's the definition.

197
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,670
And again,

198
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:50,070
by definition of how this transformation is established that is equal to the probability of X belongs to this inverse negative infinity to y.

199
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,240
Because we use this g function to map the real space to the real space.

200
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:07,080
If you want to map out this narrative, affinities lie to the original real space for us.

201
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:13,520
This is once you get to immerse apply to this set back to infinity to lie flat

202
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:25,830
provides close right and that is the integration of parts belongs to this set.

203
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:36,870
ABC's Got The X Factor.

204
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:47,969
The probability of this original round about the house belongs to something that is essentially the integration of the original PDF file,

205
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,270
the random available on this particular sentence.

206
00:29:52,200 --> 00:30:02,530
Recall that for Grandma. Well, this is the pdf function that.

207
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:10,630
Her. This is a city function.

208
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,329
This is a PDR functional because of the original round.

209
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:25,620
About all we know about the PDF is the CTA is defined as the area under the curve up to any particular line.

210
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:31,240
For example, this is the zero. Then the area under the curve from nothing to infinity.

211
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:43,890
Zero is essentially. The City of random variable has evaluated this as a zero, right?

212
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:56,800
And for any interval that's going to be the city of X two minus the city are evaluated as one.

213
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:08,250
So the probability of X belongs to any particular asset is can be calculated using the integration of the PDA on that particular asset.

214
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,970
All right. So everyone all clear about this.

215
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,750
So that gave us the generic formula for the city, for this surrender of our whole life.

216
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:28,540
It's just going to be the integration of the original PDF or AX on this particular set.

217
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:39,370
The inverse infinity to Y. So now you can say Now for any transformation, you don't have to calculate the CDF for the new random variable.

218
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:44,290
Really, the key is to decide what this particular set is.

219
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:49,150
The Streamer's maximum affinity to y set is.

220
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:54,460
Once we know that said, what's left is just to do this integration.

221
00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:01,990
But our original idea. So the hard part on the key part to decide what this is.

222
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,850
All right. Any question.

223
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:21,740
Okay. So let's look at an example and suppose X is a continuous right marvel uniform roundabout of all 0 to 2 pi.

224
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,900
Again, we will learn this different distribution so later on.

225
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:33,410
But for now a uniform uniform random variable means it takes it has equal chance to take anybody on this step.

226
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,740
And the PDA corresponding line is a constant.

227
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:45,290
So all of this uniform distribution, unless the 0 to 2 pi is going to be one over two pi omniscient over zero.

228
00:32:45,290 --> 00:33:01,190
Otherwise. Okay, so it is just a constant function of one over two pi from zero to pi acts as an zero everywhere else.

229
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:11,630
It doesn't really matter whether you take it, take a close to 0 to 2 pi openstack or any given point.

230
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:16,220
The probability of this taking that particular value is always zero.

231
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,880
It's a continuous right about this.

232
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,460
Is that the PDF or the original roundabout box?

233
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:31,550
Now let's define a transformation was equal to this sine square axis.

234
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:39,110
The square of this, the sinusoidal of x.

235
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,760
Then the question is what is the distribution for Y?

236
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:47,120
What is the out or CTA for Y?

237
00:33:50,080 --> 00:34:02,440
It's a question, Claire. So we have the original PDF for access and we know the transformation from x to y squared sinusoidal function.

238
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:07,150
The question is what is the distribution for y?

239
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:10,530
In particular,

240
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:21,900
we can calculate what is a severe plus as a cumulative distribution function by using the generic formula that we just gave in the previous slide.

241
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:30,240
I'll give you 3 minutes and you can take the first shot and see whether you can.

242
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,530
God. What? The city is on this new round of arrivals.

243
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:48,650
Again. The end is exclusively right out what this transformation function is and work out what the inverse function is and start.

244
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:52,050
What? Squeeze.

245
00:35:57,700 --> 00:37:05,350
She made, meanwhile. It's very.

246
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:39,380
All right. You got it. Got him there.

247
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:53,090
Okay, so let's coverage together. So, Your Honor, to have the CDF or this new around of line so we can bring it down into several steps.

248
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:59,120
All right. First of all, as I said, we need to explicitly write out what this transformation function is.

249
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:07,230
In other words, what is its function? So Jacks, as defined, is equal to this sun squared ax.

250
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:15,680
And I would always recommend that he would draw the function. You can just get a sketch of the function so you know what you are working with.

251
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:25,110
Okay, so the sign square function, if you draw the sine function on this 0 to 2 pi interval, it's going to be a sinusoidal curve, right?

252
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:33,530
Start from 0 to 1, zero goes negative one and then return back to zero, which is a blue curve.

253
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,910
That's a sign curve. If you take the square, that's the right curve.

254
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,690
It all also start a zero, go to one.

255
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:45,290
But at every point between zero and one is always lower.

256
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:49,190
So you are taking the square of a value that's less than one, right?

257
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:53,340
And also it doesn't for the second half.

258
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,720
It also repeat the same pattern with the first half.

259
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:02,240
So this right, that slide is the sine squared curve.

260
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:06,840
So that's the transformation function that was X.

261
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:17,010
And now we need to work out what is the ranch or what is a support, what is the possible values for this new round above the line.

262
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:24,800
We know X takes the uniform distribution from 0 to 2 pi and takes anybody from 0 to 2 pi.

263
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:28,640
What about a lot after this sine square transformation?

264
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:35,820
What about if that's a line? Anyone.

265
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,920
0202121021.

266
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:56,320
Right. So that's the motive for why any kind of writing in as that close that door opens, that doesn't really matter since its contents might have.

267
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:05,210
To be rigorous since we are taking OpenStack for answer.

268
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:10,330
That means we do not at this point, right?

269
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:14,620
We do not have this 2.0 since we still have PI.

270
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:18,380
So it's going to be a close that has to be rigorous.

271
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:23,000
So this is the range for the new round. The light,

272
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:35,830
the was all we need to care about is anybody with a small line in this branch because for any small light less than zero was a city outside we.

273
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,740
What's the city? Why or why?

274
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:49,460
What's the probability of this? Have to lie.

275
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:55,040
Take him out of the last article to this small one, which is a, you know.

276
00:41:55,610 --> 00:42:01,350
Oh, is there. All right. That's how we define a probability on how we define the cumulative probability.

277
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:06,590
What about y greater than one? One is always one, right?

278
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:14,420
So those are the simple case. Once we decide the wrench or the support for this new about them.

279
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:19,580
Now all we need to care about is anybody y from 0 to 1.

280
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:24,740
And that's what we need to work out. But you all have to work out that formula.

281
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:29,180
We go with the generic function and we need to define.

282
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:38,310
We need to first calculate the inverse function for this transformation, since g is defined as sine square heights.

283
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:45,550
What is g in response? Yes.

284
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,990
Sign inverse sine of square root of a square one.

285
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:54,070
So Emerson is an outside, right?

286
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:59,590
So that applies to square root of one.

287
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:06,610
Okay. So that is the inverse function, but.

288
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:14,980
We need to be careful when we define the humorous function, since this is not a monitoring function.

289
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:20,110
Right. These are regional transformation is not a monotone function.

290
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,230
So when we define this, the inverse function,

291
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:30,670
we need to separate this into different pieces and define the inverse function for each pieces separately.

292
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:34,270
In particular, this formula, Anson Square went out.

293
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:48,490
What is well defined on this, um, is from zero to half pi.

294
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:58,990
Right. If we take value from 0 to 1, then the outside always take value from 0 to 5 over two.

295
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:05,990
That's. Another caller.

296
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,750
So this part is essentially what this inverse function is representing.

297
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:32,460
Okay. It only maps this 0 to 1 back to this x value on this is zero to pi over two using this hard sine function.

298
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:43,410
If you want to go to the other parts, then you have to do additional radar transformation from this outside function.

299
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:50,310
So this only applies to this only applies to this a zero to pi over two.

300
00:44:52,140 --> 00:45:00,420
So now we have this j inverse function. Are these the team or function on the on the subset of the of the interval.

301
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:14,549
Now we can use the all reasonable formula to calculate this f y of what the city of Y, which is the integration of ice, belongs to this j Imus.

302
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:35,120
Y to Imus. Immigration at the last two numbers applies to 0 to 1.

303
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:41,560
Here I think it remains zero to why? Because we know why does not take by anybody.

304
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:48,310
This run of our boat does not take any narrative. So the lowest value is zero.

305
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:53,570
And the integration of this affects you mathematics.

306
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:58,390
Now we need to decide what is this the inverse?

307
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:04,570
The zero two line means. So again, let's now go back to this are in our favor.

308
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:21,960
If you have y value here. What we are trying to find is the acceleration such that g of acts is last or equal to Y.

309
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:33,840
So that region corresponding to where this horizontal line crosses is in part because the right curve is our geox function.

310
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:38,640
Right? So this interval.

311
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:50,820
This interval. This interval and this in about this for intervals.

312
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:02,770
Comprise the said estate emerged zero.

313
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:09,460
Why? All right.

314
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:16,639
And that is really because any given writer why Mr. Emerson zero two why is essentially all

315
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:23,440
of the accidents such that tailbacks and other were assigned square is alas or equal to why.

316
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:32,290
So based on this finger we know these or intervals corresponds to all of the acts by such that g of x as the last one.

317
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,720
So that is the interval that we are interested in now.

318
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,930
The rest is to really figure out what takes place.

319
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:49,600
An expression for this, for animals. Okay, so I'll give you another one minute to write out these four animals.

320
00:48:26,700 --> 00:49:07,180
It's. All right.

321
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:14,950
So I hope you all got it. So these four intervals now, I actually need this function form.

322
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:21,090
All right. So these first value is zero to the sign.

323
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:25,620
Evaluate a square root of Y. And so that's the first thing.

324
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,860
And the second one. And the third one. They're actually connected.

325
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:39,560
So they can be combined. And these breaking points are pi minus oxides, carbon a Y and the next Y is high.

326
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:46,690
Plus, they are just on a one. And the last breaking point is two pi minus our sign of one.

327
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:57,430
And the last is two. So these are the four intervals where acts at their finest function as valuable as a equipment.

328
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:02,170
And so I hope you all got it. Again, this is from calculus.

329
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,300
So now that's taking it back to the formula.

330
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:13,420
So all we need to do is to integrate this area for X out of this.

331
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:25,410
So the PDR fallbacks is a constant function. So that means it's essentially the integration is just adding up this interval length.

332
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:37,990
And multiply by this one over two pi that give us one over two pi times the summation of the summation of the length of this for intervals.

333
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:43,790
Which is. Four times.

334
00:50:44,490 --> 00:51:03,030
Our son wants us to overbuy on apartment one and that is the city of or any Y value between zero and 101.

335
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:12,200
Not complete this problem and any question. All right.

336
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:48,070
So let's take a break and come back at two, one, one, two, three, four.

337
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:58,160
Let's take a look.

338
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:19,210
So what does that mean?

339
00:52:24,500 --> 00:53:16,670
You know, this is going to happen because it's going to be different from what you're telling people around the country.

340
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:53,300
You call on Capitol Hill to get information if you want, even you like it.

341
00:53:54,730 --> 00:54:15,830
That's fine. We just have to show how you can do that.

342
00:54:16,790 --> 00:55:11,450
Do you think the last time I looked so long that someone on your show was

343
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:39,590
actually said she was excited to see that we were able to deal with it tonight?

344
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:52,790
We don't want to be alone. You know, you have jumped on board.

345
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:06,750
I'm just not.

346
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:20,800
Obviously just down the hall.

347
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:56,110
I don't know how much time, but I love you.

348
00:56:56,110 --> 00:57:00,670
But you can't push it down. Quiet doesn't always go this one.

349
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:05,810
But you can't you just.

350
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:16,160
How much I.

351
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:43,750
I don't know what he's doing.

352
00:57:49,850 --> 00:58:33,820
It piece tell me that you believe that you would want him to help us.

353
00:58:35,530 --> 00:59:24,910
So we are, you know, just about to we have to get to Washington if you want to see what needs to be able to accomplish.

354
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:41,610
I told you about the huge numbers coming out of the White House.

355
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,870
So let's resume any question about this example.

356
00:59:54,180 --> 01:00:03,520
So I hope this example shows you the the thinking process that can be used to solve this type of problem,

357
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:07,420
essentially how you can break down this problem into several steps.

358
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:16,090
You need to first decide what is the rent or what is the possible value of this new round of our already the very first set,

359
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:22,840
because that helps us reduce the sense that we need to focus.

360
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:30,170
And that's why only takes about it from 0 to 1. We don't have to worry about anybody that outside this sense.

361
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:32,560
So that's really the first step.

362
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:41,320
And then we need to work out the function of this transformation and finally following this generic formula to derive the key out of the available.

363
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:51,550
And in that part, the most difficult one and the most essential step is to decide what is the set of the C inverse infinitive.

364
01:00:51,550 --> 01:01:01,330
The Y and the figure may help and may help you identify which particular set of x corresponds to that g.

365
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:04,720
Inverse zero to y are not doing anything wrong.

366
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:10,510
So those are the steps that you can take to the type of this type of problem.

367
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,810
All right. So a couple of agreements.

368
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:23,380
So when the transformations are made, it's important to keep track of the sample space of the new round of arrivals.

369
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:27,700
And that is why do we call? Because the support of the distribution.

370
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:34,340
Particular we can define the support of of their original random variable args to be.

371
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:45,620
We use a notation of this kind of graph acts to denote the support of the original random

372
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:57,140
variable which is defined to be all the x values such that this PDA or PMA is greater than zero.

373
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:11,640
So that's how we define support for our rent of our our distribution to all possible lives where this PDF or HTML.

374
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:21,850
Is greater than zero or pm up or this great roundabout of all.

375
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:28,860
What that means is all possible that it is part of this random variable which has that known zero probability.

376
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:35,430
Okay. And for continuous rhinovirus that just means all possible.

377
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,280
The range of that is where is this rhinovirus opposite?

378
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:45,180
Because it doesn't really make sense to talk about the probability of the random variable taking out in particular about it.

379
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:52,620
It's always zero, but it makes sense to talk about this that branch of this random variable that is continuous.

380
01:02:53,430 --> 01:03:00,360
So that's it. That's the definition for the support of event available or the support of a distribution.

381
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:17,730
Before this transform around unbearable. We can help. We can also also define and support, but in a slightly different way.

382
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:25,320
This is for the transforming right of our whole. We don't know that PDF or PMI or city app yet.

383
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:31,500
Right. Just given the transformation, we do not directly know the PDF or we need to derive it.

384
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:38,580
But we want to know this support beforehand, to support even before we derive those PDF our CDO.

385
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:44,820
So we define the support side a differently or this transform right available.

386
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:48,540
That is all the value wise such that.

387
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:58,180
My call to a job asks for some acts and this kind of group acts.

388
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:04,720
In other words, or any acts in the original support.

389
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:18,070
If you take this transformation of X, then you have about a Y and a collection of those values as part of the support of this transport roundabout.

390
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:20,890
All right.

391
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:29,230
There is a subtle difference between the original definition of a support for a run, a variable, and the support for this transport roundabout.

392
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:34,660
Because there is no guarantee that, especially for a continuous running variable,

393
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:40,330
there is no guarantee that these the prime elements that will always be positive.

394
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:45,100
Maybe some reason it's going to be zero, but that's okay.

395
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:54,060
We allow those scenarios. We just simplify the definition and use in this definition.

396
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:58,450
Essentially, we know all possible side of this new random variable.

397
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:08,620
Even without the drive speeding up our plan. All we need to know is the original support and this transformation function with those two components.

398
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:20,770
We can simply center right out support for the transport running variable line and this applies to both PDF and PM or any non-active function.

399
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:33,280
Any question. So previously we have seen the two scenarios one for the discrete case,

400
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:41,070
one for the continuous case how to derive the generated formula for the CDF of a transport random variable.

401
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:46,270
Now let's consider some special case where we can have a shortcut.

402
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:53,230
In particular, if the transformation is monotone and the job ads is monotone,

403
01:05:54,190 --> 01:06:00,730
then we can actually simplify that derivation and get a much more simpler,

404
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:14,049
much simpler formula for the PD out cdf pm at this j r t max is monotone and the transformation is immanent.

405
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:15,640
If the transformation is monotone,

406
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:26,560
they must be a 1 to 1 mapping and also on to mapping from this to from this support of the original line of our eyes.

407
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:29,980
So the new support for this random variable.

408
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:40,930
So what it means to be a 1 to 1 is that everywhere it acts, there is always a single ladder in one.

409
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:13,350
So 1 to 1 means everyone mean in this part of why there's always one x maps to it and every x only maps to a single one.

410
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:26,440
Okay. So that's one, two, one. So each Y at most one X is mapped to that one.

411
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:31,640
So maybe there are some additional line that has no mapping to it.

412
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:39,889
That's that's fine. But that's a 1 to 1 or is why I look at most one acts as a map to that one and

413
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:50,630
island two means everyone has a marianas and or maybe multiple maps to the same Y.

414
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:59,120
But in the end, all the y's in this category y as our original image is not.

415
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:04,250
So that's on to mapping and a g of acts is a monotone.

416
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:15,170
Then we can guarantee that with this job, x is not a 1 to 1 and onto mapping from the original samples,

417
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,920
from the original support acts to this new subpart line.

418
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:28,930
So we're not saying that this monotone transformation going to be a 1 to 1 mapping from real space to real space,

419
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:34,690
but just from one support to another. Support if this moment.

420
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:48,690
And when it's monotone, then the transformation as you learn in countless amount of time function has many nice properties alone.

421
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:52,700
Then you can define this humerus function to be a single matter of function.

422
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:58,550
And for another, this transformation uniquely pairs x and y.

423
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:02,920
At. You got a one line bottom o each y value.

424
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:08,210
Again, if you need x, y, and then there is a 1 to 1 mapping.

425
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:15,140
So this is that I go about this a in unnecessary for this transformation function.

426
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:19,190
So this team or function is always well defined.

427
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:33,709
The team are why you've called and asked if and only why quantity of x this is the property of the monitoring function and it is monitoring.

428
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:39,110
They can be either monitoring monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing.

429
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:49,250
Either way, it's a momentum function and if we have a management transformation, Y is simplify our derivation.

430
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:55,570
So here is a sketch of a line that's the case. Assume that you have a monotone increasing function.

431
01:09:56,150 --> 01:10:05,750
Okay. I think this is this is a g of x and you have this monotone increasing function.

432
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:24,000
What that means is if you have two modules x one and x two where x one is less, are equal to x two,

433
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:37,590
then the corresponding y one, which is equal to job x one and y two, which is the quantity of x two as the same rank x one.

434
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:47,040
That's how it starts to. You can imply that y one is less or equal to y two.

435
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:51,990
So that's what models of increasing means. All right.

436
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:57,659
Now, think about that. The the definition of studio of is transform, right.

437
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:05,610
About what we are after is the. That's not right for anyone.

438
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:10,740
What is the expression for the city of why divided without this fighting?

439
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:15,810
And that is the probability of y plus or equal to Y.

440
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:22,080
Now, what can we do? What can we infer from this this probability?

441
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:30,450
If you are right, a memorable line as the last aren't quite sure why name is your g of x is the last inequality of this very y.

442
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:34,530
And from this moment of increase in function, what that means is that.

443
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:39,680
Your house must be large or equal to achieve numbers.

444
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:45,880
But. Right.

445
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:52,420
Because it's is a monitor function. It's a 1 to 1 arm to mapping from X to Y.

446
01:11:53,110 --> 01:12:06,300
So, she adds, that's all equal to why not directly translates to x one of our last article, which you have to immerse for any y value.

447
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:16,180
You have to y last. How much of this by value is directly translated into that axiomatic last article to this small asthmatic?

448
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:21,730
There's a 1 to 1 transformation. And what is this quantity?

449
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:32,160
What's the probability of the original run available?

450
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:54,030
That's how I got to this particular bank. Recall that we know everything about the x axis, our original right about what it is, what it is.

451
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:58,109
Fine. That's very good.

452
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:01,140
That's the city of the city of X.

453
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:13,950
Evaluate this about it, which is this guy right.

454
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:20,030
So just our city out of our evaluated to immerse y.

455
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:28,810
So this formula is much simpler than our previous integration domination.

456
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:37,090
And instead of doing the integration, all we need to do is to plug in the stream or slide into the original CDP for X,

457
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:49,270
and then we go and see the app a lot. All right. If your G is increasing functions and the reason is exactly in the in this graph because you can

458
01:13:52,100 --> 01:14:01,150
now the equivalent event for this it's less than or equal to align to this X plus our question.

459
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:09,370
Yes. The conclusion of having a 1 to 1 thing, I think, does it have to be strictly on its own?

460
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:16,090
Very good question. So we'll come back to that in a second.

461
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:30,740
Yeah, actually, we're going to come back to that question in the next class. All right.

462
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:38,250
So that's for the increase in function. Similarly for the decrease in function is also the same, except for a minor difference.

463
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:46,890
If you have a decrease in function, what that means is are 2x1 less or an equal to to the corresponding.

464
01:14:51,800 --> 01:15:00,360
The next one from y one is always great aftershocks to ry2 and.

465
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:22,510
Similarly, we can derive the thought in the city of a lie at any value y to be a probability, he adds.

466
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:31,090
That's what you want to smell like, which again, is equal to the probability of that.

467
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:37,600
But what is a problem if define for this?

468
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:44,080
T All acts have two acts that surround a marvel class or any quality of life.

469
01:15:49,360 --> 01:16:04,880
Is elastomer equal to or greater to? Any value arcs you can imagine here.

470
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:12,590
I know Alex is already quite you and not corresponding to a y.

471
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:16,120
Great. Quite to the corresponding to your ex.

472
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:30,169
The opposite side if you are chilled out since last night is correspondent to capital about what great I to write this great I want

473
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:43,820
you to immerse y because there's a decreasing function and what that is is one minus the probability of at last that j inverse y.

474
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:55,210
And this guy is almost equal to our senior VP of access to universal life.

475
01:16:55,460 --> 01:17:01,760
And not exactly because it began as assault last spring.

476
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:08,760
My last thought is that over the last article two, if it's the last or two of the exactly the opposite.

477
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:14,340
But since it's a strike like last night, it's not. All right.

478
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,220
So this is as far as we can get for the generic case.

479
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:26,050
Hey, if you folder I assume the runabout will have as continuous they can go through.

480
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:32,250
If you are, I assume your acts around arrival is continuous, then it doesn't really matter.

481
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:39,360
Right? It's the last or the last day or two. Because perhaps that equals in any value is always has zero probability.

482
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:47,310
So it's this continuous random variable.

483
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:53,720
Then this is equal to one minus.

484
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:58,660
I thought that's. GM or Swan.

485
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:02,800
Otherwise, it's not okay. You're very careful.

486
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:08,890
If your ax is not a continuous or random variable, you do not have this final equation.

487
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:15,760
And you have the equivalent of. To the. After the third eye is always holding the final line.

488
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:18,890
You have to have additional assumption, right?

489
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:28,450
Questions. So again, this monotone decreasing function.

490
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:36,970
We also have a much simpler formula for the city out of this transform random variable.

491
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:45,700
We do not need to do integration. All we need to do is to clock in this gym required to the original CDO.

492
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:51,730
If it's a terrorism, if it's an increase in it directly can't be because it decrease in function.

493
01:18:52,090 --> 01:18:56,140
Then we plug it in and then use one minus that quantity to get the see.

494
01:18:58,450 --> 01:19:05,560
And that actually gave us this theorem which says if Access City of Abundance of X,

495
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:16,600
y is a transformation of x and allowed this x and y axion y to be the support of the original random variable and this new round of variable.

496
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:20,380
Then we have the following two conclusions.

497
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:33,430
First three is an increase in function. And then this after a while Y is equal to the x optimized by a Y in this form.

498
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:43,000
And if she has a decrease in function and X is furthermore a continuous amount of our well

499
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:52,790
known we have based on app while y equal one minus Optimus Y or any y in this support.

500
01:19:56,270 --> 01:19:59,680
Okay. Any question.

501
01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:06,670
So this is just a summary of one. We just deriving the previous slides back.

502
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:12,879
G is, is, is a monitor of increasing or decreasing function.

503
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:19,230
We can always have this that this simplified relations between the original idea and the newest idea.

504
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:28,300
But that's the kind of example to to see how this can be used to simplify the calculation.

505
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:31,930
Assume X is a uniform distribution from 0 to 1.

506
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:39,970
We call that uniform means she has flat has constant PDA in this region.

507
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:47,500
So if it's 0 to 1, then it has this PDF equal to one from between zero and one.

508
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:51,850
And the cards money. CTA is just this function.

509
01:20:52,360 --> 01:21:01,630
All right, so Android, it's going to be starting from zero linear off to one so you and then say I one.

510
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:16,410
CD4 has now been defined y to be an active log of acts.

511
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:25,070
What is the distribution of what? So use the previous theorem.

512
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:29,450
Try to write out the key out of this new random variable y.

513
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:36,090
I'll give you 2 minutes. They see what I can write it.

514
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:39,960
If you can write it out, think about it the original way. How would you do it?

515
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:15,880
You. Just.

516
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:46,120
All right. You got it. If.

517
01:23:55,150 --> 01:23:59,470
Okay. So let's look at this together first. What is this transformation?

518
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:12,220
Is it increasing or decreasing acting transformation decreasing or increasing decreasing.

519
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:16,450
And it's decreasing on this 0 to 1 interval.

520
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:23,590
That's all that we need to care about, although it's decreasing in the entire zero to infinity.

521
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:28,170
But all we need to provide is that the support all our variable.

522
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:39,250
So the first step is to got the support of the original random variable, which is 0 to 1, and this transform right about what we should want.

523
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:45,010
What is a support of this new roundabout? Of a What is our definition?

524
01:24:50,690 --> 01:25:00,530
Zero to infinity. Very good, because if you take any acts from 0 to 1, plug it in to this negative log function.

525
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:05,270
It will have a value always from zero to infinity. Okay.

526
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,780
So this is a support for this new random variable.

527
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:16,880
And from the previous theorem we know that we can directly use this phone or since acts as a continuous random variable,

528
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:38,180
we can directly use this formula to account for this a y and that's going to be y y equal to one minus x, say inverse y or why in zero infinity.

529
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:47,090
Okay, and we know this j universe y is what if your job is not to x?

530
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:52,250
What's the humerus function? And.

531
01:25:53,750 --> 01:26:04,110
What's the function of this negative log acts? Beatrix.

532
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:11,730
Did I get you to the Apollo? To one e to the power of not to lie?

533
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:17,580
That's right. So that's the inverse function of the negative log.

534
01:26:18,930 --> 01:26:22,980
And all I need to do is to plug in this number into this formula.

535
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:29,030
Says, Why does the zero infinity? It means E to the Y is always from 0 to 1.

536
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:37,620
So we need to apply in this part of the CDF and so give us one minus E to the next.

537
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:44,700
And that is the CTA for this new roundabout, y or any Y from zero to infinity.

538
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:49,830
What about a negative value one? Why take an active value or zero?

539
01:26:50,010 --> 01:27:02,430
What's the value for the city of function? Zero because the probability of the random variable I gave last are equal to negative.

540
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:11,690
It is always zero and this actually is the CDF or a notice of distribution with parameter one, which we will learn later.

541
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:18,650
So this is using draft by using a formula. As you can say, a much simplifies the calculation.

542
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:28,460
Now we need to do is to calculate the humerus function and plug it in and properly define it based on this support.

543
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:31,040
And then we have the final solution.

544
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:40,190
Alternatively, if you want to go to the if you want if you want to use the original approach, then you have to work out the integration.

545
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:52,640
I need to integrate this quantity. I needed to integrate the CTA of the period fallbacks on the interval such that

546
01:27:53,060 --> 01:28:01,040
X takes the values where g0 max is the last or equal to any given smaller.

547
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:07,460
Essentially you will get the same solution, but apparently this way using the formula is much easier.

548
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:16,520
All right. Questions. Okay.

549
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:22,540
So if. Bias continues.

550
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:33,580
In addition to the CTA, we can also get the PDA because it is a continuous maneuverable Opiniao is essentially just a derivative of the CTA,

551
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:39,040
right, which can be differentiated by differentiating the CTA.

552
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:48,540
Recall that we have this y0y equal to acts of g inverse y.

553
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:59,230
You say it's an increase in function r one minus F of x, james y or g is a decrease in function.

554
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:04,309
So this period of the content continues, right?

555
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:09,310
No matter what is essentially just taking the derivative on both side of this equation.

556
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:20,980
And you can apply this derivative with respect to y on the right hand side of this equation, essentially it's a derivative of a positive function.

557
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:26,970
And then you've got a formula for the PDA for this right of our.

558
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:39,200
And if you do it for the other increase in function, which would be what would it cost?

559
01:29:45,740 --> 01:29:51,320
How would you take the derivative with respect to this compositing function?

560
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:11,570
Now, remember? Yes. Say they got.

561
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:20,210
We are pilots in Rome. Uh huh. The general. Very good.

562
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:25,010
All right, so we're first applying a derivative to the outside function.

563
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:29,870
This app of apps that give us the PDA of X.

564
01:30:30,590 --> 01:30:34,250
All right. Assigned to the same team as Y.

565
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:41,960
And then apply the derivative to the inside function, which is j m as y.

566
01:30:44,910 --> 01:30:52,379
Derivative with respect to y and this j function is because a go function is a

567
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:58,680
differentiable function where the different the derivative is not equal to zero.

568
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:07,469
On that particular value. You can also apply the same function theorem further right out the expression of this second derivative similarly.

569
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:11,490
But the bottom part is not to you.

570
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:19,890
What times? The second derivative.

571
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:27,750
All right. Now, as you can say, depending on where you are, whether you are change function is an increase in violence or decrease in function.

572
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:34,920
You actually got its place in form or another area of the transform random of a Y using this phone number.

573
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:47,610
And that actually gave us the next theorem, which says if AX as CDF has PDA so that Y is equal to share of X where she is a monitoring function,

574
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:53,880
it means that at some Y to be the support of this to random variables.

575
01:31:54,330 --> 01:32:02,160
And furthermore, how about this continuous and chambers has a continuous derivative on this support.

576
01:32:02,610 --> 01:32:13,319
With all of these conditions we can explicitly write out the pdf a y using this formula and what's even better than the previous slide.

577
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:21,180
They actually can unify this to integers to two to the single formula.

578
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:30,240
All the support is always going to be this acts evaluate y times the absolute value of the

579
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:39,450
derivative of this j inverse function was derivative of y anyway in the support a0 otherwise.

580
01:32:40,770 --> 01:32:49,500
And the reason why we can unify this two expression in this in this single form is really because if you think about this derivative,

581
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:58,250
right, if j is an increase in function, we know the derivative, we know the inverse function is also what increasing.

582
01:32:59,730 --> 01:33:04,320
All right. All right. Function increasing then the inverse function is also increasing.

583
01:33:04,830 --> 01:33:08,430
The derivative of increase in function is what is positive.

584
01:33:09,810 --> 01:33:13,350
So this guy is always positive.

585
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:23,040
So we do not have a negative sign from like if she is an increase in function, the inverse function is also decreasing.

586
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:26,480
A derivative is negative. Okay.

587
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:43,620
And that's why you can pair it with a negative sign to make it positive, which in turn is equivalent to just add an absolute value to this derivative.

588
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:54,210
So that's essentially the same. But this formula to unify those two results so the PDA can be expressed in this way.

589
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,250
The PD out of this neuron,

590
01:33:56,250 --> 01:34:05,250
a matter of a lot of the people that are already roundabout available evaluated on this quantity multiply the derivative of the same function.

591
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:09,540
As I mentioned, if you are if you satisfy some additional constraints,

592
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:15,600
then you can further write a write out this part using the inverse function theorem.

593
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:26,010
In other words, provided as J uh to prime.

594
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:46,820
Be my. And this derivative is essentially equal to these companies under some additional regulation.

595
01:34:47,930 --> 01:34:56,719
In particular, this derivative cannot be zero as the inverse y about it that is satisfied can replace it.

596
01:34:56,720 --> 01:35:01,350
Try to use as a human function to. All right.

597
01:35:01,350 --> 01:35:15,780
So let's now you start to look at this example and see whether we got very quickly derive the formula for this particular distribution.

598
01:35:17,370 --> 01:35:19,650
Suppose as is a common distribution,

599
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:27,240
which is another continuous run of animal with two parameter and then beta in particular, the PDR is defined in this way.

600
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:37,620
And the support is from zero to infinity. If we define Y to be one over a question is what is a PDA or y?

601
01:35:40,510 --> 01:35:51,070
All right. So we have the PDR for a continuous right about blacks and we have a white in this case is a monotonic transformation from as to why.

602
01:35:51,490 --> 01:35:54,610
Then the question is what is the PDR or why?

603
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:04,480
So let's have a trial in the cell and see whether we have the solution.

604
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:09,340
So be careful when you use this theorem.

605
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:12,790
Make sure you check all the conditions right.

606
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:23,680
Check all the conditions to derive. If all the conditions are satisfied, then you can use the theorem to derive the PDA.

607
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:28,270
Not then always go back to the definition.

608
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:36,440
Use the standard way is the definition of the CDF first and then take the derivative together PDR.

609
01:38:07,510 --> 01:39:08,090
Keep. All right.

610
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:20,830
So who can tell me? What's your first step? What is the first thing that you need to do in order to drive the bus?

611
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:30,990
That's far, far away. Are you going to support and why?

612
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:39,210
All right. That always comes first. As I argued before, you need to know your support before you actually start working on our PD.

613
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:46,140
Once you know your support, you already eliminate a lot of cases then you don't have to worry about.

614
01:39:46,650 --> 01:39:53,430
So always work on the support first. So we know that original retroviral acts take value from the zero to infinity,

615
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:59,220
and we know that the transformation is one of our acts as a amrs function.

616
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:03,300
Right? So one of our acts is a reciprocal function.

617
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:12,310
So what is a support of one? Zero to infinity.

618
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:24,640
The infinity comes to take us from zero infinity in inverted zero also goes from zero to infinity, right?

619
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:31,990
So that gives us the support of this transparent amount of our life that we need to work out the numerous functions.

620
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:38,260
We don't see how that is one of our acts. So j inverse of y is what?

621
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:49,420
One over one. All right. So now we need to go back and check all the conditions to see whether they are all satisfied.

622
01:40:49,690 --> 01:40:54,310
If they do, then we can apply this farmer directly.

623
01:40:54,700 --> 01:41:00,790
First is, gee, a monitoring function is one over a monotone function.

624
01:41:02,370 --> 01:41:06,250
Yes, it is. Right. Is it monotone increasing or decreasing?

625
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:14,890
Because, as I said, one thing that is helpful is always sketch this transformation.

626
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:21,910
All right. How have you got a clear picture of what this transformation is?

627
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:29,020
If you have us here now, you're going to have one over not following this car x approach,

628
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:33,280
the zero day approach to infinity x approach and approach infinity.

629
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:37,420
One of our approach to zero is a monotone decreasing function.

630
01:41:38,410 --> 01:41:45,850
All right. So this is this is satisfied and the support of X and Y, we already have it.

631
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:50,590
And this is how backs of X continuous.

632
01:41:54,080 --> 01:42:00,130
If you look at this PR function for us, it is a continuous function.

633
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:06,249
All right. So you can take the derivative at any X value from zero to infinity.

634
01:42:06,250 --> 01:42:15,580
So it is a continuous and smooth function indeed for anybody in the support and this is also satisfied.

635
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:25,900
And finally, inverse j inverse also has a continuous derivative, so that is satisfied.

636
01:42:26,110 --> 01:42:40,930
Now we can apply this formula to write out a PDF block which is of che inverse y times the absolute value of j invert y.

637
01:42:48,050 --> 01:43:01,070
My plan, which if you plug it in, this Jim Wyatt, this one over overboard, which gave us one over and minus one Ontario and one over.

638
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:17,110
Why? And this one is a negative one over a y times is inverse function derivative is just one over y squared.

639
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:22,570
Don't forget about this absolute value. Take it.

640
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:27,130
The right way to take the derivative is going to be exactly one over y squared

641
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:32,290
by an additional negative sign to make it a positive one over y squared.

642
01:43:33,070 --> 01:43:44,110
If you further simplify it, that gives us the final solution, which is one over a -1 to 10,

643
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:58,220
one over Y to the power out and plus one these to the negative one over any y greater zero.

644
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:05,780
So that gave us the idea for this new round of arable life.

645
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:19,820
And this PDF actually has a PDF for inverted commas distribution by arable, so it has a special name since it's useful in some other scenarios.

646
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:28,640
But all we need to know for now is this is a PDF now we can directly write out using this kind of question.

647
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:33,600
Okay.

648
01:44:33,810 --> 01:44:45,540
So now we have some the cases where if you have a minus one transformation, indeed we can give the PD out the CDP pretty easily by the right way,

649
01:44:45,550 --> 01:44:55,680
applying the right, mostly because this margin proclamation allows this one to win an automatic return to support.

650
01:44:56,850 --> 01:45:06,300
So you can directly translate the original Y last article into one small line into an equivalent event in terms of acts.

651
01:45:07,110 --> 01:45:13,980
And this are followers why this monotone transformation does not hold.

652
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:20,969
What if our transformation is slightly more complicated than a monotone transformation and not too much

653
01:45:20,970 --> 01:45:29,850
complicated then even if it's just a slightly more complicated on that than a monotone transformation,

654
01:45:30,450 --> 01:45:35,190
we can no longer directly apply those therapies. All right.

655
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:43,770
Whenever is not a monotone the true transformation, we can always fall back to our original definition.

656
01:45:44,430 --> 01:45:47,460
All of the definition helped with the video.

657
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:56,280
For example, this a squared transformation assume x is a continuous random variable.

658
01:45:56,490 --> 01:46:06,150
Y is equal to x squared. So this is a square transformation, also very common than what is a direct what is a PDA y.

659
01:46:07,290 --> 01:46:12,630
So you honored to do that. Now we know x squared looks like this.

660
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:30,940
Right. It's not a monotone transformation, although it consists of two monotone pieces, but altogether is a madonna minus transformation.

661
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:35,370
We cannot directly apply the premise there to got the pdf of.

662
01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:41,010
But we can think about the definition.

663
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:52,050
And actually it also gave us sort of a simpler formula than the generic formula in particular we know from the CDF.

664
01:46:53,190 --> 01:47:02,970
So the key out of this run America wide dividing line, a small line by definition is a probability, a line that are equal to small.

665
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:11,840
And if they replace y by this x squared, that means x squared plus or equal to is smaller.

666
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:20,440
And what does that equal to? If you have a lie here.

667
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:24,510
At Square last weekend.

668
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:41,040
A white man's ax falls into this region and that is at Square and quite an active square with a white glass article to square about why.

669
01:47:42,930 --> 01:47:50,130
And by the way, we should always think about the support first, as I mentioned.

670
01:47:50,420 --> 01:47:57,300
Right. So the support of Y is what if I say a container is right about a mile from nothing in an area entity?

671
01:47:57,630 --> 01:48:03,420
What is the support of one? The European village.

672
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:07,410
All right. This goes for anyone. Great.

673
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:10,970
I've got a zero. And now let's think about it.

674
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:14,130
What basis says Acts is a continuous reminder variable.

675
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:20,820
This screen on equal to or equal to is the same as greater than or less than.

676
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:25,350
The quantity doesn't really matter. So what this is.

677
01:48:25,530 --> 01:48:34,630
Is. The difference between two CDs.

678
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:42,330
What should be in the first promises? Square root a one.

679
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:47,910
What about the second parenthesis? That's not the square root of one.

680
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:54,660
All right. So that also gave us a sort of a simpler formula.

681
01:48:55,320 --> 01:49:02,340
It's an art form. And now, since we're really interested in this idea, what we can do is to take the derivative.

682
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:11,860
Of this Apple Watch. It is not a PDA that translates to.

683
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:33,230
The derivative of. To which you can further simplify as.

684
01:49:56,890 --> 01:49:58,460
So this is the final.
