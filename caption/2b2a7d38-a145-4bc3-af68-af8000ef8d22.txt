1
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:34,756
What about wages for the environment, health sciences?

2
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:42,706
We know we have pretty common think about the chemical agents chemicals in the environment and it's only the chemical agents.

3
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:46,936
When we talk about the biological agents, what comes to your mind?

4
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:53,666
Company of my Santeria bacteria.

5
00:00:56,926 --> 00:01:02,536
And I just. Okay. Viruses, viruses.

6
00:01:08,896 --> 00:01:19,686
So this topics like the hazards, bacterial pathogens, viral allergies in the environment, health sciences.

7
00:01:20,056 --> 00:01:23,396
It's not really a typical focused topic. Okay.

8
00:01:23,686 --> 00:01:31,996
Okay. Most of the time when we deal with chemical agents about agents, most of the time we deal with by the effects of disease, for example.

9
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:38,306
And now with the. What's going on right now is more outstanding of this.

10
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:43,616
The the the outbreaks. We started to realize.

11
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:53,526
How important the amounts paid in the in the spread of COVID 19.

12
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:59,556
What is typical example right now? We are all going to be able to talk more about this.

13
00:02:00,016 --> 00:02:04,566
Is this how the amount of therapy that's coming to cope?

14
00:02:06,346 --> 00:02:11,796
So anything we talk about. Biological agents.

15
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:18,756
We cannot separate them from the developers who think about the code.

16
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:27,336
Surely that's one of the. If we want to address it, we have to target the ratio of the brains of the environment.

17
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:41,856
So so that's also the biological is now should be when we study the environment health the biological agents should be one of the focus is no.

18
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:49,626
If you really want to control have a better management of these effects of the disease biologic agents.

19
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:59,136
Definitely the environment should be one of the focus focus area if you want to have an effective approach for that for the management just.

20
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:04,686
Now the kind of end to the end of this pandemic,

21
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:10,806
although this official announcement is that this end of the pandemic kind of towards the end of the pandemic.

22
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:19,806
So about us, about Sweden. But now we know that's in China now is still ongoing, is spread like the crazy right now.

23
00:03:19,986 --> 00:03:30,816
And that's avoidable basically. And it will still take a couple of months in China to go through this piece before it can come down.

24
00:03:30,996 --> 00:03:41,466
So but we know that this is us teach us a lot of lessons from outbreak, from the outbreak.

25
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:50,586
I want to say we're lucky, but at least we in the human history, purely pandemic.

26
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:55,906
Pandemic. We taught us a lot of lessons.

27
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:07,486
I think everyone probably think about when we think about this topic, what can we learn from these outbreaks and when we also look over the ages?

28
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:13,446
And then it's really very amazing and and what we want.

29
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:20,146
And then from this topic, we try to prevent and you can try to prevent the next events.

30
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:27,976
One of the one of the great books written by Bill Gates and the Lex and then prevent the next pandemic.

31
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:35,295
And if you haven't read that book is very much information book about pandemics.

32
00:04:35,296 --> 00:04:41,866
How can we prevent things famines that's really the the so.

33
00:04:43,786 --> 00:04:53,656
Talking about biological agents. Surely the Sars-cov2 is one of the topics that belong to the biological agents and we took the

34
00:04:53,656 --> 00:05:00,856
very best long jump in the environment health impact from COVID health and how can we manage it?

35
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:08,566
Okay, how can you? So there's some different ones us people are using.

36
00:05:08,806 --> 00:05:12,826
Sometimes we'll say defeat. Okay, sometimes we'll conquer.

37
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:22,006
We're defeated. This infectious disease will eradicate the biological agents or you fight the disease.

38
00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:28,216
And that in and this is probably not accurate and they cannot do that.

39
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:34,336
What are we can do? We probably say, how can we better manage these effects of disease?

40
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:41,206
That's probably the one we have to manage the control and you cannot eradicate.

41
00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:45,076
I mean, if you have some sort of biological agent has to be eradicated.

42
00:05:45,706 --> 00:05:49,246
But it's very, very real. Very, very real. But.

43
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:54,336
So we can minimize the impact on the House.

44
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:58,916
That's what we we want to do objectives.

45
00:05:59,556 --> 00:06:10,166
You can find also on the on this syllabus again in terms of topics what you have different backgrounds.

46
00:06:10,806 --> 00:06:17,556
I'll give you some basic information about the biology. So I tried my best to bring everyone, every teacher of you to the same.

47
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:28,216
So every page so that we can have a better discussion. So some of seem to maybe already pipes.

48
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:30,115
You have the expert I just mentioned.

49
00:06:30,116 --> 00:06:37,916
You have been exposed many times, but I still want to introduce this topic so that most of us, all of us can be on the same page.

50
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:48,206
But I do want to focus more on the applications aspects, practical aspects.

51
00:06:48,746 --> 00:06:53,636
So focused more on the how can we manage it?

52
00:06:53,646 --> 00:07:00,476
Just it manages biological agents in the environment and also in the working conditions environment.

53
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:04,886
So that's the good in the focus. So you can see that our.

54
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:09,666
Talk about some. Tools,

55
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:14,256
techniques we use to monitor the biological agents in the environment and then

56
00:07:14,856 --> 00:07:19,886
talk about the biological agents in a variety of different environments,

57
00:07:19,896 --> 00:07:26,106
like in the water, in the air, in the foods, in the buildings, in the working environments settings.

58
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:31,326
And what took was there wasn't a lot of time for that out of control strategies.

59
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:36,606
How can we control the medicine? That's the. With different environments, different agents.

60
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:42,646
How can we manage them? So for example, the SAS career to how can we make it possible to.

61
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:50,076
What kind of approach and can use some common practice or can do some time specific practice.

62
00:07:51,076 --> 00:07:56,566
And that's the way we work when we discuss in the biological agents in a different environment.

63
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:04,566
And then we'll also have some emerging topics like the Legionella outbreaks,

64
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:10,536
microbiome and the acting between the biological agents and chemical agents.

65
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:18,186
Or can we use that as the the match points for or how that impacts the alcohol?

66
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:23,916
So that's the what we have to take for these things as the contents.

67
00:08:27,116 --> 00:08:33,656
In terms of the grading. Normally you don't need to worry about it if you do the work.

68
00:08:34,016 --> 00:08:38,636
Everything should be okay. Okay. Don't worry too much about that, by the way.

69
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:41,306
But yes, you need to do it.

70
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:52,146
So as I do the looks of my previous experiments, we all my two people will have any for me, any problem with any specific students in the world.

71
00:08:52,386 --> 00:08:59,886
Okay. So please, can you present this in class or with the campus sites?

72
00:09:00,636 --> 00:09:04,106
Midterm exam, final exam, 20%.

73
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:09,806
And then we do do it. This is a very excellent class,

74
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:19,616
is very difficult to do some group project and so we have these review papers the topic so that's about 50% and then participation.

75
00:09:20,156 --> 00:09:30,896
So as the we dispute this course the grades for these for discussing academic integrated you can see that's.

76
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:51,156
Final best introduction about micrograms followed agents and what's the micrograms is in the amounts and estimate effects.

77
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:58,666
Now I'm not trying to discuss this, but when you stay in this building, in this room.

78
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:04,556
Every time I speak, I discharge a lot of my brothers.

79
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:13,886
Every time. Yeah. Okay. And you bring in and.

80
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:20,546
A lot of Microsoft is involved. So that's just the nature.

81
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:24,476
But that's just the bottom division right now. Okay.

82
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:28,936
There's no exception. That is no exception.

83
00:10:29,426 --> 00:10:35,596
So everything you say, we have a very clear rule.

84
00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:42,636
Still, I do the same thing, doing things so slowly.

85
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:47,146
The best thing you need to ask yourself is how that's impact my house.

86
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:52,666
Okay, how about in my house? So what kind of people show you my house?

87
00:10:53,956 --> 00:10:57,106
How can we take a budget? Use this to improve our house.

88
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:05,786
Okay to interrupt. So that's the B and C and we try to study, try to understand and.

89
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:12,516
Because the microbes and not just biological agents.

90
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:20,346
Okay. This is about agents. There's still a lot of beneficial missile microbes into an imbalance in the amount.

91
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:31,286
Sometime we will try to make make a scary and I don't know any of you do the experiments when you are either kindergarten or in his work.

92
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:35,816
Some researchers will bring you a petri dish.

93
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:44,696
You put your heads on the prejudice, and then the couple days they'll see how much, how many bacteria grow on the place I go place.

94
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:52,076
Some of you probably have done this experiment before. And then what's what's the reaction to that in the classroom?

95
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:58,596
But we still say, wow, so many bacteria on my head's so dirty.

96
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:05,696
So that's that's probably and then you compare the girls and boys is full of more and whatever.

97
00:12:05,946 --> 00:12:11,566
So that's kind of a different type of skill, people. But why is that?

98
00:12:12,136 --> 00:12:16,936
Yes, everyone. They have these microwaves we're living in.

99
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:21,436
We're close to the sea, the ocean. Microsoft and Sony us all the time.

100
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:26,476
Now, the question is, how can we keep the balance?

101
00:12:26,506 --> 00:12:31,696
How can we maintain this so that we are healthy, don't have the adverse impact on our health?

102
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:42,805
Is the first person who already becomes of the age of the microbes,

103
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:51,906
and this is the first of these and 1700 1600s and some of these to this microbiology class or any of these.

104
00:12:52,206 --> 00:13:03,696
Do you see that slowing birth? The key is the fabric, which is he might develop this kind of microscope, these massive glasses,

105
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:13,816
to effect to the quality of the clothes, and then use that also to look at these biological specimens and then find microorganisms.

106
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:17,716
That's the first time we see microbes and.

107
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:28,766
That breeds our eyes. We say, Oh, we can see that by the microns, and we know it's very tiny and we're going to see it by most of the time.

108
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:35,826
But I think it hides. And a North pastor is the first.

109
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:44,296
Personal crusade. Pioneers in the work on the islands are responsible for the difference.

110
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:47,906
Think what it is. That's the key.

111
00:13:47,956 --> 00:13:55,606
First, discover the sterilization techniques. Also, first, discover these emeralds and work on different activities.

112
00:13:55,636 --> 00:14:05,476
That's the study that you have to do. But but he's also the policy institute's in the different places that's focused on the infectious diseases.

113
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:20,026
Well compared to what I coached, he is really a person who really can go and buy thousands of college tickets.

114
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:24,706
So we see other places. I'm very familiar with everyone I'm familiar with.

115
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:34,156
If you are in the microbiology lab, if you use a lot of petri dishes to grow the microbes on the place, he is the person who to visit that.

116
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:45,196
He also has a concept of the pure culture, but it also has this is the one by one disease theory developed by.

117
00:14:46,156 --> 00:14:55,306
So basically what that means one by the disease, either by the bug, and then you invoking it on the on the animal or on patients.

118
00:14:55,516 --> 00:14:58,966
Good. You have the same one by one disease theory.

119
00:14:59,596 --> 00:15:04,936
But in fact, we know that it's probably not not only way out of the disease,

120
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:12,106
although he's helped the modern infectious disease research practice a lot, but is not always the case.

121
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:22,006
Likewise. Three. So kids postulate that if you have the disease, you can isolate the bug and then you really affect you can kill the disease.

122
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:27,196
That's the, the, the, the cosmetic part one plus one disease.

123
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:34,115
But it's not really sometimes how we know that the disease is some it's more complicated than that.

124
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:38,386
That's for example if you think of a really effective. Okay.

125
00:15:38,696 --> 00:15:44,606
The only infection if I use a poorly microbial infection is not one but one disease.

126
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:52,826
Okay. But still, in the practice, we know that we still can see that in one by one disease.

127
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:56,966
We have you have the effect that you have for proper prescribed antibiotics to use.

128
00:15:57,536 --> 00:16:02,006
You're the infection. And we like to help reduce that.

129
00:16:02,186 --> 00:16:13,406
So but most of the time now we know that if it is these biologists, multiple agents for that, there's a lot less mucks in the microbiology research.

130
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:15,596
Look at these agents.

131
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:26,366
In fact, because of previous research that allow us to do the biology and do the research first, we'll be able to look at these microorganisms.

132
00:16:27,176 --> 00:16:35,245
And then it's chaos theory. And then it's always in the 90, 9040s, we start to understand the danger.

133
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:46,336
Is that the. Okay. Most of the more than microbiol that come out of the research start from the.

134
00:16:47,546 --> 00:16:55,346
My point, that's the contribution of. And then we have the structure of doing a genetic glucose sequencing.

135
00:16:56,126 --> 00:17:02,006
Start finding the three domains of life. From the 1970s, Professor Coles.

136
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:11,606
And then we have these previous events in the 1985 and the start of the genome sequence in 1995.

137
00:17:12,086 --> 00:17:18,876
And then now what starts when we start to have the first genome sequencing start?

138
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:22,016
A one bacteria genome takes about about a year.

139
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,456
Spend about $1,000,000,000 for the. Okay.

140
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:32,246
And the human genome projects, for example, this thing's like billions dollars on this human genome project.

141
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:43,256
But other time when the first bacteria genome was sequence that cost like $1,000,000 takes about a year to finish the work.

142
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:54,086
Now, how much you spend getting your sequence done and we'll know how much it cost to secure the bacterial genome.

143
00:17:56,296 --> 00:17:57,766
To see the human genome.

144
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:12,306
If you make you want to get it done, takes a couple of hundred dollars, it'll be done with your genome sequencing and I mean with bacterial genome.

145
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:17,136
Probably like speed at the go genome sequence that would be available for you.

146
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:23,166
Okay. So that's how these technologies do best produce a lot of data.

147
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:30,695
But when we start sequencing the stuff from the microorganisms and then that's how we get there.

148
00:18:30,696 --> 00:18:37,136
Now, with all this understanding of biology, with this human genome and then the to disease epigenetics.

149
00:18:37,146 --> 00:18:48,816
Now one of the one of the topics that has been pretty useful, very informative for the mammal health is really the epigenome,

150
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:55,906
epigenetics epigenome and that affects bacteria or they have the epigenome as

151
00:18:55,956 --> 00:19:00,726
a starch before we ever understand the epigenome in the the higher organisms,

152
00:19:01,446 --> 00:19:10,316
the modification system. So they have protection of the DNA from the enzyme cousin.

153
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:14,656
That's one of the epigenome. First image. Don't understand that.

154
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:43,996
Okay. Let's take a quick break and then we'll come back and to look at the history of my opponents and the 2012 campaign for you.

155
00:19:45,256 --> 00:19:53,836
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning.

156
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:11,056
You're not going to want to just walk by her.

157
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:26,956
Tell us a little bit about the search area that goes on in your laptop.

158
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:35,686
I don't know. I think I'm going to say again.

159
00:20:36,076 --> 00:21:12,226
It's really hard to see how I can see what has happened since I got home.

160
00:21:12,276 --> 00:21:26,066
I got very close to I got you in your life.

161
00:21:27,206 --> 00:21:37,116
You know what we're going to do?

162
00:21:37,166 --> 00:22:12,936
You know, I was telling my older brother, I think it's like I don't know to that.

163
00:22:13,516 --> 00:23:04,956
So you have to let us know when we are going to see how I feel about that.

164
00:23:05,496 --> 00:23:12,956
You know, I don't know.

165
00:23:14,396 --> 00:23:24,406
I mean, you know.

166
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:39,226
Okay, great. So and then when you think about original life, how I feel is one of many.

167
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:46,966
So what's the first audience member involved from on this planet?

168
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:56,276
How the life starts on this planet.

169
00:23:57,296 --> 00:24:05,306
So there's a lot of theories that I've always tried to understand, and it was evidence you have for that, the evidence you have for that.

170
00:24:06,476 --> 00:24:19,616
So the first believe that the first organism exists on the planet, 3 billion years of evolution that you can read about for meaning.

171
00:24:19,656 --> 00:24:28,796
You also have the the the, the first microbes on this planet is probably 3 billion years old.

172
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:36,816
But how do you have the evidence for that? The one of the evidence is really from the site, from d'Amboise.

173
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:42,116
Almost 950 years old.

174
00:24:42,336 --> 00:24:47,946
The so we have these cyanobacteria. I think probably looks like is the full size.

175
00:24:49,326 --> 00:24:56,946
It's interesting. We can see some of the full size sample the line, bacterial contact.

176
00:24:58,536 --> 00:25:04,686
You're wondering whether it's contamination? Yes, I'm talking about that's where we avoid the contamination.

177
00:25:04,956 --> 00:25:11,706
But yes, from the source, I can still get the live bacteria from that.

178
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:18,756
So so basically they told you that you were without much growth.

179
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:22,626
It just was there. Yes. Viable. But it didn't really grow.

180
00:25:23,526 --> 00:25:27,756
And because if it was disease would be starvation by all means,

181
00:25:27,996 --> 00:25:35,256
as we had great specimens to look at this evolutionary tree of these microbes, how that's that's like many,

182
00:25:35,256 --> 00:25:38,286
many years ago and some of the genome sequence,

183
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:46,026
how they differ from this current states and how what what's the information we can get from that evolution?

184
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:52,176
There's one of the study in Michigan State University from Michigan State.

185
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:59,616
And so they do the what they do now they in is E.coli.

186
00:26:00,836 --> 00:26:11,696
In the flask. And then every 38 hours they will transfer to a new flask or every data transfer to a new flask.

187
00:26:12,746 --> 00:26:19,976
So to look at this diversity produced in this scope, in this culture.

188
00:26:21,186 --> 00:26:25,206
To do this for 20 years and still ongoing right now.

189
00:26:25,716 --> 00:26:38,276
So basically, you can look at this stuff from the long sales while you pull out and then to find so many different variants from the sequel.

190
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:43,626
And then look at this evolution of this always is very fascinating study.

191
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:54,366
And in fact, for the microcosms that's within families for a full size specimen, it's very helpful for us to understand the evolution of the micro.

192
00:26:55,896 --> 00:27:07,056
Okay, so it's pretty old and also human touch that's involved with us as well when we start to appear on this planet.

193
00:27:07,506 --> 00:27:11,526
Is evolution always ongoing and the evolution with us?

194
00:27:11,826 --> 00:27:16,775
So that's also tied to arms and the biological ages. But what's the event virus?

195
00:27:16,776 --> 00:27:19,996
All this is probably not practical. And how come?

196
00:27:20,016 --> 00:27:32,136
And it has already co-evolved with us for so many years in terms of microbial what do you come the biological agents here?

197
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:36,756
We have three domains of the life span, three domains of the life.

198
00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:43,036
You still have the bacteria archaea. You carried us. US, that's us.

199
00:27:43,656 --> 00:27:55,445
Have somewhere here in the in this domain of the life, we used to call this prokaryote a precursor to bacterial procurers.

200
00:27:55,446 --> 00:28:03,876
But now we don't really use these laws anymore. But we have street domains of the life of bacteria, archaea and the carrier.

201
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:11,076
And then we also have the the other biological agent, the infectious agents, like the viruses, fibroids, prions.

202
00:28:11,466 --> 00:28:16,386
They are not real life. Okay? This is the life we have on this planet.

203
00:28:16,536 --> 00:28:20,886
So how do we define a life or long life? How do we define it?

204
00:28:22,626 --> 00:28:31,326
We talk about the virus. Viruses don't realize a new one is about life, although they can reproduce, replicate.

205
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:35,496
But it's not really. The life only has a bacterial archaea.

206
00:28:36,276 --> 00:28:47,356
That's a life. So how do we. Defeated him with criteria of criteria we use to differentiate annealing organisms and no new arguments.

207
00:28:48,886 --> 00:28:56,876
Anyone. But I recall in production mobility that there was.

208
00:28:57,866 --> 00:29:02,416
Oh, okay. So. Self reflection.

209
00:29:02,896 --> 00:29:11,926
That's one of the key, one key criteria. They can reproduce themselves within the bacterial archaea because virus cannot do self-replication.

210
00:29:11,986 --> 00:29:17,056
They have to rely on the host machinery to reproduce themselves.

211
00:29:19,096 --> 00:29:26,736
You have to have the metabolism. And then you have to separate a remembrance, separate yourself from the events of life.

212
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:35,976
So when we think about the bacterial IKEA, the carers, those can be all of us can be biological agents.

213
00:29:36,386 --> 00:29:44,945
Also all the bottles agents like viruses of biological agents, virus clones of all biological agents, and then look them.

214
00:29:44,946 --> 00:29:52,836
All right. Okay. So that's can also be we need to understand this because this virus, most of the time,

215
00:29:54,216 --> 00:29:59,756
when they leave the host, they cannot produce and probably can see some of them.

216
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:05,746
They can remain infectious for certain period of time, but they can produce it.

217
00:30:08,286 --> 00:30:16,956
While if you think about the biological agents, bacteria agents, and when they leave the host, they can still reproduce.

218
00:30:16,956 --> 00:30:20,946
And so they come to the man, put them on surfaces.

219
00:30:21,216 --> 00:30:28,316
The three can reproduce. When individuals are virus, they cannot that's a part of a defense.

220
00:30:28,316 --> 00:30:36,236
So that's really not new in my comments. Mommy pages and pages for the domain of the life.

221
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:57,746
My volumes have different sides. Most of them we can see by our high tech and obviously by only dry ones, always effects used one millimeter.

222
00:30:58,646 --> 00:31:08,476
You can see it can move by your eyes and most of them bounce around this on my for in this range and virus.

223
00:31:09,386 --> 00:31:15,556
I mean the 9392 inch so it's very tiny very small policy all by eyes.

224
00:31:16,336 --> 00:31:29,695
Okay. That's all. To make it a little bit different. We talk about many of them can look great when you go to the gym and go to the castle better.

225
00:31:29,696 --> 00:31:34,166
We will see if you will be able to see everything fly around.

226
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:43,586
You will be skilled. But but but again. But I would come overseas if and when you go to the new environment or to the gym or

227
00:31:43,586 --> 00:31:49,916
some other rooms and see every sometimes about all my pokemon there is no rules.

228
00:31:50,876 --> 00:32:08,126
Okay. So. As a result, he took to US business to monitor them, to be able to see the microscope as one of the ways we see them amplified to see them.

229
00:32:08,876 --> 00:32:12,476
And then we use a micro molecular techniques to detect them, to quantify them.

230
00:32:12,776 --> 00:32:23,906
How much? What are they? In these we'll talk about underwear but I gave it mostly every in the of the ball of

231
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:29,396
the pretty water you what see the bottle of water give you this and even measure.

232
00:32:30,836 --> 00:32:39,146
So it's more resistance to nutrition. But do you know how many of these use water?

233
00:32:39,686 --> 00:32:43,346
I don't want to know. But the idea.

234
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:51,646
Okay, so it's not clean and you probably see like fungicides in the investment.

235
00:32:53,456 --> 00:32:58,136
They're not all biological agents, so that they're most kids.

236
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:04,226
So so one thing we emphasize is, at any moment, you need safe.

237
00:33:06,356 --> 00:33:10,046
Okay. Clean as long as I you safe. Okay.

238
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:17,396
If it's not me, you probably think about it. But because clean air is clean, as you say.

239
00:33:17,906 --> 00:33:21,626
Because I love stuff. I'm over you. Okay.

240
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:26,006
So you go to the site, okay? Because I have a site.

241
00:33:26,216 --> 00:33:35,906
And also this make it also very difficult for the effects to monitor the biological agents because the sites only become the sites.

242
00:33:36,626 --> 00:33:42,476
One thing is I try to give and take them. The site is so small, it's very difficult to come to them.

243
00:33:43,616 --> 00:33:46,946
Okay, so these also so small because I'm already everything.

244
00:33:47,036 --> 00:33:52,836
Take them every tree on my microscope. So you see it become a red pill, which always a bit.

245
00:33:55,286 --> 00:33:57,746
Okay. So it's also very difficult to do that.

246
00:33:58,256 --> 00:34:09,706
So that's reason we have to have the different tools, different techniques to quantify them, to take them, to quantify them, and then to do again.

247
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:16,616
So for them, when we start to focus on the SARS-CoV-2, they need to find a way to do that.

248
00:34:17,336 --> 00:34:26,786
Okay. Because so small, my limited range the range companies custom them we have subsequently completely these custom.

249
00:34:28,726 --> 00:34:31,996
She looks at a very simple question and very difficult roles.

250
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:38,836
Okay. So so because one of the reasons is because of size.

251
00:34:39,856 --> 00:34:51,016
Because of size. And that's the the the way when we study the statement about, okay, we have to have the techniques to be able to look at it.

252
00:34:51,846 --> 00:34:55,216
Okay. So that's probably the size if you think about that.

253
00:34:55,426 --> 00:35:03,056
The size of human cells is about like micrometers, 20 micrometers.

254
00:35:03,886 --> 00:35:11,416
But then for the viruses, the microwave is probably around four microns, one microns and the virus.

255
00:35:11,726 --> 00:35:15,826
So nanometers on a scale of this micron.

256
00:35:16,336 --> 00:35:19,666
So this is the scale now.

257
00:35:19,966 --> 00:35:23,656
But in terms of the numbers, in terms the volume. Okay.

258
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:29,716
This another way to think about is like the size if you think about the volume while human cells.

259
00:35:31,116 --> 00:35:39,536
How many viral types of we can carry one human cells, even the size.

260
00:35:39,546 --> 00:35:51,126
For example, here the virus is like a hundred nanometers, but the human cells is about 50 micrometers, so we can see all of difference.

261
00:35:52,626 --> 00:36:03,946
But in terms of the volume. If you pick up a copy of this new barfly, you ought to see one fail.

262
00:36:04,816 --> 00:36:10,516
Okay. That's really I mean, that's also very important for us to understand why we see so many microparticles

263
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:16,396
so strong to discharge into the seafood because the volume here so small.

264
00:36:16,546 --> 00:36:19,876
So we can have the means of the viral particles just once it.

265
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:28,916
Okay. So the volume here is the volume is so tiny.

266
00:36:29,276 --> 00:36:34,346
And so that in once they're just you won't feel you can have any of these viral particles.

267
00:36:36,186 --> 00:36:42,526
Okay. So that's another thing to keep in mind when they release into the environment.

268
00:36:43,836 --> 00:36:49,016
If you have the burst of the Sierra. And then how many have committed crimes in Iraq.

269
00:36:50,366 --> 00:37:01,136
Okay. In terms of how spread or sometimes so quickly spread from person to person, because Michael is Michael everywhere.

270
00:37:01,646 --> 00:37:08,486
Any place you go, you'll find my colleagues involved, involved from the times through many years.

271
00:37:08,786 --> 00:37:12,116
So we can occupy almost any area, any place you can find.

272
00:37:13,006 --> 00:37:17,726
Okay. So do you think we have the any over the moon?

273
00:37:19,586 --> 00:37:24,216
Anonymous. Okay.

274
00:37:24,806 --> 00:37:28,856
Probably not. Okay. Probably not. But I'll just tell you.

275
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:32,376
Yes. Now, the question is, now we have the spacecraft.

276
00:37:33,726 --> 00:37:37,216
We travel in the States.

277
00:37:39,116 --> 00:37:46,976
So we're bring going to into this how high above the surface.

278
00:37:47,576 --> 00:37:50,746
You can still see my colleagues in us perfume.

279
00:37:52,766 --> 00:38:01,626
Medium can still detect microbes in microbes keeping the eyes glued to the affected.

280
00:38:04,756 --> 00:38:08,086
Nick. Give me the eyes. You will still see my problems.

281
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:18,896
Okay. So. This is anywhere you can find you, you'll be able to find microgreens for the sterile conditions.

282
00:38:19,906 --> 00:38:30,736
The state of absolute microgrammes. Most can only find in the lap in a major way amounts to 500 micrograms.

283
00:38:33,736 --> 00:38:40,656
So some people say, Oh, I took a shower three times a day, unfortunately, just in my volumes.

284
00:38:44,026 --> 00:38:48,286
Okay, you know what? So every will. So that's also another concept.

285
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:53,986
You have to have to remind you that, my goodness, because everywhere we think about it,

286
00:38:54,496 --> 00:38:57,676
we are not unless we are all about our age and we're talking about our ages.

287
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:02,556
They are everywhere. Okay, that's.

288
00:39:02,586 --> 00:39:06,806
That's. It's. But we still have a few rumblings.

289
00:39:08,296 --> 00:39:17,276
Two environments. You may have different organisms. So, for example, in the air may have differently the background water in general.

290
00:39:18,406 --> 00:39:22,396
So what do you have on your on your heads?

291
00:39:23,806 --> 00:39:27,106
You have different micrograms. With all your teeth.

292
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:38,205
Okay. And when we talk about the microbiome, we can say the difference between your your head and my head of the water,

293
00:39:38,206 --> 00:39:42,556
my nausea, and less than the microbes or my sense of my taste.

294
00:39:43,696 --> 00:39:49,186
Okay. Because in into differentiate difference, is it a variation?

295
00:39:49,226 --> 00:39:53,266
Each variation. And so this in mammals.

296
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:59,776
So although. Any press anywhere on this planet, you'll be able to find my colleagues.

297
00:40:00,116 --> 00:40:04,286
But think about it in different surroundings. We have different arguments.

298
00:40:05,606 --> 00:40:09,206
Different arguments. That's also applied to the biological agents.

299
00:40:09,746 --> 00:40:14,696
Think about, well, this biological agents can cause these.

300
00:40:16,336 --> 00:40:20,796
What is followed would be able to find these lightweight. Okay.

301
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:27,376
Biological agents, special organs are not everywhere. My call with everyone.

302
00:40:28,446 --> 00:40:32,196
What is this for biological agents? They can only survive in the specific problems.

303
00:40:33,696 --> 00:40:37,986
Okay. So I want to start this and also help you mentioned.

304
00:40:40,476 --> 00:40:44,916
Identifies a specific environment that can cause these making growth.

305
00:40:47,526 --> 00:40:55,386
Says. Okay. So we talked a lot about the ballot by polling by everyone.

306
00:40:56,646 --> 00:41:02,376
That's true. The standard is the truth. If you could any on the signage, you can go.

307
00:41:02,736 --> 00:41:06,696
You'll be able to find my vote. But.

308
00:41:09,966 --> 00:41:13,836
It's more like they have the same qualities in this different patient.

309
00:41:14,916 --> 00:41:18,846
So different environments have different microbiomes. That's also adaptation.

310
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:28,116
We talk about ecology and also. Suppressive biologic agents that will be able to survive, especially once.

311
00:41:30,746 --> 00:41:39,956
So that can help people also to manage this. Many, many, many agents get this different ship, different microcosms.

312
00:41:41,156 --> 00:41:44,906
You can see the the the the the environmental harmony.

313
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:56,516
If you think about how many sales in numbers this isn't some of members here in Abacus how many sales to do print in mind.

314
00:41:56,516 --> 00:42:00,056
I cannot comment, but two to print in months.

315
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:05,906
The ocean is composed of soil and soil to find the bottom to put in.

316
00:42:08,456 --> 00:42:18,656
Nice. So this is about 10 to 30% of the sales of my volumes on these patents would have to take into consideration the viral particles.

317
00:42:19,616 --> 00:42:28,226
This is just a clearer picture of all you carriers here is about interface.

318
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:32,576
Okay. Especially if you take into consideration the viral particles.

319
00:42:34,456 --> 00:42:40,426
And much higher 100 times. Could be so.

320
00:42:41,546 --> 00:42:52,366
Huge numbers of these babies in the microwave. I mean, if you look at this and the Edmunds nitrogen and phosphorus contents, again, the.

321
00:42:53,656 --> 00:43:01,305
Poco is very similar to the mobile to he plans to think about it now think about

322
00:43:01,306 --> 00:43:06,375
this improve the management also think about all these plans become the biomass.

323
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:13,576
We have the microwave and we will have all these players this on the sim of the plants you can see on this plant.

324
00:43:15,196 --> 00:43:20,186
Urgent. Okay. Think about the soil.

325
00:43:21,206 --> 00:43:29,036
Okay. Go grab a grandmother. Soil. You probably see a meteor themselves in the presence of the soil.

326
00:43:31,376 --> 00:43:35,466
So now how come it is so big? Okay.

327
00:43:35,566 --> 00:43:40,596
That's a way that we should be mindful when we start to manage the agents in the environment.

328
00:43:41,336 --> 00:43:48,866
Okay. It's a very essential effect.

329
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:52,826
My Markowitz, we talk about this is focused on biological agents.

330
00:43:53,156 --> 00:43:56,846
Okay. But in terms of microgram, we have only supposed to be involved.

331
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:05,436
So they produced this very essential. Without my colleagues, we cannot really have the cycle of this.

332
00:44:06,516 --> 00:44:14,946
And I think, okay, a scary example if we don't have Michael Higgins.

333
00:44:16,176 --> 00:44:21,486
Oh. What? All these data bodies. I can. Okay.

334
00:44:22,656 --> 00:44:25,446
Just one example. Okay.

335
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:39,106
Because the produce to provide energy to the ecosystem, especially to the ecosystem, gives the sunlight energy from the in the top of it.

336
00:44:39,486 --> 00:44:42,726
And then that's how we can build energy. Okay.

337
00:44:42,756 --> 00:44:51,816
And then provide for the ecosystem switching that can also make the nutrients and literature to this for the plants.

338
00:44:52,026 --> 00:44:58,386
But always when we eat, stop talking where the party come from, I also just compose.

339
00:44:58,806 --> 00:45:05,976
So we have the dead bodies that promote the recycling of this elements on this planet.

340
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:13,606
So the fixes and also decomposition. So they also form the symbiosis that could.

341
00:45:15,476 --> 00:45:21,226
My control room. Audio's control effect is a relief from the microcontroller.

342
00:45:22,016 --> 00:45:30,456
They can produce energy for us. So. Even with the micrograms, yes, biological agents are part of the microbial.

343
00:45:30,516 --> 00:45:41,826
But without microbes, the effect is very essential for our households of the planet and also is very essential for our health focus.

344
00:45:42,246 --> 00:45:47,886
Okay, so that's come to this. What are your thoughts for the biology?

345
00:45:48,126 --> 00:45:59,406
So always keep in mind, yes, we only hear the scary things about microbes, but microbes in effect is very essential, beneficial to our life.

346
00:46:01,086 --> 00:46:06,906
Okay. So that's the the having the produce.

347
00:46:07,656 --> 00:46:11,576
Okay. Anyone like a beer? Great.

348
00:46:11,926 --> 00:46:17,196
So you need to find my colleagues. And for them, she's my bread.

349
00:46:17,596 --> 00:46:23,986
I for pharmaceuticals, who use my body to produce the pharmaceuticals.

350
00:46:25,876 --> 00:46:33,626
Okay. So very important for us producing energy instead of ethanol.

351
00:46:34,116 --> 00:46:38,216
Now it's also a lot.

352
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:45,786
Small amounts of chemicals. In fact, we can already see suicides in the lab, in the factory.

353
00:46:45,996 --> 00:46:50,276
We use them to do the success of this special someone.

354
00:46:50,556 --> 00:46:57,516
So basically what I'm seeing, in addition to the biological agents, the micro insight is essential for us.

355
00:46:58,536 --> 00:47:02,676
It's beneficial for human aspects of it.

356
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:06,875
We use the microbial life. And.

357
00:47:06,876 --> 00:47:16,746
Come on, you've got my phone. Okay then already knew that Michael and I loved him your she was also the when we talk about your mama popsicles.

358
00:47:17,086 --> 00:47:26,826
In fact the Michael will be able to deal with these suits surely now why we still have these chemical agents in the moment.

359
00:47:28,426 --> 00:47:40,006
But the rate of the proposed degradation is not as fast as we have to be right now in the major improvements to take time and to get,

360
00:47:40,016 --> 00:47:41,776
which is my consequence, do the work.

361
00:47:42,436 --> 00:47:50,086
But with the industrialized nations, instead of just dump all these chemical agents into the mountains, they cannot keep up with the.

362
00:47:52,846 --> 00:48:01,486
Okay. Keep up the speed with that. So, so. So that's why you have these temples you want in the moment.

363
00:48:06,986 --> 00:48:12,746
How many cells we have on our bodies now come to say, in environments we know everywhere.

364
00:48:12,866 --> 00:48:22,316
But how about it about having the oral cavities in the.

365
00:48:25,386 --> 00:48:33,486
For his father to check in on any place he can find your four or five grams of this one gram of microbes.

366
00:48:36,756 --> 00:48:42,096
Okay. One gram. Think about it in my head.

367
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:46,356
That's how was my going to have gone with us.

368
00:48:46,686 --> 00:48:49,776
So we leave you with my pockets. Okay.

369
00:48:50,226 --> 00:48:55,996
If you think about the nose to grand mouth in the lung, you have about 50 grams.

370
00:48:56,016 --> 00:49:04,706
My oldest. This particular check is to the micro scheme of 200 scrap with my cousins Wolski.

371
00:49:06,926 --> 00:49:18,346
And then, you know, that's a track that this track about one kilogram Microsoft you get across this book about the viral particle.

372
00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:22,326
This is just bacteria. Okay.

373
00:49:24,456 --> 00:49:32,106
So that's also the reason I say that people should wash your hands three times a day and and take a shower.

374
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:36,456
And they used to have. I mean. Don't get me wrong.

375
00:49:36,786 --> 00:49:43,686
Don't get me wrong. Wash hands is a very important to prevent for your head to prevent spread of the disease.

376
00:49:44,886 --> 00:49:51,516
Because this is the case with a lot of time and we still emphasize it's important to control this.

377
00:49:51,516 --> 00:49:56,816
You do this by just. Think about this.

378
00:49:56,826 --> 00:50:00,216
We have organisms living with us. We knew with microbes.

379
00:50:02,316 --> 00:50:11,496
We knew with microbes. Everything over the long. We have 50 grams of my phone, so it will be.

380
00:50:13,426 --> 00:50:17,286
Stupid to say it will kill the microwave, the mouse.

381
00:50:18,136 --> 00:50:26,266
Can you do that? Come up to the canal and into something we are doing right now.

382
00:50:27,016 --> 00:50:30,795
We tried to do that with antibiotics, with them to choose the effects.

383
00:50:30,796 --> 00:50:36,396
The disease is very helpful. So okay, we can discuss about this topic when we get there.

384
00:50:37,036 --> 00:50:40,366
But the cause a side effects with antibiotics.

385
00:50:43,796 --> 00:50:47,596
It was all done inside the White House.

386
00:50:48,676 --> 00:51:02,666
No packages by the White House. So we have this obvious body from outside the White House and they can show some of the effects of this.

387
00:51:03,466 --> 00:51:08,736
On the other hand, the great imbalance we have with my opponent.

388
00:51:09,136 --> 00:51:14,416
So with the best approach for that, don't get me wrong, animals save a lot of lives.

389
00:51:14,856 --> 00:51:18,136
Okay, so bloodlines was a better way.

390
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:25,816
To predict the effects of disease. So that's all in the study.

391
00:51:26,656 --> 00:51:30,696
That's when we manage the biological agents. We need to find a best approach for this.

392
00:51:31,966 --> 00:51:36,066
Okay. The common practice and not mean the best practice.

393
00:51:37,446 --> 00:51:44,156
Right. So, yes, about this stuff, 94 is 96.

394
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:50,586
We save a lot of lives. And we still have some issues that's not telling you.

395
00:51:50,586 --> 00:51:53,826
It's not clear what issues with reason.

396
00:51:54,726 --> 00:52:00,066
And also some of side effects come from this because it is so negative.

397
00:52:00,106 --> 00:52:07,736
So that's the reason said. We're living in the ocean regardless of a microbe.

398
00:52:09,536 --> 00:52:13,226
Any place you go, we are.

399
00:52:13,946 --> 00:52:18,116
As matter of fact, it's up to us. Individual vigilance.

400
00:52:18,326 --> 00:52:24,196
We are incubating for microbe. Okay.

401
00:52:24,646 --> 00:52:29,716
We actually think about the conditions that we have in the morning.

402
00:52:31,656 --> 00:52:36,036
What we have in Britain. One temperature 37.

403
00:52:38,356 --> 00:52:42,346
You have neutrons. Yes. Revolutions.

404
00:52:43,286 --> 00:52:53,236
So what do you eat? Not just for yourself. But Michael, you and I and we have a good few months, so that's the.

405
00:52:54,966 --> 00:52:59,886
We are individual of us, of incubator, of micro-grids.

406
00:53:01,296 --> 00:53:07,176
Okay. Now, the question you have is, how can we get our help?

407
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:17,326
How can we? Control the goals of my husband so that we are more just.

408
00:53:17,606 --> 00:53:21,766
My power imbalance is incredible.

409
00:53:22,036 --> 00:53:25,386
We probably have 10 to 14 mobile units.

410
00:53:25,406 --> 00:53:33,016
We have 10 to 13 sales. Sometimes themselves. They calculate the viral particles 400 times more of that.

411
00:53:35,816 --> 00:53:40,796
Microgravity cells to one human cells. How can we make things better?

412
00:53:42,596 --> 00:53:46,696
We have the immune system a different approach to controls.

413
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:51,386
We'll be able to do more perfectly.

414
00:53:51,726 --> 00:53:59,366
Look out perfectly. Visualize the biological evidence, the differentiation from missiles.

415
00:54:02,336 --> 00:54:06,396
So that's to make it on the control. I.

416
00:54:06,756 --> 00:54:14,426
So every time we think about the polished agents that we need to keep a system in mind that the system is mine.

417
00:54:14,826 --> 00:54:25,356
So what do we do with that? Well, have these physical biological agents or they will also disperse just to the ecosystem.

418
00:54:25,386 --> 00:54:29,526
We have an important. Okay.

419
00:54:29,706 --> 00:54:34,106
It wasn't so. Every place you go.

420
00:54:37,846 --> 00:54:43,756
Circle here. So every place we go.

421
00:54:46,066 --> 00:54:50,476
Every place we go, we carry the microbes with us.

422
00:54:52,966 --> 00:54:56,506
So that's also when we try to develop this approach.

423
00:54:57,966 --> 00:55:08,686
To control the spread of infectious disease. We need to keep that in mind because our self esteem or simply that.

424
00:55:11,746 --> 00:55:30,916
Okay. And that's really what we're doing with the college is separate two majors six fees for some reason for why we but we going with you.

425
00:55:31,156 --> 00:55:35,476
But one thing to keep in mind is that we are leaving you.

426
00:55:35,936 --> 00:55:39,126
Obviously, we carry all of you with us.

427
00:55:39,806 --> 00:55:44,296
Okay with us. You've said I'm healthy. LC Yes.

428
00:55:44,866 --> 00:55:53,676
Are you still carrying all these? Okay, so that's all always keep you might.

429
00:55:54,286 --> 00:56:02,206
So sometimes also that reason we ethically say you bring the virus through to the classroom.

430
00:56:02,446 --> 00:56:06,496
So you are the bad guy.

431
00:56:07,006 --> 00:56:21,496
Okay. Okay. But that tells you that any of us could bring this to this population to publish, because that's escalation.

432
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:28,176
It's just too much. He's just allergic to cannabidiol.

433
00:56:31,446 --> 00:56:34,856
So that's when we study them. Magic follows, followed agents.

434
00:56:35,736 --> 00:56:41,615
We need to keep that in mind. But with great micro and the still cause of disease.

435
00:56:41,616 --> 00:56:49,466
And. Circle the device with suction, though the microphone can micro the device.

436
00:56:50,026 --> 00:56:54,646
The sun is a. So 100 years ago.

437
00:56:56,176 --> 00:56:58,785
Essential is benefits to all I still love.

438
00:56:58,786 --> 00:57:07,756
My point of view is a lot of because of disease effects caused by the microbes that our life expectancy before my

439
00:57:07,756 --> 00:57:22,136
forties and forties about what's the life expectancy at that time forties any fifties ruled like because of the disease.

440
00:57:23,366 --> 00:57:28,066
And that time we're going to see which cancer because we are not old enough to do cancer.

441
00:57:30,816 --> 00:57:35,486
Okay. But kill already by the infectious disease by the time you develop it.

442
00:57:36,126 --> 00:57:40,716
But now our life expectancy. Seventies. Eighties. Okay.

443
00:57:41,776 --> 00:57:50,186
You're going to be able to manage the capacity needs to extend the life expectancy which.

444
00:57:51,686 --> 00:57:57,176
So the medical microbiology contributed security for our lack of experience.

445
00:57:58,676 --> 00:58:04,285
And in terms of management of the infrastructure, we have public health infrastructure.

446
00:58:04,286 --> 00:58:09,116
We have drinking water for drinking water. But the distribution system.

447
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:19,386
Let's play a critical role in improving our life expectancy because use that we can control patients.

448
00:58:20,546 --> 00:58:25,316
That's really still. My colleagues won't be able to control that.

449
00:58:26,416 --> 00:58:29,816
You can see now now with the increase dramatically.

450
00:58:31,556 --> 00:58:35,786
So in the public health. The safe drinking water.

451
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:47,946
It's one of the key infrastructure we have that improve our type of house commodity because with that we be able to control these activities.

452
00:58:49,536 --> 00:58:54,516
Okay. So how many years ago? We still don't know. I mean, if you're doing the war against you, get killed.

453
00:58:56,836 --> 00:59:04,616
Because you're getting the water carry the president, the pageant coverage, the effects agents that can kill.

454
00:59:06,406 --> 00:59:16,346
Okay. So if you don't have a really strong immune system that we can and with the kids with a 25 year old way of the bone,

455
00:59:16,846 --> 00:59:21,936
if you don't have a sip of water and. The motel really is very hot.

456
00:59:22,266 --> 00:59:25,746
It was still kill me. Keith in the division.

457
00:59:26,136 --> 00:59:29,486
Five years old because they don't really have one. The reason for that?

458
00:59:29,936 --> 00:59:33,326
Bottles of agency. If a disease.

459
00:59:36,316 --> 00:59:44,946
Right. So we have this microbe we call the disease because they won't be able to develop these infrastructure.

460
00:59:45,186 --> 00:59:51,156
Now, when you impose a public health. So he improvised things for these domestic.

461
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:58,226
Okay. Now, how can we do a better job? This is why we still see outbreaks.

462
00:59:59,876 --> 01:00:08,156
That's another topic we need to discuss. But in human history, civilization won't be able to control these infectious agents.

463
01:00:08,176 --> 01:00:17,606
Those agents we allow who may improve our health, improved dramatically and improve our life expectancy.

464
01:00:20,236 --> 01:00:24,136
Okay. Now we have some other issues that are not going to be quite easy.

465
01:00:27,336 --> 01:00:35,196
The diabetes. Obesity is another one we associate with you.

466
01:00:35,586 --> 01:00:41,886
Okay. But in terms of history, in the human history, yes, we've been able to control the effects of disease.

467
01:00:43,266 --> 01:00:47,676
The effect is these agents would be able to control it dramatically.

468
01:00:49,296 --> 01:00:53,056
Think about the medical microbiology treatment and then the infrastructure.

469
01:00:53,076 --> 01:01:00,596
We have public health infiltrate. We have really played a key role to improve our life expectancy.

470
01:01:03,606 --> 01:01:12,046
Like. So, yeah. In the 1940s and before that, if you are 50, we are males.

471
01:01:12,396 --> 01:01:19,326
Probably die. They can motivate early. Because you have my city of 40 years coming.

472
01:01:21,336 --> 01:01:26,006
But now we need up to eighties. Okay, great.

473
01:01:26,276 --> 01:01:36,866
So in the 1900s, the infectious disease is a major cause of the volcanic.

474
01:01:38,676 --> 01:01:42,336
Now really the effect is you become less, much less.

475
01:01:43,356 --> 01:01:50,796
And then the noncommunicable diseases become obvious because of this in the United States.

476
01:01:51,456 --> 01:01:56,306
So so here's a micro apology, but also. The infrastructure.

477
01:01:56,306 --> 01:02:00,025
We have the infrastructure. We have the safe drinking water.

478
01:02:00,026 --> 01:02:08,186
We have the water we have in the environment, but we still have this emerging infectious disease.

479
01:02:08,936 --> 01:02:18,016
As students, we seem to be able to identify the bacteria more than a thousand different species of human has.

480
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:25,466
It's still evolving, still increased. And with the current climate change we're talking about climate change,

481
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:33,026
we'll see a lot of increase, a lot of diseases from animals now spread into humans.

482
01:02:33,566 --> 01:02:37,626
So you'll see these numbers increase that that increases.

483
01:02:37,826 --> 01:02:46,616
And also with climate change with aspects, for example, because some other organs that are still viable in ice.

484
01:02:47,706 --> 01:02:50,956
Now the catch phrase, the human spirit.

485
01:02:52,086 --> 01:02:57,856
So the climate change also play a very important role now in terms of the image, impaired image of biological agents.

486
01:02:59,856 --> 01:03:03,206
Okay. So. With us.

487
01:03:04,936 --> 01:03:08,956
What about agents? So what are the biological agents?

488
01:03:13,786 --> 01:03:22,646
Biological agents? Include bacteria, virus, fungi as organisms, and the association talks about problems.

489
01:03:26,076 --> 01:03:35,796
Okay. I was very. One of the criteria we use, the biological agents, is that a reversal that affects human health.

490
01:03:38,376 --> 01:03:45,876
The Microgreens or the sushi products, the body ages adversely impacts human health.

491
01:03:47,196 --> 01:03:56,286
Either cause the infection. Or medical conditions or allergic reaction to the medical code into the case.

492
01:03:56,526 --> 01:04:03,526
So that's quite a broad definition of the voluntary.

493
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:14,496
Okay. Why switch the natural environment in the soil?

494
01:04:14,506 --> 01:04:22,125
What plants? Animals. We're not talking about the border.

495
01:04:22,126 --> 01:04:32,236
We're four agents. Sometimes you probably hear the words biological agents, massive bioterrorist bioterrorist agents in biological agents.

496
01:04:34,276 --> 01:04:40,006
But it's not what we discussed here two weeks ago. We probably catch upon a little bit about that.

497
01:04:40,606 --> 01:04:45,766
I live in the Balkans over there. We follow Balkans agents.

498
01:04:46,456 --> 01:04:49,966
If we don't have a better understanding of the biology, will not be able to make it.

499
01:04:52,006 --> 01:04:57,696
So that's the reason it's not many labs. Anyone can make the policy.

500
01:04:59,046 --> 01:05:04,186
You think it is easy to make it about, but it's not easy if you know how to do it.

501
01:05:04,206 --> 01:05:07,896
Yes. But it's not really. Because sometimes before you can.

502
01:05:09,416 --> 01:05:12,866
That should help me get to a family. Okay.

503
01:05:13,066 --> 01:05:19,146
So the biology agents will pick up out of this house. But right now, we're very focused on altruism.

504
01:05:20,286 --> 01:05:27,376
That's not really on of my values and our social problems.

505
01:05:28,056 --> 01:05:32,296
Obvious. And then the other impact is in the house.

506
01:05:33,646 --> 01:05:41,626
So if we say, oh, my argument about aliens. Is that correct?

507
01:05:42,376 --> 01:05:47,316
No. No. Okay. Sure. Not by the normal microwave.

508
01:05:50,306 --> 01:05:55,856
Okay. Not all microbiology. So they have to cause some kind of a health effects.

509
01:05:56,996 --> 01:06:07,516
A large agent can also come from. AI algorithms can be also biologic agents and.

510
01:06:09,406 --> 01:06:15,376
Okay. So plans, evidence you can find from the pilots.

511
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:25,026
The apology can come from that can cause a legitimate reaction to the degree that.

512
01:06:25,456 --> 01:06:33,396
So that's also voluntary. Okay. Surely the infectious agents material hasn't yet.

513
01:06:33,396 --> 01:06:36,956
Yeah. Policy agents. Viral pageants.

514
01:06:37,106 --> 01:06:40,886
The agents, the parasites. Biological agents.

515
01:06:43,226 --> 01:06:46,796
Okay. So.

516
01:06:47,826 --> 01:06:53,826
Options associated with adverse impacts from ALS associated.

517
01:06:57,156 --> 01:07:00,966
So the health risks or the health risk from the knowledge agents.

518
01:07:02,026 --> 01:07:07,866
We have established all of the biologic agents that are being affected by the biological agents.

519
01:07:09,976 --> 01:07:13,176
Okay. A bit effective. Could be fake about politics.

520
01:07:13,526 --> 01:07:25,096
You fix the disease by telling this very common, most dominant common knowledge agents infected by the virus in the course of this case become toxins.

521
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:30,696
Excluding the toxins. Okay.

522
01:07:31,476 --> 01:07:35,326
Diarrhea for the diarrhea, for example. That's a toxins.

523
01:07:36,856 --> 01:07:41,306
You are toxins. It also changes.

524
01:07:43,636 --> 01:07:50,386
Okay. How was the biological allergic reaction to the biologic agent or substance is produced?

525
01:07:51,486 --> 01:07:57,166
I'm not saying that the House was to the to the.

526
01:08:01,636 --> 01:08:09,136
And we do. This is very generous. So what do you can see here?

527
01:08:11,736 --> 01:08:22,506
Comparative chemical agents. The biologic engine has a variety of forms, a big range of the form from the higher abundance,

528
01:08:23,226 --> 01:08:30,456
the micrograms to the small viral particles, non-living organs, and into the chemicals to the proteins in them.

529
01:08:33,346 --> 01:08:37,036
Okay. So we'll talk about the biological agents.

530
01:08:37,096 --> 01:08:40,696
Now you have to think about what are we talking about?

531
01:08:42,136 --> 01:08:46,786
Okay. What are we talking about? Chemical agents, relatively speaking.

532
01:08:48,886 --> 01:08:55,366
Chemicals for the biological agents is a variety wide range of the.

533
01:09:02,066 --> 01:09:07,826
This is a framework. We use a lot and use a lot of attributes, travel we have.

534
01:09:09,206 --> 01:09:16,256
So when we talk about the biological agents, everything, we think about the agent, the cell.

535
01:09:17,456 --> 01:09:21,026
What kind of agency are organisms? Viral particles.

536
01:09:21,426 --> 01:09:27,986
Bacteria consumes all this plastics. How effective they are.

537
01:09:30,076 --> 01:09:35,366
How effective they are. And then we think about innovation.

538
01:09:36,326 --> 01:09:39,596
We also need to keep up, keep our eye on this effect. Introduce yourself.

539
01:09:41,906 --> 01:09:47,146
It was the best way. Iraq is so very simple with bacteriophages.

540
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:51,526
We use antibiotics, a common name we use for what viral particles.

541
01:09:51,536 --> 01:09:59,996
Can we use antibiotics for that? No. Cannot. But in practice the practice.

542
01:10:02,426 --> 01:10:07,256
Some places still prescribe antibiotics to treat the viral infection.

543
01:10:09,686 --> 01:10:13,396
Yeah. Okay. The Apprentice.

544
01:10:17,476 --> 01:10:25,036
So that's actually I think that that's what happens a lot in practice sometimes.

545
01:10:25,366 --> 01:10:35,106
We have the communications equipment and. So that's what we're do, biological agents.

546
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:38,556
We talk about the agent itself and then the environment.

547
01:10:40,676 --> 01:10:44,606
So what environments exist that poses this threat?

548
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:59,196
Okay. Physical structure of obviously that's in terms of the the Coleridge's the one of the typical example here is really what is able.

549
01:11:00,906 --> 01:11:08,046
At the beginning. What happens with the coaches with this, with that, with with the recommendations everybody is using?

550
01:11:09,826 --> 01:11:20,386
You. Anyone still remember like you do you tend to pretty late in the pandemic, at the beginning of the pandemic.

551
01:11:21,256 --> 01:11:25,296
Every time of my lecture, those days will come to you.

552
01:11:26,506 --> 01:11:36,856
Any business will tell you how you can use up these days of interest like you promised.

553
01:11:36,856 --> 01:11:39,406
Do remember when they give a speech?

554
01:11:40,036 --> 01:11:48,766
After the speech, people say some people will come here to carry the microphone to scream, okay, you didn't do it anymore.

555
01:11:49,996 --> 01:11:56,876
Right, because we know we understand more about this virus, how they're spreading the virus.

556
01:11:58,866 --> 01:12:02,826
Okay. I will show you the data and some of the risks associated with Elmo.

557
01:12:03,126 --> 01:12:07,626
It's almost ten times thousand times higher then that's on the surface.

558
01:12:08,356 --> 01:12:16,716
So it's almost nonexistent. But do we touch the surface because the virus is a cesspool?

559
01:12:17,796 --> 01:12:20,916
That's not the case. It's almost nonexistent.

560
01:12:22,416 --> 01:12:29,726
Okay. Because we need to also remember. They call this the pageants.

561
01:12:29,986 --> 01:12:35,006
In fact, the ages spread. In the. Is our.

562
01:12:37,606 --> 01:12:42,976
Whether it's through the war as we watch an income of the managements then will be able to help you with amendments.

563
01:12:43,606 --> 01:12:51,166
So one of the managements, again, when we start to understand use a copyright example, we understand the Kobe's able.

564
01:12:53,106 --> 01:12:58,986
Spread really in the environment. When at the beginning, people, if you gather together, have the party,

565
01:12:59,346 --> 01:13:03,396
you'll probably get exposure to get exposed and get infections through that way.

566
01:13:04,086 --> 01:13:09,986
And then in the room, we one of the approach we try to do is increase efficiencies.

567
01:13:11,046 --> 01:13:17,916
So we are giving we come to the to the to the to the buildings room with this so many people here.

568
01:13:18,156 --> 01:13:22,766
If the ventilation system doesn't work we know that we will should.

569
01:13:24,246 --> 01:13:31,026
The fine particles in the environments accumulate high concentration as higher risk than higher risk.

570
01:13:33,336 --> 01:13:36,396
So you consider the amendments. Okay.

571
01:13:36,756 --> 01:13:44,136
And that one of the the probably your parents probably tell you or something that they tell you when every time we bring back to the shopping,

572
01:13:44,706 --> 01:13:48,186
grocery shopping, and then you have to take the shopping bags.

573
01:13:49,386 --> 01:13:54,696
Some people are doing that. I think the country is not really up to that.

574
01:13:57,486 --> 01:14:01,946
To prevent from the effects that you don't want.

575
01:14:02,616 --> 01:14:13,956
We used to use that previous knowledge about the effectiveness of the agents that the virus follows so they will start to wear the mask.

576
01:14:14,286 --> 01:14:18,886
That's a very important one, which helps you get infected.

577
01:14:20,466 --> 01:14:27,436
So honestly, runs the trust mission in an environment that involves effects of could you go to that very important place?

578
01:14:29,316 --> 01:14:32,766
Surely. Post So why exposed to you in this room?

579
01:14:33,066 --> 01:14:36,846
Why hasn't give the infection? Why do you get infection? Why? I'm more lucky.

580
01:14:37,566 --> 01:14:41,706
No, just lucky because there's so many other factors play a role there.

581
01:14:43,226 --> 01:14:47,526
Okay. So of like human.

582
01:14:48,036 --> 01:14:53,886
Is your immune system how how's your immune system and whether you are deputies to

583
01:14:53,886 --> 01:14:58,326
the infection because sometimes you may have the high expression of the receptors.

584
01:15:00,766 --> 01:15:04,095
Right. So the fact that.

585
01:15:04,096 --> 01:15:10,526
Hey, you get to you. And if you can fix this yourself, you need something simple for that.

586
01:15:11,196 --> 01:15:16,386
Some people may have the high pressure of the receptors very prone to the infection.

587
01:15:17,396 --> 01:15:24,146
All your cynicism, prejudice speaking is weak at that time for these specific ages, and then they can affect you.

588
01:15:24,546 --> 01:15:28,006
It's great. So there's a diversity here.

589
01:15:28,026 --> 01:15:35,786
There's a diversity here. And so when we specifically, how sustainable you are for this.

590
01:15:36,716 --> 01:15:43,556
Okay. So that's reason when we study the public health population is really taking into consideration the population.

591
01:15:44,546 --> 01:15:48,926
You may see a lot of variations in the individuals in the same household.

592
01:15:49,376 --> 01:15:53,516
Some people do. Some people don't. Sure, there's a lot of factors.

593
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:58,706
So explorer and ask anybody here.

594
01:15:59,666 --> 01:16:10,486
The balance. So for example, if you in a separate house, if you build a house or if you move the conference apartment buildings.

595
01:16:12,246 --> 01:16:17,796
Your risk exposure to these effective agents is different from what you have in your house.

596
01:16:18,606 --> 01:16:22,736
Okay. So all this needs to take into consideration when we look at kids, right?

597
01:16:23,046 --> 01:16:28,236
We look at it. And this really helps the individual. How can we increase?

598
01:16:30,036 --> 01:16:37,966
We have come up with a light conditions that make you very proud of the edges.

599
01:16:38,866 --> 01:16:48,646
Okay. So this triangle will we will use throughout the course and come talk about volunteer use.

600
01:16:48,946 --> 01:16:52,426
How can mention how to the best information can it?

601
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:58,846
It was a best information here. So the command could be air.

602
01:16:58,846 --> 01:17:03,946
Water, food. Building environments, industrial settings.

603
01:17:05,406 --> 01:17:12,936
And that's just it. So this trip that we element I'm always the framework when we look at these agents.

604
01:17:14,906 --> 01:17:18,196
You look at it. Okay. Look at it.

605
01:17:19,246 --> 01:17:24,796
Use this as a framework. You have to bear in mind when we discuss this, when you think about it.

606
01:17:26,856 --> 01:17:31,916
Keep this in mind. So it's not biologic agents.

607
01:17:32,936 --> 01:17:40,186
Is not just an embarrassment as those as individuals, but in fact, is the entire planet.

608
01:17:42,206 --> 01:17:50,916
When you think about the spread of this. Effectiveness of agents and the control and control of positivity can have.

609
01:17:53,086 --> 01:18:02,296
What do you have and what can you maybe thankful for this many ex-employees for the intervention?

610
01:18:05,026 --> 01:18:11,746
And then if you think about the. Verbal and physical oral transmission routes.

611
01:18:12,166 --> 01:18:18,556
Again, these are the biologic agents who do the environment intervention we have and then how we can do better with disease.

612
01:18:19,336 --> 01:18:27,686
This kind of framework is come from. Champion in the environment, host and agents.

613
01:18:29,486 --> 01:18:39,746
So when we start to develop the approach that's opponents have to use to do better for the for the control and through

614
01:18:39,846 --> 01:18:46,885
the whole process is the one of the typical example for the biological agents environment in whatever that is.

615
01:18:46,886 --> 01:18:49,886
How do those health impacts Legionella outbreaks,

616
01:18:50,216 --> 01:18:58,136
the things that we as a country that's a typical example question to discuss about how you this trend of.

617
01:18:59,876 --> 01:19:07,316
Framework to look at it, biological agents environments and then the host.

618
01:19:08,486 --> 01:19:15,956
Okay. So the topic we were discussing, we also focused on just do this triangle as a framework throughout the semester.

619
01:19:17,216 --> 01:19:20,786
Okay, great. Thanks. A select we.
