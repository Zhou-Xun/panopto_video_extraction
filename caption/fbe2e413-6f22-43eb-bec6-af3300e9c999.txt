1
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,610
Okay. So welcome to this beautiful day.

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,900
When, if I understand correctly, the weather is ideal.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,070
You had four days. I hope to sleep.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:24,200
There's quite a lot of assignments to do and you've got a particularly large and emotionally charged reading assignment to do anything.

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,180
Oh, in like a quarter, this entire city manager said. Yeah.

6
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:35,020
So if you're sick, just like leave now is somehow avoided it and it would be very convenient to keep avoiding.

7
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:42,100
Okay, so what that means in terms of the class is that what we're trying to do today is focus on how you

8
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,660
actually read decisions and we have kind of a whole second show exercise if we have time for it.

9
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,850
But I really want you to do is walk out having applied in the case of Dobbs,

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,860
a very important decision, an understanding of all the stuff I talked about the last time I saw you.

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:04,869
To the extent to which a judicial opinion is an instruction book looking for what Justice Alito wants us to do,

12
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:12,219
looking for what the dissenting justices want us to do, looking at the reasons why judges bother to write different opinions.

13
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:20,110
What are they trying to accomplish when they say things other than the of course, creating the desire to say things because you're terribly important?

14
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,010
So what we're going to be doing is spending a large I'm going to start with a quick lecture on how to use courts,

15
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:33,790
but then we're going to spend a lot of time in groups working out just what these opinions said, and they'll be intimidated.

16
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:40,809
And at the end of it, you're going to have a good sense of the class of what's going on here and what the future of not just American abortion law,

17
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,129
but American federalism, American privacy, the American 14th Amendment and a bunch of other things.

18
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,510
What's going to look like, or basically what the future of American law is going to look like?

19
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:55,270
Because a lot of it is right here in Dobbs. So let's start with how to use the courts.

20
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,500
Right. Alexander Hamilton called the courts the least dangerous branch.

21
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:07,870
And it kind of had a point because they are basically a group of fairly old lawyers.

22
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,320
They are not in possession of a significant budget that they can deploy.

23
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,190
They are not in possession of lots of capacities. They haven't got a bureaucracy.

24
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,550
They're comparatively easy to ignore.

25
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:25,570
So we've got a right to privacy case in which the Chicago police arrested a woman for having unpaid parking tickets.

26
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:32,530
And for reasons best known to the Chicago police, they decided, as called on them, to give her a full body cavity search.

27
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,630
She objected on the grounds that there was nothing about unpaid parking tickets to justify the strip search.

28
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,919
And the case went all the way to the Supreme Court,

29
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,690
and the Supreme Court ruled that indeed your right to privacy and a number of other constitutional rights

30
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,000
means that the police do not have the rights to to give you a full strip search or on page arguments.

31
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:59,240
Well, ten years later, the case emerged in the town of Cicero, Illinois, which is very directly adjoins Chicago.

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,570
And you have to be a pretty good Illinois ologist to figure out when you cross the boundary from Chicago, it doesn't look that.

33
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,670
Editor of the Cicero police were entirely unconcerned with the ruling that was against the Chicago Police Department,

34
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:20,010
and they were cheerfully strip searching people for videos, anything that might be targeted to the city of Cicero.

35
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,229
In other words, the city of Chicago lost what two lawyers was a very public Supreme Court case like that.

36
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,730
And the seizure with Cicero continued Good Friday. Did Cicero police not know?

37
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:38,070
Did so police not care here? Did Cicero police figure they could roll the dice and see if they got sued or not?

38
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,640
We don't really know that the Chicago police necessarily stopped being strip searches for unjust reasons.

39
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,670
Also, their. That's what you call the cortex.

40
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:50,870
The least interest branch. You think Cicero would learn something from Chicago?

41
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,370
It's not even about the Chicago when they came from Chicago.

42
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:03,440
Likewise Brown versus Board of Education, which was the 1956 decision that desegregated schools, turned out to be something.

43
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,160
There were a lot of ways to resist. For example, it desegregated public schools.

44
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,430
The state of Virginia had an excellent solution to that. Anybody know what Virginia did in response to the desegregation ruling?

45
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,810
They just closed all their public schools. So for a little under two years,

46
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:24,389
the state of Virginia didn't actually have any public education because public education would have to be racially segregated,

47
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:30,900
desegregated during this time. Of course, what happened was there was a boom in private schools, which were politely called segregation academies.

48
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,690
So if your kid was like you could afford it.

49
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:39,390
You set up private school, which led to a great explosion of private education in particularly the American South.

50
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,730
Again, they made a ruling on desegregation. They set a precedent all over the city.

51
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,660
It took the National Guard in a bunch of cases, and it led to, in that case, an entire state school system for a while.

52
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,790
Here's some more reasons they need to have cases brought to them.

53
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:04,589
You need to create a case that will fit a lawyer's definition and a judge's definition of a good

54
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,540
opportunity to make the kind of law that you want to make the kind of decision that you want.

55
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:16,230
Then you have to make it. And this is the burden intellectual left time. Within legal reasoning.

56
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,799
The common law of the American Constitution. You can't just say I believe abortion is murder.

57
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,870
And that's that that's why legislators talk.

58
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:29,860
You have to say, I believe that Roe versus Wade is bad law because it's grounded in the interpretation of the 14th Amendment,

59
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:38,260
which actually doesn't hold water legally and wasn't what they intended. And like I said, they have no enforcement mechanism of their own.

60
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,170
School desegregation is an endless litany of these stories.

61
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:47,259
The Kansas City schools at one point were basically run by a federal district court judge for about 15 years who was

62
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:52,420
essentially overseeing their budgets in an effort to try and reduce educational inequalities within Kansas City.

63
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:59,590
This was widely taken in the federal courts as not a great thing, and you don't want to be caught doing that again.

64
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,219
Because as you might imagine, a federal district judge is all downside,

65
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,660
but they basically manage to throw themselves into the shadow superintendent of the school system and see.

66
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,830
So you can't just say we won the case.

67
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:22,690
Hurray. Right. Brown versus Board of Education. In those as in 1956, the United States was not a multiracial and desegregated in 1957.

68
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,740
Dobbs has for the moment removed the federal right to abortion.

69
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,940
And you're already by the nice article in the Sunday Washington Post about the networks of people

70
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,950
who are teaming up to try and provide abortions in states that have now voted against them.

71
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,190
In other words, there's an immediate effort to promote criminal activity in the name of reproductive rights.

72
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:51,000
So people keep fighting. The court case doesn't end and Roe versus Wade didn't end.

73
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,710
Opposition to abortion, adoption and support for abortion or needs.

74
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,990
But you have to use the courts as part of a judicial strategy,

75
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:05,350
including in full awareness of the fact that the courts are systematically biased over time.

76
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,259
They're probably the most structurally conservative party narrative of American political system,

77
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,970
and I say that with full knowledge of the existence of the Senate. So how do you do it?

78
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,210
Here's the list of stuff to take away. By the way, is you got to pay a lot of attention to the courts.

79
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,600
But this is one of these cases like organizing a union where step one is if you think there's any reason you need to be involved,

80
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,610
you go find someone who knows what they're doing.

81
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:35,310
Because there's a lot of information that you can see to do this correctly that you get from networks.

82
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:46,200
So we start with test cases. You don't a test case is a case specifically designed to test law, specifically designed to see what you can get away.

83
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:52,239
So the small example was about a specific ban in Mississippi that was done in the knowledge

84
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,190
that it was now available to the audience reports to conservative committees and enforcement.

85
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:57,450
Right.

86
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:07,810
So Mississippi filed a test case designed to make it as easy as possible for the courts to say, procedurally, this is correct, this law is coherent.

87
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:15,510
And here's what we want to say about abortion. Now this specific issue has to have good optics, primarily in the eyes of the judge.

88
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:24,360
But to a secondary extent in the eyes of legal academia, other judges, law students, the media is a heartbreaking story.

89
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,419
And a book by Michelle Alexander called The New Jim Crow,

90
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,950
which is sort of one of the great texts on how exactly policing operates in the United States.

91
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:42,000
She was an ACLU lawyer in Ohio, and she was looking for a test case on improper stop and search by police, which was hugely racially biased.

92
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,540
And everybody.

93
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:53,940
And she got this guidance is well dressed, you know, and some kind of a good college education, you know, very, very good personal manner.

94
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,470
Clean as a whistle. Like look like a perfect test case.

95
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,460
And he had this vast stack of the document that you get it when you get pulled over by the police.

96
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,780
And every single one of them, he was basically stopped, searched. At this time, wasted was cleared.

97
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,769
And absolutely nothing could really stop it. She's thinking this is and this is my test case.

98
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:17,740
This guy looks great, right? He's an extremely sympathetic character with an enormous back story.

99
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:25,570
I can use him to be the tip of the spear in challenging any efforts to in

100
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:29,440
challenging these policies which enable the police to do racially biased stuff.

101
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,430
Research until she says, all right, you look great.

102
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:40,810
But I have to ask you, have you ever been convicted of anything? And it turned out he had one conviction and she said, sorry,

103
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:47,110
I need you to be absolutely perfect in order to be a sufficiently good test case to file with itself.

104
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,450
The statistics are extremely powerful case.

105
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,299
And she describes how he sat there with all his evidence, all these papers given to him by the police after all these humiliations.

106
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,170
And he started turning over and dropping them on the floor across.

107
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,760
That's how you decide a test case. You also need, for example,

108
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,020
an obvious answer to the problem of standing at the number of example I gave where for a

109
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,860
long time there couldn't be a decision on the abortion because he didn't have standing.

110
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:22,450
Because by the time you got to the federal appellate courts, it's been more than nine months in those days that then you need to prepare the ground.

111
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:30,159
Remember I said this could be quite a long game. So you throw one or two articles explaining that something like the Major Questions Doctrine.

112
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,580
Remember the last lecture I sent you to? The Major Questions Doctrine is a kind of salting it into opinions so that people who

113
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,810
searched on major questions doctrine doctrine in the law library would find something.

114
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,690
So they're slowly creating it for what they need it to be, which is an effort to basically undermine environmental regulation.

115
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:53,059
So you do legal research to find the precedents. You sold the precedents and two different decisions.

116
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,200
You leave breadcrumbs.

117
00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:00,200
And, you know, people read more of your articles and you write more of your articles in part because you want to make a name of the very,

118
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,829
very political environment for the law school. Law students are extremely attentive to ways in which they might get their law

119
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,450
journal attached to some hot new doctrine that's going to shape American law.

120
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,390
And while professors wish to elucidate. You need networks.

121
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,340
The allies have been assisting the U.S. to assist non-citizens, the Federalist Society,

122
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:27,180
which is explicitly set up because it brought the real vibe of Boston's legal system, particularly the 1970s.

123
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:32,550
And the Federalist Society exists to promote conservative doctrine and conservatism.

124
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,450
Donald Trump said, what I've always been outspoken,

125
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:43,380
which is he made a commitment to the 2016 campaign trail that he was going to take all of his judicial appointments from Federalist Society.

126
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,250
Take their recommendations. Now you go to the American Bar Association.

127
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:48,610
Right.

128
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:56,330
The judge down in Florida was been so kind, it was deemed unqualified by the ABA, but she was a good member and standing the Federalist Society.

129
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:01,610
This is, in other words, a specific network designed to cultivate not just a network of allies,

130
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,870
but shared ways of thinking, while social experience is an entire social network.

131
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,530
If you decide against them, that's like rejecting any social network effects.

132
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:21,650
Or I'm shopping by the right places for our kids. So two examples, both in Texas in the 1980s and early 1990s.

133
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:31,730
The United States federal court system was awash in drug cases because that's how they were dealing with influxes basically from the Mexican border.

134
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:37,670
So federal district judges were tied up with an unusually big backlog of essentially low key drug cases.

135
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,240
Which was really a problem for a set of people called patent trolls.

136
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,639
So what they do is they find some pattern to them.

137
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,320
They sue some company that's trying to make something for a lot of money on the grounds that the companies violated their pact.

138
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,160
And they said, where am I going to get reasonably fast adjudication in the district court?

139
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:04,100
So they found a district court based in Marshall, Texas, East Texas, which wasn't particularly busy, I guess just more interested in East Texas.

140
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:11,989
And so we ended up with this bizarre situation in which the courts in East Texas became increasingly the court for patent law decisions

141
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:17,120
in the United States and managed to skew the entire structure of American intellectual property and technological innovation.

142
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:24,870
More recently, also from Texas. Texas, obviously is a state run by conservatives who can afford good lawyers.

143
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,720
There's a couple of other states near Texas that are also run by conservatives who can afford good lawyer and Louisiana.

144
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,850
And it has conservative district judges and it has a very, very,

145
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,480
very conservative and let me say innovative Fifth Circuit appellate courts in New Orleans,

146
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:47,860
which is willing to make decisions, especially those done in Gainesville, where a piece of it, you know, it's going to be exciting to.

147
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:55,740
And that means that the Fifth Circuit is a perfect venue in which to bring under the optimal circumstances your case,

148
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:01,170
to get it up to the Supreme Court. So it's not an accident that Dobbs has a case for Mississippi Fifth Circuit Territory.

149
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,700
It's no accident that the Texas felony case was the Fifth Circuit decision.

150
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:12,409
So they find the right place to start your case. Typically, courts don't like this, but in the sense they can't do anything about it.

151
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:17,780
If Texas passes a law, it's the best service to do it. Getting into the antifreeze.

152
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,790
Now, remember I said standing standing media to a very direct interest.

153
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,060
Hi, I'm the state of Mississippi, and I shut down the Jacksonville Women's Health Center.

154
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,470
Hi. I am the Jacksonville Women's Health Center and I'm being shut down by the state of Mississippi.

155
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:37,430
People clearly not like this in the state of Mississippi, which is to enforce its will on the Jacksonville Health Center to do operation.

156
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,490
Nobody else really has standing. Right. So you can't say hi.

157
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,660
I'm a historian and I know a lot about American social policy in the 19th century and that's to try case.

158
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,130
You can't you can't say high on the conference of Catholic Bishops.

159
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:59,800
And I have strong views about abortion. I like the silence. What you can do is constitute yourself as an anarchist, as a friend of the force.

160
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:07,770
Right. And that you saw if you can put a link to the SCOTUSblog where they had like a 200 something family just recently.

161
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:15,370
Alice Springs are quite powerful and powerful because you're essentially doing the legal research for the Supreme Court, which I will remind you,

162
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:24,310
is made up of nine highly political lawyers and the clerks who are mostly recently graduated law students who probably don't clerkship on one other.

163
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,639
Not the people that you would ask complex questions of.

164
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,340
What is the standard of care in obstetrics and gynecology?

165
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,680
Ask the people you would ask for any kind of sophisticated understanding of American social history.

166
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,230
I could go on. They're trained as lawyers. They're extremely political lawyers.

167
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:50,700
They're not experts in any of the subject matters they touch. How do you inform them about any of the expertize that they need for this brief?

168
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,110
That's why it's important.

169
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:59,819
If you're involved in orchestrating an amicus brief and you get cited in any parts of the decision of a sense like put it on manual review,

170
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,150
that might be one of the most effective things that you do to shape the United States in that you're.

171
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:14,450
Meaning I have to follow cases, right? So as soon as Trump was elected, I stood in this room and I said, Roe is a dead decision watching.

172
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:19,209
You've lost abortion rights. Just don't know yet. But you knew the cases, right?

173
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:25,450
So all these state legislatures immediately rushed out and all these state attorney generals immediately rushed out to create the cases,

174
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:32,410
to get these to get them in line so that when you got the Trump judges approved, you would be able to overturn Roe versus Wade.

175
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,470
In other words, you want to have a couple of cases and now we have to follow cases.

176
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,900
This is one of the things you see in the town across the state, let's say Missouri.

177
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:48,550
Very, very, very opposed to abortion at this table and very little.

178
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:55,030
Well. A lot of abortion by design.

179
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,750
After decades of conservatives successfully left or right.

180
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,400
But if you live in Saint Louis and you need abortion care, you can go across the bridge.

181
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:09,139
In other words, you can go in the same way that if you live in India and you wish to get stoned,

182
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,200
you can drive across the border into Michigan because you like.

183
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:18,800
Well, if Missouri's policymakers genuinely believe that abortion murder,

184
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:24,890
then what we have here is a set of women from Missouri who are choosing to drive to Illinois in order to convert.

185
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:33,510
Therefore, maybe Missouri has the right to institute some kind of legal mandate that you can't leave the state if you're pregnant.

186
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:41,040
Right. I was in Missouri supposed to enforce this law, but Illinois is their wide open.

187
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,160
They are already seeing actually war.

188
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:54,080
And this is a very, very hot area of activity that could serve to see any form of introduce legislation in the articles as we think about.

189
00:17:54,130 --> 00:18:03,520
To what extent, for example, can Missouri run checks on women crossing the state border in order to see if they might be going to seek an abortion?

190
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,330
So I can go back and forth between Saint Louis and be Saint Louis all day. And I want to.

191
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,890
Nobody thinks I'm great. Or maybe as a post hoc thing.

192
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,550
Maybe if Missouri learns that you went to Illinois for a procedure that was legal in Illinois.

193
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,330
Maybe Missouri can levy criminal penalties against you once you get help.

194
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:29,340
So somebody narcs, if somebody drops a diamond, says that you went to Illinois for an abortion, maybe the Missouri police can come get you.

195
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,910
These are the legal questions that we're seeing in the following cases now.

196
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,420
Because one of the things about federalism is that nothing can ever really stay at the state level.

197
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,070
And that's why I can already contracts. And then finally dissemination.

198
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:48,150
Do people know? Take the Miranda ruling. You have the right to remain silent.

199
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,410
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have a right to an attorney.

200
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,110
How does everybody know that? Because it's in every building up here.

201
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:08,640
That's a prime case of dissemination. Do people have a good sense of the broad fourth amendment rules on when exactly the police you Chicago.

202
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,990
Not to about your. So these are the ways.

203
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:18,220
And so what you do is you tell people that and here's here's an example of dissemination gone wrong.

204
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:27,020
American managers of all kinds are very frightened of talk about civil penalties for negligence.

205
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,989
We don't do before the fact regulation to keep people safe. We do after the fact.

206
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:38,410
Regulation by lawsuit. So we don't put a lot of effort into making sure that the product you're using is safe before you use it.

207
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,410
But if you use it and it hurts you, then you can sue afterwards.

208
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,329
This is why we always fight some point,

209
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:49,840
which is because if you can minimize the threat of ports and you've already minimized the threat of regulation,

210
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:56,330
then companies can pursue that advice, how much they like it, and they don't need to worry too much about damage.

211
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:09,150
I work. Well. If you go to really old playground in the United States, you'll find really good seesaws through the two towers.

212
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:16,530
You got a new playground you're likely to find much later. Things like those things shaped like chickens on a spring where, you know, you use that.

213
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,230
You think they're fun for about two weeks when you're four years old and then you're like, This is the dumbest toy ever invented.

214
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:29,370
What happened because that. Well, there was a guy writing a column for a magazine called Parks and Recreation.

215
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:34,800
Yes, there is magazine called Parks and Recreation, and it is read by people responsible for municipal parks and recreation.

216
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,570
And he got it. And he was dead. In the 1980s, there was a lawsuit risk.

217
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,860
He serious as he saw.

218
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:49,100
Now, there's no law whatsoever suggesting that you can get sued for negligence if you have a properly maintained system on your playground.

219
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:55,760
But this guy convinced his readers because he's a lot easier to read and a lot easier for them to access the judicial evidence.

220
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:01,040
A lot of the articles that she saw as a reporter, as it should have been out of your playgrounds.

221
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,920
And the result is that his dissemination efforts have been actually non-existent.

222
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,840
Body of law led to playgrounds because frankly, that less fun.

223
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,910
I think they're improving again.

224
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,270
Speaking of somebody spends a lot of time looking out there because I've got to get but we've got to sort of force an entire generation

225
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:26,320
of design on playgrounds because of this guy's successful effort to convince parts of red states that there's those eminent legal.

226
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,509
So dissemination matters. That would take us back from the Cicero case.

227
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:37,560
Right. Did anybody tell the Cicero police to start searching people for parking tickets was actually appropriate for those?

228
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:43,570
Did anybody tell civil rights attorneys and defense attorneys that this was something that they could use to get convictions thrown out?

229
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:50,660
I don't know. Dissemination hours, you might find out you have a lot fewer rights or a lot more rights than all of us.

230
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,540
So that's how you use courts. And the abortion cases are a great case of that.

231
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,930
The civil rights cases in both directions, right. When we're expanding civil rights and now that we're retrenching.

232
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,350
We're also really good cases. You have to get into a movement with a strategy.

233
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,210
You have to integrate the judicial strategy with the political strategy and the public strategy.

234
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:13,570
A decision on its own will deliver what you think. And you always want to be thinking ahead.

235
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,420
Right. Dobbs is a great case of that because in a sense,

236
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:25,550
Dobbs is an enormous victory for people opposed to the thesis that the United States Constitution includes the right to an abortion.

237
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:28,030
But also it's just one step.

238
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:34,129
Maybe we're going to really go there, get rid of Griswald, get rid of the right to privacy, give it a substantive due process.

239
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:40,760
On that reading the entirety of the 14th Amendment, it could be an extraordinarily different country if that's the direction I would go.

240
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,360
ROBERTS Is direction we can go have nots, and that's what we're bringing up now.

241
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:49,960
So you've got lots of electronic devices and you've all got the case.

242
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,190
Now what we're going to do and it's going to take more than 10 minutes.

243
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:01,410
Probably because I'm aware of what's going on. I'm. If you're going to go into five groups.

244
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:06,380
Try to make them equally size. I think it should be about seven people, maybe eight.

245
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,400
For group B groups is legitimate because this is actually kind of tricky.

246
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,469
But. Get into the groups.

247
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,590
And then I'm going to assign you the citizens sections of the decision to read and discuss and explain to the residents of.

248
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:26,620
So. Probably seven or eight people.

249
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:45,610
Yeah, I know.

250
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,020
Yeah. I don't know of this, but it's not a super convincing group of people that sitting back from each other.

251
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:09,170
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

252
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,090
Okay. Okay. Um. Starting on this side.

253
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,900
So you're kind of group one. All of you.

254
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,830
Okay. You have the majority opinion written by Justice Alito.

255
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:31,120
You have the Thomas concurrence where he basically dares Justice Alito come out and really be a man.

256
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:37,230
You have a tricky one, which is the Kavanaugh concurrence, starting with why did he write it?

257
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:44,210
You have, Roberts. And Salama slicing.

258
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,090
And up in the Senate, which is probably the most entertaining fix.

259
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,500
And one of the reasons to think about is there gonna have a lot of fun doing it to bring it to you're going to have less fun.

260
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,520
The other detective puzzle they have with not.

261
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:03,520
One of the reasons is why are all of you reading more difficult and intricate prose, very emotional prose into these cases,

262
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:07,510
whereas they're going to get like straight up something published in the newspaper people with.

263
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:16,100
You know, there's a ragged style of other things. It's not just down to the literary tendencies of a different rhythm.

264
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:22,190
I take the more than 10 minutes I'll be monitoring and make two questions.

265
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:28,610
What are their instructions to future, future litigants? For example, if you look through the majority opinion,

266
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:33,080
there's a clear set of instructions on how to repeal what was done with abortion, with other rights.

267
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:38,930
Thomas doesn't. He has a different theory. And what do they want this area to be?

268
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:46,190
Right. What is Campbell trying to achieve? Let's check Domino's design and what's Roberts trying to achieve?

269
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,620
Okay. So what are their instructions?

270
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,250
Every one of these is an instruction book.

271
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:57,080
Figure out what the instructions say and figure out why that judge wants America to be in five or ten years.

272
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:09,050
Take it away. Yeah.

273
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,520
There's. It's.

274
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:33,860
Then you start reading this.

275
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:50,490
Those same. This is the first thing we should.

276
00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:01,780
The previous. It's.

277
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:12,980
This. It's.

278
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:32,230
I was inside the pool now as an object.

279
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:37,590
And I said, I think about this.

280
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:50,970
I think for all the kids we love so much.

281
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,780
Sure. Yeah.

282
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,790
Why are you say that? Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah.

283
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:15,630
The question is, is it easy for you?

284
00:28:16,340 --> 00:29:11,260
I'm sorry to say, because it's just it's very hard for me to get inside of a page with some of the things I just say are very valuable.

285
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:40,030
And there are people, you know, I think, like my father is telling what you're saying.

286
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:09,750
All right. Let's discuss it all time.

287
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:21,740
I have to ask you this.

288
00:30:27,400 --> 00:31:10,090
Well, I'm sure it's necessary in the sense that you're not talking about like making sure that this kid's sexuality is okay,

289
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:21,870
because this is what's your heart?

290
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:35,220
You know, I have no idea. Oh, yeah.

291
00:31:38,670 --> 00:32:05,280
Yeah, it's. It like you want to just sit still?

292
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:38,530
Yes. Yes. Right?

293
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,060
Yeah. Yeah.

294
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:58,250
Yeah. You don't know very much about it.

295
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:11,780
You know, you have to put. So you want to know what you're doing and.

296
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:30,500
So, you know, it's like I just sense that that's the thing that he wanted to say to all of us,

297
00:33:42,350 --> 00:34:26,490
because we can't just say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we just not to use the restroom because we have to make this happen.

298
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:43,530
So if we shoot somebody, if you say yes.

299
00:34:44,040 --> 00:35:13,830
Because like you say, you know, there is a great importance in terms of the sense of reality that regardless of this,

300
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:44,120
don't some people and the next generation this is what I guess a lot of the various things do you know those things where they are.

301
00:35:45,490 --> 00:36:24,330
And you know, I mean, it's not like something that was interrupted once she has decided to adapt one of the stories that.

302
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:46,230
But it's just that was, you know, that I'm saying like based on his opinions.

303
00:36:47,700 --> 00:37:02,520
Yeah, it's not necessarily a poll, but like, let's be honest, isn't that weird?

304
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:50,090
And like, this is different, you know, it's just like, yeah, this is just every day that's not where they are, you know?

305
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:59,330
So he's very proud and rich.

306
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

307
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:38,030
There's a lot. You're not going to want to bother to complete the impossible using.

308
00:38:39,030 --> 00:39:01,000
But of course, no one wants to read these statements and she doesn't know who has the problem.

309
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:32,840
Yeah. I'd like an to existing legislation because explains it works.

310
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:55,930
So basically it's just the fact that everything is found to be a success.

311
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:28,770
Stories. Everyone loves this story, but it's also not really based on science, the heart of this crisis.

312
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:40,690
So it's not like this for me.

313
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:57,860
All right, let's do this.

314
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:07,460
Let's consider what to do.

315
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:18,830
It is better late than never.

316
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:29,260
Yeah, it's just more of a war situation.

317
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:43,640
And I think that's the point of view, is that that's that I've said before.

318
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:50,330
So I think that, you know, I.

319
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:30,360
Yes, I'm just saying that, you know, let's say this is either, you know, this was right as the press was agitating.

320
00:42:31,000 --> 00:43:01,670
For instance, this book says this, they're not you want to get ahead of it was like, no, no, because this knows a thing or two about this.

321
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:08,940
So when you hear by White House officials.

322
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:46,520
Some of the things to his name is important, but like many things in life, you know what you do then.

323
00:43:53,810 --> 00:44:37,220
But there's so much better when it comes to something that's since the 19 Nigerian.

324
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:54,350
Yeah. Yeah. I think most Americans.

325
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:28,500
I'm not all of those organizations, but this seems to be a better place.

326
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:46,500
Well, you know, I thought I was it was worth it work.

327
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:54,060
You got to get a sense.

328
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:23,750
Yeah. So and also, I swear, it's no signs of the person who isn't just about business,

329
00:46:23,750 --> 00:47:14,780
but it is just, you know, like, I was just wondering if I could just sort of any more.

330
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:30,980
All right.

331
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:49,660
Yeah. So we feel like I think there's something about the crisis, and I think that's an excellent.

332
00:47:58,960 --> 00:49:00,390
It's just really good. And this is not that this is a narrative that seems like a if you look at my actions and you want to see part of it.

333
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:12,950
You probably get used to it.

334
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:52,290
But I'm just saying that this is one of the things that I'm watching right now.

335
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:57,380
The president travels a. Yes.

336
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:03,720
That's part of the story.

337
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:13,950
Yes, you're right.

338
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:23,980
Oh, that's right.

339
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:30,150
That's right. Yeah.

340
00:50:30,750 --> 00:51:00,730
So let's say that you would like to say it has to be a little bit of news about anything you need to know about it.

341
00:51:00,790 --> 00:52:26,180
This is going to be the best thing last year, which I have that has ever happened in the last three years or so.

342
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:32,990
Like right now.

343
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:40,880
Yes. Yes.

344
00:52:41,530 --> 00:53:05,140
I want to make sure that everybody gets it.

345
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:15,250
Yes. 30,000. Yes.

346
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:25,610
And I don't want.

347
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:35,470
Get her. Actually, that's what we've been talking about.

348
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,510
Yeah. Oh, thank you, guys.

349
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:51,490
Okay, well, one minute I think you make sure you've agreed your answer to the question and make sure you've agreed who's going to receive the cube.

350
00:53:55,250 --> 00:54:03,350
So everyone is okay. So everything's falling apart in the room where I teach the Masters class.

351
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:07,430
Like this is broken. And that's broken. And nobody ever fixes everything that's broken.

352
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:13,570
So now I have to wander around with the arm, strap on my wrist, talking to the class.

353
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:23,059
An update puts the slides because it's like the world's biggest athlete and like the Masters,

354
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:29,210
students are paying higher tuition than Harvard for this. It's falling apart visibly around me.

355
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:37,550
So again, start with the control is going way around the descent, and I think that's class.

356
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:42,680
All right.

357
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:55,550
So let us begin with the controlling six three opinion, determining that there is not a right to abortion on the federal level in the United States.

358
00:54:55,550 --> 00:55:00,200
This is now the status of American constitutional law. The law is what the court says it is.

359
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:10,460
What does the court say is. So in all those opinions,

360
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:20,360
he told us that the need to interpret the Constitution as it was originally intended and that rights under the Constitution

361
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:28,190
should be historically entrenched based on legal precedents and the precedent of tradition in American history.

362
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:36,210
He says that Roe is wrong and it should be overturned, and that started because this does not have to apply to other problems either.

363
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:40,550
And he says that was the criticism. That is a huge thing in law.

364
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:46,760
Like I'm glad you called that, because the Supreme Court just saying a major precedent is just bad and therefore can be overthrown.

365
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:51,380
He just rewrote everyone else in the country a could carry on.

366
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:57,380
And he also distinguishes Roe from other subsequent substantive due process cases as well.

367
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,910
Laurence virtue of because of the involvement of potential life.

368
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:07,400
So he states that therefore it is the worst of them to overturn Roe.

369
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:12,650
It just doesn't necessarily have access to process cases.

370
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:24,890
And he said that going forward that this should be up to the representatives of the people as such versus the court.

371
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:31,370
He also lays the groundwork for her doctrine by stating that since he considers viability to

372
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:37,670
be an arbitrary line and it's not necessarily agreed upon when someone is considered a person.

373
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:47,400
He stresses that argument applies to all who are born with certain disabilities or conditions are not.

374
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:53,450
Also, he lays the groundwork for a future constitutional future case.

375
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,300
And what of this?

376
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:02,750
Watch that, because that's a really important thing the court that he's doing, which is that he's saying that since viability is incoherent.

377
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:08,920
Right. And no. Remember, not an obstetrician, not a gynecologist, not an innocent doc.

378
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:17,770
But since viability is incoherent, since he can find cases where a viability test would actually extend after birth, where you have, like, a neonatal.

379
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:20,690
Therefore, viability is an incoherent test.

380
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:28,540
Therefore, the only logical way to go is that from conception onward includes an IUD and it's infanticide to wear an IUD.

381
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:36,700
That's where he's going. It's just a question is the argument against all ideas, which is copyrighted since they can be used as.

382
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:41,750
There's a concept in Catholic theology of the abortifacient.

383
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:48,860
And like literally what he's calling for is the abortifacient is something that causes that causes any harm once for specific.

384
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,070
So then they are their methods of therapy.

385
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,350
They are not especially good at that level of technical detail, but you can find some articles.

386
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:05,650
But basically the usual line is the IEDs by preventing implantation are therefore abortifacients,

387
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:13,030
which, because availability is incoherent, means there are kind of side effects of not having success.

388
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:19,840
I wouldn't buy stock in normal iron dealmakers. And Samuel Alito gets his personal.

389
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:29,300
But that's also a really nice case of just how complicated this gets past, because now we have Catholic theology,

390
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:33,290
American constitutional law and different birth control technologies in one sense.

391
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:37,850
Okay. Clarence Thomas thinks that's a little bit weak.

392
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:55,490
Yeah. So Thomas basically says that Roe was originally enacted to protect the right to privacy, but he's basically arguing that.

393
00:58:57,030 --> 00:59:03,530
The right to privacy is not actually. It's not actually given within the Constitution and.

394
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:16,030
Uses this argument basically that any right that's not explicitly enumerated in the competition constitution

395
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:23,140
has to be both deeply rooted in the nation's history as well as implicit in the concept of order.

396
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:32,440
You. He says that abortion is not just not all of these like qualifications for protection under the Constitution.

397
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:43,600
However, he goes even further and says that because this is not protected in the Constitution, other rights like same sex marriage,

398
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:52,690
the rights to contraception are also in danger because there's no explicit right within the Constitution.

399
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:58,270
So he's basically saying that the right to privacy is kind of made up.

400
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:12,110
And to use this to overturn other laws and other rights that have been on the books and these include same sex marriage is the status quo,

401
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:18,250
that interracial marriage is a topic of interest to him. So it goes into this, the right to privacy.

402
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:25,020
Like you said, it was all the way back to the question of whether states prevent conception of married couples and conservations.

403
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:39,670
So, you know, forget about any favorites like Silver Ex. Now we got a serious one,

404
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:48,520
which I think is partly motivated by the fact that Barack Obama said on the Senate floor and then promptly voted in what he said later this month.

405
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:53,950
But he also has to go after these questions, take it away.

406
01:00:54,820 --> 01:01:04,670
So my stance was that he wants the court to actually be shown to be protecting the rights of the president and the Constitution.

407
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:11,110
He thinks that it has to be to overturn his not overruling federal law.

408
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:23,890
And he does he says that he wants the decisions made by political representatives in other states, in Congress.

409
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:32,709
But the court itself has been. You tell me also that it's interesting that you did bring up the NBC channel and he his

410
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:38,890
stance is that it would not be it would not be wrong for people to challenge the states,

411
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:42,580
and that wouldn't be right. So watch this.

412
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:47,900
So part of what's going on with Kevin on this is actually thinking through the implications of this case.

413
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:58,690
So, you know, it's not because Alito was busy giving conservatives a blueprint for abortion and national issues, for example.

414
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:04,060
But in this area, they're very suspect that's already happened.

415
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:09,430
Thomas has left abortion in the rearview mirror, and he's gone for the entire enterprise.

416
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:17,770
Kavanaugh is suddenly looking very old in sports, and it's just it's just constantly on the topic.

417
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:24,000
But I am not stupid. And I recognize that there's going to be a [INAUDIBLE] of a lot of cases if he talks about.

418
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:33,620
No, that's not the border. Let's go to John Roberts, I think is having a really bad judicial term, actually.

419
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,180
I think Chief Justice Roberts is enjoying himself.

420
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:49,600
So so for upwards of this like I think it was liability had liabilities any perpetrator remain in a fortunate position.

421
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:59,800
Um, he was talking a lot about the 15 vehicles and the things that they are forced to capture is not the same as if it was 15 weeks or so.

422
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:12,790
It is a story to be sure what it is, is basically to redefine viability that a lot of the work I do is really skirted in to reevaluate over time.

423
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:22,149
And he was talking a lot about how an inversion of the road rule road ruling, they can actually have a right to choose what liability it is.

424
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:29,350
The oversight should be disconnected. And you say it is a basic right, but that we should have abandoned the whole market,

425
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:34,390
which would leave us where we would have a right to work at the end of the operation.

426
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:39,520
So what you are seeing here.

427
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:42,970
Right. So why is Roberts fiddling around with how many weeks?

428
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:50,890
Alito says that doesn't make any sense. Liberals explain why it's focusing on the government.

429
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:59,089
He's not exactly competent don't of Julianne. Robinson Salami slicing.

430
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:06,110
Right. Robinson's strategy on everything and you see this most clearly with voting rights cases is Roberts believes in taking away rights very,

431
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:10,220
very gently by creating more and more exceptions. So Roe is the law of the land.

432
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:18,050
But you can have a conceptual role as the law of the land, but you can require an invasive ultrasound role as the law of the land.

433
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:19,519
But you can have a waiting period.

434
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:24,770
Role is the law of the land, but you can mandate that doctors have to have admitting privileges at the local hospital,

435
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:29,320
even if it's Catholic in comparison until at the end of it rules the law of the land.

436
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:32,090
You have the right to abortion. That's how Roberts votes.

437
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:37,860
And you can kind of see he's a little bit offended by these like accent wielding gang over here.

438
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:41,350
That is, you know, he was allowed to mix the metaphor.

439
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:48,490
He's salami slicing lyrics alone. It's not a very big, prominent decision of the sort Roberts doesn't like.

440
01:04:49,810 --> 01:05:17,370
The Liberals have views on this. Um, so they said basically that they want women to have the right to choose to have an abortion.

441
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:25,810
They don't agree with that. Obviously, they like to talk a lot about it.

442
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:31,760
Your stuff is choices that people make in your lives, that the government does have the right to it.

443
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:38,110
So they were basically saying French positive for privacy.

444
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:44,469
And then they also want to do something for families probably and sexual

445
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:52,110
familial relations in the also the issues with the state schools of the states.

446
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:55,380
But I mean, eliminating the rights of informants.

447
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:04,370
Yeah. So in a sense and this is and and this is, as I said, as I want you to look at what is actually coming.

448
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,270
And one of the things that they're doing is they're speaking to the public.

449
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:11,210
They're they're they're providing quotes for The Washington Post of The New York Times.

450
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:18,080
These guys aren't because none of these arguments benefit from being aired in public in a country that's about 70% pro-choice.

451
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:24,530
They benefit from being married and legally so that you think if you want to talk about it, they benefit from the majesty of the law.

452
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:26,149
That's no accident.

453
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:31,610
Most of the sexes are not giving speeches about how we're politicizing the courts, and we should show more deference to the Constitution.

454
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:38,040
The Liberals are saying, yeah, you already politicized the course that that horse left the bar a long time ago.

455
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:42,740
I'm going to make it clear what is going on and make the stakes of what has happened.

456
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:49,220
They're also making decisions like a weird Roberts liberal axis scenario for.

457
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:57,880
In which liberals and say, we're going to lose the lesson. Lesson Roberts would say, I'm going to win, but I knew exactly what is going on.

458
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:03,430
Alito was like, No, I'm going to win. This is bad law. And it's what I consider Samuel Alito to be all of us.

459
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:12,229
I'm in a position to fix the law and end the mass murder myself. It's a little this is a really big because locals are saying if you can't trust the

460
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:18,020
courts to decide based on precedent that goes back to 1973 and trust the courts.

461
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:23,150
So they're trying to shock people saying this is a lawless political body and they're

462
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:27,590
trying to shock the whole legal system by saying this is a lawless political body.

463
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:30,920
You a lawyer? What are you doing if that's the case?

464
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:33,470
That's a lawyer in Russia. Another lawyer in the United States.

465
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:41,570
He's going to say, well, it was bad while we fix the law got better, law makes more sense and the policy consequences are optimal.

466
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:48,800
The only question is whether Alito is actually serious, that this ends an abortion or whether he actually secretly agrees with Clarence Thomas.

467
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:54,940
That is the law of the land. You've done a good job. This is a hard one. Particularly hard.

468
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:59,679
One of the things policy memos do don't add up. I called this out.

469
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:08,200
But basically what you would say is that all of the things I bolded from the previous slide are the ones that you're seeing mattering most.

470
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:14,440
And also the thing I really want you to take away with this isn't Dobbs is in the rearview mirror.

471
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:16,600
Federal right to abortion is in the rearview mirror.

472
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:23,020
But all of these are instruction manuals for the next round because nobody is satisfied at this point.

473
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:29,250
Nobody. Not even Brett Kavanaugh. Okay.

474
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,580
By the way, trivia on all the judges. Who's the only one who regularly, publicly, approvingly cites Malcolm X?

475
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:45,490
Sotomayor. Kagan. Jackson.

476
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,680
Governor. It's Thomas.
