1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,220
Oh, right. Hello. Hello. Good morning.

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,580
It's good to know. Yeah. You sound excited.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,680
Yeah. You excited? Yeah.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:24,990
Oh, why not? Uh, I, i it was snowing on Saturday at the airport, but I don't know if it was snowing here.

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:35,640
It was snowing here. Okay, well, you know, I was not properly I underestimated how cold it would be this morning.

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,610
So it's that that time when I need to pants just wore one pants.

7
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,100
Okay, so before we get started, just some administrative stuff.

8
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:57,000
A reminder that your homework number three, which is your interview is due this Sunday.

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:09,209
I will not be accepting late homeworks for this because I have been mentioning it for the last 12 weeks, so I hope you have your interview by now.

10
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,450
If not, here's a mad dash until Sunday.

11
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:12,839
Again,

12
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:21,329
if you're not able to interview someone over the phone or in person over Zoom perfectly acceptable for you to send them a list of questions via email.

13
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,310
They can answer via email and then you can write your assignment accordingly.

14
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:33,090
So today will be having a lecture. Thursday will actually be unique.

15
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:43,500
So it is optional. If you want to come on Thursday, Thursday I will be here from the normal time from 830 to 10.

16
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,480
If you're already here because you have other classes and stuff like that, you're welcome to come.

17
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:55,260
But this is a time when you can work on your commentary and then I'll also be here in

18
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:04,560
person if you need like consultation or feedback on your paper or also your homework.

19
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:12,300
So I will be here from 830 to 10 if you don't feel like you need that and you're good to go like you don't need to come.

20
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:25,709
But that's what we have going on this Thursday. And then next week, right before Thanksgiving break on Tuesday, we will meet virtually so on Tuesday,

21
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:33,990
the 22nd, we will meet over Zoom, not in class with the guest lecture from Dean Gibbs at Texas A&M.

22
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:43,440
You'll have your Thanksgiving break and then your quiz five will be do that on that Sunday right before break.

23
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:54,450
How many of you would prefer to have it do the Monday after break instead of Sunday had a okay.

24
00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:00,450
All right so I will I didn't does anyone people not feel strongly either way.

25
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:08,220
Okay I'm going to move that quiz then to be due Monday night after break.

26
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,350
I'll change it and make an announcement on canvas. Sounds good.

27
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,299
Okeydokey. All right.

28
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,130
That was all the administrative stuff. I can't believe we're almost.

29
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,230
We're barrowland towards the end, y'all. Can you believe it?

30
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:40,679
You can. Okay, I can't. I just got my course evals from my online version of the class.

31
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:52,380
So that was. Yes. So picking up from last week, we had a very engaging guest lecture from Dr. Herr Stein.

32
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,880
She emailed me, I posted her slides there already on on canvas.

33
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,969
She mentioned how engaging you were and like how thoughtful some of your questions were.

34
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,520
So she really appreciated that we talked about interprofessional teams.

35
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:17,339
So today we'll recap that a little bit, but then we're mostly going to be talking about public health communications today regarding

36
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:23,790
infectious diseases to the capacity in which I know best from my professional practice.

37
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:32,070
But as I mentioned, obviously not as good as like other faculty who specialize in public health communications like Dr. Zygmunt Fisher.

38
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:42,300
So to get our brains going this morning, we're going to do a think pair share or just like a time to whoever is around you.

39
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:54,960
So the first question is who do you think is a good company, organization, etc. that's really good at communication and why?

40
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,940
And then the second question that we've kind of posed in class so far.

41
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,570
But have it like fully talk through is.

42
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:11,490
Think about a person, company or organization that went through like a scandal or a bad time.

43
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,930
And they were able to turn their reputation around positively.

44
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,610
Right. So how were they able to accomplish this?

45
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:26,790
So so for the first one, it could be like, I don't know a person as well,

46
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,680
but thinking along that lines and then the second one was like an example of,

47
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,200
you know, somebody who had a scandal or they had like a bad period and they were able to turn it around.

48
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,990
So I'll have you all turn to each other kind of chat about these two questions and then we'll regroup.

49
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:50,170
Okay, go. I know.

50
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,570
Okay. I can join them or them. That's here.

51
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,460
Oh, yeah. Sorry, I got to go.

52
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:07,670
I was having that occasionally at that time there.

53
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:23,400
And a lot of the time that they do around the country really, you know, successful,

54
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:38,120
I think I might be sorry, but I mean, I think they do like if they are anything, I guess then hide it.

55
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:52,680
And, you know, it was like I never wanted to run for the Senate and never came back, you know, like somebody doesn't.

56
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,129
I like seeing or doing a thing, parachuting or so.

57
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,400
Feel free to just join whatever group is. I think.

58
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:20,720
Yeah, I heard the plane is upside down and it's hard to get to work because it's really easy for you.

59
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:30,480
But they probably never got hurt because of this.

60
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:40,700
But then there is a 28 year old prime minister doing it.

61
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,600
I think a scenario that actually hit Britain like Monday night for this type of thing.

62
00:07:46,400 --> 00:08:01,900
I think there are a of. I think that was that was very, very tight around the season and I feel excited to be able to run from them.

63
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,450
And then it came back one, but yeah, exactly.

64
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:20,480
You know, it's just and then like all the other people and the people in our movies were very designers like size, style.

65
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,100
There is always. Yeah. Yeah.

66
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,409
Yeah, I know.

67
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,870
I was like that. I was like, once again, I think.

68
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,850
I think that's true. Yeah. They were like some of the instigators is.

69
00:08:50,680 --> 00:09:11,990
No doesn't. I mean, the thing that I would like to say, I believe was born around a year ago and my values are not it's not about my grandmother,

70
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:18,669
but what the nature of women is coming in for and never watching something.

71
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:30,129
I don't you know, if you look at somebody else's, it rings everything sold.

72
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:38,500
And I look at the journey and I mean, I think that's always going to be appealing as hard as it goes for anybody trying to take advantage of it.

73
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:58,250
And, you know, seems like there is another. I'm right here in L.A. and that made me think, okay, let's give me more time.

74
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,090
Okay, let's get to number one first. Kind of go around the room first with number one.

75
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:10,910
So so who do you all think is a good company or person who's really good at communication?

76
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:15,430
Which I'll discuss. How about we start here?

77
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,940
Okay. Oh, I first thought of Patagonia.

78
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,460
Not super well run as a company as a whole. Sure.

79
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:30,969
But, like, I know the company or the owner was, like, selling his stock to like, that kind of change.

80
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,870
And you've seen a very open about that and there's a stable of rights.

81
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,120
But yeah, yeah, yeah.

82
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,090
They're very into sustainability.

83
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:47,470
I And you all feel free to chime in, too, because I'm also obviously not a Patagonia expert, even though I own a few of their items.

84
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:53,229
I think for like the Black Friday, they don't do Black Friday or anything like that.

85
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:58,270
And then a lot of their profits go to like climate initiatives or charity,

86
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:05,530
and then a lot of their clothing are upcycled or recycled materials, which is why it's a little pricier.

87
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:09,190
But yeah. Yeah. Were you all in the same giant group or.

88
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,830
No? Okay. What? What about.

89
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:22,659
We also mentioned that I had originally divorced and just like the principals of the company and that they just do good stuff.

90
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:31,720
So we hear about it versus like there's still that communication and maybe there will be, like you said, Johns Hopkins.

91
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,220
Okay, Instagram page, I don't call them on Instagram.

92
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,800
I said, okay, so I'll talk to.

93
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:49,040
For me, it was during this period and in, like, a like a good way.

94
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,710
Okay. Okay. I'll check it out after class.

95
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,270
Is it that they just, like, are really fast or they explain things like clearly or they have like these meetings?

96
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,730
I think they cater a lot to the agenda.

97
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,490
Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah.

98
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:15,280
See, they're there. I wouldn't say marketing strategy, but this idea of like setting messages of like get vaccinated or.

99
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,279
Okay. Yeah. Basic public health announcements.

100
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,629
But they do it in a very trendy I check it, I'll check it out.

101
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:33,320
Kind of like the Duolingo tik tok or like the scrub daddy tik tok is also like unhinged if you followed that one, the sponges.

102
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,510
Okay, how about this group we talked about? Johns Hopkins.

103
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,640
Okay. Public health. Okay. And we're all a different group.

104
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,620
Are you? Everybody was like Hopkins. Oh, the four of us were talking.

105
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,250
The one I came up with was Ben and Jerry's. Because I don't know much about Ben.

106
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,940
Yeah, yeah. Everybody, I got to have their page open right now.

107
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:02,059
It's really. How do we dismantle systemic racism? Like, literally, like the voting rights, economic inequality, education,

108
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:08,810
criminal justice and talk about how to eliminate racism and all those factors so they can, like, completely dismantle their system.

109
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:14,810
Yeah, that and Jerry's is very progressive. They're based in Vermont, delicious ice cream.

110
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:25,729
So probably for us, who are more like public health or progressive, for example, we might think that's good communication, right?

111
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,230
But imagine if you have different feelings about those kinds of things, right?

112
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:39,499
You know, give or take. But for us, I would say Ben and Jerry's, is it overall when the reason they started was because if it ends,

113
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:44,540
it's Ben or Jerry but doesn't have the ability to have full taste.

114
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:52,150
So they added textures to the ice creams, which is why there's like chunks of stuff in there anyway.

115
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,819
And there's one on like a state tree, if you could.

116
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:05,870
Yes. Head up. I just thought of this in another class that I'm taking had a guest speaker, Paul Teller, who works for Mike Pence.

117
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,220
He's actually the executive director of his nonprofit that he started.

118
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:18,079
And I asked him the question, who is more effective at like communicating like their problems that are getting their policies passed?

119
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,450
And his answer shocked me. He talked about the differences between Democrats and Republicans,

120
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:29,329
but he said Democrats were better at what and what we're all we all had the reaction in the class.

121
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:36,530
And what he was saying was that Democrats communicate by highlighting stories so they don't just, like, have stats and figures.

122
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:41,570
They might be like, here's a woman who's experiencing, you know, like.

123
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:50,979
A lot of issues around, like from back home. And this is why he's an asylum seeker and like that has an emotional draw.

124
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,230
Whereas Republicans tend to focus more on just like numbers, deaths, figures.

125
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,480
This is the number of people that are like illegally crossing the border.

126
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,800
And I thought that, oh, that's interesting. I ever thought about that.

127
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:09,160
So maybe Democrats are more likely to use qualitative data Republicans and more likely to use quantitative data.

128
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,880
What was Penn's nonprofit like? What's its mission?

129
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,380
It's like for like advancing freedom, whatever that means.

130
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:24,400
He likes turn it around that. So they have like three policy issues that they like really focus on.

131
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,780
I don't remember what they were because I have to be honest, I think that's fair.

132
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:36,400
But yeah, so I think they just like try and like raise awareness about three things in particular.

133
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,720
That's interesting that that's their perception because I would say to me that's also surprising because when I look at both parties,

134
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:49,030
I feel like Republicans are in such lockstep with one another,

135
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:55,840
like no matter who does a terrible thing or who's wrong, we're very much going to support our own party.

136
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:01,779
Whereas with the Democrats, there's a lot of infighting between moderates and progressives.

137
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:06,309
And yeah, that's a that's an interesting perspective in the room.

138
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:12,880
Like, I don't know, like maybe it's because we're on opposite sides of the aisle, but like, yeah, yeah.

139
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:19,360
Interesting. But I would, I would say kudos to him for I'm guessing this was on their policy classes.

140
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:27,370
Kudos to him for like being willing to come talk about that, knowing like what kind of campus the University of Michigan is.

141
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:31,180
Yeah, he's really good friends with the professor.

142
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,680
They went to undergrad. They're on like opposite ends of the spectrum.

143
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,400
It interesting but I was. I was glad it was one of the better lecturers.

144
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:48,549
Hmm. Thank you for sharing. Okay. So the second question now I think about a person,

145
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:54,590
company or organization that went through a scandal or a bad time and they were able to turn their reputation out positive early.

146
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,180
How were they able to accomplish this? So I know this one's a little trickier.

147
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,530
I was talking about the other night at a dinner with some other faculty,

148
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:09,140
and the only person that I could come up to my to my mind was Robert Downey Jr.

149
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:19,000
Case before, you know, before your time before he was Iron Man, he was had a lot of substance use disorder issues and was, you know,

150
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:23,169
considered to be problematic in the sense that, you know,

151
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:29,829
he very openly had these issues and then he kind of like, you know, chilled out for a while into his career.

152
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:37,299
And then all of a sudden, like his second like career, wind was becoming, you know, Iron Man and part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

153
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:42,850
And since then, now he's very beloved. So so I will start over here.

154
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,170
Did your have a chance to, like, think about number two?

155
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,340
Anybody was able to come up with any anything.

156
00:17:53,910 --> 00:18:05,600
This was a trickier question. We talked about pharmaceutical companies pre-COVID and post COVID, like Pfizer's reputation for it.

157
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:11,520
Do you think their reputation is better now? Yeah.

158
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:16,360
Oh, okay. I do. I think that they've done a lot.

159
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,680
Well, at least in terms of their communication systems. I think about communication.

160
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,100
Yeah, I, I feel like they put a lot out there.

161
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:30,700
And Pfizer has done a lot to get its vaccine to a lot of, like, um.

162
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:39,400
Communities that wouldn't have been able to get it otherwise if I didn't donate it, for example, like vaccines to countries in Africa.

163
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:43,319
And so I'm not that it's like much better,

164
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:49,530
but I feel like people had a really negative view of pharmaceutical companies and Pfizer was included in that.

165
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:54,870
And I feel like it's changed. It's not necessarily like a lot better, but I think that it's a private.

166
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,210
Sure. Sure. Thank you. CHLOE So you had a handout?

167
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,259
We were just talking about, like, Victoria's Secret and Abercrombie.

168
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:12,840
How they went through a scandal. Oh, yeah. Only I like any, like, skinny size zero models and mannequins.

169
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:25,240
I think all these have one body type. And so what they did was they got rid of one of their old executives and brought in younger people,

170
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,590
I think new perspectives that changed what they were.

171
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,979
The names for my guess. Yeah. Thank you.

172
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:39,020
I don't know as much about Victoria's Secret, but there was that Netflix documentary and Abercrombie, I mean, it was it's yeah, it's very interesting.

173
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:44,670
It's like a quick hour. I forget. It's like white, hot, young something just like, look at Netflix.

174
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:54,889
Abercrombie documentary. But essentially it was one man who was kind of driving like, we need to have this Americana type of look in our catalogs.

175
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,150
They can only look a certain way. So even when I was growing up,

176
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:04,940
I had an older sister who was very into Abercrombie and it was like a sign of like affluence and

177
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,830
like we're not like we're minorities because we couldn't shop at Abercrombie and stuff like that.

178
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,760
And now I'm shocked at how inclusive their sizes are.

179
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,280
Actually, I didn't know about until again, like tick tock, but like people were like they're jeans.

180
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:26,510
Like they're now they carry like, you know, bigger than a size six, which was very surprising to me.

181
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:34,310
It's very challenging, I think, to turn your reputation around positively.

182
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:45,950
It depends on, I suppose, how scandalous that thing was or damaging the thing was and how long it will stay in the general public's memory for.

183
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:53,210
And it also depends, like if it's very tricky in in like the capitalistic society that we live in,

184
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:00,139
right, to have this moral stance of like, yes, some corporations do a lot more harm than other ones.

185
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:05,870
But if you we like say, like, I'm not going to support any company that does bad things.

186
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:12,050
Like that's basically almost every company like you really kid like shop anywhere,

187
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,850
go anywhere, do anything like even target, for example, even probably.

188
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:23,870
Build-A-Bear So just with these things that we're keeping in mind, we'll get to this part later.

189
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:32,509
But with public health communication, healthy people defines it as the art and technique of informing,

190
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:39,740
influencing and motivating individual, institutional and public audiences about important health issues.

191
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:47,630
Very complicated. You need to take into consideration, like we talked about before, health literacy and cultural appropriateness,

192
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:55,070
and then efforts can be undermined by what we talked about before social media, media pay per click bite news bites.

193
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,449
So I've mentioned to you, I've never formally taken a public health communications class.

194
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:06,799
This is all something that I've learned, you know, in sprinkling throughout my class and in my time as a public health professional,

195
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:15,320
I've only known one person who specifically went to get a Ph.D. in public health communications at Northwestern,

196
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,889
and that person didn't even end up finishing their doctorate.

197
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,550
They're like a yoga instructor now or something like that. Well, teach their own.

198
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:29,840
But I want to point out this was a campaign by the South Dakota government a few years ago.

199
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:38,659
And depending on the information that you put on the campaign, it changes the meaning.

200
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,920
Right. So obviously, people worked on this at the state.

201
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:56,960
So, you know, okay, so if you read it, you could say meth, I'm on it or meth we're on it or meth I'm on it or meth.

202
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,700
We're on it, too. We get that nuance.

203
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:13,730
So I think what they meant was the latter, because methamphetamine use in South Dakota was the was is a huge issue.

204
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:22,880
So they wanted to tell the people of South Dakota that the state health department was on addressing the issue, in fact.

205
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:31,580
But this made national news. And, you know, I think it definitely got people talking about the campaign.

206
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:39,860
Right. But to what effect it actually addressed the issue, I'm not entirely sure.

207
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,850
And here's some early public health communication for COVID 19.

208
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:56,300
So this one, you know, you have a young boy or a youth getting my COVID 19 vaccine means I can get back to my favorite activities.

209
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:02,420
And then so that one is more like anecdotal information personalizing, right?

210
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,520
This one is more like a infographic. It's safe, it's free.

211
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,510
It'll help protect your family. You might get side effects.

212
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:19,500
Side effects of Read your mind. No, no, sorry. Side effects are spelt wrong.

213
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,130
So somebody did not proofread this. You should feel better in days.

214
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:29,610
Get the first vaccine if you can keep taking basic prevention steps until you're fully vaccinated.

215
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:39,000
The have social distancing thing. And then this third one is a very a more longer like evacuee situation.

216
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:46,260
So, I mean for all. So depending on the kind of person you are and what information you might like,

217
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:52,710
what information you're more susceptible to receiving, that's why they tried to create these different modalities.

218
00:24:52,980 --> 00:25:01,320
But obviously, you have to roll this out very carefully because if you like, even before COVID, think about going to the doctor's office or whatever,

219
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,320
they've forever had those signs that are like the cover your cough signs with the little cartoon on it.

220
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:16,760
And in America in particular, I feel like we're more susceptible to like sign or flier fatigue.

221
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:23,410
They all feel that way because sometimes there's so much information or there's so many fliers.

222
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:27,360
Like, your eyes just glaze over them. You don't even read it.

223
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:35,610
In a parallel example, if you think about like road signs in the United States, just pay attention.

224
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:45,120
If you're like driving home later today, how many signs there are like sequentially for construction, roundabouts, turns, etc.?

225
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:50,520
If you go anywhere else like Europe, for example, they don't have as many signs.

226
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:58,800
And so the National Highway Traffic Safety Association has done some studies that show like because of the number of signs,

227
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:02,879
traffic signs we have everywhere in the U.S., it gets confusing for people.

228
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,010
It actually causes more accidents than it's meant to, like prevent sometimes.

229
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:15,600
So in terms of like communication, right, in order to communicate properly,

230
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,270
we do need to understand the incidence and distribution and possible control of the disease.

231
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,580
And this is all data.

232
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:33,059
But, you know, as of July and 21, that the Hopkins actually COVID dashboard was very useful and excellent in terms of providing this data.

233
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,770
But again, more so numerical than than qualitative.

234
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:45,890
So thinking so thinking back into you, towards public health communication,

235
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:51,209
some of the things that they want to convey in terms of how we're doing it.

236
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:57,180
And these are key principles that Dr. BIDDINGER mentioned in his lecture in particular.

237
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,380
They're clear, they're concise, right?

238
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:07,350
Ideally not contradictory. They're quickly addressed.

239
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:18,000
You take into like an empathetic approach to communications as well, and then, you know, they're accurate.

240
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:34,920
So thinking about the CDC in particular and where we have been now for the almost last three years, what do you think it would take?

241
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:45,960
First of all, how many? Just the show of hands. How many? We all think it's possible for the CDC to get back in the good graces of the public.

242
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,430
Raise your hand if you think this. Okay.

243
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:56,370
Oh, just Chloe and Burnley. So everybody else does it?

244
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:03,429
Not in our lifetime, you think? I think in our lifetime.

245
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:08,140
In our lifetime. Okay. Not next five years?

246
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,969
No. Ten. Maybe.

247
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:17,110
Maybe. What? What do you think it would take to turn?

248
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:26,430
Turn the ship around? Hoda.

249
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:32,920
I think if they don't acknowledge that they pulled off the ball, it'll be hard to like.

250
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:38,310
Trust that they even knew that they felt like you did.

251
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:47,149
You know that I feel like they do know, you know. But it's one of those things where, like accountability goes a huge weight for people.

252
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:51,380
If you can hold yourself accountable, that means that in the future, I think you can hold yourself accountable.

253
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:59,479
And without that, for me, it's hard to think that you hold yourself accountable, that accountable, shared Sawhill.

254
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:07,129
Did you ever raise your hand? Yeah. I think one thing is like dissociating itself a little bit more out of partizan politics,

255
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,750
because I feel like during these during the last presidential administration,

256
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:17,540
like it was very the like the Trump administration had like a lot of influence

257
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:21,650
on the CDC and like the kind of communication that they were putting out.

258
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:28,969
And I think that might be a little bit better now, but I think that would serve the public trust within CDC.

259
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,740
And I think also just like time heals a lot of things in general.

260
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:41,329
So I feel like in ten years, for example, a lot of people would just like forget about all the like minor details within the COVID response.

261
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:45,380
But I think the whole public and just like really getting some of that distrust.

262
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:54,649
Yeah. Yeah. I'll be curious to see Page. I see. I'll be curious to see what they put in like history textbooks or like how did it

263
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:59,420
or like did any of you take AP government where you have to like do those prompts,

264
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:06,830
be curious. A page? Oh, yeah. I was kind of thinking something similar, just like maybe better for listening on both sides of the spectrum.

265
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:12,330
Yeah. This is very dangerous, like I said, during the last administration.

266
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,160
Yeah. I don't. Yeah.

267
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:23,270
I feel like for the for the for the in terms of what everybody that kind of combining with everyone saying definitely the accountability.

268
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:36,080
I, I feel like the best time they could have done that was when Biden took over in office because it was like a new administration and it is like,

269
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,219
you know, we're acknowledging we fumbled the ball.

270
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,250
But starting today, like we're charting a new leaf.

271
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:51,200
But now we're like 11 months into this administration and they still haven't come forward yet.

272
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,150
So I'm not sure if and when that might happen.

273
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:08,760
Yes, but they are. I mean, the CDC is still actively doing some things like there's a huge listeria outbreak again right now going

274
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:16,550
on with like cold cuts and deli cheeses that are causing a number of deaths in a cluster of states,

275
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,370
specifically, you know, women who might be expecting.

276
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:25,109
And so they're still doing all their like foodborne illness, etc., etc., etc.

277
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:28,380
But I think they're trying to scale back a lot of the COVID stuff.

278
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:33,840
It might take a period of them, I don't know, laying low for a bit.

279
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:45,000
It was interesting. So I was actually I did a quick pop over this weekend into Texas and I was meeting some folks

280
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,920
there and and contrasting the different responses that Texas and Michigan had to COVID.

281
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:58,500
Obviously, they were shocked to find out that we're still wearing masks here.

282
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:06,480
Shocked, Shook. I was like, Yeah, we still have like screening checks at our building.

283
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:15,180
And they were like, We stopped that like August of 2020, which, you know, maybe is not surprising to anybody in the room,

284
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:26,639
but it was interesting to hear their perspective about how they said, you know, one lady lived at a low like a smaller town outside.

285
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,379
And she said all the local buffets initially shut down,

286
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:40,110
but then all the buffet owners decided that they were going to reopen at the same time, even though they weren't, like, allowed to yet.

287
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:46,020
But if they did it, like, then all of the buffets would just not stay closed.

288
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,530
And for the small town, apparently this is a very buffet going town.

289
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:59,099
And so they said they this is, again, anecdotal information that she said that there didn't seem to be a rise in COVID cases from the buffets.

290
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:04,319
It seemed to be more so like people going to church or like doing other things.

291
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,590
But at that point you have community spread. So I was just like, Aha!

292
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:18,930
And then and then other folks kind of talked about how they feel like the strict COVID protocols and masking

293
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:27,149
mandates have affected the quality of education for the students and like their learning experience in particular.

294
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:37,200
Because I know for y'all this is probably like maybe the first semester in your two year program where you're like back to fully in-person, right?

295
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,200
So it's it's definitely a different transition.

296
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:47,730
So obviously every every locality and even every state has its different public health measures.

297
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:54,360
We didn't talk as much about their perception of public health communication.

298
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:01,559
This was at a school of public health, so obviously they value keeping the public safe.

299
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:08,340
But I was surprised to hear from one person that they thought, you know, they said they weren't a fan of Abbott, who's the governor there,

300
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:20,670
but they thought one of the good things he did was the ability to give students their as normal of an experience as they could.

301
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:29,640
It's pros and cons, because I've talked to some folks at Texas Institutions and they said that in Texas they're

302
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:38,100
much more forgiving if people get COVID and die than if you impede on their personal freedoms.

303
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:46,709
So definitely an interesting difference in values. And as we go forward in public health communication, kind of thinking about, number one,

304
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:56,400
who the target audience is just because the same messaging that you use is not going to work for for all swaths of the country.

305
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:05,430
Right. Yes. I just want to point out that there were big differences across the university, too.

306
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,760
So Abby and I were at Ford last year. How was that?

307
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,989
And they didn't do any kinds of screening.

308
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,970
They didn't really care.

309
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:22,920
Like they I guess they were like, well, we don't have a front desk or someone hired to do a screening check for when you walk into the building.

310
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,749
So on our systems,

311
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:33,090
there was very slight difference between my first year being entirely remote at the School of Public Health and then last year every person,

312
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,480
oh, and like distancing didn't matter.

313
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,590
You had an econ lecture with like more than 100 people. Interesting.

314
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:48,300
Which would not have happened. Oh, no. So, like, even between schools and departments, very, very different.

315
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:58,980
Yes. Thank you for highlighting that. I will say we are one of the few units schools institutes because there's 19 across campus last that.

316
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:07,700
Is hybrid. So if you go to like medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, like they've required their staff to like.

317
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:11,750
I'll be back in person since, since the beginning of the fall semester.

318
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:18,500
Whereas here, like I feel like upstairs, at least on the sixth floor roaming the hallways, it's still mostly empty for the most part.

319
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:26,360
So, yeah. Any final thoughts on communication before we move?

320
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:34,720
Okay. So now talking more about intervention, design and implementation.

321
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:44,110
So if we're trying to then address a specific emergency response or infectious disease issue kind of thinking again,

322
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:47,650
how this is also going to be integrated into your commentary.

323
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,340
Are you suggesting something primary, secondary, tertiary?

324
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:56,680
What's the method of delivery? What scheme levels are you addressing?

325
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:02,120
And then what are the plans for continuation? And then how you're actually evaluating it.

326
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:08,379
So this is a big one that folks often forget when they implement a program

327
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:14,020
or an intervention or even something that is a program like vaccine rollout,

328
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:22,720
for example. How many all have taken a program evaluation course to people?

329
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,830
How many of you will take a program evaluation course before you graduate?

330
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:37,210
Okay, a third person that is so interesting to me, I had to take a program evaluation courses, part of my yes mirror.

331
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:42,490
You don't make those courses very accessible all you want and non-infringing students

332
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:45,850
aren't allowed to take it right because they prioritize the beauty with students.

333
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:50,349
Yeah, I tried to go through I tried to look at the yeah, yeah.

334
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:59,050
I was talking to one of my colleagues about how different your master's education is here compared to my masters education.

335
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:04,510
So my masters education was yours is 60 credit hours, right?

336
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:16,270
-45. It's still a C F accredited. But here the difference is that you take a lot of specialized classes and not that many general classes.

337
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:21,430
Whereas for me, my concentration was community oriented care, primary care.

338
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:29,980
I only took 12 credit hours of specialized courses and the rest was like general public health, like addressing the core.

339
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,799
But I still feel like those four that I took was sufficient because we did like intensive projects.

340
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:44,020
We were like out in the field doing field trips. It was very intensive, but I took like health promotion and intervention design program evaluation.

341
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,629
Health inequities classes bias that AP health behavior.

342
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:53,650
All of us had to take a health behavior course across. They didn't care what concentration were.

343
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:59,590
AP about that. And I feel like it's a very different model of education because it does give

344
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,320
you like a more holistic appreciation as a public health practitioner was here,

345
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:13,510
they're very focused on like more specialized like so when you go out, you are ready to do like this thing.

346
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,559
But then sometimes people do end up in more broad based jobs.

347
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,590
So it's kind of like then you're having to learn everything.

348
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:32,620
Trial by fire. Yeah. Lucky of graduated because they're redoing the public health core again although the faculty is a redo all the classes.

349
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:40,030
So what the evaluation there's too there's you know these are the formal definitions

350
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:45,219
of evaluation and a program which I'll let you read because it's quite long,

351
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:53,110
but there's process and there's outcomes evaluation. So process evaluation is essentially as we're going along, implementing the thing,

352
00:39:53,530 --> 00:40:00,790
doing essentially dynamic check ins and checking and then improving processes as they're happening,

353
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:05,859
whereas outcomes evaluations can be short, intermediate or long term.

354
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:11,470
Where we look at, you know, the month after, three months after and then a year after,

355
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:16,750
again going back and trying to collect that qualitative and quantitative data,

356
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:28,240
did we accomplish what we actually sought to accomplish a lot of the times in, as we talked about, emergency response in particular,

357
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:35,170
they'll do both process and outcomes evaluations now in emergency or an infectious disease response.

358
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:40,690
Sometimes it's difficult to modify things dynamically, right?

359
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:48,489
Like, for example, like in a hurricane response, but in something like a vaccine, roll out easy to modify something dynamically.

360
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:54,250
Like if you're getting long queues for example, at the registration process is bad or wonky.

361
00:40:54,910 --> 00:41:04,030
And then in terms of the short term, you know that the hot wash or the after action report is considered like a short term outcomes evaluation.

362
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:13,240
And then in the like recovery period and then the planning period is when you're kind of looking back at your long term outcomes data.

363
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:28,600
Now when we're oh, okay. So this one here drawing back to the things that we've talked about in class before regarding.

364
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,340
Communications.

365
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:38,560
And then in periods where, like things are dying down, how are people taking their approaches of like addressing the public in particular?

366
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:42,700
You know, I've talked about this briefly in class. This was earlier in August.

367
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,370
Medical experts are becoming influencers among all the anxiety over monkeypox.

368
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,479
So I do want to open this BuzzFeed article.

369
00:41:52,480 --> 00:42:05,680
I know it's not the most like academic source, but so this one here, this is the one that I was talking about there, Dr. Saskia Pappas.

370
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:11,650
You had like kind of claps back at her. So this lady is a sleep doctor.

371
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:16,120
And this was a tweet that she had that had over 40,000 likes.

372
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:22,780
Once monkeypox is detectable in the wastewater, it's game over for eradication.

373
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:26,769
The sewers are swarming with rats. It will become endemic.

374
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:30,129
We need to resume universal vaccination against smallpox.

375
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:34,600
Monkey pox. Monkey pox has been found in the wastewater in San Francisco.

376
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,930
This was in July of 2022.

377
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:41,320
As we've seen, it's not become endemic.

378
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:48,820
Right. And then so this tweet, very divisive, calling her claim, bad idea, absolute garbage,

379
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:55,480
misinformation became trending associated topic for Google searches involving wastewater.

380
00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:04,180
COVID introduced us to the virus influencer in particular, and they find ways to like get into the conversation.

381
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:13,810
And then this one talks about Eric Ding, an epidemiologist who has over 720,000 followers because of this COVID out date,

382
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:22,420
shared a post from a man claiming he contracted monkeypox via scooter handlebars, ending his tweet with the eyes emojis.

383
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:26,920
But many criticize the doctor for sharing unverified story.

384
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:38,020
Benjamin Ryan, science reporter 4500 followers in a matter of days when he wrote Men who have sex with me instead of men who have sex with men,

385
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:46,870
and that, you know, they're kind of talking about all these various implications about monkeypox in particular.

386
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:53,589
So not this one is zero. I'm not sure what Denise the wild is getting out here,

387
00:43:53,590 --> 00:44:01,510
but she appears to be wrongly suggesting that there is substantial spread of monkeypox through the means of sex between men.

388
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:09,879
Evidence strongly suggests more causal means of transmission are in common and then people are arguing amongst themselves.

389
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:20,440
So if you're on academic Twitter, this is happening like at any given time and it's wild because now these informal communications,

390
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,209
I kind of don't I don't like this,

391
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:31,900
but all of us have to like play this game now where when I became an academic, I did not expect to have like a public facing persona or profile.

392
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:39,730
But now it's kind of like what you have to do to market yourself and like get people to be aware of your research and your work.

393
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,529
Which on one hand I think is very important for like particularly scholars of color.

394
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:51,069
And like because we get cited less often and then generally like people pick up our

395
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:54,610
work and that affects your like h index and blah blah blah and all this kind of stuff.

396
00:44:54,970 --> 00:45:00,220
But it's also the ability just to spread a ton of misinformation.

397
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,180
I don't think any of y'all went to AP this year, did you?

398
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:13,180
There was like some splashy protests at the beginning of the planning of the conference because originally wasn't going to require masks.

399
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:19,300
And that's a huge conference of public health professionals, about 12 to 15000 every year.

400
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:27,910
So they were like, how is the foremost public health association in the United States not going to require masking at the conference?

401
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:38,770
And so if you look at some early communications, they eventually like backpedaled and then put out this statement essentially about masks.

402
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:48,940
And then Dr. Leana Wen, who is like a political pundit, but also physician who who's become very vocal during COVID as well,

403
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:53,890
that she was going to be on the opening session as like a panel speaker.

404
00:45:54,610 --> 00:46:00,310
And that gained a lot of controversy. And then people were going to protest the conference as well.

405
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:07,660
I did not attend this year, having attended for a couple of years, but for very different reasons.

406
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:13,359
But it's it's interesting to see how these things are perpetuated online because then

407
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:19,030
people will pick up expert tweets and then those will become news stories as well.

408
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:27,850
A recent one that I, I actually got anonymous because I feel like peer review people get pretty savage but it was.

409
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:41,880
Of Psychology article authored by what looks like the names of mostly Chinese authors, but kind of talking about systemic racism.

410
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:47,459
And the crux of the whole paper was that it was the fault of individuals,

411
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:52,770
and minorities were not essentially like pulling themselves up from their bootstraps.

412
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:57,600
And this was published in a pretty prominent psychology journal.

413
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:03,930
And I at first saw Dr. William Lopez comment on it, which is how I'd like ended up in my feet.

414
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:10,740
He's also very vocal of mine, but I was just thinking to myself like, how did this get through peer review?

415
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:18,810
Because if it's it's gone through a peer review with at least like a couple of people who like speak English natively.

416
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,889
So usually it ends up in the United States or like Europe or whatever.

417
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:31,320
And at least like two people had to have their eyes on this article and then somehow it went went through.

418
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:36,240
It just blows my mind. But anyway, I just wanted to highlight that in regard to that.

419
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:42,389
But you know, subject matter expertise can be taken with a grain of salt.

420
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:46,080
Generally it is a good thing. So subject matter expertise,

421
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:52,350
you're trained in a specific area that are what we typed and what Dr. Kirstein talked about was like pieces to a

422
00:47:52,350 --> 00:48:00,180
puzzle in identifying and controlling the impact of infectious diseases or a part of like an inner professional team.

423
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,280
But I liked what she said in that. Like, just because we're all pieces of a puzzle,

424
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,800
does it necessarily mean it makes like a perfect picture because there's a lot of complementary expertise.

425
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:20,930
But in the realm of infectious disease and emergency response, you generally have subject matter expertise in this area in particular.

426
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,839
These are just some examples of what we've done during COVID.

427
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:33,030
So Michigan researchers get $5.3 million to expand COVID 19 wastewater monitoring.

428
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:39,689
So this is a partnership with Environmental, Health and Safety, our department.

429
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:47,069
So Dr. Shi, Dr. Neitzel, Dr. Davon Engineering and then a couple of different units.

430
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:52,740
So, you know, Dr. Xi is still monitoring the wastewater now here on campus.

431
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:59,760
We're moving towards polio, RSV and other things, but it's really cool how early they partnered with the engineering department back

432
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:05,969
when campus was still empty to test aerodynamics and fluid dynamics in particular,

433
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:11,129
and how it moved on busses and how you could go back to taking, you know,

434
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:17,700
like the circulator or the ride and what the maximum capacity was in terms of safety.

435
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:24,690
Thinking about like aerosol sampling in the classrooms, how many were in the classroom or a gym.

436
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:30,719
One, like one of Rick's student workers showed up to, like, set up an air sampling machine.

437
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,340
Yeah, you guys saw that. Was it noisy? It was, yeah.

438
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:42,980
They were pretty clunky, but they were able to find out that aerosol transmission in a classroom was really limited.

439
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:53,100
It's mostly fomite based droplets, but even that was still pretty minimal with all the precautions we had here and allowing time for again

440
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:58,890
those fomites to defecate and kind of die off in the environment after an extended period of time,

441
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:11,400
I had the opportunity to do a couple of blogs on returning to work safely in Michigan and across the United States.

442
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,660
This was published in May before I even started working here.

443
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,489
So I was still working at Indiana University, but they knew I was coming and they were like,

444
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:25,139
Hey, you do these things, so can you like do a series of blog posts about it?

445
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:30,570
And I think I talked about it briefly before Dr. Neitzel and I worked with the Michigan

446
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:38,670
Department of Labor and and Gretchen Whitmer's task force essentially to reopen Michigan safely.

447
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:46,830
So what this encompassed was what the Department of Labor, each of the major industries we had construction,

448
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:52,379
we had retail and restaurants, gambling had their own thing.

449
00:50:52,380 --> 00:51:03,420
We had education office. Each industry group had to like meet amongst themselves and come up with a PowerPoint presentation,

450
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:13,290
essentially like 20 slides long on all the different COVID measures that they were going to take and new standard operating procedures.

451
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:23,340
And then Rick and I essentially like had like three days where we like just stayed up like reading through all of them and providing corrections.

452
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:28,200
So like, for example, in an elevator like this, we're.

453
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:36,980
For example, they were going to put those little feed stickers on each of the four corners that show where people stand.

454
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:40,280
And it's like, What is the point of this?

455
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:51,680
Even like you have four people still in a very confined essentially to like, I don't know, three by five cube and then some industries.

456
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,120
And then we had to determine what we call control banding, how many.

457
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,930
We have heard the term control banding before. I see.

458
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:10,939
Chloe, you're nodding your head. So very early on in the semester, we talked about, you know, basic controls on the hierarchy of controls, right?

459
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:16,099
So for certain things like pneumonia or benzene,

460
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:25,160
we have what we call permissible exposure limits for how much a person can be exposed to in an eight hour day and still be safe.

461
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:37,219
Right. But for things like pathogens, which we consider the most nefarious workplace or public hazard is because you can't see it with your naked eye.

462
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:41,990
You don't know when it's there and you can't get an automatic read on it,

463
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:46,820
like something like temperature, for example, or like radiation or like certain chemicals.

464
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:56,749
You can get an instrument and directly quantify that, but also because of the complexity of how pathogens are affected by the size of a room,

465
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:00,560
air exchanges, temperature, humidity, all that kind of stuff,

466
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:07,220
you can't definitively give it like a number or or anything like that to how hazardous it is.

467
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:14,090
So we have to do something called control banding where essentially we kind of take into consideration this holistic view.

468
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:23,899
And you might see it as something like low risk, moderate risk, high risk, or like some people do like green, yellow, orange, red bubble.

469
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:32,540
So that's essentially control banding. So that's what we had to do for all these industries in particular, and then decide who could go back first.

470
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:42,740
And so we decided the first industry to go back was outdoor construction with some modifications for indoor residential construction.

471
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:47,959
They went back May 7th, the government slowly rolled back and then gambling.

472
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:53,330
We said, Y'all going to go back? Looks like you're not an essential service.

473
00:53:53,330 --> 00:54:00,110
And essentially all people do in those facilities is touch things.

474
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:09,800
And most of the population that goes to like casinos and stuff tend to be retirees or older folks who are immunocompromised.

475
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:22,610
You allow smoking indoors, right? So you're more likely to have folks who might have COPD, chronic asthma, weakened lungs due to smoking.

476
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:33,110
So these were all considerations that we had to take into account when we were tapped on to provide subject matter expertise for COVID 19.

477
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,840
Was they paid for any of this on the.

478
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:44,989
No, but I got a kudos from my department that was like, thanks for your service, but I do other subject matter expertise,

479
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:49,700
stuff like for the National Disaster Medical System, which I am paid a pretty penny.

480
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:55,700
That is something that you can still do, by the way, depending on your job is contract work.

481
00:54:55,700 --> 00:55:05,240
Where here as a faculty member, I'm allowed one day a week, meaning four days out of the month where I can do contract services as an individual.

482
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:16,969
Just remember, you have to hold a third of that back for taxes. So now I want to move on to public health practitioners role in emergency response

483
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:21,290
because we've previously talked about our role in infectious disease response.

484
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:29,780
Okay. So yeah, we talked about the puzzle analogy, you know, in a broad roles, right?

485
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:36,139
We want to initiate response during the first 24 hours of that acute phase and then coordinate

486
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:41,120
with existing emergency response structures where types of incidents that we've talked about.

487
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:46,309
So this might include emergency management services, medical services, medical health,

488
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:54,110
behavioral care providers, fire law enforcement, state, local, tribal, territorial, humanitarian.

489
00:55:54,110 --> 00:56:03,470
And then we talked now about the service. So first is create operational objectives for the emergency response.

490
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:09,319
A lot of times people will just go out and just, you know, put out whatever is on fire first.

491
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:13,700
But what as a team are you defining as the objectives?

492
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:21,290
Is it to, number one, put out the literal fire or get people to evacuate, seek shelter,

493
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:28,220
and then provide epidemiological surveillance at the time, if you can, whether that be we're making.

494
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:33,900
Morbidities syndrome. It very seldom do people collect behavioral mental.

495
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:44,849
There is a typo in terms of their epidemiological surveillance and then, you know, registries for the affected populations, plans, procedures,

496
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:54,290
guidelines were public affairs and risk communications and then assuring that participating personnel are indeed certified in trained.

497
00:56:54,300 --> 00:57:00,420
So whether that is orientation or personal protective equipment situation specific scenario.

498
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:08,220
So we've talked before about for health care teams in particular how it's great if they train or exercise quarterly for these types of scenarios.

499
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:14,490
And then we talked about like a week, week and a half ago about certs or the Community Emergency Response Team,

500
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:18,750
how they in fact do receive like that funding from FEMA to get trained.

501
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:27,990
But these teams in particular also generally when you're deployed, get something called a jet or a jet jet just in time training.

502
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:31,949
So I imagine like for fast, for example, when you deployed to Kentucky,

503
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:36,720
you got a jet where you basically have had some sort of training leading up to that time.

504
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:38,580
And then when you land on the ground,

505
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:50,129
the first hour or two is an orientation of like what's going on and this is what you're likely to encounter now in particular with Jets.

506
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:55,170
They do this a lot with volunteers deployed by the American Red Cross, for example.

507
00:57:55,470 --> 00:58:05,100
Even national disaster medical personnel like Dr. BIDDINGER, when he deploys, gets these types of deep debriefings before you deploy.

508
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:14,700
And then again participating in planning, design and conducting of exercises and then reviewing air hours and then direct aid.

509
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:25,139
So one example that I want to provide to you in particular is this case study looking at the evaluation of public

510
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:32,549
health response to hurricanes to allow North Carolina to be better prepared for public health emergencies.

511
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:39,420
So North Carolina and the coastal states in particular, as climate change progresses in the next decade,

512
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,890
are going to be severely affected by hurricane season.

513
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:53,520
So they had pretty devastating Hurricane Floyd and Isabel in the late nineties and early 2000, keeping in mind that this was pre-Katrina.

514
00:58:54,360 --> 00:59:02,280
So Floyd was considered category two with about 15 to 20 inches of rain and 57 deaths.

515
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:08,220
And then Isabel was also Category two, 4 to 7 inches of rain and 16 deaths.

516
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:20,190
So at this time, the CDC provided like these large scale grants to different states to essentially improve public health preparedness.

517
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:30,330
So the state of North Carolina used this and they adapted no, jeez, disaster phases framework for analysis.

518
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:40,530
So this is a framework used by Japanese health officials and public health preparedness folks in Japan,

519
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:49,830
where they use this framework to decide like what are the components that we're looking for to try to improve our emergency response?

520
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:58,650
And this was a qualitative study that they did where they conducted 32 interviews from various agencies in North Carolina.

521
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,219
These are photos of some of the destruction on the side.

522
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:08,250
And they found that public health departments that use federal bioterrorism cooperative agreements,

523
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:16,500
that's been a capacity building and functional capabilities to improve public health preparedness and response is generally they were more

524
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:27,840
successful if they did that capacity building rather than spending it on things like tertiary prevention or tertiary care and then like rebuilding.

525
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:34,680
And the evaluation of these hurricanes in particular revealed that measuring

526
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:42,300
preparedness alone does not test capabilities in real time and emergency conditions.

527
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:50,910
Right. Because you can think all you want about how things will be rolled out, but when it's actually executed, nothing is absolutely perfect.

528
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:56,610
So thinking about how protocols needed significant improvement.

529
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:03,870
So from there they were able to obviously better their situations for subsequent hurricanes.

530
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:18,240
One, I guess real time example that I'll use for me more so related to protocols and procedures is related to air sampling.

531
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,479
How many all have have done air sampling.

532
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:24,840
I took that lab class Burnley.

533
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:30,950
Okay, just apparently. Have you had a chance to do air sampling outside of the lab since then?

534
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:42,679
It is so different in real life. So for all of you who might have taken a lab doing air sampling, so generally when you do air sampling,

535
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:47,749
you're supposed to calibrate your instruments before you go out in the field

536
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:51,360
or before you're on site just to make sure that it's functioning properly.

537
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:58,850
And then when you sample the air, you know, you pull up like Nyasha or OSHA, and they'll generally tell you,

538
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:03,250
like what air flow rate you need to set your pumps at and how long you need to, like,

539
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:07,850
collect the air for because it'll depend on the compounds that you're looking for.

540
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:14,550
But in a lab, of course, we're in a perfect climate controlled environment.

541
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:17,990
It's beautiful. It's like, I don't know what.

542
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:22,040
70 degrees in here. There's good lighting.

543
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:26,780
You have your resources. Great, great.

544
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:35,150
And it's still kind of also difficult in a lab setting. So I will say my first experience where I would say, for example,

545
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:42,050
preparedness alone does not test real time capabilities was in this scenario where I was doing air sampling in those math,

546
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:49,580
those clandestine meth labs where I've previously mentioned, like we had to use that crowbar from my car to bust in.

547
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:53,840
So at that time it was Muncie, it was November.

548
01:02:54,770 --> 01:03:03,980
We were trying to sample for volatile organic compounds that might be the remnants of doing essentially the shake and bake method of meth.

549
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:09,319
But what we did not anticipate was that this house has been broken into multiple

550
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:15,530
times because people were squatting in it and the windows were still broken,

551
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:24,080
meaning in the last year since it was a clandestine meth lab that it has essentially been airing out.

552
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:30,190
Right. So what volatile organic compounds are still there in the colder temperatures?

553
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:33,360
It was like less than 40 degrees that day.

554
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:40,850
A volatile organic organic compounds in cold temperatures tend to sink to the ground.

555
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:45,260
They're not volatile, rising because or vaporizing because it's colder.

556
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:50,330
Thankfully, we got ahead and did bring some space heaters.

557
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:55,850
But because of the fact that this was like a clandestine meth lab, that was an old house,

558
01:03:55,850 --> 01:04:04,700
there was no insulation, the space heaters barely brought the house temperature more than five degrees up.

559
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:14,299
So we air sample for a period of 3 hours, sent the lab the tubes to the lab to get to look at.

560
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:20,160
And by the time like they brought it home, almost nothing, basically.

561
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,670
So I would have said like that didn't that was not perfect at all.

562
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:35,630
My faculty member left me for 3 hours because he said he was going to McDonald's to get a coffee and then he just like did not come back for 3 hours.

563
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:47,450
So here I was just like in this, like full Tyvek suit in a clandestine meth lab that had, like, no heating, no electricity, no bathroom.

564
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:52,220
And I was just, like, changing out these tubes myself.

565
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:57,739
So I would say that was definitely a situation where, like the capabilities of tests,

566
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:03,049
like real time emergency conditions or even when you're doing these exercises in

567
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:07,820
health care facilities where they have sometimes they have these simulations

568
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:18,140
of what they call like man down or like person down where they'll simulate a health care provider fainting while providing care just because of the,

569
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:22,550
you know, hotness of their PPE.

570
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:26,900
You know, we exercise those kinds of things, but when it actually happens,

571
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:30,649
you don't know what will actually happen if they're middle in the middle of

572
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:35,360
like doing an IV line for a patient that's totally different than just them,

573
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:41,270
just like falling in the hallway outside an exercise when they're not actually doing anything.

574
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:46,100
So those are just some some examples to think about now.

575
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:53,150
Oh, okay. So how are we going to influence communication and culture change?

576
01:05:54,650 --> 01:06:00,200
So risk communication is defined as the science and art that confronts a dilemma.

577
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:11,150
So, you know, for very for relatively non-hazardous risk, they try to get people to calm down about a situation like SaaS, for example.

578
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:19,040
This is I'm talking 2000 to SaaS, right? Not COVID or like flu or the mold or and then for overlooked hazards,

579
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:24,590
we generally want people the public health risk communication strategy is like wake up people.

580
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:28,150
Smoking is bad for you. Radon is bad for you.

581
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:34,940
You should wear seat belts. So what the drives the risk communication is.

582
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:41,270
Number one, is the public interested in and at all this is fueled by the media, environmental issues,

583
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:49,730
the demand for information on past, present, future event events, the extent of like I have the right to know,

584
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:53,780
but also what's the level of mistrust in authorities,

585
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:59,990
government recognition of the issue and then the ability to amplify or attenuate

586
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:05,930
the impression of the risk barriers are messages that are inconsistent,

587
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:10,100
overly complex, confusing and complete lack of trust.

588
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:16,460
Selective media reports. And then psychological and social factors which we've previously discussed.

589
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,080
Now, what causes outrage in people?

590
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:23,120
A lot of things in particular,

591
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:32,060
but one in particular that causes that historically has caused outrage was effects on children and effects on future generations.

592
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:43,430
Now, there's always exceptions to these rules, in particular because we do not necessarily see this with COVID in terms of population immunity.

593
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:47,690
But we did see this in terms of what are the harms of the vaccine.

594
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:53,060
So people can be selective in terms of what they decide or their outrage factors.

595
01:07:53,330 --> 01:08:01,700
So people weren't outraged about the fact that kids were missing out on school and getting super behind

596
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:07,070
even further behind on their education because adults couldn't just like buckle down and wear masks,

597
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:14,780
get vaccinated, etc. But they were very concerned about the effects of getting the COVID vaccine on kids.

598
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:23,540
Right. And then again, all these things we've previously discussed about like, is that a human versus natural origin?

599
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:32,180
Catastrophic potential. So the risk perception equation is essentially risk is what is the actual hazard,

600
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:41,660
plus what is the level of outrage that people have about it and that will determine what their perception of the risk actually is.

601
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:53,620
Now, this grade in particular, if we look at the ability to predict from low to high and then the level of human infliction or control,

602
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:03,010
if we look at something like, let's say, hurricanes, tornadoes and forest fires, right?

603
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:07,850
We have a high ability to be able to predict hurricanes, tornadoes and forest fires.

604
01:09:08,150 --> 01:09:11,479
But our level of control over it is pretty low. Right.

605
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,030
I can't like. I know.

606
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:24,640
Was it I feel like at one point President Trump suggested that we have a someone fly over the eye of a hurricane and then drop a bomb into it.

607
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:34,760
Okay. That was a real yes. So that's over to my imagination. But another example, like we have not just a bomb who is like a nuclear bomb.

608
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:44,899
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. And like, you know, we have a high ability to predict lifestyle, eating choices, smoking exercise,

609
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:52,700
but also I have a high ability to control that where as something like terrorism, for example, low ability to predict.

610
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:58,730
But, you know, depending on what the type of terrorism is, sometimes of high ability to control.

611
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:04,999
So in risk. I mean, yes, hoda sorry. I would just go back to that chart.

612
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:14,120
Where is the like is risk considered highest in the top risk is considered highest

613
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:22,220
with the low with the lowest ability to predict and the lowest ability to control.

614
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:26,360
Yes, the bottom right is trying to figure out. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

615
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:33,050
And then and then the on the opposite side, like risk is lowest in the upper right hand quadrant.

616
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,190
Right. Because those are like general autonomy over that.

617
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:40,430
It's like the unpredictable and uncontrollable.

618
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:51,380
So generally how risk communications evolves is the first step is we ignore the public drivers still trying to like what?

619
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:55,070
What is our plan, what are we doing then explaining the risk.

620
01:10:55,070 --> 01:11:02,810
Veda is the second stage dialoging with the community and then ideally the fourth stage is treating the public as a full partner.

621
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:08,120
The EPA does have seven cardinal rules of risk communication.

622
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:18,259
And I will say, although the EPA was, you know, somewhat affected by the partizanship in recent years,

623
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:26,480
for the most part compared to the CDC, for example, I feel like the EPA has been more resistant or unaffected.

624
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:36,030
To bipartisanship, of course, like their guidelines and regulations change depending on the administration that's in control.

625
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:46,260
But I would say that their risk communication is generally better than the CDC, but also people are less.

626
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:54,700
Incensed when it comes to matters of the environment, the matters of the community or the public.

627
01:11:55,060 --> 01:12:03,370
Just because for a lot of folks, the environment is seen as not like a living thing,

628
01:12:03,370 --> 01:12:10,000
not like the lives are being affected, even though it is in a in a less tangible way.

629
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:17,080
So therefore, there's seven rules. Are you accepting involve the public as a legitimate partner.

630
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:24,670
You know, involving them in clarifying decisions about risk that are both based on magnitude and concern.

631
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:29,680
Listening to the audience acknowledging that what they said was actually understood.

632
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:36,430
The honest, frank and open coordinating and collaborating with credible sources,

633
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:43,030
meeting the needs of the media, recognizing that they are the prime transmitter of information.

634
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,509
So generally what I've folks that I've talked to,

635
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:52,720
they know not to [INAUDIBLE] off the media because they can really affect the way that your story is communicated.

636
01:12:53,650 --> 01:13:01,720
Speaking clearly and with compassion and then planning carefully and evaluating performance and how that message was received,

637
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:07,900
you avoid using technical jargon, only use humor if directed at yourself.

638
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:14,920
You know, so in that like self-deprecating way, we're not trying to disparage other people,

639
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:20,979
refute negatives without repeating them, using visuals to emphasize key points.

640
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:28,090
Remaining calm. Using personal pronouns like I or we rather than like they them.

641
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:34,510
And then focus remarks on empathy, competence, honesty and dedication.

642
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:46,209
Okay. How many? Okay. So for public health communication and for infectious diseases, again, this will depend on that scholar institution aims.

643
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:50,380
But we want to have these recommendations in particulars.

644
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:57,610
And one thing that I noticed that, you know, being trained as a health behavior practitioner that's not necessarily something

645
01:13:57,610 --> 01:14:03,939
used widely is its messaging is best informed if it's based on theories and models,

646
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:07,690
which some disciplines don't necessarily use.

647
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:11,020
But empirically we know that is what is best.

648
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:13,660
And then strategically crafting messages.

649
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:25,570
So the Met wear on it campaign that was probably like very strategically crafted and then piloting or testing out the materials or the messaging.

650
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:30,220
How many of you have been in a focus group before for these kinds of things?

651
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:39,730
I have. This was like when the American Industrial Hygiene Association wanted to rename its tag line.

652
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:47,380
Like, I think if it's protecting worker health, protecting the future or something like that, and they wanted to change the logo.

653
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:53,770
And so they brought a bunch of us in to do focus groups done by a third party that was like, What do you think of this new logo?

654
01:14:53,980 --> 01:15:01,600
How does this new logo make you feel? How does this all make you feel? And the consensus at the end was like, we don't like any of these new things.

655
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:09,520
So they just like cap their current tagline and logo or currently I don't think students get to participate in this at all.

656
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:14,380
But there is a Culture of change campaign going on right now here at the University of Michigan.

657
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:18,400
Have you all heard that? Okay, maybe it's just for faculty and staff.

658
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:28,660
There's a culture of change thing. And I signed up for the focus group thinking like, this is my chance to really give them a piece of my mind.

659
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:37,120
What it ended up being was the university has ten new nouns or verbs that they're rolling out.

660
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:49,120
And my group was integrity and transparency, and they had created a definition for integrity and transparency based on the University of Michigan way.

661
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:52,630
And they wanted us to weigh in on what we thought about the definitions.

662
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:59,979
And you bet that that was like this is def, these are facilitators from the university.

663
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:10,330
But I was like, what is the point in having these sentences if you are not going to be transparent or have integrity?

664
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:15,969
And then, you know, this is the kind of thing where it's like clearly this is a thing that they're going to roll out integrity,

665
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:20,440
transparency, diversity, equity, inclusion, which they didn't do a focus group on.

666
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:25,360
They sent us out a Qualtrics survey. They're going to smash the definition of all three words into one.

667
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:34,689
And a lot of us were like, What is this? Okay, so clearly this is something that they're plugging forward and and going ahead and doing.

668
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:42,850
They just want feedback on the wording. But I was like, this is one of the things where they were trying to pilot the messaging, the materials.

669
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:49,110
And I'm just like. I like it in that example.

670
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:59,909
In that vein, I don't know how you all feel, but like I started working here in 2020 and that was when the university got really messy with

671
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:06,330
everything going on with the school and the president and the former provost and the Anderson stuff.

672
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:11,549
And so in the focus group I voiced like, what is the point of this?

673
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:20,700
Because I feel like the more you make these statements with a prestigious institution like this, the bigger you are, the further you have to fall.

674
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:25,680
And like, wow, we have we have really fallen in that regard.

675
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,680
And they were just like smiling. They were so uncomfortable.

676
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:36,270
And then Dr. Brower, who's like the only other assistant professor, I made some like really common comments and he was like, snap, snap.

677
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:44,280
Yes. And I was like, people in this focus group think we're annoying because we're the Elite Two being really vocal about it.

678
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:47,519
But I would say, like, I don't you know, that's another example.

679
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,989
It's not public health communications.

680
01:17:48,990 --> 01:18:00,270
I don't think the university has done a very good job in terms of strategically crafting the messages and then knowing what the issues are.

681
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:03,870
But that's just an example where we piloted and tested out some materials.

682
01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:10,980
You'll probably be graduated by the time these statements come in and other considerations.

683
01:18:11,490 --> 01:18:20,250
This gets very challenging. Sometimes trying not to be little bit combative or directly collared for someone is stupid.

684
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:24,420
Approaching things with scientific data or facts may not be for everybody.

685
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:33,060
Taking time to understand people's perceptions and then understand social media will be a force whether or not you influence it.

686
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:38,999
So with that, we will pause. We will stop there for today.

687
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:46,860
Before I talk about the trans theoretical model, my watch says there's snow showers outside right now, so I'll be curious to peek outside.

688
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:51,480
We'll stop there. We'll finish the last two slides talking about theories later on.

689
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:57,629
Just as a reminder, this Thursday is a working class session, so I'll be here for consultation.

690
01:18:57,630 --> 01:19:05,840
If you want to talk about your commentary or your assignment, just remember homework three is due Sunday.

691
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:09,360
And with that. Stay warm out there. Yes.

692
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:14,790
Yes. Well, given those last two slides, be on the quiz because I don't think we'll get to it this way.

693
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,960
I'll look. And if it is, I will change them.

694
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:25,670
Great. Okay, Jayson, content. Second question is, are we allowed to cite lectures in our commentary?

695
01:19:26,610 --> 01:19:29,790
Yes. Yes, but it's.

696
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:32,850
But but if it's like.

697
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:40,590
I mean, I would say in your next outline, put it as I like kind of pointed out to me and that I can give you that the concrete source for it.

698
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:45,930
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Where I like got the information. Yes, but you can cite my lectures.

699
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:50,910
Sure. Okay. Anything else? All right.
