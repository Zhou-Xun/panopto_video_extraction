1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:18,500
In addition to the one pager testimony, can be a very effective vehicle for airing your view.

2
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:28,700
Advancing your goal as part of a hearing to explain that a little more clearly, hearings are held by decision making bodies,

3
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:37,850
many decision making bodies, as a way of inviting all perspectives to weigh in on the issue or problem at hand.

4
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:47,900
These hearings can take place at the city council level, at the state legislative level, or in the United States Congress.

5
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,160
They are also frequently part of the regulatory process.

6
00:00:53,570 --> 00:01:04,130
So it's a it's a common tool for the decision maker to invite views and opinions as part of the decision making process.

7
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,970
There are two ways to present testimony. The first is written.

8
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:20,530
This is a terrific way of including facts, expertise, data, the evidence behind of you.

9
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:28,150
Because all of that information will be included as part of the public record of the hearing.

10
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:36,400
So it's for all posterity. It's a terrific way of getting that information into the decision making process.

11
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:42,880
It also is helpful because later, after the decision has been made,

12
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:53,950
there may be some insight that can be gained when exploring what the intent of a specific provision as part of that decision might be.

13
00:01:54,190 --> 00:02:00,310
So that legislative intent and that written paper trail can be very, very helpful.

14
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:13,660
I encourage organizations of all types to use the opportunity of submitting written testimony as part of their advocacy strategies.

15
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:23,640
In addition, when the hearing is held, there is an opportunity for a representative of the view of the organization,

16
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:29,670
whatever stakeholder group coalition it is to present the testimony publicly.

17
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:36,630
The oral testimony is often more brief and more concise than that written document,

18
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:45,450
but the written document is helpful again in honing in on the key points that will be included in that oral presentation.

19
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:58,830
The event of a hearing can be used strategically by the decision maker to show either momentum or a lack of momentum around a topic,

20
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:11,730
and also can generate a lot of press coverage and media coverage, which can then be used to perpetuate whatever the decision or topic may be.

21
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:21,900
So with that in mind, when we think about crafting written testimony, the structure is very similar to a letter,

22
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:30,510
and the structure includes many of the points we discussed earlier as part of that eight minute rule that I like to use.

23
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:38,940
So the first thing we do is we identify ourselves, our organization and the reason why we are there.

24
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,780
It's addressed to the chair of the committee, the committee members.

25
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:49,230
It will be very clear on what the goal and the outcome is that we would like to see.

26
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,729
And then it will include a thorough explanation.

27
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,330
Drawing on that expertise that we talked about in step one.

28
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:04,259
Written testimony, as I mentioned, can be longer than the oral remarks but should not digress.

29
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:10,980
So it should remain succinct and relevant because it will be there as part of the public record.

30
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:23,560
At the hearing. It's important to realize that as the representative from the organization, you may be filmed and you may be part of media coverage.

31
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:30,100
So the preparation around oral delivery of the testimony is very, very important.

32
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:41,050
It's helpful to think about identifying three main points in oral testimony and boiling it down to 5 minutes.

33
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,530
Often there will be requirements.

34
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:53,300
That testimony is limited to 3 to 5 minutes, so sometimes even there will be a timer there.

35
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,380
So the testimony will be just cut off.

36
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,940
So knowing that ahead of time will help you in preparing brief delivery.

37
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,260
It's so important to be painfully basic and simple.

38
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:12,219
And again, going back to the etiquette and protocol and understanding that the audience of

39
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,510
decision makers may not have any background in the topic that you're discussing.

40
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:22,240
So keeping simple language, avoiding acronyms, things like that will be very helpful.

41
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,130
Going back to one of the points I made in the very first part of the module,

42
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:38,890
thinking about honing in on the facts and not becoming emotional and trying to avoid any type of interaction with a decision maker

43
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:47,290
so that you're not distracted from the importance of the substance and repeating repeating your points sort of over and over again,

44
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:55,150
which may seem unnecessary as the expert, but again, recognizing that the audience is not likely to have a background on this.
