1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,070
You lose its wheels, just like nothing's going to happen for a.

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,390
My dad taught me how to uproariously get right with the world.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,560
And I always. I like to run because I always.

4
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:33,260
I take my heart was flailing and this happens and I'm like and so I've never really the problem was like I was given an Onaga like I'm really sorry.

5
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,700
So I went here and there to see that I was starting another run.

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,110
Next thing used to be right. I don't think I have. It feels great to do it actually.

7
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:52,950
We often do. Yeah, we. It sells the but for me but I don't make them provide my the ankle strength my leg ankles or something or whatever I like.

8
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,990
You're getting the signs in the hospital.

9
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:03,560
I could feel a lifetime years and years and years when you think that my family wasn't here.

10
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,960
So you don't know? These are the classic friends and best friends.

11
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,420
Oh, yeah. So it's like, super.

12
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,370
Yeah. Yeah. I know where you feel like that sense of stability.

13
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,170
So, like. So it's not like. I don't think.

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:31,910
It's like. I feel like it's not like that. Like, I know some of my practices are kind of like they're like 530 oh oh thing like lending

15
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,200
standards and that's why they were so happy and happy when they have that stability.

16
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:43,520
Why do we only. That's for me. There you go. So it's kind of like this.

17
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,790
It's kind of like and I was like, so, yeah, I was going to say, you're like, you know, really early on.

18
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:56,990
Yeah. You have to be like you a little bit learning. As we're learning in the morning, it's kind of like, Yeah, we got there.

19
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,190
I haven't gone.

20
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:07,820
I went downstairs, you know, just a lot.

21
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,260
It's kind of like take the whole Sarah Palin summer and go, Yeah, okay.

22
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,080
I. That's good.

23
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,010
It's going all right. Oh, yeah.

24
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,320
That's cool. Yeah. Yeah. Google Maps.

25
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:42,080
Okay. Well put the reflectors on the arms so you can like oh it's just mirrors.

26
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:49,790
Yeah. So I think you can, you can change things. I just like I saw another person this weekend.

27
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,930
No. Yeah, I saw one on Sunday over by Zingerman's Roadhouse.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,650
I mean, it's a website by working out over there. I thought it was Thursday.

29
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:03,560
They were all black and they had the same slogan, but they just had they just had like a yellow reflective vest on.

30
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,299
And then and I was like, oh, my God, that. I was like, Oh, those are great.

31
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:14,180
It's like, you know, religious. I saw I saw a guy going down.

32
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,190
I was I was wondering if I was, you know, I was like, oh, my God, it's me.

33
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,780
But the dude just kept going. So it's just that there is 1 to 2 other people in this.

34
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:39,860
But I know in Detroit this is not like it was like also like I can't really hear in the helmet so I can't hear you.

35
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,380
I never thought about it, you know. And then the strap turn and you hit it.

36
00:03:44,540 --> 00:04:00,260
Yeah, that would be a nightmare if you actually about. All right.

37
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:18,290
You're part of America. It's proven elsewhere work.

38
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:34,370
If you're. And before you do, that was a right.

39
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,290
Okay. You want to give me. Claire.

40
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,650
So I don't know. I'm not going to comment. Yeah.

41
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,240
Yeah, I think that again, like, is there anything along those lines?

42
00:04:50,250 --> 00:05:01,580
Oh, yeah. I would have been like, I think I send you the rundown down, but I probably won't.

43
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:13,800
Yeah, not. That's what I meant. I was like, I saw the ABC and again after it was over last night, it was kind of everything.

44
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,660
Right. So are you ready for this?

45
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:26,610
If. Where is this class held?

46
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,650
It's a place time. Yeah, it's today.

47
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,480
I thought that was weird. I guess it's kind of. I didn't know where to go.

48
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,350
And then I saw the professor's voice. Yeah. Yeah.

49
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,550
Like directly. Oh. And that's why he deserves to start, like, eight.

50
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:51,760
Nine, right? Yeah. But he thinks that I'm. Yeah, Orleans, that tends to be like nine.

51
00:05:52,570 --> 00:06:00,570
And yet you're like doesn't go into any of the Midwest and like going is kind of like, Hey, I want to start.

52
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,330
Oh, yeah. Like, okay, yeah.

53
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,430
It's like, oh, yeah, yeah, I still doing that kind of thing.

54
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:20,650
Yeah. And then also at the end of the 30 year time frame, I guess opening day on Wednesday already has it has classes start.

55
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,159
Yeah. They started like early on. Oh.

56
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,610
And they are also in the prison class down here.

57
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,660
Oh it's good it's going well. We're still creating a workshop though.

58
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,840
Or we didn't get treatment for almost 10 minutes.

59
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,970
Like, forever. Oh, like, I really don't know if there's.

60
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,100
There's a focus on the zoom. Can you hear me? And they, like, try to scare us.

61
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,640
Like, the video camera for the zoom here doesn't appear to be working.

62
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,540
I don't know if that's because of the Panopto, but I still should be able to share a screen and everything.

63
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:04,200
So I'm sorry. I was a few minutes late. I went to the wrong classroom downstairs through six, six rooms, but.

64
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:11,660
Oh, yeah, I think sometimes, though. And, like, you can't turn on the camera because you can't run Zoom and Panopto this time and.

65
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,380
Yeah. The only class of, like, we couldn't turn on the video.

66
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,920
The Panopto camera looks like it's on now. I don't know what it's looking at.

67
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,060
So, like an owl looks like it's a wig and it's staring. Staring at this.

68
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,610
Hello of eyes on the camera on top of it.

69
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:36,210
Yeah. Oh, yeah. You keep looking that way. It goes like mushrooms are like.

70
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:43,180
Well, I mean as long as we can hear it, as long as we can project whatever I have on the screen, I think we're probably we'll just figure it out.

71
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:48,100
Whatever happens is the class. It's all part of the journey.

72
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,239
All right, all right. Well, it's organized. Okay, hold on.

73
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,320
Let me share a screen for our friends at home. Oh.

74
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,660
Okay. Um, I think I'd be your first.

75
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:10,470
Okay, zoom, folks. Can you see our campsite?

76
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:20,130
Yep. Yeah. Something's working. All right, so today we're going to do our very orient ourselves and time space.

77
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:26,939
Today is the 23rd, I believe. So today we're going to talk about some of the topics that we introduced last time about

78
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,050
planning a study or essentially we have our little mini lab group and we're planning our study.

79
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:39,060
So we're going to work on that. Hopefully, I'll be able to get to a discussion of sample size calculations.

80
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:44,339
And then next week, I remember I kind of shifted things up a little bit.

81
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:52,380
I didn't talk about study reporting yet, but next week we're going to kind of finish up some information that you'll need for our in-person lab.

82
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:57,000
So I'm going to talk a little more specifically about what we're going to do at our lab at necropsy.

83
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,310
And then I'll also talk I'll give that missing lecture like the one about reporting.

84
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,059
So I know they're starting to be a little bit of anxiety about how you're going to write

85
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,980
your methods and how you're going to write all the portions of the paper at the end.

86
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:16,500
That's going to become a little clearer today and a lot clearer next week.

87
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,890
So next week, I'm going to kind of go back to some of the stuff we did at the beginning,

88
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:26,100
talk about the components of the report and give you kind of the nitty gritty of what I expect in the papers.

89
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,030
So next week, that should clarify things a little for you.

90
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,960
And the other thing that I'm going to do after our discussion today.

91
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,880
So last week I gave you a very kind of sketchy version of the protocol.

92
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,370
It basically had a lot of open spaces and read writing.

93
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:48,390
So based on our discussion today and just some stuff that I'll plug in there, there'll be a much more fleshed out version of the protocol.

94
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:54,660
So I'll update that document under the study, the background materials to like a partial version of the protocol,

95
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,040
and that is what you'll draw upon to write your methods.

96
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,650
So we'll have summary slides from what we did today, and then we'll have the kind of updated version of the protocol.

97
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:11,910
Your methods are not due until after your necropsy lab.

98
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:18,300
So if you are in Group one, the October 7th group, your methods are not due to the 14th.

99
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,680
If you are in group two, your methods are not due till the 21st.

100
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:30,030
Okay. And the methods that you'll see when I update the protocol, I mean, a lot of it is kind of going to be cut and paste,

101
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,870
almost like if there's bullet points, you'll just convert the bullet points into actual writing.

102
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:40,709
And remember, the method is you pass it in. I give you comments on your draft, but that's not graded.

103
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,760
It doesn't go into the grade for the final paper.

104
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,850
So the purpose is to give you some interim feedback.

105
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,709
And what I'm expecting in terms of writing and just like if we were writing a paper for publication,

106
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:58,700
we'd be writing different drafts and editing as we go. So I know a lot of stuff is happening around that time of year.

107
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:03,950
Some people are going to Michigan, so t don't forgot about it.

108
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,060
The purpose of it is to give you feedback.

109
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:12,510
So obviously if you give me a more polished version or if you just give me an outline with hardly anything, there's not much I can say.

110
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:19,080
But if you give me our version, I can give you more feedback. But if you have of your little craft for time, it's not the other world.

111
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:24,210
Okay, so think, think, think. So today we're going to talk about the protocol.

112
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,340
Oh, shoot. I should have written this down.

113
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:35,190
The only thing between this week and next week that you want to think about as an assignment before we go to that wet lab,

114
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,460
everyone has to have completed the lab safety quiz.

115
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:45,330
That's actually a requirement. It's not not the department academics like the occupational health requirement for me to run that lab.

116
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,430
So it's not a graded quiz, but I have a means of going out and seeing who's done it.

117
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,270
So just make sure before you get to lab that you've taken that quiz.

118
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,989
Because if you get to lab and you haven't taken it, you can't do the lab. Okay.

119
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,940
So like if you have more time this week, you could certainly do that. It's self-study the study modules on there.

120
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,400
Let me know if your question. Just make sure you get that done before your lab session.

121
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,600
Does that make sense? Zoom, folks. Are you guys okay with that?

122
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:22,260
All right. Okay, now let's find out so many things.

123
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:27,090
Well, I also want to keep track of what I'm doing here. Oh.

124
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,210
Okay. Good. All right.

125
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,220
Okay. So we had this study protocol.

126
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:58,860
We said that our purpose was that we're going to examine the efficacy and tolerability of a particular vaccine against a respiratory virus.

127
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,940
And I give you a whole lot more information than that. There'll be a big reveal there. Very exciting.

128
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:10,530
And then we talked about all the components of the study and everybody had to be a group leader for their discussion.

129
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:16,200
So the first question we talked about was like, okay, we're doing a study, we're using a preclinical models.

130
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:23,010
We need to pick an animal model and we need to make sure we want to bring it to humans that our animal model has relevance to humans.

131
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:30,130
And so we asked someone to kind of talk about what are the different criteria or pieces of information we need to determine that I think was Michael,

132
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,480
is that yours? Yeah. Okay. I know I have.

133
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:45,000
Well, we'll let you talk first and then I have kind of a short slide, so I've made sure it's mostly kind of a discussion so it can be free form.

134
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:55,770
It doesn't have to be a formal. So I have right now is for the assessment of vaccine access, efficacy and tolerability.

135
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,580
We will be in direct stream with our model as our animal model.

136
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:07,950
Oh, I brought into the World Health Organization guidelines for nothing for reasons of

137
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:14,159
vaccines outbreak and more generally recommended and targets rates for this treatment.

138
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,020
Right. So what does that mean?

139
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:22,950
So you were sharing with us that out read rats out for the animals are generally preferable over what's the alternative.

140
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,530
I think they're estrogenic or mutant or inbred is a commonly used term.

141
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:33,420
So like what's up? Can you explain what an outbreak strain is for anyone who might not know that term in general then?

142
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:40,950
Yeah, so I got it from that. With all outbreak strains have more genetic variability.

143
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:46,090
Yeah. Rise in restraints are all have the same genotype.

144
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:51,819
Yeah there they're actually essentially 99% genetically identical.

145
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,960
So it's like doing your study with a whole bunch of twins. Yeah.

146
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,400
So, like, why under what?

147
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:04,080
What's why is it better to use an outbreak strain for tox study and what kind of studies might be better with, like, an inbred strain, do you think?

148
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:12,210
So what I have here is that in most like relentless studies of toxicologists

149
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:19,050
prefer the outbreak population because they have all that genetic variability,

150
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,730
which is analogous to some extent they have in the human population.

151
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,160
That's why they prefer the other strains over in breed.

152
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,420
Yeah, for most, yeah. I talked studies.

153
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:39,870
So you're trying to better represent the variability of the other, you know, both side that you might see in a human population.

154
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,440
And like what, what would be the advantage of an inbred strain?

155
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,400
What might we when might we want to use animals that are pretty much but not necessarily toxicology.

156
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:55,570
Just add anything like what's the advantage of inbred strain? Why do you think it's it's okay.

157
00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:00,060
Just think like they don't worry about what you're thinking out together.

158
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,900
Like, what might you think she's a woman. Very scary.

159
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:15,510
I think when you want to assess the toxic effects of oh, or when you have like this specific disease,

160
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:23,850
you want to, you know, see or assess new target study, then you want to have that uniformity in genotype.

161
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,950
So maybe if you want to have if you're addressing a specific question because obviously

162
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,249
the advantage we said if we have an outbreak strain is we have a lot of variability,

163
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,410
we have a little bit more variability of response.

164
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:41,250
But if I want to assess, I don't know, like a chemotherapeutic agent, I want to do an efficacy study.

165
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:47,310
I want to be sure that all my animals are going to have a tumor, because otherwise how am I going to assess the efficacy?

166
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:53,130
So there I might need to use the genetic manipulation and all the animals need to be uniform.

167
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,680
So I'm going to tighten I'm going to decrease the variability in my host side, right?

168
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,129
Because every experiment has a certain degree of variability in response.

169
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:10,320
So that can create some noise in your data. So if you have a model where you want it, you want to look predominantly your interactional variable,

170
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,490
but you want the animal response to be the same that an inbred strain might be more useful.

171
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:21,330
So we use a lot of inbred strains of mice through our campus for our various experimental models of the advantages it decreases.

172
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,620
You can use smaller animal numbers because you have a more uniform response.

173
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:34,140
The disadvantage is that you're looking at a very particular genotype, and if that particular genotype happens to affect disease manifestation,

174
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,429
what you're studying might be different from what you really see are less translatable,

175
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,909
shall we say, to what you see in the human population that exists sense.

176
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,600
You've got to make those decisions that's often. One of the first decisions out. Red versus inbred.

177
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:53,080
So that's good. Yeah. Well. Oh, yeah.

178
00:17:53,530 --> 00:18:02,710
So aside from the preferred attributes like the short life span and gestation periods and also an insurance on each of the brands,

179
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:13,000
toxicologists, toxicologists like to use the RAD because it's also economically advantageous to use them because of the cheap nature.

180
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:24,170
We also chose these as models. There is a great deal of historical data on the appearance of spontaneous lesions with this drug in these cases,

181
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:33,430
as well as a well-characterized immune system which will allow for a quality interpretation of the by toxicology,

182
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:44,830
toxicological pathologist and our assessment strategies of, you know, assessment of vaccine access, efficacy.

183
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:53,110
This strain of RAT is critical to our study as it also shares more similarities and a

184
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:58,810
similar model of viral infection and disease of virus eggs with the human population.

185
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:05,739
Mm hmm. Our model is it is similar in doing this follow up on vaccination rates of

186
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,970
infection and disease progression and development as seen in the human population,

187
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,650
which confirms that translational improvement.

188
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,720
Yeah. So if we're looking at a vaccine study,

189
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:24,010
so one of the measures as we'll find out later when we're looking at efficacy is we're going to see if our vaccine is effective right,

190
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,530
in decreasing the severity of disease or decreasing virus load.

191
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:35,860
But in order for that to have relevance, we have to make sure that the mouse or the mouse, the rat responds to virus infection like a human does.

192
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,689
So there are some viruses that would affect a human, but a mouse, a rat aren't even going to get disease at all.

193
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,140
So that's not going to be a great model for us if we want to assess efficacy.

194
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:52,180
So we have to establish that we have an animal model that responds similarly to infection as a human.

195
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,970
And then more challenging, we we have to define what do we mean by similarly, because it's never going to be exactly the same.

196
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,030
So that might mean that some of the histologic lesions in the lung look similar as they might in a human.

197
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,370
So that would be one similarity.

198
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:17,860
It might mean that virus titer or virus number builds up to a similar degree in the rat tissue, as in a human and on a similar time course.

199
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,559
Right. So we want to have some measure.

200
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:27,100
And when we're writing a paper or if I'm writing a grant proposal or if I'm justifying my use of animals in an article protocol,

201
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,930
I have to make some sort of statement to say this is I picked this model because of this,

202
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,839
and it has to be convincing enough to convince someone that I've thought about it.

203
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,260
And I think this model is translational irrelevant because of whatever.

204
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:46,490
It's never going to be 100%. And you got to think about it. Not so much in this study, but in the general sort of regulatory talks.

205
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:51,760
Another thing they will often have to do, because there's some you know, there's some leap of faith.

206
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:56,410
A rat is not a mouse. They have similarities biologically, but they're not exactly the same.

207
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:03,510
So many times they'll have to do with the regulatory requirements to do a study in two species, one of which is a non rodent.

208
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:10,270
So are rodents. Having even the outbreak was, you know, selected up over generations for use in biomedical research.

209
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:16,060
So there's concern that they're just too clean a population to represent the diversity of what's going on in humans.

210
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,379
So a lot of times we'll use a large animal model, has a little bit more genetic diversity.

211
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:26,080
And because of the nature of how they're kept, they're all a little less like we're biologically clean.

212
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,160
And so that can bring in some of the additional variability in response.

213
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,990
So oftentimes we'll have two models, one being a rodent and one being a rodent species.

214
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:43,270
That's good. So like I said, I'll post the so this again, I didn't give you a lot of information to work with Michael.

215
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,650
So good reading between the lines.

216
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:51,280
But in our protocol, like you have in our fleshed out version of that, we're going to have some statement like this eventually.

217
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,240
When you write your final papers, all the stuff in red will be filled in with the actual answer.

218
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:01,570
But rats were selected as the infection model for this study, as they have been previously shown to develop.

219
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,470
So this was one of the measures for this study chosen.

220
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:11,500
They've been previously shown to develop a robust antibody response to natural infection.

221
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,589
So when they they at least show that their immune system recognizes the virus and gets an antibody response.

222
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:25,600
So that's important. They support viral replication upon infection rates of the susceptible to the virus taking hold infected the animals

223
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,720
and replicating and they develop pathology similar to that seen in the majority of human cases of infection.

224
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,620
And this is an example of one parameter that you could use.

225
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:39,850
We're going to come into this thought that later when we talk about titer but the upper Dr. so that you don't know

226
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:46,450
what it is but the upper line is representing the antibody response with natural infection and primary infection.

227
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,079
So by how many days is that? By five days?

228
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,980
Post-Infection. It's the peak of the antibody response.

229
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,610
Apologize virus titer. This is virus amount in tissue.

230
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:03,520
So by day five or so post-infection is the peak amount of virus in tissue.

231
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,840
So this is a previous study that was done to establish the course of infection.

232
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:14,980
So it shows that the animals get infected, they get disease. And in this case, it's represented by viral load and they actually recover.

233
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,600
And for this particular virus infection, that's what happens in most people.

234
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:24,730
You get disease, you recover. Some people are unlucky. They get more severe disease and it might be more life threatening.

235
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,300
But in most people, they get virus load peaks.

236
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,800
Immune system gets on top of it and they recover. Okay. So similar to humans.

237
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,050
All right. Nice job. That's good for you. All right.

238
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,080
So in broad sense, that was our flexible model.

239
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:45,820
And then I think I think the next thing we're going to talk about was vaccine preparation.

240
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,770
So we're going to talk about what do we mean by test article?

241
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:55,970
How am I going to do this? I think. Okay.

242
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:01,450
What do you mean by test article? That's the thing. We're where to test, and that's a term we often use in regulatory talks.

243
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:08,920
What's the response to the test article? And so I think Jennifer was going to tell us a little bit about what a test article is, what's an event?

244
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:14,950
And we're going to have to make our experimental vaccine. So there are some features of importance there.

245
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,710
Jennifer, do you want me to share a screen of anything or like what would work best for you?

246
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:26,480
Or can you help? Okay.

247
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,540
Okay. It.

248
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:11,660
Right. Do you remember that?

249
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,260
Adjuvant. So we're recruiting a lot of cells like macrophages and dendritic cells.

250
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:23,850
Do you remember what was the advantage specifically to an immune response of pulling in like macrophages or dendritic cells?

251
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:29,400
Like the more. And do you remember how that ties into our adaptive immune.

252
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:37,930
It's okay if you don't. So like we said, that I had been caught.

253
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,760
I'm sorry I didn't get the porter. Hold on.

254
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:48,910
We said that an adjuvant pulls innate immune cells that create the little local inflammation, just like we talked about this morning.

255
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,010
Inflammatory cells, command, we get macrophages, right?

256
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,619
And so those are local irritants.

257
00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:00,410
And you're right, they respond, but then they go and do something else that ties in with your adaptive immune response.

258
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:19,420
So then when. Sort of.

259
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,620
Do we have do you want to phone a friend at all? Then we want to flesh out that explanation.

260
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,610
And anyway, just shout out because we discussion. And it doesn't help her.

261
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,049
You? No.

262
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:36,010
How did the B cells get there? Well, how did the B cells mostly get their information?

263
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:39,970
So we have cells on the spot. The first responders remembers.

264
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,140
Yeah, the first responders. Grant, they are the first encounter.

265
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,310
So they they're nonspecific. They just kill whatever they can find.

266
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:52,840
And then they also can ingest antigens.

267
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,480
So in our case, it's a vaccine delivered antigen,

268
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:02,860
and then they're going to go from the site of vaccination or the site of injury to the local immune tissue, to the draining lymph node.

269
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,400
And that's where they say to the lymphocytes, Hang my God, look what I found.

270
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:12,550
It's in the periphery. And then the lymphocytes that are there, sort of in the sentinel, in the guardhouse, in the lymphoid, in the lymph node,

271
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:19,060
that's where they have their first antigen presentation and replicate and then send effector lymphocytes into the periphery.

272
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:26,140
So the the plus side of having a lot, you know, we've used the example when you get your flu shot, you have a sore arm the next day.

273
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:31,390
That's because of that inflammatory influx, just like we learned this morning or pain from all that tissue swelling.

274
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:41,590
The advantage to that is it creates a larger pool of antigen presenting cells so the immune system is going to get a larger danger signal.

275
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,740
Does that make sense? So if I don't have many antigen presenting cells, I might get a lukewarm or an immune response.

276
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:53,500
So the flipside of a vaccine, if you want an adjuvant that will recruit a lot of antigen presenting cells,

277
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:58,300
the downside to that is you get local tissue damage and maybe more pain at the site of injection.

278
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,869
And obviously you want that within reason because you don't want a giant, necrotic, gaping hole.

279
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:06,189
That would be awful. But the advantage is that if you get some inflammatory cells,

280
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:11,200
then you can get a more robust adaptive immune response because there are more signal cells that make sense.

281
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:21,610
Thank you. So let's see. So you told us test article in the context of regulatory study is a vaccine plus adjuvant.

282
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,560
Right. Um, I'm sorry. We're we're is.

283
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:38,980
What else did you want to tell us? Hmm.

284
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:57,200
There's a good one and that's actually nanoparticle adjuvants are more common now and they tend to have less adverse effects.

285
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:02,960
So like COVID vaccines, the M RNA vaccines use lipid nanoparticle as an adjuvant.

286
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:12,460
So it's a good choice. Yeah.

287
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,420
Right. That's a good point.

288
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:29,020
Sometimes people are trying to develop like novel adjuvants, like maybe there's a nanoparticle particular adjuvant that is of some novel material.

289
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,060
Novel adjuvants have a higher regulatory burden. Right.

290
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:38,110
Because you want to separate out what the toxicity is for an adjuvant versus the vaccine.

291
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:42,130
In most vaccine preclinical studies, you just study it as one platform together.

292
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,129
But if you do see toxicity that severe,

293
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:51,100
you might need to do a study where you separate those out and you have a control group that's just adjuvant because you're trying to figure out,

294
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:56,650
okay, if I'm seeing an adverse effect is related to the adjuvant or is it my my viral epitope?

295
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:01,479
So yeah, so it's a good example that when you select these adjuvants, in most cases,

296
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,320
if you just consider it as one, but some cases you might have to investigate that further.

297
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:59,930
Her. Can you think that I why might a virus based vaccine be more difficult to keep

298
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:06,499
control of quality control in a manufacturing phase compared to like a chemical,

299
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,980
like a, you know, a chemical chemically based drug?

300
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:20,560
Kind of a broad question. So I kind of have to think about that for a minute. It's like to make a virus vaccine and this is kind of extrapolate out.

301
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,840
Usually we have to grow the virus in some way, so we culture it.

302
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,569
Many viruses will only grow in cells,

303
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:33,590
so sometimes we have to culture them on a cell layer right through culturing a biological agent on another biologic agent.

304
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:39,110
So what we have a safety concern if there's something in maybe one of the serum agents or something in the

305
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:44,149
host cell type where we're growing that virus that can contaminate our virus prep maybe another virus,

306
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:50,120
a helper virus or something. We have a biologic aspect to our manufacturing.

307
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:56,959
It's also this is not something I necessarily expect you guys to know, but it's also more difficult to quantify how much virus you have.

308
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,080
Back to the bat, a surrogate the door in a second.

309
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:06,850
So if you're growing them on a cell, you're not actually counting virus particles to that.

310
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,150
To quantify it, you're counting sort of the cells that are.

311
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,989
LYSED So you're using a unit that's based on the number of life cells.

312
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:21,560
So we'll talk about that later when we do platform and units. That's kind of a rough estimation of the concentration of your virus,

313
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:29,540
but it's not as exact as being able to measure exactly a chemical like get a powder and resuspended in milligrams per mil, for example.

314
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:40,060
So in biologics, one challenge is that there's more opportunity both for contamination and for less certainty about batch to batch variation.

315
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:44,719
So one of the challenges and one of the things that that World Health Organization

316
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,760
is trying to address is like keeping track of the batch in your preclinical study,

317
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:53,209
you know, because you're going to only make a certain amount and making sure you have enough controls,

318
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,750
enough stuff frozen back so that when you go later and bring it to humans,

319
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,480
you can compare and make sure that you're kind of using the same base standard to compare.

320
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:06,980
Does that make sense? Yeah. So one more biologics.

321
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:14,270
That's great. And you also addressed stability. Being a biological agent, we might have some more difficulty with stability.

322
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:20,509
That certainly was the case with some of the COVID and RNA vaccines that had to be at -80 versus,

323
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,649
you know, four degrees or -20, which is easier if you think about distribution.

324
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,870
So that can be a challenge. That's great. Did you haven't?

325
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:40,860
Because I could never do anything else you want to add or. Yes.

326
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:48,020
That's great. So yeah. So here is your summary thing with most of which you address.

327
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:56,410
So vaccine considerations and manufacturer scalability, which kind of speaks to that back to back to variation thing and cost.

328
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,900
Obviously we didn't really talk about it, but it's kind of implied that it's a concern.

329
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:07,160
So we have to pick both the the antigen that we use, make sure that it's immunogenic in both our animal model and our human.

330
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:14,510
And the other thing we didn't really think about is that we picking with a can't talk anymore.

331
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:20,930
The antigen that you pick also has implications for the long term utility of your vaccine.

332
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,860
So think about what's happening with COVID now and the different strains.

333
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:29,390
We're having some subtle mutations right in the spike protein that are making

334
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:33,650
the the original vaccines a little bit less efficacious at preventing disease.

335
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:38,180
Same thing happens every year with influenza. That's why we have to modify influenza every year.

336
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,040
So when you're making a vaccine,

337
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:46,940
it's really it's challenging because you have to kind of pick which epitope is going to be most likely to be effective.

338
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,129
But that epitope itself has to have importance for the biology of the vector of the virus, like has to be.

339
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:56,450
If you interfere with that, you're going to prevent it from entering a cell or prevent it from damaging cells.

340
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:02,720
And it has to be relatively stable, because otherwise you're going to be making a new vaccine, you know, every three months or so.

341
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,020
So conservation of immunogenic, structural elements.

342
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:12,800
And you have to kind of split the difference sometimes and select something that's likely to have a longer utility for that vaccine.

343
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,600
So it's very challenging. And the manufacturer we talked about use the production instability.

344
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:21,140
Jennifer told us that vaccine plus adjuvant is the test article.

345
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:29,469
Oh, did I lose my. I hope I still is the test article.

346
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:36,280
And then the adjuvants can enhance or modulate the immune response by recruiting antigen presenting cells.

347
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,960
And one thing that we didn't talk about, adjuvants can actually bias the immune response.

348
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,860
They can be balanced or they can kind of push the immune response towards humoral or cellular immunity.

349
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,050
And so in certain types of virus infections, you might need more of an antibody response.

350
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:54,940
You might pick a T to biasing adjuvant. So that might be of importance.

351
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:59,670
Let's see, there's a couple of slides. Yes.

352
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:11,310
Amber, is there a potential that the vaccine could carry, like an antigen from these cells that was going on?

353
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:18,460
Like if it was grown on like dog kidney cells or immunized cells, they could carry an antigen over.

354
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,540
It's less common nowadays, like purification techniques or a lot better.

355
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:27,069
And it's also more common to use recombinant vaccines where you're sort of artificially making

356
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:33,000
a peptide from a virus rather than making the whole virus as part of your your vaccine.

357
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:40,030
So it depends for this particular study, we're using a whole virus inactivated vaccine.

358
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:46,450
So there you're growing the virus itself, the whole virus, and then you're inactivating it somehow, usually chemically.

359
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:51,030
So there there's a lot more potential for stuff to kind of get carried through.

360
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:55,540
So it's a little bit of an older style vaccine strategy.

361
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,440
The pro side is that it can be very effective because you have all the antigens there, right?

362
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:04,660
So you don't need to make that decision. Okay. I think the protein is most immunogenic.

363
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,460
I'm just going to throw the whole commission there.

364
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:12,610
I'm going to try to inactivate it so that it doesn't cause disease, but it does have a higher risk of something along.

365
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:20,799
And there actually have been cases like in the old, oh God, the oldest form of the polio vaccine,

366
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,650
which was grown on monkey cells, and that there have been cases of suma viruses, which are called foamy viruses.

367
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:31,900
They don't really have like a known pathogenicity, they're just kind of background, whatever.

368
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,290
But in some of the earlier vaccines that were grown on monkey kidney cells,

369
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:40,420
there have been cases of infection actually with stomach virus from the cell culture.

370
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,799
So it just goes to show that there's a lot of when you're working with a biologic system,

371
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,680
there's a lot more variables and a lot more difficulty in controlling the final product.

372
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,510
Because to the human,

373
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:57,430
this is just the reminder slide from the first lecture looking at different types of vaccines that adjuvants talks about the pros and cons of each.

374
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:04,420
Oh, that's for somebody else. Okay, so that's what we had for vaccine manufacturer.

375
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:08,540
And then we had some I think that. Yeah.

376
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:43,460
Go for. Hmm.

377
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:54,209
Well, I guess the most common thing I can think of in terms of worth is that different people have a different robustness,

378
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,160
I guess, to their inflammatory response.

379
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:06,240
So most likely because like you, you're kind of aiming really for a synergistic effect, at least at the site of vaccination.

380
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:10,130
Like the intent is to boost what would be the response to antigen alone.

381
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,280
So like in ordinary functioning, you're aiming for a synergistic effect.

382
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,899
But for some people, they might have a more robust inflammatory response.

383
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,980
So that might be excessive to an adjuvant.

384
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:30,389
So like some of the, you know, people who have different reactivity or different pain in their arm or the people who get more of a systemic

385
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:35,610
inflammatory response like this morning we talked about local cytokines can have systemic effects.

386
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:42,750
Some people have might have a more robust systemic effect to the adjuvant for really adverse reactions.

387
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:51,750
Those are more common related to immunogenicity of the vaccine itself and those are more common are boosted or second administration.

388
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:59,100
So for people who get an overly robust immune response to the epitope, a lot of times first time they get the vaccine, they're okay.

389
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:04,320
And then the second time, because they have all the memory cells, they get kind of an overt, robust response.

390
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:12,090
And it's kind of a roundabout way of answering your question. So it's like an allergic reaction, like you need it's got the sensitization phase.

391
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,640
Yeah. So remember when we talked about the immune system,

392
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:22,920
allergic reactions and part words are hypersensitivity reactions and they always take place after you build sort of that army of responding cells.

393
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,800
So they're always on the next exposure. Um, maybe pixabay.

394
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:37,350
So that is an important factor in toxicity testing because your vaccine is your first exposure, right?

395
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:44,370
So let's say we have a vaccine that's hugely sensitizing or nonspecific.

396
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:48,550
If it's sensitized, maybe it's activating multiple clones of T cells vaccine.

397
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:58,170
You get it. You have an army of immune cells. Now, if you get infected with the virus, if the immune response isn't appropriate to clear the virus,

398
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:03,270
like, let's say, your immune response, the virus also damages host tissue.

399
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:11,490
One potential toxicity of vaccines is that because of that sensitization, you actually make the response to natural infection worse.

400
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:18,090
So that's called up or there's a couple of different methods for it, but that's vaccine enhanced disease.

401
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:25,980
So that is one potential toxicity. And that's actually one of the goals of like a efficacy study and a toxicity study to see if the vaccine,

402
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:31,500
you know, doesn't ameliorate but actually enhances response to disease. So that would be a pretty adverse effect.

403
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,090
All right. So this is the memory side. So the next thing.

404
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:44,100
All right. Great. I think Margaret was going to talk to us about what were you going to talk about dosing in groups or something?

405
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:49,650
Yes. Yes. Okay. Do you want me to show anything? I made sort of.

406
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:53,700
Oh, text on them so I can just kind of. Okay. Sure. I'd actually be better.

407
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:58,590
Um, so I looked into. So I started with toxicity testing.

408
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:06,480
Okay. So I looked into the different OK'd methods for acute toxicity testing and for chronic toxicity testing.

409
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:10,200
So there's a couple options for the acute selectors,

410
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:20,540
like a fixed dose where the text of the protocol said that they use lethality as an outcome that you talk in class.

411
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,870
But I, you know, it's just like toxicity or more like you need an endpoint,

412
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:33,179
but it's rare that you pick a fixed dose level and then you at the beginning just give it to one animal and see what happens to that animal.

413
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:38,670
And then you can scale up or down depending on whether that animal experience, toxicity or lethality.

414
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:46,440
And I recommended if you don't have any prior evidence of toxicity, which because we don't have that much information about the virus.

415
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:50,820
Sure. Of that. So that said, to start at 300 milligrams per kilogram.

416
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,139
Okay. So I kind of like that one.

417
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,580
There's also acute oral toxicity, which is about 50, so we don't really have to.

418
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,820
Yeah. And that's oral toxicities that's administering via oral.

419
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,790
So yeah, this is probably gonna be an injectable vaccine,

420
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:14,790
but so like a fixed dose and like are dosing for vaccines, the measures can be a little bit different.

421
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:22,850
So it's hard to do like a big per mil dose for vaccines, but in vaccines that the approach of a single dose is pretty common.

422
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:27,240
And like, do you remember like what was different about dosing?

423
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:37,140
Like if I dose a chemical, if I increase my per mil dose, like if I go low, medium high, I tend to increase my adverse response as well.

424
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:45,930
So it's like a kind of linear ish relationship between increasing dose and increasing response if the endpoint for my vaccine study.

425
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:51,190
Really it's to induce an antibody response. Do you remember anything different about the dose response curves?

426
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:58,420
I know that you don't like the W.H.O. protocols saying you don't need a dose response curve.

427
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,790
Yeah. You don't need to do a like a low, medium high. I'm going to help you out here.

428
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:09,220
But in vaccines, so you have a certain number of B cells and you kind of spike them to a certain degree.

429
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:15,530
So they don't tend to have like a like if you keep giving a higher dose of vaccine, it just keeps shooting off higher and higher and higher.

430
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:16,930
If you're looking at antibody response,

431
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:24,280
it tends to be adequately stimulate your B cells and you get a peak response and then any vaccine you give after that,

432
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:29,169
it's not going to have any additive effect. So when you're trying to figure out your dose for a preclinical study,

433
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:33,940
what you're trying to figure out is like what dose at the bottom is going to give you that peak effect

434
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:38,770
because that's basically the dose you want to use and it doesn't give you any additional benefit.

435
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:44,260
Do you know what I'm saying to go above that? So like their dose response, they have a little bit of a four foot curve.

436
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,980
It's like this one good upside down you, but it's not linear.

437
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:55,000
And one of the early studies is to look at this dosing, but it's not like a chemical I can type studies for chemical.

438
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:00,720
We often do use low, medium and high dose because we're trying to find that no adverse effects level.

439
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:06,640
So that's a little bit different about vaccines. Is that true for the toxicity testing, too?

440
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:16,900
Yeah, like earlier, because in your humans you're going to use one dose essentially or one one level, dose level.

441
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:23,049
So the goal of your early study is just figure out what is the shape of this curve so you can optimize it.

442
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:30,700
So it's more optimizing the dose for maximal antibody response in terms of route of administration.

443
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:36,940
So like in humans, if I figure out if I think I'm going to use a boost initial dose that a boost in

444
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:42,010
the animal studies you do by regulatory demand have to give one dose additional.

445
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:49,840
So like they do want to give the number of administrations higher in the animal, but not the actual dose.

446
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:54,639
So like if I'm doing a one dose study, if I plan, like there's a vaccine,

447
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,270
I'm just going to give once to humans in the animals, I have to dose that at least twice.

448
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,080
If I'm going to dose it twice to humans, I have to dose it at least three times in my arm.

449
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:07,390
So that's the variability there. Sorry.

450
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:14,110
Do you have another and I looked at also chronic toxicity.

451
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:19,480
Okay. I don't know if those are really something that we look at the vaccines,

452
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:29,200
but essentially just have three dosing levels that they look at over a period of 12 months for just regular toxicity or 24 months for carcinogenicity.

453
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:36,790
And they pick three dosing levels in a control. Yeah.

454
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,010
Don't. Hmm. Now, that's good. Yeah, that's pretty.

455
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,630
Kind of classic toxicology type studies in a vaccine study.

456
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,709
The study designs are a little simpler, actually, because we first do some studies to optimize dose.

457
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,830
And in our example, we're pretending we already did that we actually had one dose.

458
00:46:53,840 --> 00:47:02,120
And then for the toxicity, you have sort of an acute study that extends for one administration past what you would do in a human.

459
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:08,299
So you do that dosing interval and then usually there's somewhat of a recovery arm like you push it out if you're doing a challenge

460
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:16,150
study until the animal would have recovered from its illness or until you anticipate that the antibodies will have died down.

461
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:22,490
So it's a little they tend to be a little bit shorter term than, you know, like the long carcinogenicity studies.

462
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,470
But there are relatively simple there's an acute study just looking at does

463
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:31,070
it engender an immune response and is it protective against initial disease?

464
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:37,190
And then there's a recovery arm, which would be when you would anticipate that antibody response would have died down.

465
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:41,300
So ours is kind of a little hybrid structure, but good.

466
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:45,079
So that lines up like I, I looked at, you know,

467
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:51,380
the obesity protocol stress and read some of the literature on vaccines that are also formalin inactivated.

468
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:55,489
Yeah, just in rats. So that's kind of where I live.

469
00:47:55,490 --> 00:48:02,990
I mean, they're all in PSU, so I wasn't really sure how that translated directly to like the key toxicity testing.

470
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:09,980
I've been saying, you know, we should take 300 milligrams right now, but they tended to use kind of somewhere in the range.

471
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,750
I think the lowest one that I found was ten to the three, ten to the seven.

472
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,240
But they all kind of centered around about like ten then. Yeah.

473
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:22,790
So that's based on studies like this that they have previously established with a given platform and unit,

474
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:27,410
what's going to give them that peak response? Yeah.

475
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:39,480
And then they had, you know, a couple dosing groups and one study had a negative control that was just Phosphate Group and Sailing Man,

476
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:46,670
which I thought was interesting. But it was a study that had a mock virus, which is an active control, which is mentioned in the guidelines.

477
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:54,000
And that is essentially just like they cultured cells that had the virus infected, ones that didn't, and then they treated them exactly the same way.

478
00:48:54,020 --> 00:49:02,329
Oh, so they had. So the mock virus has kind of all of the you know, it has the element in that it's inactivated in the same way.

479
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:07,280
Yeah. So it's like an adjuvant and a delivery platform control.

480
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:13,010
Yes. Essentially. Yeah. So and then I guess if we wanted to recap of it's just the adjuvant, if we're worried about.

481
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:17,959
Yeah, that might cause toxicity. Right. So. Yeah.

482
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:24,140
So it depends a little bit on like what stage you're at if you're in like development, if you're in a regulatory stage,

483
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:30,350
hopefully some of the groundwork has been done for you and your other your the goal in any science is you do have to pay attention to cost.

484
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:35,330
So you try to make your study as simple for interpretation and as cost effective as possible.

485
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:41,120
And as we talked about, depending on what your of it is, you may or may not need to have a separate adjuvant control.

486
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:49,160
So like in terms of like our simplest toxicity, so we have a toxicity arm and an efficacy arm.

487
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:56,930
So like for the efficacy arm, what's like our simplest structure in terms of groups that we can think of like for efficacy?

488
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:02,780
I maybe it's actually let's hold that question because we have somebody else, I think, who's going to talk a little bit more about efficacy.

489
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:09,170
So maybe we can come back to that question. But like that will play into actually when my slides kind of gives it away.

490
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:17,299
Let's look at this. This might help a little bit. So in efficacy, we're obviously going to have to see how effective it is at diminishing disease.

491
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:22,910
Right. So we're going to have to have an infection group, right? So in this and this is kind of giving it away.

492
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:26,570
But in our study, we have different animal groups to the efficacy arm.

493
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,809
We need a virus challenge group. So that's just natural infection.

494
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:36,860
If we didn't do anything and we could do that by itself or we could do kind of what you talked about with like a vaccination control.

495
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:42,379
So this could be the cell culture media that we grew the virus or it could be if we wanted it,

496
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,200
adjuvant control could just have adjuvant, but that's this one.

497
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:52,070
And we can have then we have our virus, our vaccination group, but then they get virus challenge.

498
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:58,700
So our our efficacy group, we have a control group that gets mock vaccine and then virus challenge.

499
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:03,980
And then we have our test group that gets vaccine and then virus challenge.

500
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,900
So not so simple as possible to group structure. And as you said, there are lots of permutations.

501
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,830
We can add some other groups, but if we're trying to make it really simple, this is what we could do.

502
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:16,520
And then for our toxicity arm, there's no virus challenge, right?

503
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,840
Because we don't want to confuse pathology of disease with pathology of the vaccine itself.

504
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,010
So there we have a vaccination. There's no challenge in that box vaccination.

505
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:29,329
Does that make sense? So that's a kind of it's a very simple structure.

506
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:33,920
But if you're trying to get an answer in a quickly in an early stage study, that would be a very effective structure.

507
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:40,130
And then in terms of our groups and timeline, it depends on the course of disease.

508
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:45,590
So our disease actually this is the right slide or is that picture we already

509
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:50,629
showed that peak antibody response after infection is around day five or six.

510
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:55,250
So this is kind of peak disease. That's where we're trying to structure our efficacy study.

511
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:03,080
So a study design for this one was I'm going to hand over here for vaccination timeline.

512
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:03,890
It's at the top.

513
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:12,770
So at day zero, you have sort of baseline information, baseline body weights and the zero, the first day of vaccination for the study,

514
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:17,930
there's actually usually a background period where you let the animals acclimatize and take the body weight.

515
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:24,650
But day zero is the day of vaccination, either with the vaccine or your control group.

516
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:29,210
And then you're going to monitor things like body weights. We're going to talk about that later.

517
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,270
You could measure serum antibodies a certain point.

518
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:40,820
And then depending on the the slope of that curve like you've already established after I vaccinate, when does my antibody response first go down?

519
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:45,770
Then I have to decide when to give that booster vaccine, which in this study is at day 21.

520
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,790
Okay, so now I'm boosted, I'm protected.

521
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:54,170
Like I've had my two COVID vaccines, I go to study, but so now I want to challenge.

522
00:52:54,380 --> 00:53:02,630
So in this study that was designed at day 49, so that's about 20 days after the second booster.

523
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:07,159
And then peak infection with natural infection is at six days.

524
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:18,050
So the euthanasia point is six days after the challenge. So I sent primary vaccine booster challenge endpoint and then for some of our animals,

525
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:25,130
we kept them presuming that they were defended against infection for an additional couple of days because that's what we anticipate.

526
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,250
The normal course of infection would have things die down.

527
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:34,220
So we're hoping that our vaccine animals won't quite peak as high or maybe they'll dampen things down quicker.

528
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:39,590
So that's the basic structure of the study and that's going to be in your protocol thing.

529
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:43,169
So you can see that next one. All right.

530
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:46,530
Let me check my time. We're still okay. We're doing the work.

531
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:51,410
All right. Thanks. That was a hard one. Thank you for working your through that.

532
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:57,860
All right. I'm going to skip for now animal numbers and power calculation, because I'm going to do that discussion after.

533
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:04,639
So we're going to go on now. We have this timeline, but I have all these different things written here.

534
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,970
I put a box over it and I want to see we're going to do all these different things.

535
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:12,500
So we were going to talk about some of the biomarkers of disease that we were going to use.

536
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:18,460
We have someone who's going to talk to us about hematology. Remember who is the.

537
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:25,700
Okay. Do you want me to show? What can I do here? This.

538
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:33,420
Okay. You don't have to read it all directly, but maybe you can just explain in a broad sense what are hematology or.

539
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:56,540
Right. Okay.

540
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:55,690
Okay. Okay.

541
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:51,049
Okay. Okay.

542
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:58,209
Great. I'm sorry. Did you get more? Do you want to give us?

543
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:04,840
So that's great. So one of the parameters that we can use both to assess toxicity and to assess efficacy,

544
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:08,860
the things that you're talking about are part of a complete blood count.

545
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,220
So, as the name implies, a count of the different cells in blood.

546
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:18,550
So as he told us a little bit about some red cell parameters, so this is the overview slide of red cell parameters.

547
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:25,960
And at its simplest, the ones she mentioned that are like hematocrit and red blood cells, it's just the count of red cells in the blood.

548
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:35,530
So if you're anemic, anemic anemia basically means decreased oxygen carrying capacity and blood, which can be due to a reduced number of red cells.

549
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,690
So maybe you're hemorrhaging somewhere or maybe there's an inhibition, a blood cell release from the bone marrow.

550
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:46,420
So the very basic red cell parameter is up or down or how many red cells are there.

551
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:51,910
And then there are other indices, some of the which like NCBI, that is he mentioned for us.

552
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:59,259
But tell us something about the red cells. So maybe if my adjuvant is toxic like some I can't remember.

553
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:02,889
Is that you? Someone was suggesting that the adjuvant was toxic.

554
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:08,060
Maybe it's listing my red cells. So my red cells are down, and then my bone marrow is responding.

555
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:17,110
If that's the case, I'll see an elevation in something like mean cell volume because immature red cells are larger than red cells in the periphery.

556
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:22,479
So all these things that I'm not going to go through them one by one, but all the indices,

557
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:28,690
if there's something wrong up or down with the red cell index, it tells us about the cells and helps us interpret that.

558
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:38,320
Okay. And then the leukocytes, as he was mentioning, that you can do a complete count and you also can count the different types of leukocytes.

559
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:44,640
So you'll see when we get our data that we have absolute counts of each of these different types of white cells.

560
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:48,520
And then we can also computer compute a relative count like a percent.

561
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:51,460
And these parameters too can change.

562
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:59,290
So we might expect if we have a robust immune response, perhaps we might see an increase in lymphocytes associated with our vaccine.

563
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:03,730
But we don't want that to be too high or too elevated. But that might be an expected response.

564
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:10,450
Conversely, if we have something that's immunomodulatory maybe our innate inflammatory cells,

565
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:17,530
maybe our immune response is muted and the neutrophils are higher because we have like, I don't know, an opportunistic infection or something.

566
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,909
So the relative percentages of each of these white cells in the relative numbers

567
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:28,630
can tell us something about the inflammatory or the immune status of the mouse.

568
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:33,010
If I'm sorry, I'm going to go back here for a second just to give a big picture.

569
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,900
So complete blood counts because you're counting. The cells themselves are measured in anti coagulated whole blood.

570
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:45,010
Because if I just take blood out of an animal and stick it in a tube, it's got a clot.

571
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:49,750
But there's substances that you can put into the blood tube to stop it from clotting.

572
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,740
And for CDC, we usually use potassium, EDTA, tubes.

573
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:58,630
There are purple cup tubes for those of you who've done this. And we'll see that when we do our necropsy.

574
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:03,940
And it's important. I'm really glad you mentioned volume. Mice are very small.

575
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:08,530
And one of the big problems we have with CBC for mice is getting adequate volume.

576
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:14,589
Usually the tubes are pre-filled with a certain percentage of EDTA, and if you don't get enough blood in there,

577
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:20,950
the ratio of that key later is off and you actually get artifacts rule changes in the red cell.

578
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:24,010
So having the volume matched to the tube size is important.

579
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:29,200
And in mice, sometimes you have to make decisions because they're so small, you can't always get adequate blood.

580
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:31,630
And another thing is invention is really important.

581
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:37,180
If I have a larger animal or a human, you know, I can draw blood for them at a certain interval throughout the study.

582
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:45,159
If I have a mouse, it's really hard. And most studies don't use serial blood draws in mice because the amount of volume that you can get

583
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:50,770
minimally in a tube is pushing the limit of the amount of blood you can safely draw from a mouse at a time.

584
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:56,580
And you'll start to see a response, like, if I draw blood from an animal, it's going to have a bone marrow response.

585
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:59,830
So I'm going to have a regenerative response because I pulled blood.

586
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:05,800
So if I'm taking blood multiple times, by the time I get to sample two or three,

587
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:09,549
I'm going to see not just my response to the infection or whatever it is.

588
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:14,070
I'm going to be seeing my response to blood drawing. So you're confounding your own result.

589
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:19,090
So study planning when you have these animal models sometimes depends on things like the species.

590
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:23,020
And that's something that we see frequently in people submitting blood samples to us.

591
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:27,680
So, yeah, it's typically measured on a hematology analyzer.

592
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:32,560
I'll show you these. In the lab we have an impedance laser cytometer.

593
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:41,590
So it uses blocking of an electrical current. That's a five based measure, and then it also uses the complexity of the cell to separate them.

594
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,630
Great job. Let's do serum chemistry and let's take a little break after that.

595
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:52,150
Amber, with that, you asked me, do you want me to show this?

596
01:01:52,330 --> 01:02:05,850
Yeah. Okay. So. Chemistry is measured at the end of some like and private studies and it's it's a measure to understand the animals of organ function.

597
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:12,380
So we will be analyzing serum was taken from the.

598
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:22,040
From the. I'm sorry. That's it. I get it from the rat posthumously.

599
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:26,530
And that will go on. You're all you, amber. Line one.

600
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:33,680
Line one. I'll help you. Oh, yeah. Then you need to thank you so much.

601
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:42,290
And so I mentioned that the blood samples will be taken from the animal via the intracranial

602
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:47,630
puncture and will be collected in the serum in a serum separator micron container tube.

603
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:54,560
Because it's really, really important to be very consistent and standardized throughout the process of sequencing,

604
01:02:56,060 --> 01:03:02,090
because that's going to minimize any variability that we may see that might be provided by the picture that was present.

605
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:15,350
So per the best practice guidelines and the Society for Toxicology Pathology, it's recommended that clinical chemistry panels are taken for.

606
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:20,000
They suggest that we do for parents have had a toxicity.

607
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:31,160
We should we should do a minimum of two hepatocellular injury markers and a minimum of two biliary injury markers.

608
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:35,300
And I highlighted an example from both of those.

609
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:42,559
Okay. So my example for the hepatocellular injury marker is old and that's a cytosolic enzyme found

610
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:48,380
in hepatocytes and is indicative of panic damage when increased levels are found in the blood.

611
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:57,540
And it is important to note that the measure reflects active capacity damage and levels will normalize following the cessation of damage.

612
01:03:57,740 --> 01:04:01,790
Good. And it is also increased during times of starvation.

613
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:04,820
And that's especially true in rats. That is true, yeah.

614
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:09,950
And for biliary injury markers, I chose bilirubin.

615
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:16,250
And that's increased with blood cell lysis and hemolysis, which is a confounding factor.

616
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:27,500
And that and also due to failure of liver processing and elevated bilirubin, is a true marker of liver function.

617
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:32,690
Good stuff. And also they'd like us to analyze for renal toxicity.

618
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:37,730
And I highlighted two of those and highlighted one and creatine.

619
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:48,650
So these are very traditional markers but are very sensitive and urea as measured by is for urea.

620
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:53,030
And urea is measured in blood or urine as a marker of kidney function.

621
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:59,660
So damage to the renal block along your one area list can cause an increased level.

622
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:09,200
Um, and it can, a blockage can also increase this level and also dehydration, which makes sense and concentrates.

623
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:16,459
So these are all things that we need to be thinking about prior to the animal being euthanized.

624
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:19,940
What were they were they drinking or were they eating? Which they should be.

625
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:23,900
They should be taking time to not be eating because of euthanasia.

626
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:30,770
Yeah, that's a good reminder because like nonspecific sign of toxicity of animals not eating well, not drinking well.

627
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:36,730
So you can have elevation of brown and creatinine because of that, but then you want to separate that out, right?

628
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:38,719
When you're analyzing your data because you want to know,

629
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:47,390
is this a renal toxicant or is it making the animals sick by some other means and then by renal biomarkers are just being elevated for dehydration.

630
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:53,630
Right. So like there's a difference between something that's a specific renal toxicant versus general signs of a sick animal.

631
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:57,800
But it's a great reminder, like we talk about these as a liver marker, a kidney marker.

632
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:04,400
It's a whole animal. It's a body. Right. So once something starts to go wrong, all the systems get affected.

633
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:08,390
So when we're doing toxicology, one of the most challenging things is trying to figure out,

634
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:11,500
you know, what what came first, that this cascade of events.

635
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:16,940
So that's what makes it more challenging than just looking at like, I don't know, a dish of hepatocytes or something like that.

636
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:23,970
Good job. Thanks. That's great. So yeah. So there's nice summary slides of that here as well in our general slide.

637
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:27,680
The clinical chemistry is, as AMR mentioned, are usually measured in serum.

638
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:34,909
So just a reminder, serum is the liquid component of blood. Sometimes we measure them in plasma, which is the same thing as serum,

639
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:41,540
plus it has some extra coagulation proteins and for serum will see examples of this the way you collect it.

640
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:48,079
Post euthanasia in an app in a room. We're going to collect blood via intra cardiac puncture for rats.

641
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:51,710
There are some measures you can do interim, but we're just going to do a post euthanasia.

642
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:55,460
The whole blood can be clotted and then separated to the liquid and.

643
01:06:55,590 --> 01:07:05,219
All abortions by centrifugation so that the serum portion is taken and it's usually measured in an enzymatic assay in an automated system.

644
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:09,510
So I'll show you our instrument for that. And so those are enzymatic reactions that are performed.

645
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:16,650
So it's like a chemistry in a box analyzer and usually the reaction products are detected by Spectral Photometry,

646
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:24,450
which explains why if we're like that, we draw the blood and we accidentally light the cells by mistake through like a rough blood draw or something.

647
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:30,420
When the red cells slice of hemoglobin, which is a pigmented compound, gets into the serum and the serum looks all red,

648
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:35,100
that can interfere with our ability to measure reactants in this assay.

649
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:43,679
So things like a rough blood draw, low volume or the presence of interfering factors which can be our drug that's more common in chemical

650
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:48,570
compounds that they're spectra of automatically reactive at the same wavelength as a reaction product.

651
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,760
All those things can impact your results. All right.

652
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:58,560
And then those are your serum chemistry markers. Won't read through those because you did a great job going over those.

653
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:07,260
This will be on your protocol, this slide. This is just the verbiage for how we are analyzing all these parameters.

654
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:13,020
So this will be straight up on your protocol. Just use that in your methods and I'll show you all this in the lab.

655
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:17,090
All right. It is 230 ish.

656
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:21,030
Let's take a five minute break. Thanks for your patience.

657
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:24,330
I know it's a lot of talking and it's the afternoon on Friday for all kind of sleepy,

658
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:29,250
but let's take a five minute break and finish up with some discussions.

659
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:46,110
I'm going to open this on a panel any more general with a mini panic attack.

660
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:51,000
And I have those all the time. I know I have those all the time, too.

661
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:56,860
It's totally fine. Just drink your water. You'll be fine. Yeah.

662
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:11,200
My heart just is. Ready for the next round in a flash.

663
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:18,339
The wheels always are 100% a good thing to remember.

664
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:22,000
If you're talking and like you have those mini panic attacks, you lose your train of thought.

665
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:25,660
To you, it seems like hours of silence are going by.

666
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:33,639
But to everybody else, you're going to like a pause, like the like, you know, when you watch speakers,

667
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,730
like start to try to notice those moments when they're just collecting themselves.

668
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,690
And how rare is it for you to be like, Oh my God, why are you sitting there like that?

669
01:09:40,690 --> 01:09:45,070
Almost never happens. So it helps to just be like, okay, breathe.

670
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:52,530
And then usually you can pick it up again and preserve them for the next part.

671
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:57,920
I'm like, I was like, Oh, sure, that was true.

672
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:10,420
I think if we put that, it's, you know, figure out where the thing is or does it have to stand for, oh, I didn't know.

673
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:14,280
I was trying to feel if it had a USB thing. But are poor people.

674
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:22,480
So so they're. I have something for me.

675
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:26,440
Maybe I can join my own Zoom meeting at the moment.

676
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:37,640
There has to be a USB port on this thing somewhere. I think what it says, Toby.

677
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:44,270
Oh, wait, wait. Oh, perfect. Having a baby. And I just figured out crocheting like crazy.

678
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:47,390
I have my three blankets down. Yeah, from down there.

679
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:54,470
Thank you. Sure. Sorry again for the hassle, but, yeah, it's just very.

680
01:10:54,950 --> 01:11:05,149
It's kind of like this is a thing I get appreciate for myself.

681
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:08,090
I only crochet for my problems to this.

682
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:17,630
I married my sister and I think I want to make it harder for me to like a different color, but to think, oh, are you nuts?

683
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:21,920
Yeah. Oh, okay. Well, kind of. What kind of cardigans you make? Um, it's.

684
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:27,300
I'm pretty good. It's so it's just like over here and then that.

685
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:35,650
It's kind of like a collection of those things that come in at the wrist that they're sort of.

686
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:43,370
Yes. Thank you. All right. Perfect. And I love that he he's so cute.

687
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:51,770
That's mine. Like, you know, it's like a protocol discussion for mine.

688
01:11:52,250 --> 01:12:00,230
And then you basically, like we get in the yard along the way.

689
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,450
So I do like stretches and then.

690
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:10,139
All right. Thank you. Very cool. That's two things.

691
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:14,420
I like the way I look.

692
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:18,750
That's so smart. I like that. I knew better.

693
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:26,040
No, I love that. That is not work. You know what I did when I was in high school?

694
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:30,460
Yeah. I need a from somebody else. This time, I swear to God, I swear.

695
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:34,470
I close my presentation and I save it. Because if I could find it.

696
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:45,910
Yeah, I do. Near here. Okay. There is.

697
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:54,940
Oh, wow, that's nice. It's just a corner prior knowledge and it's essentially just like from the ground up.

698
01:12:55,420 --> 01:13:05,700
I think we can find one day or all years and I thought it was very good.

699
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:14,620
Here's what I did. So different. No, but he's still you still remember that being like, you don't have to wait.

700
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:20,109
Didn't I like that? There's didn't sound like a magic circle.

701
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:25,720
All right, now your hair follicles can kind of go straight back like it didn't.

702
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:30,250
It was bad. I mean, I'm sure you saw him across the U.S.

703
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:36,250
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So I think you better be all right.

704
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:40,460
Sorry about that. How are you? I like baseball. Yeah.

705
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:46,450
Yeah. You just sit here in your front?

706
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:56,169
Yeah. We sat through all of their names and told you about the pattern.

707
01:13:56,170 --> 01:14:04,310
Name him, and I thought he was going to have a really good friend that year.

708
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:16,510
You can't really get away from those names about whether or not, you know.

709
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:25,860
Oh, thank you for your whole example that that was the only one there this.

710
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:37,740
Well, I don't really think they're you know, and and I think I really wanted to have people like that.

711
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:46,420
He's like, that's how I feel about my, you know, like I say that this doesn't do it much easier to like going through a little.

712
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:50,730
There's a future of reality entirely there. Yeah.

713
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:56,920
Oh, I wouldn't noticed. Noticed? You're charming.

714
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:03,860
You've got a little. He's not exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

715
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:07,460
I used to like like longer than it might have gone to train your.

716
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:16,710
But I like going right now it's just being a player as usual.

717
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:24,910
I prefer plants and not really. And so I mean I try to give any false readings of like this aquariums.

718
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:33,819
I mean, this reminds me of some, you know, people from my house or some food doesn't like watch it.

719
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:37,330
And I really thought it was chicken.

720
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:51,639
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. That's what is I guess that's not really, you know, that's what they're trying to make.

721
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:59,470
And then I still think I know a little bit like what has happened.

722
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:17,320
So it's like this mystery with three things and religious holidays know it's segment now but then it update I think maybe.

723
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:23,350
Yeah yeah yeah right. Yeah. Now I don't get mixed up with the other one.

724
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:27,400
Yeah. There's another game or girl you get each other's emails all the time.

725
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:32,529
And so by the European. Your last name. Yeah, my last name.

726
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:35,680
Change. Yeah. Congratulations. Thank you.

727
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:42,520
But I was wondering, it's still very weird.

728
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,910
I saw myself and Amber Brewer. Oh, yeah?

729
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:50,350
Why did you have to read it? So, yeah.

730
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:53,480
Yeah, it's like, know that you're married.

731
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:57,340
You know, it's. It's good. It's like, it's very annoying.

732
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:04,299
I'm still it's still not like a financial legal for everything except for the animal rights, which actually matters most.

733
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:11,860
But obviously, I need to get, like, a new Social Security card that's a 407 thriller.

734
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:16,930
And your driver's license? Yeah, they give me a sticker for my driver's license, but it doesn't.

735
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:25,450
But having said that, a lot of them, they're just a sticker that I really like.

736
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:32,020
Yeah. I don't have it on my like it's the same if you, like, change your address at night instead of Michigan.

737
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:35,500
They just send you like a little sticker that you just like.

738
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:39,470
So you just come in if you have a lawyer sticker.

739
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:45,190
Yeah, it does seem pretty terrifying, but it's like when I was like special status as a.

740
01:17:46,690 --> 01:17:49,770
All right. It's just, like, a little bit.

741
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:53,950
All right, I think. Do we have everyone pretty much back? Go ahead.

742
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:58,600
I know it's a long afternoon. Um, so what are we talking about now?

743
01:17:58,690 --> 01:18:01,780
We're not talking about body weight. I don't think so.

744
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:07,090
We just need biomarkers and blood. But now we're going to do body weight, sporting weightlifting.

745
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:14,350
Yeah. So kind of extending on another dimension of like important end points and observations, going once a level of head.

746
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:20,350
I'm sorry my voice is shrinking, but this is the pathological examination of like tissues.

747
01:18:20,710 --> 01:18:28,000
And so to help break this down, basically there's like two stages of really life stages that we're interested in considering in life.

748
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,210
One, like our actual rat unspecified species is still alive.

749
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:36,370
And so some of the things that we want to measure include like body weight as a sensitive indicator of health.

750
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:42,070
Often like rapid loss of body weight is associated with primary and secondary effects.

751
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,959
And then when do we want to measure them?

752
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:51,220
So initially, when we before we perform our study, we want to do an initial screening, make sure that we're starting off on the right foot.

753
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:59,320
And then recommendation is like 10% more animals for the minimum number of study groups that we've decided on for study design.

754
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:01,930
And then once you begin the study,

755
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:10,630
you want to measure body weights on a weekly basis and then as well as a measuring body weight at the study termination after a fasting period.

756
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:17,860
And so any issues that may arise. So there's a lot of confounding factors when we start going up into different scales of resolution.

757
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,860
And so it really requires like careful planning,

758
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:28,899
proper training and detailed standard operating procedures for both in life and across and across studies that will both.

759
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:34,330
We'll briefly talk about you and you only get one shot at like the cross could be a specialty.

760
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:42,280
And so some of the things I mentioned might include feed and water consumption like underlying disease factors and toxicities,

761
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:46,030
because that can confound your data. Most often we like feed them.

762
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:50,140
Water consumption is a poor area that's like naturally occurring. So you want to account for those effects.

763
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,760
And then so you also have like a central,

764
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:59,200
the group of like 5 to 10 animals that help like as an indicator if things are going right in your experiment.

765
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:03,430
And then of course like making sure you're like digitalizing and streamlining your data

766
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:10,149
collection for peer review auditing as well as just like identification of samples.

767
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:14,560
So sometimes they'll use them or most often we don't use subcutaneous microchip implants.

768
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:21,000
And so then on the other side of the life stage, but once you're done with the animals, you're going to perform an across copy.

769
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:28,870
And so these are really, really time sensitive because you want to avoid oral lysis when the cells start begin to like the grain their own components,

770
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:30,790
like using their own enzymes like lysosomes.

771
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:37,540
And so really like within 5 minutes and then completing it within 20 minutes is like a really short time span.

772
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:44,679
So making sure everybody's on the same page and coordinated on the team and then having like a prospector who like helps,

773
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:47,920
like I said, for like demonstration purposes aware and then,

774
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:52,050
you know, it's optional, but like a pathologist for like on documentation,

775
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:58,570
like making sure that the results of are well documented for the report and then for some organs especially.

776
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:05,500
Well, since we're doing like a novel vaccine investigation, in our instance, we want to have our pivotal organs like our brain,

777
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:09,880
kidneys, liver, adrenal glands and reproductive organs that will have like primary effects.

778
01:21:10,330 --> 01:21:15,910
And then also any potential organs that might be affected by the site of vaccine administration.

779
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:26,230
And so some common examples include immune organs like spleen with nodes, the thymus, etc. And this is often defined on a case by case basis too,

780
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:32,470
based on our like study design, our size and our capabilities as a facility and like technician training.

781
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:40,810
And then another important thing is when you're including the when you're measuring the body weights or inmates and gross findings of any lesions,

782
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:44,649
you want to normalize the organ weights relative to the brain,

783
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:51,190
which is one of the recommended or body weight, which is not really primarily recommended because once again,

784
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:56,559
like body weights can be confounded by feed and water consumption.

785
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:01,750
So that's a covariate that can like, you know, mislead the results and give you false positives.

786
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:08,620
And so the brain is not really like impacted by like this like feed and lower consumption mainly.

787
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:15,100
So it's recommended over like the body weight. Um, and then like other things to consider, right?

788
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:16,540
The pathologic context.

789
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:24,370
So you want to maximize your like actual signal that's being contributed by your, you know, test article or experimental design factor.

790
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:28,600
And you want to minimize like the noise continuum, like things you're not interested in.

791
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:34,120
So like subtle changes like in organ weight can be contributed by things like examination.

792
01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:39,639
So how you prepare and process the organs is really important because if you have like residual blood left

793
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:46,210
over that can really like give you inaccurate findings for a year or two weeks and then as well as like.

794
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:53,439
Enough that connective tissue prior to weighing that. And then you also want to prevent organs from drying out because using sealing,

795
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:59,680
not tap water, because, you know, you'll have like hypertonic like osmolarity issues.

796
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:08,829
And then if you do have like animals that die when you're not attending to them like overnight during like operational hours,

797
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:12,490
you want to refrigerate them, not freeze them prior to giving it to the press.

798
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:22,390
Presenter So that's kind of like a rapid fire, but yeah, thank you, thank you, thank you.

799
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:29,500
Yeah. So you can see there's a lot of things and there's a lot of detail to be considered that can have a strong impact on your results.

800
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:35,380
And then I guess the other thing that that brought to mind there was all of the decisions and tradeoffs we made.

801
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:39,729
So I think you were alluding to like depending on the type of study,

802
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:45,190
like you can have a huge list of organs that you might need for organ weights or for microscopy.

803
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:49,750
The more you do, the more time the necropsy takes and the more cost there is.

804
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:53,340
So you have to really always think, okay, what's the main focus of my study?

805
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:59,440
If there's a regulatory requirement, what's the minimum I need for regulatory requirement and what are the likely things to happen?

806
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:05,319
Because sometimes, like if you try to take every single organ and let's say you have a study where the GI system,

807
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:09,960
the intestine is the focus, if you take a ton of work, it's going to take you longer.

808
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:16,540
The gastrointestinal system has bacteria and it starts to orderlies within like 5 minutes after euthanasia.

809
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:21,490
So if my necropsy is slow, I'm going to degrade the quality of that tissue.

810
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:24,760
So like that comes into play when I think about the order.

811
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:31,180
So I might prioritize my first or if I have things that I need to do downstream that are time sensitive,

812
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:36,970
I might choose to make my list of stuff a little bit shorter because I know what the important ones are because everything's a tradeoff.

813
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:42,310
That was a great point about it's true. Brain is less affected by changes in body weight.

814
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:48,640
Brain is harder to take out. I mean, we usually do it as part of our type studies but takes more time.

815
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:53,890
So there are quite a few people who, if they're doing that shortened body organ weight,

816
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:57,850
they will still normalize organ weight relative to body weight, probably briefly.

817
01:24:58,150 --> 01:24:59,080
That's always a tradeoff.

818
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:05,680
But like you have to be aware of all the trade offs that you're making and make conscious decisions about what I'm going to prioritize,

819
01:25:07,130 --> 01:25:12,760
what they're going to think of. So usually we look at absolute and relative organ weights.

820
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:19,299
Some of the ways that we standardize like our rodents, studies rodents because they're all, you know, pretty much the same strain.

821
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:24,700
And everything we're using, they tend to be around the same place in terms of body weight, at least when they're young.

822
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:29,770
So a lot of times, like when you order rats from a vendor and say, I'm on it with gold rats,

823
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:35,320
or you can specify the weight range because you want your starting weights, you don't want big outliers.

824
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:43,480
So in your baseline screening, you might want to initially select animals that are within a certain standard deviation rate of weights,

825
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:51,880
and then you walk through randomized them so that within the spread of weights that you have, you're not, you know, biasing it from the start.

826
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:55,719
So I was involved with a study years ago where there was a bias.

827
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:59,440
It was a device study in a non-human primate model.

828
01:26:00,190 --> 01:26:09,009
And it was a it was essentially an IUD device. And the person doing the study we had selected reproductively mature animals,

829
01:26:09,010 --> 01:26:16,930
but they at the sorting basically assigned the larger animals to be the IED group because they thought it would be easier to place the IEDs.

830
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:21,730
And then monkeys usually are not using animals of the same age like they have a bigger age range.

831
01:26:22,150 --> 01:26:26,560
So we ended up with a bias in our data related to age and weight.

832
01:26:26,830 --> 01:26:31,060
That was very clear and that was because of that bias at the beginning.

833
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:37,570
So that's not as much of an issue usually in rodents, but it comes to play that bias at that randomization stage.

834
01:26:37,930 --> 01:26:41,050
So it's a great example. Thank you. Nice job.

835
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:50,320
We'll leave that in there. And this was an example just just from some studies that pulled out of Oregon way.

836
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:56,379
So again, I said choices have to be made. So these are sent this is part one of the guideline papers of the best practice of papers from

837
01:26:56,380 --> 01:27:01,030
talks to these are some of the common organs that are weighed in various types of studies.

838
01:27:01,510 --> 01:27:03,820
So you can see with like drug testing,

839
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:12,550
there is often a huge list of things because they're looking at different parameters like endocrine versus lymphoid versus renal or paddock toxicity.

840
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:17,380
And then depending on the study type, there might be a less comprehensive list in terms of body weights.

841
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:22,180
This is an example of a study. These were all in the control of interest groups.

842
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:29,229
This is high dose group body weight over time. So sometimes body weight could be our most sensitive marker.

843
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:35,080
So that's a really good thing to track over time, not just that end point, but a lot of times along the course of the study.

844
01:27:36,970 --> 01:27:40,209
All right. So this is just kind of a short summary.

845
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:44,890
This will be in your updated protocol. This is an abbreviated study.

846
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:49,720
So, you know, this is data that. For before. This is from not a regulatory study, kind of an experimental study.

847
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:53,500
So it's not as comprehensive as some of the nice data that Neil just showed us.

848
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:58,899
But for our study, this is what is being taken. Those are the tissues that are weighed at growth.

849
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:04,780
Necropsy We're doing body weight sneak weekly. And then this is our microscopy less.

850
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:11,290
So some of that obviously based on the the data that I have. Yeah.

851
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,830
Okay. I think I'm going to.

852
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:20,290
Oh. So for protection against viral respiratory disease, we already kind of alluded to that.

853
01:28:20,290 --> 01:28:23,350
So it's one of our measures, right, of efficacy.

854
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:27,939
So we said we're going to do a challenge study. And so what are two?

855
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:34,030
Well, yeah, let's say what are two measures we could potentially use to determine whether we're effectively

856
01:28:34,030 --> 01:28:40,180
protecting against disease and the challenge of the virus stuff is going to happen.

857
01:28:40,630 --> 01:28:44,020
So what are two things that we can measure or assess?

858
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:51,110
We think. But studies that looked at the kind of viral load.

859
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:59,090
So viral loads of our titer like that please that the slide that I showed you the virus titer it's a respiratory virus.

860
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:04,879
So probably long if we know that the lung is going to be where the majority of virus

861
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:08,120
is going to be present depending on the type of virus like maybe it will be blood.

862
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:11,480
But in this case the lung would be good. So virus load.

863
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:22,040
So that will tell us protection against like can the virus replicate to the same extent specifically for disease?

864
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:29,030
How can we measure to see what's the what's disease, what's pathology?

865
01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:32,250
Yeah, if you measure like lung scarring or like function.

866
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:37,400
Yeah. Functionality, a change in the tissue pathology, the study of disease and tissue.

867
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:42,170
So we're going to measure some sort of pathology parameter that could be inflammatory cell infiltrate.

868
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:48,410
We have to see we have to know what the pathology is expected from natural infection and come up with some way of assessing it.

869
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:50,060
So we're gonna do some pathology.

870
01:29:51,110 --> 01:29:58,880
So we'll talk more about that when we have our actual data, but like actual assessment of pathology in some way and measure of virus load.

871
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:06,709
Measure of virus load is more quantitative, but it's not the exact same thing as disease because we all know you can get infected by a virus,

872
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:11,300
but the amount of disease, the severity of disease and an individual person can be variable.

873
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:21,440
All right. So we're going to oh, oh, I thought we were going to do Animal Supply next.

874
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,740
I'm going to work with that. Oh, so sorry.

875
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:28,159
That's me. You're up. Yeah. Okay.

876
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:32,390
So. So, no, I'm sorry I skipped the whole thing tonight.

877
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:38,900
I'm sorry. So you can go back to your ready state.

878
01:30:41,630 --> 01:30:46,880
All right. Actually, we're going to do the immune stuff first, right? Because we were talking about efficacy, virus response.

879
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:50,540
So we were going to do a little of this discussion, I think.

880
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:55,640
Tiffanie, were you going to do that for us? Can you hear me, Tiffany?

881
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:05,410
Oh. That's right.

882
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:10,860
Can you hear me, Tiffany? I just got here. Oh, no.

883
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:18,820
The whole system is breaking down. I think those, like the sort of videos go away if nobody has their video turned on.

884
01:31:19,150 --> 01:31:23,410
So I think that's why that sometimes shows I think that people should be able to hear me, right?

885
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:27,580
Yeah, they can hear you. Oh, yeah. Because the little.

886
01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:32,340
Can anyone on the zoom hear me? Yeah.

887
01:31:32,830 --> 01:31:36,400
Yeah. So let's let's stop.

888
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:40,720
Oh. Oh. Okay. All right.

889
01:31:40,730 --> 01:31:44,210
So we're going to do assessment of viral disease.

890
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:47,930
Tiffany, can you hear me? Or maybe not have a microphone.

891
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:54,820
Do not a microphone. Our whole system is breaking down here.

892
01:31:54,870 --> 01:32:07,400
We'll try this. And rest are just. Oh, sorry.

893
01:32:10,670 --> 01:32:16,850
Are people, like, calling you, texting and giving? Isn't that be like, take your 2 seconds.

894
01:32:17,060 --> 01:32:20,960
That is the moment. Whenever. Sorry.

895
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:25,790
Okay. So were you. You were going to do virus.

896
01:32:26,330 --> 01:32:30,310
Platforming, I say. Was that right? Yeah. All right.

897
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:34,469
Let me share a screen again. I thought my whole system was breaking out, so I was having a miniature panic attack.

898
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:39,600
But I'm good. Now back. Do you want me to show that slide?

899
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,660
Or, like, what would help you? Is there anything on our end that we can show to help you out?

900
01:32:51,550 --> 01:33:01,240
Do you want to share your screen or what would work best for you? Okay.

901
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:42,839
Mm hmm. Great. So, yeah. So that's pretty much what the diagram has.

902
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:49,340
So the different follow that you're starting in the this example is from a stock virus culture.

903
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:54,049
So this plays to what we talked about before when we're developing a vaccine,

904
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:57,680
if we're growing a virus and we want to know what the concentration of the virus

905
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:02,000
in there are starting solution might be like stock supernatant from that culture.

906
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:09,950
But you can also do this in serum. Like if I want to know virus concentration in serum or I can use tissue homogenized.

907
01:34:10,670 --> 01:34:12,409
Right. So if we if we have our lung,

908
01:34:12,410 --> 01:34:21,410
we can homogenize that thing up and or we can do a val like a bronchoalveolar lavage or something and we can take the sample from the animal,

909
01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:28,969
and that'll be our starting thing. In that tube, we do our serial dilutions and then the plate in the background here, these blue things,

910
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:35,120
all the blue stuff is the monolayer of cells, the whole susceptible cells and the white things are actually clearings.

911
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:41,150
So the cells there have been killed and so that corresponds to one infected cell and then it spreads around it.

912
01:34:41,390 --> 01:34:44,180
So those are kind of roughly analogous to the virus load.

913
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:52,190
And then as Tiffany told us, you can kind of compute back across your dilutions and the unit you get is plaque forming units per mil.

914
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:56,090
And so you extrapolate it back to the original stock concentration.

915
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:02,450
Or if my starting material was tissue, I would weigh the tissue and then I have plaque forming units per gram.

916
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:06,360
Does that make sense? Okay. That's great.

917
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:26,390
Tiffany, do you have anything else you wanted to add about that? Yeah.

918
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:38,190
Yeah. And that also helps guard against, like, lack of homogeneity.

919
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:41,790
Like, as you're assuming, as you do those dilutions that the dilution,

920
01:35:41,790 --> 01:35:48,980
the solution is randomly distributed each time, but depending on the starting material, that may or may not be true.

921
01:35:48,990 --> 01:35:55,020
So if you're doing your dilutions and plating your dilutions, that can kind of add another measure that your final dilution,

922
01:35:55,140 --> 01:36:00,390
you can indeed literally or you can indeed calculate that back accurately to the starting concentration.

923
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:05,159
Yeah, that's great. So that is how we measure virus concentration.

924
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:08,850
And so that for our study that comes into play both during the growth phase,

925
01:36:08,970 --> 01:36:11,910
that's how we're going to figure out how much virus we have when we make the vaccine.

926
01:36:12,330 --> 01:36:16,020
And also during our measurement of disease, how much viruses in the animal.

927
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:21,299
And that comes into play in some degree when we talk about our other responses.

928
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:28,770
Another thing we wanted to measure, this was the yeah, we wanted to measure B cell responses.

929
01:36:28,770 --> 01:36:31,860
Who was that going to be? W Yeah.

930
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:40,170
Okay. Do you want me to show anything here? Yeah, you can show the you that this maybe you not a life.

931
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:44,540
Okay, this one. Okay. All right.

932
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:50,520
So the the main function of that this is to produce and produce antibody.

933
01:36:51,090 --> 01:37:07,950
So about so that uses the full name of Eliza is and I'm like and I like you know so I say to measure the amount of antibodies produced by that B cell.

934
01:37:08,850 --> 01:37:16,560
So basically B we have to have different kinds of, you know, if one is directly like that and the other is indirect like that.

935
01:37:17,130 --> 01:37:25,260
So for a direct Eliza first we got some antigens at the bottom and we add some enzyme,

936
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:31,080
they build antibody and they can bind to that and they can bind to the antigens.

937
01:37:31,450 --> 01:37:38,610
Okay, they are. And then they both means they can generate some Flores for detection.

938
01:37:38,970 --> 01:37:52,200
And then we measured the Flores produced by this reaction and this Flores is proportional to that original antigens.

939
01:37:52,560 --> 01:38:01,610
Yeah. So we then know we didn't know the amount of antibodies in this O reaction and that that

940
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:08,250
can at the indirect side that we ran up using that and they both detect and then they

941
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:16,950
both antibody directly we use a secondary antibody to label the primary antibody and the

942
01:38:17,370 --> 01:38:26,909
growth is that in each secondary antibody we can label multiple molecules of enzymes.

943
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:33,390
So it's an increased sensitivity of the whole experiment process.

944
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:38,129
But the principle is basically, you know, you just say, yeah, yeah, yeah,

945
01:38:38,130 --> 01:38:45,060
this diagram is actually showing indirect, indirect life because there's an unlabeled primary antibody.

946
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:52,530
And that's useful because in our context we're taking, for example, antibody from serum, right?

947
01:38:52,530 --> 01:38:55,649
So we're taking serum from the animal. So we vaccinated it.

948
01:38:55,650 --> 01:39:00,780
Presumably it has antibody in there, but that antibody is not to be labeled with anything because it's from the serum.

949
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:05,430
So we have virus epitopes on the surface of our plate.

950
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:08,580
We apply the serum that has antibodies in it.

951
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:14,310
And if the animal has an immune response, has antibodies present, they'll presumably bind to that target protein.

952
01:39:14,610 --> 01:39:21,839
And then, as Doug was telling us, we're going to add our labeled antibody, which will be against the constant region.

953
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:26,760
So when you have an antibody, you have variable regions that have the epitope and you have sort of in the cartoon,

954
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:32,399
it's the stem of the Y, which is the constant region. So you'll have anti rat antibody,

955
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:36,420
that's the second label and that's going to be binding to the constant region and then it

956
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:41,730
has its chlorogenic or cryogenic substrate and we can detect it and make a standard curve.

957
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:48,359
I said, did you want did you have such ad about this one or just some other concerns?

958
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:58,920
Like they actually they reflect the immunogenicity enough that it's not actually effects if they say, but we use that as a proxy for that measurement.

959
01:39:59,310 --> 01:40:04,379
And if we want to develop a vaccine that targets laudable antigens,

960
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:16,020
we need to we might need to conduct Eliza separately for each antigens and the challenges that that immune system differences among different species.

961
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:19,560
So that's had some challenges in interpreting our data.

962
01:40:19,950 --> 01:40:20,190
Yeah.

963
01:40:21,150 --> 01:40:30,420
So in context of vaccine studies serum, Eliza is most often used for total antibody measure and again, as you said, against the particular epitope.

964
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:36,210
So it is a proxy. Because it reflects just how much antibody generally generated,

965
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:41,800
but it doesn't actually tell its function because if you remember when we talked about how antibodies kill things,

966
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:48,099
you can have neutralizing antibody that binds to some important microbial protein, maybe prevents it from binding to cells.

967
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:55,780
That's a functional antibody, protective antibody, or it can have kind of an antibody that binds but doesn't really interfere with microbial function.

968
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:59,620
This isn't going to tell me the difference, right? It's just going to tell me total antibody.

969
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:06,910
So sometimes I need another test. This is often also done to measure antibody function.

970
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:11,229
So do you remember the plaque that Tiffany just showed us?

971
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:14,379
That plaque assay. So plaque assay.

972
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:17,800
Right. Was dependent on effective virus infection.

973
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:22,550
Right. We put the virus on the cell. The virus has to infect the cells and kill the cells.

974
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:32,590
If we take that original vial like of sera, for example, like with virus, and we add an antibody to it that's functional, that's neutralizing.

975
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:37,060
It's going to block. Do you understand the effective number of virus in the tube?

976
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:43,660
And then when we do the plate assay, we're not going to get as many plaques because we're neutralizing the virus.

977
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:52,000
We're preventing it from binding to the cells. So that plaque formation assay that Tiffany explained to us can also be used.

978
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:56,290
It's a little bit less precise method than Eliza's.

979
01:41:56,290 --> 01:42:03,860
It's not going to give us as accurate an answer really for titer, for total titer, but it gives us a function answer, they said.

980
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:07,720
So these are two things like when you as in combination and you can have a situation where you

981
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:11,680
have a ton of antibody but like you don't really make any difference on the plaque forming assay.

982
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:15,340
So be like, well, that might be that we picked a less effective epitope.

983
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:22,690
And so this is just an example, the data that you get from the plaque reduction neutralization assay.

984
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:33,610
So really this is just kind of a obstructed version of the plaque forming assay where you can determine at different dilutions what percent of the

985
01:42:33,610 --> 01:42:42,640
the like your baseline is just infection with no antibody and C determine what percent of that drop that infection with different dilutions of serum.

986
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:47,470
So it's a way of measuring the amount of functional antibody that makes sense.

987
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:53,769
So that's great. So yeah, so when we think about B cell function and remember these are all very kind of indirect.

988
01:42:53,770 --> 01:42:59,920
So these are ways of measuring the antibody producing aspect of B cell function.

989
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:06,889
All right. And then there's another whole arm to the immune system, which is t cell responses, I think.

990
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:10,460
Or are you going to do that, right? Yes. You want to show this? Sure.

991
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:16,590
Okay. I work here, but you just walk very quickly. So it's kind of like B cells.

992
01:43:16,930 --> 01:43:22,569
A similar process from Elispot, Elisa not detecting antibodies,

993
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:31,000
but in this case detecting specific cytokines that respond to the specific antigen that are that our infection will produce to.

994
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,050
I'm going to go forward or turn on now. Okay.

995
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:41,770
We'll wrap it all together with the images in a second. Okay. So this Elispot, again, specific antigen, specific cytokine measuring.

996
01:43:41,770 --> 01:43:47,490
There's also this window side assay that uses this to try to trace here the timeline.

997
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:55,440
Basically this real isotope of hydrogen linked to, um, at this time that gets incorporated into new DNA.

998
01:43:55,450 --> 01:44:05,829
And as I understand it, as this new DNA is used in T cells, you can look at that radioactive isotope and basically see after this time point,

999
01:44:05,830 --> 01:44:11,710
once we put this radioisotope in how many new T cells were produced following infection,

1000
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:18,070
that's another way of looking at T cell production, but not function piece,

1001
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:23,200
at least by looks at the function with the set of hand production of the T cells.

1002
01:44:23,650 --> 01:44:31,540
Um. Collection wise, this is all following infection or stimulation ex vivo x people in this case.

1003
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:39,340
Just a reminder is when the tissues are directly taken from organisms and then used experimentally,

1004
01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:48,070
we go to the next slide and this is just kind of living example of a family's from a European biotech company.

1005
01:44:48,430 --> 01:44:52,660
And this is a great explanation. There's a link there of this ALS test.

1006
01:44:53,230 --> 01:44:56,530
And on the right, you can kind of see the similarities with the ALS five.

1007
01:44:56,530 --> 01:45:05,770
But instead of having the antigen being on a wells or on the plate that has an antibody that binds to the cytokine,

1008
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:12,850
and then an antibody with the tag plus intact binds to that cytokine.

1009
01:45:12,850 --> 01:45:17,830
And then that's what you see for us. Okay. It's kind of hard to see and it's a flaw.

1010
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:26,560
Yeah, sorry. The idea. And then so the left is kind of one of those dishes that looked like before and after vaccination with these,

1011
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:32,770
with this test done for those, uh, inflammatory cytokines.

1012
01:45:33,570 --> 01:45:36,060
Uh, you know,

1013
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:49,610
when I say what I and this one is just like flow cytometry where it's another method to look at t cell production and the function is a little harder.

1014
01:45:49,620 --> 01:45:57,929
You have to use all the intracellular cytokines. Staining is less efficient, more specialized, more costly.

1015
01:45:57,930 --> 01:46:02,430
But it's what I learned when I learned immunology.

1016
01:46:02,430 --> 01:46:06,180
And so that's why I kind of jumped to it. Yes. This is is experiment.

1017
01:46:06,180 --> 01:46:12,720
I think in experimental bioscience, this is probably more common because you're usually really delving into which subset is there.

1018
01:46:13,350 --> 01:46:16,650
But if you're testing like real world efficacy, sometimes you just want to know,

1019
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:23,669
are the T cells proliferating in response to antigen or are they, you know, producing interferon in response to antigen?

1020
01:46:23,670 --> 01:46:27,120
So you just want kind of a yes or no answer. Sure. Yeah.

1021
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:30,240
And that's what I got on T cells. Good job.

1022
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:34,110
Yeah. So thank you. Thank you. Yeah.

1023
01:46:34,110 --> 01:46:43,439
So the take home point. So yeah, that was great. Or in T cells of the C the other arm of the immune system for T cell responses.

1024
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:46,530
One important thing is that you are trying to measure.

1025
01:46:46,530 --> 01:46:54,870
You are trying to measure even with the the prevailing timeline as a little bit function because

1026
01:46:54,870 --> 01:46:59,940
you're trying to but a T so what a memory T-cell should do is if it encounters antigen,

1027
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:04,080
it should proliferate, make more of itself and it should activate.

1028
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:15,330
And the proxy we have for that is interferon gamma. So Elispot uses measurement of interferon gamma in response to, as you said, ex vivo stimulation.

1029
01:47:15,690 --> 01:47:18,330
So we have lots of T cells and are not functional.

1030
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:26,309
When we throw on the extra zero antigen, you're not going to get high levels of interferon gamma, so you get a plenty of t cells.

1031
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:29,460
You could throw them out for cytometer say there's lots of CD3 positive cells,

1032
01:47:29,790 --> 01:47:37,619
but there is no increase if you were to have a negative amount of spot after you add the antigen.

1033
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:45,810
So there's an zero stimulation. And for the proliferation assay, this is just measuring a radial labeled form of five these.

1034
01:47:45,870 --> 01:47:47,819
So you're providing it with a nucleic acid.

1035
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:54,780
So when the cells proliferate and make more DNA, their radial labeling, their own DNA, so it's just a marker for cell proliferation.

1036
01:47:54,780 --> 01:48:01,769
So they're you're directly counting the number of T cells, but the same thing if you don't have activated or functional T cells,

1037
01:48:01,770 --> 01:48:04,830
they're not going to proliferate in response to that specific antigen.

1038
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:10,110
So both of them have a functional component, but they're measuring functionality in different ways.

1039
01:48:10,110 --> 01:48:13,680
Proliferation versus cytokine production.

1040
01:48:14,350 --> 01:48:23,300
T Cell assays are more complicated, more difficult to do, and there are plenty of like early stage preclinical studies.

1041
01:48:23,310 --> 01:48:27,690
You just measure antibody because it's just easier. And in the real world you're kind of on both arms.

1042
01:48:27,870 --> 01:48:36,389
And it's also easier in human patients to just measure antibody is kind of a proxy of efficacy of T cell is a little bit more specialized,

1043
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:39,630
takes a little bit more kind of planning to do, but they can be done.

1044
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:49,740
Um, blah blah blah. Measure of disease reduction we already talked about and that brings us finally sorry final you're up now.

1045
01:48:49,970 --> 01:48:55,420
I know the pi how. Okay so I have four small ish sections.

1046
01:48:55,420 --> 01:49:04,649
So this is all about like how do we obtain animals, how do we want them and how do we keep them healthy throughout the duration of the experiment?

1047
01:49:04,650 --> 01:49:12,990
Because we obviously don't want our rats to experience any adverse health that's directly tied to how they're kept,

1048
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:22,530
because that can mess up our understanding of how the vaccine affects the vaccine and like the health effects from that actually occur.

1049
01:49:22,530 --> 01:49:33,540
So with sourcing the animals, it's you have to get them from the same from the same vendor, and then you also have to get them from the same source.

1050
01:49:34,050 --> 01:49:37,020
Because if you have rats from different source colonies,

1051
01:49:37,410 --> 01:49:43,559
they're going to have different responses to xeno biotics because they've experienced differences in the housing

1052
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:50,310
or the diet or the different pathogens that they've been exposed to within those different source colonies,

1053
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:57,640
even if they're from the same vendor. And then I think some of this is covered was covered in Neil's presentation.

1054
01:49:57,690 --> 01:50:01,080
Like how like how do you get the animal?

1055
01:50:01,090 --> 01:50:05,729
So you want to order like a certain standard deviation of the way and then randomize

1056
01:50:05,730 --> 01:50:10,379
from there as we talked about then and then with the health considerations.

1057
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:20,190
So the most of the testing facilities are pretty free of the pathogens that cause clinical disease, but some of them, just because of space concerns,

1058
01:50:20,190 --> 01:50:29,250
have high stocking densities or they have a lot of colonies in close proximity which can facilitate the spread of pathogens.

1059
01:50:29,610 --> 01:50:32,490
So you just have to be careful about that. And then.

1060
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:37,990
Most facilities depend on a study like you might have different need for different health studies.

1061
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:45,010
Like if I have immune compromised animals. Right? Even microbes that are just commensal can sometimes cause disease.

1062
01:50:45,310 --> 01:50:51,070
So like in our facility here at the University of Michigan, different Bavaria have different health services.

1063
01:50:51,070 --> 01:50:59,500
We have containment, we have barrier housing that has a a higher health status, meaning we exclude more things versus like general housing,

1064
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:06,370
which still we still have sensible animals in place and we still have a standard with the pathogens that we look for to exclude.

1065
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:10,570
But there's different levels of housing, that kind of cleanliness.

1066
01:51:10,570 --> 01:51:17,740
And in the vendors, people supplying animals, there are breeding stock are always like their base.

1067
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:21,970
Stock colonies are always at the highest level of health surveillance.

1068
01:51:22,330 --> 01:51:25,690
So those are very clean, like shower and shower up facilities are really very,

1069
01:51:25,690 --> 01:51:31,210
very clean versus they're kind of working staff, the ones they sell to the investigators.

1070
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:38,400
Because if you have a health outbreak, right, it's easier to shut that down and go back even to cryopreserved embryos and start again.

1071
01:51:38,740 --> 01:51:43,209
So that health status is very, very important. Yeah.

1072
01:51:43,210 --> 01:51:50,050
So then that begs the question, like, how do we assess microbial infections within these animals?

1073
01:51:50,050 --> 01:51:57,220
There's a few options that you can do. So something that's really common is having certain animals in contact with the study animals.

1074
01:51:57,730 --> 01:52:01,720
So then better contact or are there other ways of exposing sentinel animals?

1075
01:52:02,530 --> 01:52:06,220
Could that be expensive? Right. About a deferral of something else. Yeah.

1076
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:12,160
So I, I think they're not in contact with, they're just like part of the study.

1077
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:18,340
So usually speaking of animals that are in the facility, surviving animal husbandry, they're in a different cage in the room.

1078
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:22,690
And like now of mice, there's urine and feces in the cage.

1079
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:27,070
Right. And I have people coming in and cleaning the cage. They won't know what I'm getting at.

1080
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:30,149
How do you expose the sentinel animals? Like cross-contamination.

1081
01:52:30,150 --> 01:52:34,230
contamination? Yeah. So, like, when they clean the cages, they take a scoop.

1082
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:40,800
I mean, I'll throw the whole thing in. Have you take a scoop from the cages and put that in the sentinel, intentionally contaminate that cage.

1083
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:49,590
So, like, one method is like shared bedding, setting contamination, because, like, you want the scent of my office to get infected, whatever's there.

1084
01:52:50,550 --> 01:52:53,790
So that's one common method, right? Yeah.

1085
01:52:53,800 --> 01:53:01,320
So then there's like, I think I, we talked about right there with the PCR examination of the feces so then that you can

1086
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:06,750
detect viral pathogens or bacterial infections and then with housing and husbandry.

1087
01:53:06,750 --> 01:53:10,620
So there are a lot of factors within housing that can affect their health.

1088
01:53:10,620 --> 01:53:17,489
So temperature, humidity, light, airflow, water there they're bedding is a big thing as well.

1089
01:53:17,490 --> 01:53:21,870
So those are all things you have to account for and you have to make sure to document

1090
01:53:21,870 --> 01:53:27,960
those and make sure that all of those conditions are equal for all of the participants,

1091
01:53:27,990 --> 01:53:30,330
certainly all the the rats in your study,

1092
01:53:30,660 --> 01:53:39,060
one factor that vary is that sometimes you don't think about a lot of our inbred mice and rats in particular have like retinal sensitivities.

1093
01:53:39,210 --> 01:53:43,170
So especially a lot of our vinyl strains, they're very, very sensitive to light.

1094
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:47,910
And it's actually pretty common for them to have some mutations that cause retinal degeneration of the young age.

1095
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:53,040
The animals on the top shelf, if you've ever been out of a barrier room, are closer to the ceiling lights.

1096
01:53:53,550 --> 01:53:58,770
They actually have accelerated retinal degeneration compared to the animals on the bottom shelf.

1097
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:04,379
So if you're doing an ocular study, you really have to be careful about where the animals in the groups are distributed.

1098
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:09,480
So that's like one kind of example of a room housing condition that can actually affect your study,

1099
01:54:09,850 --> 01:54:16,860
one that also affects like their feeding and drinking habits, ability to find the food in order to find the water.

1100
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:21,570
Well, not so much for rodents, because rodents are really driven by olfactory sense.

1101
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:26,730
The olfactory lobe of their brain is huge compared to ours, so they like to feed their eyes for that.

1102
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:32,370
But it can affect well, I mean, maybe it would affect some of the behavior aspects.

1103
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:38,669
They're very olfactory driven. So for them, it's a bigger deal if they have something ammonia levels actually,

1104
01:54:38,670 --> 01:54:43,020
like if you're not keeping a regular level of cage cleaning and the ammonia from the urine is high,

1105
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:45,240
that just like we talked about, corrosive,

1106
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:51,840
that's corrosive to the nasal epithelium and that can compromise their ability to smell and that can have downstream effects.

1107
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:56,829
There is just a very olfactory driven species. Okay.

1108
01:54:56,830 --> 01:54:59,979
Yeah. So good. Right.

1109
01:54:59,980 --> 01:55:05,860
So then you want to acclimate the animals to the environment and personnel and equipment that is involved in your study.

1110
01:55:05,860 --> 01:55:11,050
And I think it's mentioned on the the following slides and how we will do that in our study.

1111
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:17,379
And then lastly, so you want to monitor the health of your of your rats throughout the study,

1112
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:22,060
but then your the goal is not to carry the study out until the totality occurs.

1113
01:55:22,060 --> 01:55:25,090
So we want to euthanize the more humane endpoints.

1114
01:55:25,090 --> 01:55:34,440
And doing that can be tricky because you have to know the behaviors and the physiological attributes of the animals, like when they're about to die.

1115
01:55:34,450 --> 01:55:41,349
So that that can be a little bit tricky to identify among residents and then for diet.

1116
01:55:41,350 --> 01:55:46,719
So the goal for dies provide enough nutrients for their growth and maintenance.

1117
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:49,570
They're not providing access nutrients.

1118
01:55:49,570 --> 01:55:57,580
So there there are a few types of diets, but the most standard one for for rodent studies is are non purified diet.

1119
01:55:58,210 --> 01:56:04,870
So that's like unrefined plant animal materials and then open formula means that there is a known composition

1120
01:56:04,870 --> 01:56:12,040
of each ingredient and that just ensures standardization in the in the diet that the rats are receiving.

1121
01:56:12,730 --> 01:56:19,059
And then so you can include like moderate diet restriction which can improve longevity of your rats.

1122
01:56:19,060 --> 01:56:26,980
But I think for a study like this ad libitum or which basically means diet without any restriction is also an option.

1123
01:56:28,150 --> 01:56:33,340
Yeah. Yeah. That comes into the decisions based on the focus of the study and what you think is likely to occur.

1124
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:35,950
So like and also just logistics,

1125
01:56:36,070 --> 01:56:43,390
so like controlled diet like if you have to measure feed consumption and you have to measure out a certain amount of feed each day,

1126
01:56:43,990 --> 01:56:46,660
that's more time consuming. So it has a higher labor cost.

1127
01:56:46,750 --> 01:56:51,250
So depending on the duration of my study and the most important things in my study, I may not do that.

1128
01:56:51,250 --> 01:56:56,410
It's much easier to just kind of make sure they put all the time to top it off, you know, change it at a regular schedule.

1129
01:56:58,060 --> 01:57:05,760
But absolutely, if you have a long term study, if you feed ad libitum, especially rats and they're just eating a little bit,

1130
01:57:05,770 --> 01:57:09,940
then they get pretty fat and they have a higher incidence of spontaneous tumors.

1131
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:17,230
So ad lib feeding for a two year study, which is essentially a lifetime study for rodents, kind of give your raise your background level of tumor.

1132
01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:21,760
So that might be a case where you would want to restrict the diet somewhat for our purified

1133
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:26,499
versus non purified diet that can come into play depending on where your study is.

1134
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:32,170
Certainly the less sort of specialized the diet is, the cheaper it is, and that can be a factor.

1135
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:35,799
But if I'm doing like, I don't know, an environmental type study,

1136
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:41,620
I'm looking at endocrine disruptors and I'm using a food which usually has some plant feces and there are

1137
01:57:41,620 --> 01:57:47,679
some naturally occurring like phyto estrogens and that I might want to know exactly how much estrogen,

1138
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:51,970
you know, compared to the experimental stuff I'm giving the animal, how much estrogen they're being exposed to.

1139
01:57:52,270 --> 01:57:59,020
So there I might not need to have a really controlled batch tested diet so I can be really conscious of any sort of variation.

1140
01:57:59,470 --> 01:58:04,930
Your hope is that the diets do come from plants and there are seasonal variations in estrogens and things like that as well.

1141
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:08,980
So again, it's thinking about all these factors and seeing what is going to be important for this study

1142
01:58:09,730 --> 01:58:14,800
without going so overboard that you make your little study so expensive that you can't do it.

1143
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:19,480
All right. That's great. You have it. Are you good? Yeah.

1144
01:58:19,540 --> 01:58:23,199
Okay, I stop. All right.

1145
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:33,760
And I think that brings us home to Jade, who is going to talk about euthanasia and things like that.

1146
01:58:36,250 --> 01:58:39,330
Oh, wait, sorry. This was the summary that's going to be in here.

1147
01:58:39,340 --> 01:58:43,300
This kind of the stuff that sort of just talked about, this is going to be the summary in your protocol.

1148
01:58:43,690 --> 01:58:51,310
And in particular, you can look here under our specific pathogen free conditions, that's a phrase you'll often see specific pathogen free,

1149
01:58:51,670 --> 01:58:55,930
which means that we have a defined list of pathogens that we screen for, and here's our list.

1150
01:58:56,410 --> 01:59:02,830
So that doesn't mean germ free. That means it's free of common things that we screen for and then we define what those are.

1151
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:06,490
So if somebody else is like, Well, what about Helicobacter? Do you screen for Helicobacter?

1152
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:10,030
They know that. No, we didn't. So that is a possible comforter for us.

1153
01:59:11,050 --> 01:59:21,370
Okay. Yes. So that specific pathogen free roaming and different pathogens and again like from experiment to experiment, it's usually per facility.

1154
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:25,510
So usually for your facility you decide. And like I said, we have different health statuses.

1155
01:59:25,510 --> 01:59:32,589
So our cleanest facility we have a longer list because that's where we have a lot of our immunocompromised mice in our general housing.

1156
01:59:32,590 --> 01:59:36,310
There are a lot of things that for immune competent mice, it doesn't matter. So we have a shorter list.

1157
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:44,739
So it's defined by facility usually and within the facility, even by like section or another variable, but it's user defined.

1158
01:59:44,740 --> 01:59:48,430
So like when I say I ran my study under specific pathogen preconditions,

1159
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:54,340
you could have run your study under SPF conditions too, but our definition of that term could be very different.

1160
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:57,820
So that's why we have to. Specify it. Thank you. Okay.

1161
01:59:57,830 --> 02:00:01,460
Where are we going for regulatory approvals? Okay.

1162
02:00:02,150 --> 02:00:06,290
Tell me if you want to show anything that you like. So I shall observe.

1163
02:00:06,290 --> 02:00:14,150
The University of Michigan's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee is going to be approving all of our animal use for the study,

1164
02:00:15,150 --> 02:00:19,280
including endpoints and use the data. So there it's in the title.

1165
02:00:19,670 --> 02:00:24,229
They're concerned with animal care. So they are really concerned about the welfare of the animals.

1166
02:00:24,230 --> 02:00:34,430
They want to eliminate suffering. And so because we're doing a vaccination study with toxicity tests and efficacy tests,

1167
02:00:35,660 --> 02:00:38,920
they're going to be concerned about the animal welfare throughout those processes.

1168
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:43,340
So as far as efficacy, Tesco, you know,

1169
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:52,970
they may develop a viral infection and we want to be able to identify any signs that the animal may be showing that they have an infection.

1170
02:00:53,990 --> 02:00:56,780
And then as far as toxicity goes, similarly,

1171
02:00:56,990 --> 02:01:02,600
we want to make sure that they have any acute toxicity that can be fatal and we want to be able to recognize that.

1172
02:01:02,600 --> 02:01:10,309
So there are some ways that are that we can kind of see that physically.

1173
02:01:10,310 --> 02:01:19,760
So with rodents specifically, they're going to have like a very hunched and scruffy posture when they are not feeling well.

1174
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:28,189
Um, also rodents are very social animals, so if we have them housed, I'm not sure if we'll be putting the house individually or in groups,

1175
02:01:28,190 --> 02:01:32,900
but if they are in groups and they start isolating themselves or they stop eating or drinking water,

1176
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:36,770
that would be abnormal nesting behavior to look out for.

1177
02:01:37,370 --> 02:01:46,519
And so we should be monitoring our rodents daily and we should be monitoring them specifically after we administer the

1178
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:55,429
vaccine just to make sure they don't have any acute effects from the toxicity tests such as any nonspecific information.

1179
02:01:55,430 --> 02:02:03,110
So we've talked about that this morning. Edema is the first sign of inflammation and then ultimately and black.

1180
02:02:03,350 --> 02:02:14,300
So we don't want to see any like smooth muscle response from the animal because that could be indicative of multi organ system failure.

1181
02:02:15,290 --> 02:02:20,890
Um, so with that, it's a lot of information I think from the next slide.

1182
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:26,930
Okay. You've had or. Yeah, but there's one other one after that.

1183
02:02:26,930 --> 02:02:32,760
Yeah. So that's one. Yes. So I'll go back to euthanasia.

1184
02:02:33,110 --> 02:02:40,820
Sure. That I feel like this is easier to talk about first. So there is a scoring criteria to monitor animals throughout the study.

1185
02:02:41,510 --> 02:02:46,940
So essentially, if if the score is cumulatively above five,

1186
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:58,100
that's indicative that we're going to either need to contact the vet or euthanize the animal early because they're showing significant signs,

1187
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:08,030
signs of morbidity, and it wouldn't be humane to continue on or if they score three in any of the categories, which I'll go over this in a second,

1188
02:03:09,410 --> 02:03:16,670
a three or higher, then that's like an immediate red flag where we're going to want to consider early euthanasia.

1189
02:03:16,670 --> 02:03:24,410
So there are categories for this that we're going to be looking at for our physical appearance, which I already went over.

1190
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:33,349
There's also a physical exam portion where that monitors like heartbeat, stuff like that,

1191
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:39,770
like a little bit more intensive body weight and then behavior, which I talked about as well.

1192
02:03:39,770 --> 02:03:47,929
And then there's a body condition score which kind of takes all of that into account and

1193
02:03:47,930 --> 02:03:55,610
looks at the link fat on the animal and kind of like feels around to see like it's more,

1194
02:03:55,790 --> 02:03:59,239
I guess invasive than body weight where you're actually kind of feeling around

1195
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:04,910
on the animal to see like how if they're like emaciated or anything like that,

1196
02:04:04,940 --> 02:04:10,940
it's actually like there's a diagram of it too that you can even look at a mouse and kind of see just without touching it.

1197
02:04:11,390 --> 02:04:17,630
It has to do with like how prominent their bones are. There's like a little cartoon of it, drug, like first the mouse back office around it.

1198
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:21,440
That's like a normal mouse. And then it gets really pointy because they're losing a lot of muscle mass.

1199
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:28,400
So like once you kind of develop your eye for it, you can actually just look at a mouse and know like when its bones are more prominent.

1200
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:31,850
And so some ways it can actually be quicker and less invasive.

1201
02:04:32,180 --> 02:04:33,229
Like you don't have to touch them.

1202
02:04:33,230 --> 02:04:39,110
But like so like there's training charts and stuff that you can learn to do this really quickly because like physical exam,

1203
02:04:39,110 --> 02:04:42,200
unless you're like veterinarian examining the animal like that one looks really sick.

1204
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:48,499
I'm going to check it. Usually we don't pick them up and individually examine them other than their body weight,

1205
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:54,100
their regular schedule body weight one because like it's stressful for a mouse, I think a huge human grabbing, you know.

1206
02:04:54,470 --> 02:04:57,080
So we don't want to. At another like parameter.

1207
02:04:57,890 --> 02:05:04,090
So in many cases, a lot of the scoring systems you can with a trained observer, you can like do it right, like by AI.

1208
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:07,459
So people are just kind of looking of like seeing and a lot of things too.

1209
02:05:07,460 --> 02:05:10,100
Animals tend to hide their illness, rate their prey animal.

1210
02:05:10,110 --> 02:05:14,780
So like if you're a pretty animal, you don't be like, I feel so sick because a predator is going to get you.

1211
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:21,260
So like a lot of times if you take a cage out of Iraq and like you're putting it in the cage changing hood, the others are excited.

1212
02:05:21,260 --> 02:05:27,450
They're running around and like, you got to look, if you put that cage back on the rack and the excitement is gone, just kind of watch up.

1213
02:05:27,470 --> 02:05:30,980
And that's when the one that's like kind of not feeling so well will be like,

1214
02:05:30,980 --> 02:05:33,890
off by itself, maybe like breathing really fast and having some difficulty.

1215
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:42,350
So take some training and like you've got to it's more subtle than, you know, they don't make it as obvious as some of our domestic species.

1216
02:05:42,350 --> 02:05:47,000
But yeah, but there are just kind of a method of treating eyes and like the end stage illness.

1217
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:53,479
So like in a lot of our protocols, we write this basically because this is in our it's not universal,

1218
02:05:53,480 --> 02:05:56,840
but in our facility there's this system which is what you've described.

1219
02:05:57,470 --> 02:06:03,920
So like we've stated, we're going to use this, that this is like a standing protocol in our, you know, facility.

1220
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:08,270
We don't have to like enumerate all the different things or you can like put one parameter,

1221
02:06:08,270 --> 02:06:10,940
say, I'm going to use body condition scoring forever, I'm going to use body.

1222
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:16,310
But some sort of system that you've thought about, these are the criteria I'm going to apply with Grace.

1223
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:27,500
So I guess moving on to euthanasia specifically, so there's this term on the underside and it's AVMA approved,

1224
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:32,510
which AVMA stands for the American Veterinary Medical Association,

1225
02:06:33,350 --> 02:06:41,720
and they have a panel specifically on euthanasia that creates these tables to approve euthanasia methods,

1226
02:06:42,260 --> 02:06:49,040
ending them as humane so that we're, you know, eliminating as much suffering as possible for the animals.

1227
02:06:49,820 --> 02:06:52,970
So I believe that A is stands for acceptable.

1228
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:58,820
A C I think is like acceptable with the caveat of like anesthesia.

1229
02:06:59,180 --> 02:07:07,370
And then the U is unacceptable. So if you look at rodents as small animals as you said, please, barbiturates, inject less statics.

1230
02:07:07,700 --> 02:07:14,569
And then instead of that, if you want to use anesthesia, you can use inhaling anesthetics or carbon dioxide.

1231
02:07:14,570 --> 02:07:21,680
So I assume for the study, a lot of the animal studies here at University of Michigan use CO2 as the primary.

1232
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:27,079
So I put that and like was mentioned earlier, I don't want to be considered,

1233
02:07:27,080 --> 02:07:33,680
but I figured it'd be easiest to do carbon dioxide administration, so that would be with anesthesia for a rat.

1234
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:38,750
And then also from that, that's the primary euthanasia.

1235
02:07:38,870 --> 02:07:42,829
Euthanasia. There's also a list of approved secondary methods.

1236
02:07:42,830 --> 02:07:51,260
So you want to ensure once you administer the carbon dioxide that the animal is in fact dead, you don't want them to be suffering.

1237
02:07:52,010 --> 02:07:56,180
And a primary method that's used here is bilateral pneumothorax.

1238
02:07:56,180 --> 02:08:06,260
So essentially making a slit across their chests to puncture the lungs so that they're not going to be they're not going to resuscitate it.

1239
02:08:06,890 --> 02:08:11,990
And we're doing that by default because we're going to necropsy, right? Yes. Yeah, yeah.

1240
02:08:12,080 --> 02:08:16,210
That's great. We are actually for our study. We're going to use it.

1241
02:08:16,220 --> 02:08:19,850
We did. I put it in there. Oh, oh yeah.

1242
02:08:20,090 --> 02:08:25,729
It's a the animals euthanized study endpoint by AVMA approved method and our method,

1243
02:08:25,730 --> 02:08:28,760
we actually have a rodent vaporizer like a Russian anesthetic machine.

1244
02:08:29,120 --> 02:08:32,130
So we typically use 5% isoflurane.

1245
02:08:32,230 --> 02:08:36,620
That's a high level anesthetic administration and that's the ties. And then we use CO2.

1246
02:08:36,950 --> 02:08:43,910
We'll talk about it more a lot, but CO2 is a bit noxious and so they can sometimes have some secondary lung changes and it's a more harsh method.

1247
02:08:44,300 --> 02:08:47,540
Yeah, kind of like following the farmer and using CO2 as an anesthetic.

1248
02:08:48,080 --> 02:08:52,820
I read that like in the book or know the basic toxicology like yeah.

1249
02:08:52,830 --> 02:08:59,209
Textbook that there might be like vocal alveolar like hemorrhage due to like CO2 asphyxiation.

1250
02:08:59,210 --> 02:09:02,630
I don't know if that's like a minor effect or it depends.

1251
02:09:02,630 --> 02:09:07,250
Probably more so in mice, but for the CO2, it also depends on the person.

1252
02:09:07,730 --> 02:09:12,710
So like if you've ever been in a you land the variable space where those and I'll show you on ours when we get to the lab.

1253
02:09:13,580 --> 02:09:20,600
If you put a really high percentage of CO2 in the chamber that's very noxious to inhale,

1254
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:25,280
causes a lot of distress, can cause a lot of that probably can cause a lot of alveolar damage.

1255
02:09:25,910 --> 02:09:29,300
It kills mammal faster, but it's highly noxious.

1256
02:09:29,660 --> 02:09:35,989
So like there are regulations and like if you look on the regulator for our CO2, it has like a marker and it says small cage,

1257
02:09:35,990 --> 02:09:44,750
large cage that's calculated based on the air in the cage and the rate of adding it so that it's calculated to give only above a third,

1258
02:09:44,750 --> 02:09:49,250
only to a certain percent of CO2 to try to minimize that kind of risk.

1259
02:09:49,940 --> 02:09:53,840
That said, CO2 is more noxious than an inhalant anesthetic.

1260
02:09:53,850 --> 02:09:59,920
So there's a movement. More towards overdose and Anastasia or anesthesia plus CO2 like we're doing here.

1261
02:10:00,430 --> 02:10:05,660
They're actually it's kind of funny, but the way they assess this,

1262
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:14,800
they had a study where they recruited college students, probably undergrads, and they had like a CO2 inhaler thing.

1263
02:10:14,810 --> 02:10:17,190
So they I mean, obviously they weren't at the toxic levels.

1264
02:10:17,210 --> 02:10:24,250
This was approved by some sort of IBC somewhere, but they invited them to like inhale the percentages.

1265
02:10:24,550 --> 02:10:32,530
And then they had to ask them, would you be how bad was that on a scale of 1 to 5, and would you be willing to take another breath?

1266
02:10:34,330 --> 02:10:40,420
I don't know if I'm a study, but yeah, but like that was how they kind of made the like I mean,

1267
02:10:40,420 --> 02:10:43,239
there's probably some ability to it, but I guess you extrapolate that to a mouse.

1268
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:48,190
But like that's how they made the determination of like what the relative levels obnoxiousness are.

1269
02:10:48,250 --> 02:10:51,670
So anyway, just, you know, contribute to research for your pet.

1270
02:10:51,940 --> 02:10:56,860
But so anyway, that's great.

1271
02:10:57,760 --> 02:11:00,790
All right, good job. So that kind of is the summary of what?

1272
02:11:01,030 --> 02:11:06,000
Oh, so I guess that's a summary of what we'll be doing or kind of an overview.

1273
02:11:06,010 --> 02:11:09,730
And like I said, I'll summarize all that information and put it into the protocol.

1274
02:11:10,810 --> 02:11:17,530
But you're really good. I know it's a long time. I'm going to finish up with a discussion of sample size calculations.

1275
02:11:18,070 --> 02:11:21,550
I know this is one of our longer classes. I appreciate you guys kind of sticking with it,

1276
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:28,239
but I don't want to make next week long and I just want to finish up with this because it pertains to the sample protocol.

1277
02:11:28,240 --> 02:11:35,440
So I'm just going to give a quick overview of sample size calculations, some of which probably relates to information you have.

1278
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:41,379
Or I used to ask this in a question and answer format and I would ask like, okay, well, what do you think?

1279
02:11:41,380 --> 02:11:42,640
How are we going to determine?

1280
02:11:43,090 --> 02:11:48,069
How are we going to determine what our group sizes are or like, what kind of group sizes are going to use some of this yellow out?

1281
02:11:48,070 --> 02:11:53,320
Usually people say nothing and I would just hope she's a call me just kind of sitting there and someone's just right away.

1282
02:11:53,320 --> 02:11:56,649
You've got three. All right. Okay. That's really definitive.

1283
02:11:56,650 --> 02:12:00,820
Like, what's your reasoning is like, well, three is the minimum you need to calculate.

1284
02:12:00,820 --> 02:12:06,580
On average, you don't like the thought process, but that is not how we're going to do it.

1285
02:12:07,630 --> 02:12:14,080
That's all right. This presentation is also under the background stuff.

1286
02:12:16,070 --> 02:12:19,660
You guys okay? Actually, do you guys want to just keep going through?

1287
02:12:20,530 --> 02:12:25,540
You don't wanna take another break or anything. I know it's long, but we can power through it because it's about power.

1288
02:12:25,540 --> 02:12:29,770
The power calculation, you can do it. All right. So sample size calculations.

1289
02:12:29,890 --> 02:12:34,660
So when we're doing a sample size calculation, we're usually asked to do this, like for your I cook.

1290
02:12:34,750 --> 02:12:46,480
And it's a good idea anyway because you want to make sure that your study has the statistical power to make to accurately assess your objective.

1291
02:12:47,020 --> 02:12:51,910
Right. So our objective here is going to be to assess the protective efficacy of vaccination.

1292
02:12:52,570 --> 02:12:57,970
So the first thing we do is we have to pick a relative, a relevant efficacy measure.

1293
02:12:58,450 --> 02:13:06,310
So of the bajillion things we're measuring in our study, we're going to do a power calculation for something that's very important and relevant.

1294
02:13:06,430 --> 02:13:13,149
So here I picked virus titer in target tissue. If you have another parameter that's important to you, like, I don't know,

1295
02:13:13,150 --> 02:13:18,700
body weight or something that would need a separate sample size calculation because your study,

1296
02:13:18,700 --> 02:13:23,320
depending on what the parameter is, can have different power to detect different types of differences.

1297
02:13:23,710 --> 02:13:28,810
So if there are several important endpoints, one thing you can do is do a power calculation for each,

1298
02:13:29,290 --> 02:13:32,980
and then you pick the number that gives you the highest group size.

1299
02:13:33,340 --> 02:13:36,729
Right. So you're you're going for the one that's least sensitive.

1300
02:13:36,730 --> 02:13:42,520
You're making your groups big enough to hit your least sensitive, important objective, and then the other ones will be taken care of by default.

1301
02:13:43,120 --> 02:13:46,240
But anyway, when you do a sympathetic calculation, you have to pick an objective.

1302
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:50,830
You're and you're going to pick a relevant efficacy measure, which is going to be virus titer.

1303
02:13:51,370 --> 02:14:00,969
And so really our experiment is designed to determine if the null or the alternate hypotheses are true about virus titer, right?

1304
02:14:00,970 --> 02:14:06,490
So kind of general scientific design a null hypothesis would be that would if the virus titer in our

1305
02:14:06,490 --> 02:14:12,760
vaccinated animals is not significantly different right from the unvaccinated challenged animals.

1306
02:14:13,240 --> 02:14:16,720
So these populations are the same with respect to virus titer and no difference.

1307
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:20,739
That's null hypothesis. And the alternative is that it is significantly different.

1308
02:14:20,740 --> 02:14:24,550
These populations are different. So that's what we're trying to assess with our entire experiment.

1309
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:31,300
And we want to make sure that the sample size calculation is related to the power of a study.

1310
02:14:31,570 --> 02:14:39,460
And when you talk about the power of study, essentially means the likelihood that a particular effect level will be detected.

1311
02:14:40,210 --> 02:14:52,060
Okay. So if I decide that a reduction in virus titer of I'm going to say 40%, because that's what I think the study was designed for, let's say.

1312
02:14:52,060 --> 02:14:54,670
I think that a reduction in virus titer of 40.

1313
02:14:55,050 --> 02:15:01,290
It is biologically important enough that that's going to be my breakpoint, my goal to call this effective, right?

1314
02:15:01,770 --> 02:15:06,870
I want to make sure that I have enough animals that given the natural spread of virus titer,

1315
02:15:06,870 --> 02:15:17,070
like in the uninfected vaccinated animals and given the likely variation in, in efficacy of my vaccine, that I can detect a difference of 40%.

1316
02:15:17,310 --> 02:15:21,840
So I'm specifying a priori the degree of difference I want to detect.

1317
02:15:21,900 --> 02:15:29,520
So we'll see how that works. So power, power. The study refers to the likelihood that a specified effect level will be detected.

1318
02:15:30,870 --> 02:15:35,790
All right. So we've to back up a little bit to some stats to understand how this all comes together.

1319
02:15:35,820 --> 02:15:39,810
So this you've all seen before. This is the shape of a normal distribution curve.

1320
02:15:40,860 --> 02:15:43,070
And we don't need to get into two minute nitty gritty here.

1321
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:52,410
But basically, 95% of the values, as you know, in a normal distribution curve are going to be within two standard deviations of the mean.

1322
02:15:52,530 --> 02:15:57,810
So the bulk of the results in any normal distribution are going to be in this little portion of the curve.

1323
02:15:58,350 --> 02:16:04,319
Okay. But our population so this is virus titer, you know, maybe this is our mean virus titer,

1324
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:08,460
but we're going to have some distribution even in the unvaccinated animals on either side.

1325
02:16:09,870 --> 02:16:15,300
So our steps are first, we need to identify a biologically meaningful effect size.

1326
02:16:16,380 --> 02:16:21,840
So that would be like our, our typical virus titer, say, in our control population.

1327
02:16:22,590 --> 02:16:30,780
And we want to make sure that the spread of that parameter and the shift from it that we see in our vaccinated population,

1328
02:16:32,220 --> 02:16:39,900
95 of our control population, is going to have a response that's within that's less than our desired effects level.

1329
02:16:40,320 --> 02:16:45,900
So if we pick an effect level of D, so this is the shift from the mean.

1330
02:16:46,380 --> 02:16:55,050
So I'm trying to detect a hyper hypothetical different population that shifts the mean to a distance of d from the controls.

1331
02:16:55,230 --> 02:17:00,810
All right, that's my effect size D if I'm looking at a two tailed effect, so depending on what I'm measuring,

1332
02:17:01,560 --> 02:17:08,100
I might want to see a difference from the control in either direction, or I might want to see adjust in one direction depending on my study.

1333
02:17:08,760 --> 02:17:11,970
And basically the responses I'm trying to detect.

1334
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:17,190
Right, are going to be the values that are that are at least that far distance away from the mean.

1335
02:17:17,750 --> 02:17:20,910
Okay. So I'm interested in populations that are out here in this pink zone.

1336
02:17:21,990 --> 02:17:29,100
That's a two tailed effect. So the meaningful effect size D is the degree of difference from the control that we're trying to detect.

1337
02:17:29,730 --> 02:17:33,150
And that's the hand-waving part that people get nervous about, because you have to decide that.

1338
02:17:33,150 --> 02:17:39,990
You have to pick that you decide on a meaningful effect size using your knowledge of the typical response range in the control populations.

1339
02:17:40,650 --> 02:17:48,240
Right. So if I had a typical if usually the controls are very uniform and if I really thin distribution curve, I can detect more subtle differences.

1340
02:17:48,690 --> 02:17:50,399
But if there's a lot of innate variability,

1341
02:17:50,400 --> 02:17:55,080
I can only detect bigger differences because they're only the only biologically meaningful ones are bigger.

1342
02:17:55,440 --> 02:17:59,070
So it depends on our biologic knowledge of the system and the typical response rate.

1343
02:17:59,770 --> 02:18:08,700
Okay, so that's a two tailed effect. Or there might be instances where I only really care about shifting the control in one direction.

1344
02:18:09,690 --> 02:18:14,670
And our vaccine study might be a good example of this. If I'm looking only at efficacy.

1345
02:18:14,910 --> 02:18:24,540
Right. Because like, if they have the same or they have more virus than that than the challenge, who cares if my vaccine didn't work?

1346
02:18:24,750 --> 02:18:31,610
Because all I want to know is, does it work or not? So if I'm looking solely at efficiency, I might be able to do a one tailed effect for virus titer.

1347
02:18:31,980 --> 02:18:36,150
And in that case, I'm looking only at a reduction in virus titer.

1348
02:18:36,930 --> 02:18:43,020
Okay, so I've got to decide ahead of time what's important to me. So once I do that,

1349
02:18:43,050 --> 02:18:52,140
notice that even though most of my control population is sort of within like kind of less effect of that level d some tiny population of my controls,

1350
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:57,390
there might be some outliers there. So in my control population, depending on how many animals I look at,

1351
02:18:57,390 --> 02:19:05,430
there's some smidgen of a chance that by chance I'm going to have control animals that end up with values within my meaningful effect level.

1352
02:19:06,090 --> 02:19:11,970
Okay. So Alpha is referring to the proportion of the control population that by chance

1353
02:19:12,540 --> 02:19:17,400
may have a response that's outside or selected meaningful difference threshold.

1354
02:19:18,120 --> 02:19:22,290
Okay. We want that to be small. Right. We don't want we don't want a lot of overlap.

1355
02:19:22,290 --> 02:19:27,420
It's meaningless. So in most cases by convention, this is specified as 5%.

1356
02:19:29,130 --> 02:19:33,090
If I'm looking at a one tailed test, all I care about is,

1357
02:19:33,090 --> 02:19:38,460
is it less that if in the direction I have done here, all I care about is, is it less than this difference?

1358
02:19:38,490 --> 02:19:47,100
So all of my 5% can be on the side if I'm looking at a two tailed test, that 5% is split 2.5 on each side.

1359
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:54,180
Okay. So it's basically the likelihood that some control that a control result will end up outside that.

1360
02:19:55,310 --> 02:20:04,490
Meanwhile, the principal or confidence interval, which is the likelihood that a particular result is not representative of the control population,

1361
02:20:04,730 --> 02:20:11,270
is that one like this whole population, minus that migrant percentage, one -5%.

1362
02:20:11,780 --> 02:20:19,160
So we're 95% confident that values outside this meaningful difference level will not appear by chance and control.

1363
02:20:19,940 --> 02:20:23,270
Okay, so that's great.

1364
02:20:23,450 --> 02:20:26,450
How does this relate to power and sample size?

1365
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:34,910
So by design, we're only going to be able to detect the proportion of a hypothetical test population.

1366
02:20:35,330 --> 02:20:37,520
So this is my hypothetical vaccine population.

1367
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:46,520
Say I'm blue, you're only able to detect the proportion of a hypothetical test population that has at least the specified meaningful effect size D.

1368
02:20:47,330 --> 02:20:53,510
Okay. And so it's possible that there might be some overlap and some of our vaccinated animals.

1369
02:20:53,540 --> 02:20:57,680
Like if I were to look at enough animals that might be outside that level, but there's some overlap.

1370
02:20:58,430 --> 02:21:04,489
So just like with our controls, there's some little proportion that might have some overlap with our controls.

1371
02:21:04,490 --> 02:21:11,720
So we're going to call that beta. So that's the proportion of a test population that does not show the specified effect size.

1372
02:21:12,410 --> 02:21:16,910
Then the blue, right blue is one minus beta.

1373
02:21:17,690 --> 02:21:21,560
One minus beta represents the proportion that we are able to detect.

1374
02:21:22,500 --> 02:21:28,400
Okay. So we want that to be kind of high. So one minus beta is the power of our test,

1375
02:21:28,670 --> 02:21:36,110
the likelihood that we can detect that the power of our test to detect the population that shows the specified meaningful effect size.

1376
02:21:36,680 --> 02:21:41,090
And by convention, we usually require that to be at least 80%.

1377
02:21:41,810 --> 02:21:46,010
Okay. So what can affect this power?

1378
02:21:46,310 --> 02:21:54,530
So I already told you if we have a really tight variation around the mean for the controls, we can detect more subtle differences.

1379
02:21:54,860 --> 02:21:56,540
And there's two ways that that can happen.

1380
02:21:57,740 --> 02:22:06,140
Variance can affect power, and variance is a function you can consider variance both in terms of standard error and standard deviation.

1381
02:22:06,770 --> 02:22:14,540
Okay. Standard error is related to how certain we are to our of our estimate of the mean.

1382
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:24,350
So that's kind of a measurement based phenomenon. And it has to do with how well really we've sampled our control population.

1383
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:30,850
So we're running an experiment. We're not sampling all rats in the entire universe because that's seemingly impossible.

1384
02:22:30,860 --> 02:22:36,020
But we're assuming that our representative sample represents, you know, is universally applicable to all rats.

1385
02:22:36,030 --> 02:22:44,990
So it's always a sample of a true population. And we're making an estimate based on our sample size of what a that a virus infected rat.

1386
02:22:45,230 --> 02:22:47,630
Mean antibody titer would be. Right.

1387
02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:53,420
But depending on how many rats, like if there's however many millions of rats in the world and we're picking five of them,

1388
02:22:54,200 --> 02:23:01,040
you know, there might not be some uncertainty in our estimate. So standard and there also might be some uncertainty in our method.

1389
02:23:01,130 --> 02:23:05,450
Right? Our method of measuring the platform units or whatever are mean.

1390
02:23:05,840 --> 02:23:12,200
So there can be there's always a certain amount of uncertainty around that means that standard error and that is proportional,

1391
02:23:12,200 --> 02:23:17,170
inversely proportional to the number of animals that we are examining.

1392
02:23:17,180 --> 02:23:21,080
So if we have a high number of animals, if we could examine all the rest of the entire world,

1393
02:23:21,320 --> 02:23:24,500
we would know what the mean value is for virus titer pretty effectively.

1394
02:23:24,890 --> 02:23:30,170
So we would have a very small standard error if it's inversely proportional to any standard

1395
02:23:30,170 --> 02:23:35,840
deviation though is sort of the inherent variability in that parameter in virus titer.

1396
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:40,370
Or if I'm measuring like liver enzymes in normal in our millionth rats of the world,

1397
02:23:40,370 --> 02:23:50,650
there's some inherent variability in like liver enzymes or you know, in our virus example, it's just how much virus really is there with infection.

1398
02:23:50,660 --> 02:23:53,780
So it's an inherent variability and it's not dependent on.

1399
02:23:53,780 --> 02:23:56,690
N Okay, it's kind of inherent to the variable.

1400
02:23:57,440 --> 02:24:03,650
So if there is a lot of variability, you're not going to be able to make a subtle distinction and you have to strategies.

1401
02:24:04,310 --> 02:24:05,700
There are two ways to increase power.

1402
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:15,890
You can increase MN for sample size if the greater contributor variance is standard error or you look at pain over there,

1403
02:24:16,760 --> 02:24:24,829
this actually should say yeah or increase D because like if there's a lot of variance inherent variability in the control,

1404
02:24:24,830 --> 02:24:31,909
if some animals that can infected have very low virus titer and others have a very high so have a very broad peak to

1405
02:24:31,910 --> 02:24:37,790
really say that my vaccine is making the difference I'm going to have because of the inherent biologic variability.

1406
02:24:38,030 --> 02:24:41,870
I'm going to have to only say if there is a big shift in control.

1407
02:24:41,870 --> 02:24:45,310
Is that meaningful? So I have to pick an effect size that's bigger.

1408
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:52,220
Okay, so very variable biologic parameters require you can only detect bigger differences.

1409
02:24:53,060 --> 02:24:57,100
And I guess that's what I thought there. So if there's high uncertainty to me, you can increase.

1410
02:24:57,100 --> 02:25:04,240
And if there's a high uncertainty around the mean and you can't increase sample number like I blew my budget so I can't do it,

1411
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:08,510
you will only be able to detect populations that are very different.

1412
02:25:08,560 --> 02:25:12,400
I can still run my study, but I'm only going to be able to detect broad strokes population.

1413
02:25:12,400 --> 02:25:15,790
So the study is underpowered to detect subtle differences.

1414
02:25:16,420 --> 02:25:17,380
So how does that look?

1415
02:25:18,860 --> 02:25:25,810
Okay, so this is a standard error, a measure, as I said, of uncertainty in our estimate of the mean it's inversely proportional to N.

1416
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:31,510
So if standard error is high, I can increase power by increasing n.

1417
02:25:32,260 --> 02:25:36,640
So pretending that there is, I don't know, 5000 rats in the world and I measure 100 of them.

1418
02:25:36,970 --> 02:25:43,150
I get some sort of broad estimate of my mean, but if I measure more, I can get a more tight estimate of the true mean.

1419
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:52,960
Okay. So if standard error is high increasing and will decrease the variance and improve our power by improving our estimate of the mean.

1420
02:25:53,560 --> 02:26:01,240
So here this is kind of flipped from the example that I use there using a one tailed test to the right, but h not as the control population.

1421
02:26:01,480 --> 02:26:08,140
And this is the the mean. I don't know why they use it at a one, but I guess they extrapolated out the error.

1422
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:16,180
But this is a controlled population and then the the test population because of that standard error, the power,

1423
02:26:16,180 --> 02:26:23,200
the stuff that's that lies outside their specified difference level, which is the dotted line is like 0.26 because look how much variation.

1424
02:26:24,010 --> 02:26:27,130
So if you increase number, the mean is the same.

1425
02:26:27,790 --> 02:26:31,599
So that was the true mean, but they're just more certain in their measurement of it.

1426
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:36,550
So that increased the power a little bit. If you increase power, the more you really tighten up that error.

1427
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:40,000
And so you have higher power to detect that degree of difference.

1428
02:26:40,300 --> 02:26:46,660
So the increasing end is one way, but if the standard deviation is the problem increasing,

1429
02:26:46,670 --> 02:26:50,920
that is not going to make a difference at all because it's always going to have a pretty broad peak.

1430
02:26:50,950 --> 02:26:57,160
So standard deviation is high. You can increase power of your test by increasing the meaningful effect size.

1431
02:26:57,820 --> 02:27:01,660
So here's my control mean. Here's the specified level of difference that I want.

1432
02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:05,920
So let's say that's one standard deviation or whatever one D is measuring here.

1433
02:27:06,310 --> 02:27:14,170
So this is there's still a lot of overlap. So the response parameter has a pretty wide standard deviation and the test population is too much overlap.

1434
02:27:14,440 --> 02:27:17,710
My power to detect small differences is low.

1435
02:27:18,340 --> 02:27:22,660
So I'm like, okay, fine. Well, I'm just going to look for a hypothetical population with a bigger difference.

1436
02:27:23,170 --> 02:27:32,440
So now by this is supposed to be 1.5, now my population is shifted more to the right and I have a greater percent that I can detect.

1437
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:35,680
And if I want to detect even bigger differences, more are going to be shifted out.

1438
02:27:36,220 --> 02:27:40,240
So if standard deviation is higher, you're limited to looking at only big differences.

1439
02:27:40,600 --> 02:27:46,060
And that makes sense because if the standard deviation is high, only big differences are going to be biologically meaningful.

1440
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:49,660
Okay, so this is the basic equation.

1441
02:27:50,260 --> 02:27:54,010
Remember, I describe it now, we're not going to do that. You don't need to know this.

1442
02:27:55,870 --> 02:28:00,160
So the this is the basic equation for sample size for a one tailed test.

1443
02:28:01,570 --> 02:28:07,240
So it's dependent on a couple of things. It's dependent on inherent variability that's sigma.

1444
02:28:07,780 --> 02:28:12,610
So you have to know the standard deviation, which is the inherent variability of your parameter.

1445
02:28:12,700 --> 02:28:19,480
And so you get that from previous experiments or from literature. So hopefully you have some idea what the normal virus titer variability is.

1446
02:28:20,170 --> 02:28:25,780
You have an effect size that you specify. What do you think is going to be biologically meaningful?

1447
02:28:26,170 --> 02:28:30,729
Like, do I only consider my vaccine effective if I have a 100% reduction?

1448
02:28:30,730 --> 02:28:37,240
Like if I reduce it to no, it's probably not realistic. Do I think 50% will make enough difference that the animals will get sick?

1449
02:28:37,510 --> 02:28:45,940
So to pick a level and then I can specify my confidence levels alpha which is the confidence that the values for the control population are excluded.

1450
02:28:46,390 --> 02:28:53,709
So usually, like I said that by convention it's 5% and power like how how confident do I want to be

1451
02:28:53,710 --> 02:28:58,270
that my control population is going to be outside this difference of by convention?

1452
02:28:58,270 --> 02:29:02,500
That's usually 80%. So those are the four things you need to know.

1453
02:29:03,250 --> 02:29:07,959
This expression over here is just a constant that defines the limits of the normal curve.

1454
02:29:07,960 --> 02:29:15,550
So that's based on alpha and beta that you've specified. But all of that, I mean, if you're a statistic, who's the statistics, major?

1455
02:29:15,550 --> 02:29:23,080
It's Tiffany. So maybe Tiffany has to this sorry. Tiffany, but for the rest of us, most of that is usually inside.

1456
02:29:23,080 --> 02:29:26,220
Or what's my sign on that, huh?

1457
02:29:27,310 --> 02:29:31,780
I guess it's here for most statistical programs, this equation is embedded in the program,

1458
02:29:31,780 --> 02:29:40,240
so all you need to do is provide those for factors like the variable, the standard deviation, the effect size, and which alpha and beta you want.

1459
02:29:40,570 --> 02:29:42,610
And that's going to give you you know,

1460
02:29:42,610 --> 02:29:49,630
it's going to compute the equation that's going to give you what sample number you need for the specified level of certainty,

1461
02:29:50,080 --> 02:29:54,250
given the constraints of the inherent variability and the effect size.

1462
02:29:54,870 --> 02:29:58,980
Okay, so you usually get a result. So this was the calculation for this study.

1463
02:30:00,060 --> 02:30:08,670
We specified that we wanted to have at least 80% power to end the biologically meaningful difference that to call our vaccine a success.

1464
02:30:08,670 --> 02:30:13,230
We decided that we wanted to detect at least a 40% reduction in viral titer,

1465
02:30:13,890 --> 02:30:19,440
probably based on early infection studies that shows that the disease severity drops off at that level.

1466
02:30:20,040 --> 02:30:30,270
So five animals per group was calculated to have greater than 90% power, actually to detect a 40% reduction in viral titer at a 95% confidence level.

1467
02:30:30,780 --> 02:30:36,510
Okay. So when you're doing this, I'm not going to do this for the sake of time, but there's a nice little site that has free sample calculators.

1468
02:30:36,810 --> 02:30:40,080
And you can specify, I want to do one tailed test or two tailed test,

1469
02:30:40,410 --> 02:30:48,420
and they're going to ask you to specify all these parameters and you can see what changes the parameters does to the power, basically.

1470
02:30:48,420 --> 02:30:54,650
So this is an explanation of what sample size means at the end of this call.

1471
02:30:54,660 --> 02:30:59,309
So here I've just given you the sample size at the end of this class that's going to take all points.

1472
02:30:59,310 --> 02:31:06,000
I want you to understand is if you were to have a graph like this, I would want to understand what each symbol and area represents.

1473
02:31:06,480 --> 02:31:10,030
So like, what's one minus beta? We know that's power. What does that mean? What's alpha?

1474
02:31:10,030 --> 02:31:15,780
What's made all that stuff understand the variables you need to specify in order to calculate a sample size.

1475
02:31:15,780 --> 02:31:22,290
So those are the four things I just told. You understand the impact of standard error and standard deviation on power.

1476
02:31:22,590 --> 02:31:26,520
And what two things can you do right to increase power and experiment?

1477
02:31:26,520 --> 02:31:34,770
You can change and you could change different level so that hopefully you can kind of put some kind of context around what these numbers mean.

1478
02:31:35,550 --> 02:31:39,330
Okay. All right. Does anyone have any questions on that?

1479
02:31:41,010 --> 02:31:50,880
Yeah. So just to briefly review like all the terminology, so the power being like one minus beta or false negative, right?

1480
02:31:51,120 --> 02:31:56,340
Yeah. So that basically is like your true negatives are true positive.

1481
02:31:56,790 --> 02:32:01,169
Yes. And then then one night is outweigh the negatives the one minus.

1482
02:32:01,170 --> 02:32:06,330
Oh yes. Well yes.

1483
02:32:06,450 --> 02:32:16,260
Because one minus alpha is the proportion of the control population that truly has no, no, no deviation from that beta.

1484
02:32:16,410 --> 02:32:18,860
And an alpha would be like the false positive rate.

1485
02:32:19,140 --> 02:32:26,910
Well I'm trying to think about if understand it that way because like in this context alpha, these animals in alpha.

1486
02:32:26,910 --> 02:32:32,160
True. I think that's a little bit different because these animals in alpha truly do have a difference

1487
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:36,750
from the mean because they're there is a true positive when it comes to our virus titer.

1488
02:32:37,380 --> 02:32:40,920
So I think of true trying to think how I can figure this.

1489
02:32:40,920 --> 02:32:45,240
I think of true positive, true negative in terms of the sensitivity and specificity of my test.

1490
02:32:45,400 --> 02:32:51,450
Okay. So like the only thing I'm testing here is like is the high titer higher or lower than this?

1491
02:32:51,780 --> 02:32:56,190
The alpha is actually lower, so that is still a true positive.

1492
02:32:56,790 --> 02:33:03,329
Um, what was the other question was about true negatives. Yeah, everything above the site is a true negative.

1493
02:33:03,330 --> 02:33:07,469
So it actually includes this part, everything below the side of the true positive.

1494
02:33:07,470 --> 02:33:14,940
But that's more relevant to the sensitivity well to the efficacy of the test.

1495
02:33:15,750 --> 02:33:20,340
So I don't really think of those terms in the context of this power calculation.

1496
02:33:20,340 --> 02:33:27,630
This is more relevant, I guess, to the epidemiology of the biologic response.

1497
02:33:28,110 --> 02:33:34,920
It sounds very confusing even to me, but like it's just trying to given a known biologic variability,

1498
02:33:37,290 --> 02:33:44,040
how much of the population do I need to sample to reflect what the true mean is in this case?

1499
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:48,959
And how much of my test population do I need to sample to establish epidemic?

1500
02:33:48,960 --> 02:33:52,590
Kind of epidemiologically, whether these two populations are truly different,

1501
02:33:52,980 --> 02:34:02,010
I think that's subtly different from truth from false positive false negative, which we get back to as terms when we do data analysis later.

1502
02:34:02,780 --> 02:34:08,880
But that's probably the best explanation I can think of now. Did you ever question.

1503
02:34:09,420 --> 02:34:10,800
Yeah, right.

1504
02:34:12,180 --> 02:34:19,950
So just to kind of make sure that I understand what all of these numbers are so greater than 90% is the one that is made out of the pollen.

1505
02:34:20,190 --> 02:34:24,090
Yes. And then the 40% is the date. Yes.

1506
02:34:24,300 --> 02:34:30,360
That's we want we to specify the difference. We want it's 40% from the challenge, no vaccine group.

1507
02:34:31,170 --> 02:34:37,080
And then the 95% is one myself. Yes. Okay. Yeah, yes.

1508
02:34:37,260 --> 02:34:40,440
And it's good. Yeah, good.

1509
02:34:41,820 --> 02:34:48,660
All right. Anyone else? All right, thanks. I know that was, like, kind of a heavy one to put at the end of a long afternoon, but nice job.

1510
02:34:48,990 --> 02:34:53,399
All right. Thank you. Thank you. Zoomers out there. I hope you're all still conscious and everything.

1511
02:34:53,400 --> 02:35:01,540
And I hope everybody. Feels better or, he said. The cure is the name of the game here.

1512
02:35:01,900 --> 02:35:06,380
So it is like a therapy to me.

1513
02:35:07,870 --> 02:35:16,890
That's great. This is yet another one that includes access to their biases.

1514
02:35:18,250 --> 02:35:23,950
And if you're not there, if you've taken steps to be guided by a.

1515
02:35:26,480 --> 02:35:30,240
Arizona. Bye. Yeah, I always thought.

1516
02:35:30,300 --> 02:35:47,090
Thought I were gonna stay stuff. I think I can do better in general in San Francisco, since it is for public health major.

1517
02:35:48,050 --> 02:35:51,410
Oh, yeah. Yeah. The terminology gets better.

1518
02:35:52,190 --> 02:35:56,010
Everybody, this. Yeah. I mean, I understand.

1519
02:35:56,150 --> 02:36:01,979
It was like. It was like a five out. If I want to increase, it has to be absolutely sure.

1520
02:36:01,980 --> 02:36:08,240
But I had thought there was no way that you could increase your powers by greater overlap.

1521
02:36:08,240 --> 02:36:11,250
But Alpha is going to be really in the top 1%.

1522
02:36:11,270 --> 02:36:21,350
How many things in polls those restrictions like if you say I want to make something normal, something that I guess I want better or goals like a lot,

1523
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:30,020
like I guess I aspire instead of like you can't have differences like more so I need to find the ah no

1524
02:36:30,020 --> 02:36:35,540
that's honestly I don't want to live near here and I don't want to do this for a little while anymore.

1525
02:36:35,540 --> 02:36:43,370
I don't want to go to and I don't like the direction like that. Yeah, I did not do that if I can't do it.

1526
02:36:43,390 --> 02:36:48,230
Okay. And I was like, I can't remember. She gave it star power and I had.

1527
02:36:51,450 --> 02:36:55,770
But like all the test populations, you can detect a hypothetical.

1528
02:36:56,040 --> 02:37:00,989
So this is my problem. If there's one hypothetical, have nothing to fear.

1529
02:37:00,990 --> 02:37:04,490
Even then, there's one that's here, like, oh, I didn't know this.

1530
02:37:04,520 --> 02:37:14,159
Right? So, like, I don't know, like if I only went out know the population has a potential other unless we going

1531
02:37:14,160 --> 02:37:18,770
to definitely anything less than 5% in terms of the overlap and greater than that.

1532
02:37:19,290 --> 02:37:28,649
But that's going to be kind of a biologically meaningless distinction if I restrict like at the third of my interest data,

1533
02:37:28,650 --> 02:37:36,930
like in a statistical program, usually I say I want power to be at least 80% and I want Apple to be no greater than 5%.

1534
02:37:37,500 --> 02:37:46,040
And by doing that, that's in that part of the equation on the right hand side, that automatically restricts, well, I'm sorry,

1535
02:37:46,290 --> 02:37:51,839
how big of a difference that can detect because then I'm I'm basically specifying

1536
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:55,630
that I'm not going to be able to detect populations that are closer to me.

1537
02:37:56,440 --> 02:38:02,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think that if that size and think they need to Yeah.

1538
02:38:02,490 --> 02:38:07,680
Need to be a balance. Oh yeah. It's just for everything ideally.

1539
02:38:08,010 --> 02:38:16,139
Yeah. So effect size is really the one that you can play with the most because like by statistical definition,

1540
02:38:16,140 --> 02:38:20,820
it's like you can't say, okay, well I'm just going to be an alpha 20%.

1541
02:38:20,820 --> 02:38:22,860
That would be stupid. But yeah, that would be me.

1542
02:38:23,090 --> 02:38:31,920
So like when you're a designer experiment, you don't have very much freedom really to play with, with alpha and beta.

1543
02:38:32,040 --> 02:38:35,909
Like those are kind of there's a limit for harboring.

1544
02:38:35,910 --> 02:38:41,219
So but effect size you can play with a lot like I can decide that I'm only going

1545
02:38:41,220 --> 02:38:47,470
to detect maybe maybe population maybe by a vaccine that moves the virus.

1546
02:38:47,470 --> 02:38:51,060
Tiger By 50% by 80%. Production effect size.

1547
02:38:51,060 --> 02:39:00,150
I can play with a lot. I just have to decide, you know, given my constraints, maybe I can only see big differences, right?

1548
02:39:00,390 --> 02:39:05,100
And like if there's always some standard error. So like if I have a lot of animals,

1549
02:39:05,100 --> 02:39:09,950
I'm going to be able to see a lot more subtle differences just because I'm going to tighten that variance around me.

1550
02:39:10,590 --> 02:39:14,370
But like, there's a limit to how many animals you can use in a study, right?

1551
02:39:14,430 --> 02:39:20,880
Because you can't use all the animals in the world. And there's often a financial limit in real terms and I logistical is that.

1552
02:39:21,150 --> 02:39:31,840
Yeah. So like if, like if I can't change up like right now I can't change beta and I can't change and just cause I need to modify the mechanism.

1553
02:39:31,950 --> 02:39:35,279
Yeah, but I always solution is like, okay fine. It's a part of study.

1554
02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:39,239
I'm only going to look at big different differences. Yeah. So yeah, that's perfect.

1555
02:39:39,240 --> 02:39:43,440
That's actually a great way of thinking about it because that really helps you understand what the trade offs are.

1556
02:39:44,100 --> 02:40:19,270
Thank you. Have a great weekend with you. Thank you.

1557
02:40:45,850 --> 02:40:50,810
I want her to hold this. Right.

1558
02:40:58,300 --> 02:42:15,960
The. Yeah.
