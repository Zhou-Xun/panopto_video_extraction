1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,630
Hey, this is Matt Zawistowski.

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,140
In our previous videos,

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,930
we've introduced
longitudinal studies and

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,185
the concept of correlated
repeated measures data.

5
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:22,900
We've learned how to make
good summaries of the data

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,155
using longitudinal techniques
and descriptive statistics.

7
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:28,690
We've also discussed why some of

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,090
the existing statistical
methods you're already familiar

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,875
with just don't work well
with correlated data.

10
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,875
We're now ready to introduce

11
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,810
the linear mixed effect model,

12
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,930
a common tool for analyzing
repeated measures data.

13
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,715
Over the next two videos,

14
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:45,835
we'll introduce the simplest
version of the next model,

15
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:48,160
the random intercept model.

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,140
Let's start by recalling

17
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,585
the notation for
repeated measures data.

18
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,780
We defined YIJ to be

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,670
the Jth observed outcome
for the Ith subject.

20
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,995
This notation provided
a good method

21
00:00:59,995 --> 00:01:01,210
for handling a range of

22
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,125
repeated measures data,
including unbalanced designs.

23
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,210
We've already discussed why

24
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,130
standard linear
regression models are

25
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,105
not applicable to repeated
measure longitudinal data.

26
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:15,250
The residuals for measurements

27
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,215
on the same subject
are correlated,

28
00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:20,545
therefore violating the
independence assumption.

29
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:23,050
What is a model that
more accurately

30
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,760
describes the structure of
repeated measures data?

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,615
We previously discussed allowing

32
00:01:27,615 --> 00:01:30,570
each subject to have their
own distinct regression line.

33
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,660
One that differs from
the regression line,

34
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,910
defining the overall
relationship between

35
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,895
outcome and time averaged
across the population,

36
00:01:37,895 --> 00:01:39,715
shown here in red.

37
00:01:39,715 --> 00:01:43,055
We can imagine a model
in which each subject

38
00:01:43,055 --> 00:01:46,010
has their own subject-specific
regression line,

39
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,890
and that all subject-specific
lines are parallel

40
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,785
to each other and to the
population regression line.

41
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:54,800
That is the subject-specific
regression lines have

42
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,745
a common slope but differ
with respect to intercepts.

43
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:01,670
Let's think about how we
would build such a model,

44
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,835
starting with the simple
linear regression equation.

45
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:07,340
Let Beta zero and Beta one define

46
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,690
the intercepted slope of

47
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,055
the red population
regression line as usual.

48
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:15,185
We can add a single term
to the model that gives

49
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:17,965
each subject a distinct
intercept value.

50
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:20,300
This term is called
a random intercept.

51
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,570
It is indexed by I to indicate
that it differs between

52
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,340
subjects and it lasts between

53
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,130
subjects variation in intercepts.

54
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,670
This new model is a linear
mixed effect model,

55
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,919
specifically a random intercept

56
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,750
linear mixed effect model.

57
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,610
Let's take a look
at the individual

58
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,445
components of the model.

59
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:42,710
The two Beta terms are
called fixed effects.

60
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,050
They're population-level
parameters that

61
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,150
define the population
regression line.

62
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,850
In the figure, Beta
zero and Beta one,

63
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,185
give the form of the red
population regression line.

64
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:57,095
Our new B_0I term is
a random effect term,

65
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:59,285
specifically a random intercept.

66
00:02:59,285 --> 00:03:02,795
Each sample has its own
random intercept term,

67
00:03:02,795 --> 00:03:05,270
and it is this random
effect term that

68
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,135
captures the repeated
measures nature of the data.

69
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:10,970
By giving each sample
a distinct intercept,

70
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,560
the model is acknowledging that

71
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,195
measurements on the same subject

72
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:17,779
are more likely to be similar
or positively correlated.

73
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:20,720
We call this between
subjects variability.

74
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,835
For example, the B_01 term
in the picture is positive,

75
00:03:24,835 --> 00:03:25,940
and indicates that the

76
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,560
yellow measurements
corresponding to

77
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,390
the first sample tend to be

78
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,200
well above the population
regression line.

79
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,970
Alternatively, the
random intercept for

80
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,330
the third subject
B_03 is negative,

81
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,775
indicating that measurements
for this sample,

82
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:42,350
shown by blue dots tend to

83
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,440
reside below the population
regression line.

84
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,440
The final component of
the random intercept

85
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,285
mixed model is the random
error term Epsilon IJ.

86
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:56,140
The random errors captured
within subjects variability,

87
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,670
or the part of the observed
outcome that cannot

88
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,250
be explained by the
population regression line,

89
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,980
and the subject specific
random intercepts.

90
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,470
Pictorially, the random errors

91
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,705
shown here as black
arrowed lines,

92
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:11,435
are the distances between
each observed outcome

93
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:14,515
and the respective
subject-specific regression line.

94
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:18,335
Collectively, the random error
terms for a given sample

95
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:20,060
are randomly distributed about

96
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,970
the subject specific
regression line.

97
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,010
It is the mixture of

98
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,580
fixed and random effects that
gives this model its name,

99
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,385
the mixed effect
regression model.

100
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:34,505
Now that we've built the
random intercept model,

101
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:36,125
let's take a minute
to think about

102
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,825
the intuition behind
the terms in the model.

103
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:41,540
Suppose we have a
population for which we are

104
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,675
interested in studying a
specific outcome over time.

105
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:46,190
As with most studies,

106
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,390
suppose we are unable to

107
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,830
get measurements
from each person in

108
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,255
the entire population and
therefore take a sample.

109
00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:54,545
From the first subject sampled,

110
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:55,790
we get multiple measurements of

111
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,485
the outcome taken over time,

112
00:04:57,485 --> 00:05:00,760
and we can imagine a regression
line for this subject.

113
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,475
Now, for the next subjects
samples from the population,

114
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:07,070
we again take measurements
over time and imagine

115
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,390
fitting a regression line

116
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,595
specific to this subject's data.

117
00:05:10,595 --> 00:05:12,485
As we previously discussed,

118
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:14,540
the regression line for
this subject will be

119
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,840
slightly different than that
of the first subjects line.

120
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,750
Imagine if we could compute
the regression line

121
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,045
for all subjects
in the population,

122
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:25,775
and then average
across those lines.

123
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:28,595
What we get is the
population regression line,

124
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:32,850
which is indicated by Beta
zero plus Beta one times time.

125
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,670
We've considered two
subject-specific regression lines

126
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,750
that differ slightly from

127
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,805
the red population
regression line.

128
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:42,505
The difference from the
population regression line

129
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:44,950
is the random
intercept term B_0I.

130
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,990
Therefore, the equation for

131
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,300
the first subjects
regression line is Beta

132
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,160
zero plus B_01 plus
Beta one times time.

133
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,870
Each subject has

134
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,375
its own corresponding
random intercept term.

135
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,415
Again, we can write
the equation of

136
00:06:00,415 --> 00:06:02,860
each subject-specific line using

137
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,250
a mixture of the fixed
effect population parameters

138
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,205
and the subject-specific
random effect.

139
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:12,235
In reality, there
are many such lines,

140
00:06:12,235 --> 00:06:14,775
one from each subject
in the population,

141
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:17,540
each with its own random
effect term capturing

142
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,800
its respective distance from

143
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,575
the population regression line.

144
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:22,205
When considered as a whole,

145
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:23,945
the lines form a distribution,

146
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:25,250
and that distribution is

147
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,995
centered at the population
regression line.

148
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:30,920
Since the regression
lines are all parallel,

149
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,170
they differ only in
their intercepts.

150
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,840
We can summarize
the distribution of

151
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,810
subject-specific lines
by the distribution

152
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,730
of random intercept terms,

153
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,220
corresponding to the
subject lines being

154
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,490
centered at the population
regression line,

155
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,839
the distribution of
random intercepts

156
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,645
will be centered at zero.

157
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:51,260
It is customary to put

158
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,780
an assumption on the shape
of the distribution.

159
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,050
Typically, the random intercepts
are normally distributed

160
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,295
with a variance indicated
by Sigma B0 squared.

161
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,040
Given this framework,
we can consider

162
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,410
this subject-specific
regression line for

163
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,905
a randomly chosen individual
from the population.

164
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:13,790
The subject-specific regression
line for this sample

165
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,530
is a random line that differs

166
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,885
from the population
regression line.

167
00:07:17,885 --> 00:07:20,810
That difference is the
random intercept term,

168
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,100
which is essentially a draw

169
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,065
from a probability distribution.

170
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:26,480
It is this distribution
that describes

171
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,810
between subject differences
in the regression lines.

172
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,780
The actual observations
for this sample are

173
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,570
then realizations from the
subject specific line.

174
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,100
Of course, we do not expect

175
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,515
the observations will
fit exactly on the line,

176
00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:41,945
instead they'll be
scattered around the line.

177
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:44,960
That is, they'll have some
noise or random error to them.

178
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,910
This is precisely
what is captured in

179
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,060
the random error term Epsilon IJ.

180
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,040
I hope this video gives you

181
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,180
a good introduction to

182
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,430
the random intercept
mixed effect model.

183
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,620
Specifically, for the intuition

184
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,270
and notation for the model.

185
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,895
We'll continue our discussion
in the next video,

186
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:04,505
where we'll put our random
intercept model to use

187
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:08,683
for interpretation,
prediction, and inference.
