1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,360
My name is Joe. Okay. All right. Welcome back, everybody.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:10,109
So today it's going to mark sort of the start of what is sort of like somewhat

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,799
back and forth digestion carbohydrate unit for the next three or four classes,

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:21,030
we're going to go through and get started and then hydrates and then carbohydrate digestion and then the fiber and the microbiome.

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,530
So those are like the next 5 minutes after that, we'll get into some of the biochemistry of carbohydrates,

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,470
metabolism, which will be the next 5 minutes after that.

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,540
So like I said today, we're going to talk about digestion, absorption in really general terms.

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,160
So I had just been to probably a lot of vocabulary and maybe some concepts that are a little new to you.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,560
Don't worry, we have at least four different digestion lectures, so a lot of these things are going to come up over and over and over again.

10
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,600
So, for example, this indication of the stomach is going to come up like four times over the course of the semester.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,470
Each macronutrient has its own digestion units. Okay.

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,000
So that's our goal for today.

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:05,250
So, so to start, I just want to make a bit of a distinction here between digestion and absorption, because sometimes people get confused.

14
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,590
So digestion is the process by which we break down primarily macromolecules into the absorbable units.

15
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,670
So I'm going to use this framing along with your absorbable units, right?

16
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:21,809
So you may think that we, you know, we eat fat and therefore the unit is like triglyceride or something that's like not true, right?

17
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,370
So even though we might eat something in the example of glycogen and in mushrooms or something,

18
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,760
even though we might eat glycogen and we might stored as glycogen,

19
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,090
it actually goes through multiple steps to convert it from glycogen to glucose and then back to glycogen in metal.

20
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,130
And that's pretty important for understanding what's happening.

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,990
So when I talk about the Absorbable Unit, I'm talking about the thing that can get from our gut into our body.

22
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:49,210
So in the case of starch or glycogen, the absorbable unit is glucose, right?

23
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,159
So you have to break it down to those and then you can absorb the foods. For example, sucrose.

24
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,040
We cannot absorb sucrose, we can't absorb the lactose or we can for lactose, we can't absorb starch.

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,670
We tend to sort of all of those things through. We have to break them down into absorbable units.

26
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,350
So within the digestion is breaking things down into whatever the most appropriate level.

27
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,719
And that's going to vary of course to make our macronutrient that's distinct from absorption,

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,210
which is after you've gone through that process getting into the bottle.

29
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,210
So if you don't have digestion, you by definition cannot have absorption, right?

30
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,160
Unless you're starting with the absorbable unit like glucose for routine.

31
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,380
But we usually don't eat that directly, so the digestion takes precedence because that has not been fixed.

32
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,660
So if you have an enzymatic problem such that that casting doesn't occur, then you'll never have absorption anyway.

33
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,130
By the same token, if you don't have absorption, you can still have digestion, but it won't get into your body.

34
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,870
Right? You could break something down, but if you on the transporters of the mechanisms to get it into orbit,

35
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,890
something that we're not supposed to absorb, we'll start talking about those next class.

36
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,260
Then it doesn't matter what happens with the digestion because that makes sense, the distinction between those two things.

37
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,440
Okay. So we're going to start with the idea of the alimentary canal. So the elementary canal is the entire digestive system altogether.

38
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,860
So it's composed of main organs and accessory organs is going to sound a little bit gross.

39
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,560
But the best way I can think of to visualize the digestive tract is we are actually like hollow tubes.

40
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,330
So I have a tube starting in my mouth and ending at my Nina's and it's hollow. That's actually external.

41
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,630
Basic. Now, this is going to sound a little confusing because like, what are you talking about?

42
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,770
That's probably inside your body, correct? But it's external facing, right?

43
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:29,190
So when we say getting into our body, we mean getting from this in tube here, which is externalized into our body.

44
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:34,110
And the reason for that is that as we develop, we develop sort of like this from the blast ular stage, right?

45
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,400
So that actually one of the first two of the first organs that form are the anus in the mouth.

46
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,479
And we form in that sort of symmetrical system such that everything else here,

47
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,940
this whole O2 is maintained and now it just looks a little bit different because it's got all these wines and organs and stuff, right?

48
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,200
But that's the best way to sort of think about how we operate. So we're like conceptual cylinders, right?

49
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,200
And we're taking some from the inside into the marble cylinder.

50
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,950
And then there's a whole bunch of organs that have been developed throughout evolution to help this process happen at effective rates.

51
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:12,480
Okay. So sort of just like energy balance we're in actually for the first five, 10 minutes of class, we're going to just take a break and start.

52
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,180
And I want you guys to try to sketch out the digestive system with your own hand brace, because the idea is to try to draw on your own.

53
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,360
Again, you're not going to agree that there are 50 parts per here.

54
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,950
So try to draw as many of these organs and label them as you can.

55
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,780
I think all of these work function in a video or in a note system.

56
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:35,280
Feel free to captivate people, right? We'll spend several 10 minutes on.

57
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,430
You don't need to submit it yet because we're going to add on to your drawing. You're like 45 minutes from now.

58
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:49,110
Just something that we were anything like ready to talk for out here.

59
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:57,300
This piece, nice.

60
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:07,400
I feel like we've had enough.

61
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:16,850
I was thinking, actually, even though I started writing that I was drawing them,

62
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:32,800
but also yeah, but I was like, Oh, do this because it's just not what you.

63
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:50,460
Like, I don't think it's going to happen this year because the goal is to be like you to close up.

64
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:57,010
The goal is to be like I forget with the intention with the baby.

65
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:06,390
Baby. I catch all the assumptions.

66
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:14,640
Yeah. Oh, so many plans and promises.

67
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:26,460
And it's not enough, so it doesn't help.

68
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:36,030
I know what they do. I know where they are. Yes.

69
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,560
And you need to do something.

70
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,620
No, I think that's fine.

71
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,610
I think. Right. I just I have a smart business, so I look at it, right?

72
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:05,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's. I mean, that's.

73
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,020
That's been something that you're stuck in.

74
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:23,660
It's a small day. Yeah. Because I think small the large gap, which is, you know,

75
00:07:25,950 --> 00:08:00,810
it's not only a very small because I just I don't know how many girls I got those other things if I was especially I,

76
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:14,640
you know, I mean, I, I just I guess you could change for your parents to talk about.

77
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:22,550
You know, I think Hearts lyrics is quite easy to take, I think. I don't know.

78
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,230
Yeah, yeah. Right.

79
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:39,890
Because, well, I mean, if you're involved with your daughter and I think that label is good because the relative location of school.

80
00:08:40,250 --> 00:09:04,520
Yeah, this is something like yeah I have to write you, right.

81
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:24,320
Yes. Yes. We got to just think this little baby here is also slightly larger.

82
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:30,430
I think I think I like to think.

83
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:51,080
Yeah, I think we represent something else that makes it easier for me to like to take control of this,

84
00:09:51,900 --> 00:10:11,190
which is the remote control you see, I was doing earlier this year meeting some of the world offer here sometimes.

85
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:32,960
But you're solving some so much. Yeah, you know, there is a broad overview, but that's partly because you're drinking to some degree closely.

86
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:45,410
Okay, because I'm like, oh, look at this human.

87
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,860
We had something like this.

88
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,580
It this like, oh, goodness.

89
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,320
She's like, Oh, so this is why we're not hurt like this.

90
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,870
Do you think would you ever stop and think we're kind of like.

91
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,380
I think it's like a directly family. Yeah.

92
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:35,710
But also present as well and just the media or else.

93
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:52,890
And you're like, Oh, that's funny if you wanna go carefully, but it could be really important because you know,

94
00:11:53,870 --> 00:12:07,190
I know I'm assuming that I'm speaking between phone right now.

95
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,680
I, I use, I used to call the real world. Yeah.

96
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:24,680
That was really something that not straight up or something you would be the one in your stomach.

97
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:41,660
Alright. Well there's also other, the other one between the rest of it which I think about.

98
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:50,970
The reason I'm surprised is actually, I mean obviously.

99
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:56,600
There you go.

100
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,240
Okay. So again, you don't have to have this done to kind of get the full marks for this activity.

101
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,090
But just like we did with the energy balance concept map,

102
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,590
if there's something that you're like not sure about, like, I don't know, is this where the mouth goes?

103
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,180
Circle that with all the arrow to it so that either just move or I can kind of clarify if you're confused.

104
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,159
But if you just leave subway Vancouver presume you didn't he didn't like get to it so the

105
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,940
reason I think this is a useful place to start is the really two ways you can sort of connect,

106
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:29,720
contextualize the anatomy of the digestive system. One is that it's a like one way transport system starting at the Met, right?

107
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,970
And if you know the order, you should know everybody's food. Every time you eat a meal should pass these things in the same order.

108
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:38,360
Ready to go? Mouth fragments, upper esophageal sphincter liver.

109
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,559
Something you think your stomach center. Right. And so it should go in that direction, right?

110
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,969
That's not always the case. For example, if you have vomiting or GERD, things can go the other way.

111
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,840
But usually when things are going the other direction, it's a sign of a problem.

112
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:57,439
So you can think of the digestive system as sort of a linear pathway by which you go through all of these different aspects.

113
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,799
And again, since we're going to refer to the liver and the pancreas and the gallbladder and everything many, many, many times a semester,

114
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,780
you know, really helpful that you've got a sense in your head of like, whereabouts are we in terms of the system?

115
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:15,290
On the other way you can think about the anatomy of it is within each organ there's multiple layers, right?

116
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:21,860
So if you think of literally any part of the digestive system, it's going to have all of these four distinct layers.

117
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,190
Now these are going to vary depending on where you are. In some places.

118
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:29,720
You're going to have a lot of absorptive area, such as your small intestine and much less structure.

119
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:36,230
For example, in your esophagus you can have a lot more structure, but you don't really absorb any nutrients in your insides.

120
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,480
So you have much more of the outer, stronger structural layers, but less of the internal luminal.

121
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:50,120
But on the God, if you look at it and if you do the anatomy table, like in the actual assignment, you'll see this.

122
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,030
Every part of the digestive system has these for just the relative performance varies.

123
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,650
So there's four layers you process because of muscularity, external and subrosa.

124
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,310
So this is just another picture of all of those orbiters.

125
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,120
They have different roles and we're going to kind of go through these off and on a little bit over the next few slides.

126
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:19,760
So if we start with the internal internal layer, the composer mucosa is called that because it's gotten rid of Lucas.

127
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:27,349
It's on some but not all of your digestive system. You've got this protective mucus layer that protects the cells within that you cause a layer.

128
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,410
You have three somewheres in the epithelial cells.

129
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,720
Right? So those are the cells with the absorption actually occurs. You've got another layer on the middle called the lemon appropriate.

130
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,400
That's where most of the immune cells are. And then you've got a muscle layer inside.

131
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,630
Right. And that also layer allows for small contractions, but not really big contractions.

132
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,700
The big contractions, for example, when you feel your stomach contracting. That's the muscular externa.

133
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,700
Right. But it's these small contractions that can happen through the muscular out in close to the muscle in the mucus.

134
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,620
The length appropriate, like I said, is where most of the immune cells exist.

135
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:07,470
Right. And we're going to talk a lot about the interplay between the immune system and digestion throughout this course.

136
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,959
Many inflammatory diseases are associated with some sort of either hyper activation

137
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,000
or hypo activation of lemon appropriate immune cells of our gastrointestinal layer.

138
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:25,440
And so one of them that I'm sure many of you are familiar with, and probably by all odds some of you are afflicted with is called celiac.

139
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:32,310
So celiac is an autoimmune disease, and specifically it's an autoimmune reaction to a protein that is called gluten,

140
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:40,530
as we'll learn throughout the semester. Most immune reactions in terms of food intolerances, not all, but most are based on proteins.

141
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:45,840
And that's because proteins have unique shapes and those unique shapes can be detected by our immune system.

142
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:55,290
So in the case of celiac, our body detects the gluten, protein or particular fold in the gluten protein as not something that we should have.

143
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,560
And so it mounts an immune response to it to try to try to destroy it.

144
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:04,170
The gluten is a trigger. It's an environmental trigger and activate the t cell adaptive mediated response

145
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,620
and it causes a release of a particular hormone called interferon gamma.

146
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:13,230
That is just a symbol that's missing there and causes inflammation of the intestinal mucosa.

147
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:20,730
If that inflammation persists and you continue eating gluten, then eventually you'll start to destroy the building, which is the absorptive layer.

148
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,980
In this case, in the small intestine, if you destroy the belive that you're not going to have very good absorption.

149
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,940
It's reasonably heritable. And there are particular meals that we know are associated with with celiac.

150
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,989
Human leukocyte antigen a to you to indicate both or they increase the risk of disease.

151
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,710
But it's not entirely penetrant so it's not like if you had these, a woman will definitely get it.

152
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:50,100
It's more of an increase in odds. There is some role that we don't totally understand in terms of development and environment.

153
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,460
And so I'm going to switch from the peanuts, which is another very common allergy.

154
00:17:53,730 --> 00:18:01,320
About 20 years ago, we used to think that peanut allergies could be avoided by not giving children beans, and that was actually quite common.

155
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:06,390
Public health advice is not give people peanuts, and eventually they would never have any exposure to peanuts.

156
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,510
They never become allergic to peanuts. That turned out to be totally wrong.

157
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,100
Not exposing people to peanuts dramatically increases the odds of peanut allergies,

158
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,970
which is something we learned because part of the development and we'll talk about this throughout the semester

159
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:23,370
is being exposed to different foods and training your immune system and what is normal and what is admirable.

160
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,480
So, for example, the theory right now is that by never exposing anybody to a peanut allergy,

161
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,010
then eventually what would happen is that when you see a peanut engine for the first time,

162
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,330
you might now get immune response or you'd be more like a question, like the immature.

163
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,690
But so it really sparked a question for me.

164
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,590
How does that work?

165
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:46,140
Like, okay, like say a woman is pregnant, the baby was going to be allergic and that's what she's eating nuts like what is the allergy developed?

166
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,530
So the allergy develops usually after repeated exposure.

167
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:55,020
And generally it's about the allergy. Our food system, obviously, we have to detect invading organisms.

168
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,610
Right. And we have to be good at that.

169
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,740
And if you're too far on that side, you're going to detect all positives, things that are not invading organisms.

170
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,799
You're going to think that if you don't have that, you're from the other side.

171
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,610
Then when you get when you are afflicted with some sort of infection, you can't fight it off.

172
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:14,770
So you imagine everybody trying to find this central point of being responding to the bad things, but not too many of the bad things.

173
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:19,170
And it seems like a lot of allergies are just people tiptoeing a little more towards

174
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,020
immune responsiveness and a little bit farther away from surveillance like something.

175
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:33,360
What do you think about the argument that part of this happens because our environment is too academic, like I have family.

176
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,909
She's an educator in a farming community. She's like, we never see food allergies in these kids.

177
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,780
They're on the farm. Their animal dander follows pollen like they never.

178
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:49,090
There's no like no peanut butter in school. So that is one theory.

179
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,120
This fight over hygiene hypothesis is that, you know,

180
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,999
kids were rolling around the dirt more often back in the day and therefore not somebody who was born and raised on a farm,

181
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,139
but is like a really bad hay fever allergy and everyone like 100% of the answer.

182
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:09,430
But it could be right. I mean, the one thing is that certainly allergic responses seem to increase in prevalence.

183
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,000
Now, how much of that is diagnosis and how much of that is actual true allergy?

184
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:19,060
It seems like some of this might be diagnosis in terms of like restricting access to food and restricting sort of pathogenicity.

185
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:24,100
You know, there's been this very beneficial effect for the last hundred years were infectious diseases.

186
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,920
I know right now with COVID, it's not the best time to talk about this, but in general,

187
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:33,310
infectious diseases and that's what impacted me is the drought really precipitously over the last hundred years and that's because of sort of hygiene.

188
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,670
Right. And that kind of gets to a kind of the saying is we as a society are also

189
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:41,340
trying to find this balance between what is appropriate level of cleanliness, for instance, maybe what is not enough exposures.

190
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,980
One of the first things so it's been we are we were responding to inappropriate things.

191
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:52,100
So it could be part of hygiene or it could be part of also just exposure to foods that maybe you weren't exposed to due to global trends in food.

192
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,760
So like when people develop allergies like for not like being exposed for it for a long time,

193
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,260
like is it like how long do you have to not be exposed to something for your

194
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:06,790
body to not recognize the antigen like when you come into contact with it?

195
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,419
Is it dependent like on foods different? Yeah, I don't really know.

196
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,960
I'm obviously I'm not an allergist, so I'm I'm wasn't an allergist and I am a dietitian.

197
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,280
The I could just say and neither so I think it varies.

198
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,879
You know, anecdotally you hear stories of people developing allergies, you know, in their thirties and forties.

199
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,770
Right. And then also you hear of people about like I was going to cats when I was a kid, we we'd get rid of our cat.

200
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:32,379
But apparently now I'm a cat because when I got to people cancer and bother me. Right. So but I was like not exposed to catch for like 25 years.

201
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,950
But also, I don't know, I mean, a lot of the stuff that was 25 years so I don't know.

202
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,009
It's a lack of exposure. What. Yeah, it's a good question.

203
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,100
I don't I don't really know. Yeah.

204
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,870
All right. So. Okay.

205
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:55,889
So this is just an example. Obviously, if you have too much breakdown of your bill, I this would be an example of normal.

206
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,850
I know the damage bill in your small intestine that's going to reduce the absorptive capacity

207
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,839
pretty dramatically because the whole advantage of having these melee and the microvilli

208
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,319
in your customers to increase the surface area and you can diagnostically determine

209
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,830
whether or not somebody has got an autoimmune reaction by doing a biopsy of their bill,

210
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,170
either an endoscopy or a physical biopsy of their belly. And you can see what's happening.

211
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:21,680
We have not talked about that and I thought must have a logical version of this in a minute.

212
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,659
So the main consequences of celiac, because you don't have you've got this damage bill by our decreased digestive enzymes,

213
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,130
secretion and presence and malabsorption, right?

214
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:35,500
So quite often people present with lethargy, weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain, things like that, right?

215
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,410
Because it's a malabsorption process. Now, remember, everything in our bodies should be a one way pattern.

216
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,900
And this is something I'm going to kind of repeat a lot, especially as we get through the fiber and microbiome centers.

217
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:50,610
If you mean something, it's going to come out. The other end is either going to be absorbed or it's going to come out the other end, right?

218
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,150
So because you don't absorb it, that doesn't mean it doesn't exist in your body anymore.

219
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,380
It's just going to go to a part of your body where maybe you're going to have some other some other effect.

220
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:03,810
For example, it's going to interact with your microbiome that might have some impact there by nutrient deficiencies,

221
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:09,150
weight loss we've already covered anemia is probably due to poor iron and B vitamin malabsorption,

222
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,060
osteoporosis related to cow, you know,

223
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:17,549
and then intestinal cancer is probably due to the damage and the repair and the improper repair of the sense for children.

224
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:23,370
Quite often it's first detected is just slower growth, which can be different, especially when they switch to solid foods.

225
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,910
Fortunately, treatment is pretty straightforward. We know what causes that gluten, so you don't eat right.

226
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,260
The people in the world you need to not include in our people like this. Now I feel like I go to Whole Foods.

227
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:40,499
Sometimes I see non gluten marked as if it's like low sodium or like you know, high fiber, as if it's like a general health thing.

228
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,879
That's like not true for most people.

229
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:49,620
Gluten is fine, but some people think that just as principal is the fact that if you like bread that is chewing gum like you,

230
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:55,440
you're tested for celiac generally through a blood test, which is detecting immunoglobulin e antibodies.

231
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,620
Right. So there's direct biochemical tests for celiac, either the antibody tests or the genetic tests or both or like I said,

232
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:07,259
an intestinal biopsy to show that you get the damaged damage knowing the prevalence is about one in 100.

233
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:14,159
Right. So odds are one of you could have this. So like when you get the biopsy, you have to have gluten within like the past four weeks or so.

234
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:19,620
Is that the same with the blood? Yeah, it's a challenge. So we'll give you a small amount of gluten in the middle of an antibody response.

235
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,889
Sometimes you'll have residual antibodies, but it's better to see them challenging response.

236
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:31,470
And I think that's number of people. That is the challenges. They should be separated from a somewhat sounding related but not.

237
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:37,340
Have the physiologically related condition, which is called anti-gas or non-celiac gluten sensitivity.

238
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:42,590
So this prevalence is estimated to be much higher. So like 6%, so 6%, six points higher.

239
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:48,230
So this is where people have a sensitivity to one, but they test negative for the antibodies to celiac.

240
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,770
They also generally do not have the bely damage.

241
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,070
Right. But they do report symptomology associated with when they include it.

242
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:05,149
Right. So it's possible that you may have some gluten symptom gluten associated symptoms and may make you feel nausea or it may make you feel bloated.

243
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,150
It could cause indigestion.

244
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,780
But then when you get the test, that's not there. So I would say for many years,

245
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:16,939
people thought that this was like entirely psychosomatic and was not a real thing because there was no gluten antibodies,

246
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,790
and therefore this person was obviously just faking it and just didn't want to eat their dinner or whatever it was.

247
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:25,610
But now I don't think that's the case that most people think that this is a true condition, but it varies.

248
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:31,180
And because there is not hard and fast diagnostic criteria like the genetic tests or the antibody test, there is resilient.

249
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,880
It's a lot harder to figure out where people are. Some people may be mildly sensitive.

250
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:41,400
Some people may more sensitive. But generally, it's not an autoimmune response threat because you do not get the antibodies to it.

251
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,170
So chances are if somebody tells you that they are sensitive, this is what they are.

252
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,360
They're six times more likely to be the other four celiac at this point in time.

253
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:57,320
And this sort of psychosomatic interaction does have it could play some role.

254
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:03,260
What I'm saying is that, especially in the case of the IBS, not only what you're saying, but especially in the case of the IBS,

255
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:13,250
where you may have periods where you will develop sensitivities and gluten or lactose, and then you may have like no symptoms for a really long time.

256
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:20,450
Right. So I'm using psychosomatic in the way that an allergist would be like you of where the psychosomatic effects are.

257
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,290
True. Right.

258
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:27,720
As the notes talked about a little bit for today's class, if you just have a lot of anxiety, that's going to have now digested the test, right?

259
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:34,220
So people can have sensitivities to food or they can have temporary intolerances to food for reasons that are true and real.

260
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:41,600
There is not an allergic responses. Yep. So has gluten sensitivity like similar to an allergies that we know.

261
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,310
So we don't think it's similar to an allergy because it doesn't mount an antibody based response. Oh, yeah.

262
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:49,680
So it's something something else. Yeah. And that's a problem.

263
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,279
Is it possible it could be ten differences. Right. And we don't really know what any of those things are.

264
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,740
It could be something that's not even the gluten could be something that comes along as well.

265
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,980
Right. Again, without including on their own.

266
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,860
Okay. So that's my little thing about the lemon appropriate.

267
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,850
Right. So remember, that's because the lemon appropriate immune cells where that immune response is initiated from is from.

268
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:19,300
And your response in the lab before moving on to the subject is so I'm not going to go through all of these layers.

269
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:25,150
You're going to have some mucosal there's a layer here which has a lot of connective tissue and elasticity.

270
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:32,590
Right. So indeed, this is the blue part right there and in there is two sets of nerve.

271
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:38,360
So that's where a lot of innovation occurs. And there are two places that we're going to talk about, like this just means network of nerve endings.

272
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,580
This one is called the plexus of Meisner.

273
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:49,850
So, Julie, some person will probably do with Meisner and this is largely to control secretions into a little bit, right?

274
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:54,709
So if you find just something, you've got to signal for these epithelial cells to secrete things,

275
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:59,750
these will indicate that that signal comes from nerves that are in the some mucosa,

276
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:05,299
specifically nerves that are called the classes of mice in the muscle layer here.

277
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,860
On the muscular extension of the order in this Rosa, there's another set of networks.

278
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:15,500
This is now called the Plexus Empowerment. So these are the same thing or nerve endings from our entire nervous system.

279
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,309
And they're what promotes the contract, right? So they can sense the presence of food.

280
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,340
Maybe there's a stress response and then there's a contraction response. Right.

281
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,280
So that's another layer of muscles here.

282
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,620
There's the ROSA also provides a lubricant and sort of an outer layer of support, kind of like an outer shell for the environment.

283
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:35,870
And again, remember, it's going to look different in the stomach, which is going to be able to expand quite a lot into your esophagus,

284
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:41,540
which isn't going to be expand at all that your stomach can expand 24 years, Hopkins can probably spend less than 10%.

285
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,900
Okay. So those two places is which I'm going to show you the picture that might highlight them

286
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:51,290
a little bit better are part of some of the central neural regulation of digestion.

287
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:57,860
So as we're in talk about last class, just the sight or even the form of food can start the digestive problems.

288
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:03,680
Right. So you might smell something, you might even notice you get some salivary secretions in your mouth, but all throughout your body,

289
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,690
as soon as you eat your body, anticipate food to arrive, it's going to start some of these secretions already.

290
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,470
Right. So the digestive process precedes the actual part of food.

291
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:17,390
But then, of course, as you smell and taste, the food is going to activate it much, much more strongly.

292
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,390
And this is mediated by the enteric nervous system, right?

293
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,649
So the entire nervous system is sometimes thought of the second brain.

294
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:28,190
We have something like 500 million neurons in our enteric nervous system and you

295
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:32,839
can see the entire nervous system connects to all throughout the digestive system,

296
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:41,840
through all throughout the stomach, the small intestine areas, all of the sphincters, all the connections between the organs are controlled by this,

297
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,020
as is these plexus analyzer and plexus of our back.

298
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:51,679
So if you kind of look down here, you can see this outer layer that is going to control muscle connection is the inner one,

299
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,110
which is going to control secretion is the place of mind.

300
00:29:54,230 --> 00:30:00,770
So this is what this would look like if you zoomed in at any of these nervous connections and you can see this again throughout the digestive system.

301
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:07,099
Now, in some places, this is going to be very, very there's going to be a lot more innovation.

302
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,530
For example, in small intestine, there's a lot in the stomach,

303
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:14,690
there's a reasonable amount and in the say the mouth in part because there's somewhat less, but there's always going to be some.

304
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,239
And this communication is by the end, right.

305
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,400
So it's the brain telling the digestive system what to do and the digestive system telling the brain what's going on.

306
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,660
Right. So you get stuck or you have too much food in your stomach. That's all part of this connection.

307
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,650
There also has to be coordination between the respiratory tract and the digestive tract.

308
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:38,169
Right. Because we have two separate sets of foods that we do not want in getting into our respiratory cavity.

309
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,680
And really that about once we get air in our gastric cavity.

310
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,340
But it's it's mean it's not as bad, but it's not good.

311
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:49,159
If you going to get food and respiratory tract, you can be right in life threatening.

312
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,290
And so you might think of something as big as choking or could be something as in you're getting

313
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,360
food into your digestive tract and that can cause inflammation and eventually aspiration,

314
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:03,400
right? So there's too much food that gets in your tracks that can cause build up inflammation in your respiratory tract.

315
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:10,840
So we have mechanisms through our parents in our larynx that controls the opening of the respiratory tract and the digestive tract.

316
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:16,540
It's also one reason why children are doing so quickly because they're more prone to people who are more severe.

317
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:21,070
And if we doesn't prompt or. Okay.

318
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,460
So now I'm going to start we're going all the way from the top to the bottom.

319
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,850
So the very first part here is going to be the esophagus, right?

320
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:32,409
So right after we need food, we get through the parents, we're going to have the esophagus.

321
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:36,700
And there's two sphincters here. There's an upper esophageal sphincter, which is basically activating the parents.

322
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,290
And then there's a lure, something which is which is going to control flow into the stomach.

323
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,440
And so we're going to go through a case study here.

324
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:50,620
Example, now that we have the microphone working through the technology of what can happen with the esophageal sphincter.

325
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,560
So we're going to go out now.

326
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:02,580
He is a busy college student and also a radio DJ.

327
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,810
This slide gives you a little detail about Ralph.

328
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:12,840
Take a few minutes and read about Ralph. It's.

329
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:34,800
And he. It's.

330
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:54,160
You've got a very busy schedule and of the things like yeah are some more details about Ralph,

331
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:59,740
the problems he's having the symptoms and he's going to the doctor.

332
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:08,300
It's not like he's presented to the doctors. With another minute to go to this slide.

333
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,860
So here we have a few questions about this problem.

334
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:53,210
And then guess what Rouse might be experiencing?

335
00:33:54,710 --> 00:34:01,250
33rd. Yes. And the burning sensation and sour taste.

336
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:13,040
Do you have an idea why he's got the sense he's got great ground isn't probably around.

337
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,370
Are there any long term consequences of this intense cancer?

338
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:30,660
Damage to the esophagus? Yes. And is there something the doctor can recommend him to reduce the symptoms?

339
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:46,920
Take a Prilosec diet, antacids like that, modifications to last year and help people drive smaller meals not laying down right up to meals,

340
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,950
not wearing tight clothes around the waist.

341
00:34:51,380 --> 00:35:02,660
Not the typical gastric irritants you want to avoid alcohol, caffeine, carbonated beverages pretty much due to change in life.

342
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:12,570
You know, some of our times are pretty much covered.

343
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:25,940
All these Texas doctors might have four rounds of large meals lying down after a big meal, spicy minty foods, smoking meat overweight.

344
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:39,239
And I don't think it applies throughout the pregnancy process of early this is also probably so from you

345
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:45,870
as in and as eating bolus from the stomach its back to the esophagus and improper disclosure of the law.

346
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:56,520
So could you explain to some that's why the gastric content it's packages of yes indeed significance and then then a leading burning sensation.

347
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:08,160
Now you have to jot down your thoughts about these all these four questions you have to submit individually in an assignment that is already a study.

348
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:16,380
This is an individual assignment. And there are why there are just three and four, but you will have to answer all the questions in the segment.

349
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:22,770
I think the assignment page on great prep, that's all for questions. You know, we answer all four.

350
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:26,760
Yes, yes. And here are the long term consequences.

351
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:35,130
Cancer at the same time you cannot be so patient is if they used ulcers and damage to the oral and treatments.

352
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:46,080
Obviously even smaller meals avoid certain foods to remain upright after meals lose weight if the patient is overweight and and disease.

353
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,920
Okay, so why don't we spend 5 minutes on that? Try as you're answering these questions to focus on ask the people around you if any

354
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:02,280
of the things that either we are testing about covered here are confusing to you.

355
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:06,480
So if you're not totally sure about why you would lie down or why truly why you're

356
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:12,030
pregnant might be an issue here not they're not problem then talk with that around

357
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:21,780
the people around for 5 minutes so you to you have something I of course I was very

358
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:42,080
often I was reading during World War II military which just happens sometimes.

359
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:50,100
And I have two different stories, which I think is feedback.

360
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:56,660
So they feel like I need me, right?

361
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:11,370
Which makes me feel like, no way, you know, everybody, I just I don't know.

362
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:18,120
And yet I like I like the earnings.

363
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,710
I think about your stomach acid. Those are good.

364
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:44,820
Know why I come back and talk to buy stuff and I think that I know like it's real.

365
00:38:47,330 --> 00:39:15,510
Like there's so much, you know, it's like as it's digested all of through acid, it's sort of like it's like.

366
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:23,250
I guess it's because.

367
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:33,150
Speaker of the House.

368
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:48,530
The focus is no good.

369
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,850
We won't. But I think that.

370
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:05,800
Oh, my. Don't think that there's anything they have to know, because maybe I should look like that.

371
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:12,400
I doubt that. But they do want to see that.

372
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:19,690
That's why I my country.

373
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:26,470
Okay. So I'm going to move on to the last part of the upper digestive system, which is the stomach.

374
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:35,889
So the stomach, of course, is an extremely acidic environment and that is generated by an organ which is generated by my cells within our stomach.

375
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:36,060
Right.

376
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:44,580
So the layer of the if you look in at the stomach systems, give you a little of capital in stomach comprised of what are called gastric pants, right?

377
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:49,930
So it's almost like the inverse of what's in the small intestine, which is where we have intestinal here.

378
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:54,610
We have these sort of foundations. And the reason we are located is we actually don't really care.

379
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:58,900
They increase the surface area that much in the stomach because the stomach is definitely stretchable.

380
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:06,530
That's got to be a good spin and it's going to be able to have the cells that can secrete acid in it, private cells sort of hidden in from there.

381
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:09,340
I think this is what we call the layer of the stomach would look like.

382
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:15,220
And then if you look a little closer, there's really four types of cells are going to be three types of cells that matter here.

383
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:19,710
There's the entrance. Also, they'd secrete the regulatory hormones, things like that from grown there.

384
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:23,140
There's a mucus neck cells here. Sorry, mucus next cells here.

385
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:26,500
So these are more like protective cells. This is what's going to secrete in mucus,

386
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:34,059
which is going to be the barrier in terms of the carbohydrate barrier that protects these cells and getting degraded by the acid royal cells,

387
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:42,590
which actually specifically treat the acid. And then the cheek cells which are secreting pepsin again, which is various in various and water.

388
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,720
All of those work and the functional cells are geared towards the bottom of the,

389
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:52,990
of the cancer, whereas these cells part of the secretes secreting this.

390
00:41:54,230 --> 00:42:00,260
Okay. So that's in the upper digestive tract. So we get to the lower part of the digestive system.

391
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,370
Most of the digestion is going to occur within the small intestine, right?

392
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:09,800
So the stomach is really just sort of a holding area. A little bit of digestion does occur in the stomach, but not very much.

393
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:16,190
The vast majority, usually more than 95% of all, both digestion and absorption occurs for most things.

394
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:22,309
In the small intestine. There's a few exceptions, mostly macronutrients. So the gateway is the pedal sphincter.

395
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:27,920
So the stomach is going to decide when to empty its contents into the bottom by opening of the pyloric sphincter.

396
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,910
And then food is going to pass through here. So the first part is the door knob.

397
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:38,749
So that kind of this is the acidic now acidified food emulsion is going to come from the stomach and it's

398
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,800
going to be immediately neutralized by bicarbonate secretions from something called brewer's glands.

399
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:45,830
So these are created by carbonate. So by carbonation acid.

400
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:53,680
Now the page is going to come back up from four or five up to seven, and this is going to activate the enzymes in the small intestine.

401
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:57,710
So as we talk about the various enzymes, we get to the individual macronutrients,

402
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:02,390
you'll see that certain enzymes will be activated or inactivated based on the page, right?

403
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:05,660
So if you want it active in the stomach, it's got to be active in a little bit.

404
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:13,880
You want to activate the small intestine, you want to activate a small diffusion of the genome is where most of the absorption actually occurs.

405
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,670
And so that's sort of this longer middle part here.

406
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:24,930
And then the last part is the earlier where a little bit more something occurs and where we have biliary circulation before moment.

407
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:31,220
So if you zoomed in again, it's going to have the same three layers that we've been talking about throughout the mechanism system.

408
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,100
But now the small intestine has these intestinal villi.

409
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:41,050
So if you look in here, if you zoom in here, you would see this finger like protrusions here, which are called below.

410
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:44,480
They are intermediate by two different sets of blood vessel type.

411
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,370
So arterials and animals, very small veins, very small arteries you've probably heard of before.

412
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:56,780
These here called black heels connect to the lymphatic system. And as we'll learn, lipid primarily travels through the lymphatic system,

413
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,740
whereas carbohydrates and proteins and most other micronutrients will pass through.

414
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,400
There are a few of system. So this is just showing one example here.

415
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:11,570
But each individual belly is going to have both like fuels and at least arterial capillary bed to a lot of resorption.

416
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:15,350
That all occurs underneath a layer of epithelial cells here.

417
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:20,330
This is shown here and then on each epithelium cell is going to be what are called microbial lives.

418
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,000
So even though these are really on top of each of that,

419
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,690
are more finger like protrusions to even increase the surface area on the surface of the army and terrorism.

420
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,930
And we'll talk about this a lot as we talk about the actual mechanisms,

421
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:40,700
but the transport to get something from the lumen so food across into the blood here is going to involve two different transport processes.

422
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:47,750
You have to transport it from the looming into the interstate and then you have to get an interest like out of the parasite and into the blood.

423
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:52,430
Right. So it's two steps for almost all macronutrients, actually. There's two steps for all macronutrients.

424
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:57,140
There's a step of the apical membrane and a step here at what's called the basal lateral membrane.

425
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:03,500
And again, having a really high surface area allows us to absorb more things at the same time.

426
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:07,800
So the low interest looks like a light.

427
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:14,620
Yeah. So I heard all of that. Okay, so the previous pitch. Yep. So could you just a piece of lipids go through the lymphatic system, the carbs.

428
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:19,040
So yeah, so lipids will go through primarily through the effects on the primary.

429
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:25,339
I just miss the carb part that everything else goes through the vascular system as we'll talk about in the lipid digestion,

430
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:31,040
unit lipid, they're actually quite confusing to digest because it turns out by definition they're like not soluble and one right.

431
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:36,049
And so that's why they have different processes for a lot of reasons. Okay, well, it's been about 5 minutes or so.

432
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:39,920
So what I want you to do is on your diagram, I want you to draw your own bill.

433
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:47,000
I like to use arterial microbial. Think so? You can kind of get your head around exactly sort of what the structure of these things look like.

434
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,680
So we'll spend just a couple minutes on that. And then with you on that picture of your digestive system and the picture of your bill,

435
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:56,780
like, would you still believe all these parts here on your thigh?

436
00:45:57,080 --> 00:49:32,630
Then you can submit that on to. Okay.

437
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,430
So again, just like before, if you have any questions about any of this,

438
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:42,810
just mark that on your diagram before you submit it and I'll try to clarify it if you have any questions about the orientation of these things.

439
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:50,940
Okay. So two other things I want to touch base on really briefly are going to be the liver gallbladder through these reviews for the small intestine,

440
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:57,990
bile bile acids are generated primarily in the stomach or in the liver.

441
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,979
We'll talk about these a lot more. We get to the liver lipid unit. We're not super relevant.

442
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:07,500
For part, proteins are carbohydrates. They're generated in the liver and they're stored in an organ called the gallbladder,

443
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,010
which can then be constructed to release it into the small intestine.

444
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:16,320
Now, about 95% of bile faults are recirculated, which means that when they get to the ilium,

445
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:21,809
those ducts that can be sort of like the bile so literally secrete bile all the time.

446
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:25,700
We lose a little bit every time we do that, about 5%, 5% percent.

447
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:30,330
But most of it can be recirculated through this, through the stomach here.

448
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:38,970
And that's one of the major roles of the able to be able to recirculate whatever is non ritualized recirculated is loss misfeasance.

449
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,260
Okay so after we get through the ilium, we're now in the large intestine.

450
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:47,080
Now mostly this is stuff that has not been absorbed and likely will not them.

451
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,460
So you can think of the large intestine is sort of like a pre storage area.

452
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:54,540
Again, it's gated by the iliac sphincter and it consists of three parts,

453
00:50:54,550 --> 00:51:01,950
the colon and then the rectum, some macro, some microgram, some minerals, mainly the major mineral.

454
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:08,640
Some important parts are absorbed in the large intestine. And it's also the major sort of absorption for water.

455
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:15,440
The other major thing that happens in the large intestine is that's where our gut microbiome primarily but not exclusively, is located.

456
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,210
We have a little bit of bacteria throughout the gastrointestinal tract.

457
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:22,829
There's a little bit in your mouth as often as a tiny bit in your stomach, a little bit in your small intestine.

458
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:26,460
But the vast, vast, vast majority of it is in your heart.

459
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:34,470
So we talk on a whole lecture on the microbiota. Almost all of that is going to exist in what is in fact the functioning of the part of the biology.

460
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:39,810
So we're not going to cover it too much today because again, we have a whole class on this in a couple of form.

461
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:45,089
Okay, so that's all the way through. And then of course, things are released through.

462
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:49,110
That directly means we're going to move on to our first food of the day,

463
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:53,520
which is going to be called in, because we're talking a little bit of microbiota.

464
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:57,790
She's going to talk a little bit about you.

465
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:15,520
I. It's not what it used to.

466
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:24,370
You know, I can you go to your club also?

467
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,850
Okay. So our quote of the day is kombucha.

468
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:33,940
And I'll be going over what it is, how it's made, what it contains, and some of its health claims and benefits.

469
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:45,400
So Complutense is a fermented probiotic beverage made from some simple ingredients so that black or green tea,

470
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:49,390
sugar and a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast,

471
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:58,450
also known as a scope and fermentation, means that the sugars in the culture will be converted to alcohol in anaerobic conditions.

472
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:04,630
And then probiotics means that it's a combination of yeast and bacteria, which is exactly what's going to be is.

473
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:09,790
And there's also the implication that it supports microbiome community.

474
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:18,840
So oh, so sorry.

475
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:45,940
Because your cool. Okay.

476
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:50,090
So we're the food data central search results.

477
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:59,450
I actually found that there were no search results for the two types the foundation legacy surveys and Experimental Foods.

478
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:06,410
So the information I used for understanding its profile was from random foods.

479
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:11,840
So the example I used was Buddha's Broken Butcher,

480
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:21,800
and I'm looking at a 100 milliliter content and had no fat or protein and had low carbohydrate and sugar content.

481
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:29,330
And I found interesting that there was an energy category, which I wasn't quite sure what that was referring to,

482
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:37,150
because there wasn't a category for like putting these and all those micronutrients that I was aware that that contain.

483
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:45,860
So it's kind of categories in there. But what I did gather from this was that an additional content will vary by brand.

484
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:56,969
And this also allowed you to understand that branded information might be seen as less accurate than a foundational information,

485
00:54:56,970 --> 00:55:01,340
because a foundation foundation profile will give you information,

486
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:06,980
which is like the standard reference for any type of kombucha, but that just simply wasn't found.

487
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:13,500
And I'll go over why that might be. So how do you make kombucha?

488
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:17,320
Referring back to the ingredients I talked about earlier.

489
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:23,820
You allow the tea and sugar to mix so you know how this is going to ferment from anywhere from one to a month.

490
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:34,079
And the longer brewing time you allow, the more alcoholic or acidic it can be and also the less degree it could be.

491
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:42,059
So mostly the alcohol is found will be ethanol. So you might get like part confusion and mostly the actions you plant as a student athlete.

492
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:51,720
And so if you let like a kombucha culture go on for months, it might entirely turn into acetic acid, which is just vinegar.

493
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:57,070
Okay. So where and when did it originate?

494
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:07,719
It dates back all the way to 221 B.C. originated in China, and even then, back then it was already seen or known to have some properties,

495
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:13,440
and it was called the Tea of Immortality in 414 posters in Japan by Dr. King,

496
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:19,089
who couldn't believe that this work, which was made up there, and then it spread to Europe and Western societies,

497
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:23,709
and then it's thrived worldwide for its proclaimed health benefits.

498
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:28,260
And this is just an image of real life news today.

499
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:33,190
It's on February 1st. So what are some of these health claims?

500
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:42,160
So this review study titled Future Recessions and Future Prospects was published just earlier this year.

501
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:51,700
And you look back over time or reference over 70 origins in which those articles talk about computers and nursing homes.

502
00:56:54,820 --> 00:57:04,450
So this figure is from their article, and the middle is like a circular diagram they got going on from regulations

503
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:11,440
and how that is like dictated or affected by no on health benefits and how

504
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:21,510
it kind of it's like a cycle going like that in which some benefits might influence what regulations the market or people want to impose on computer.

505
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:31,870
And so the last signs of this image is some parameters the researchers in the study deemed were not very good enough.

506
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:42,999
So probiotics regulation wasn't uniform across different computers or the scope selection can vary or the manufacturing process itself could vary.

507
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:49,690
So as I mentioned, fermentation, you go from two months, so things like that wasn't uniform.

508
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:57,310
And on the right side is some of the health claims that they found across these different literature they review.

509
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:06,160
So anything from antidiabetic effects and sequencing of dengue to improving the liver or improving immune system.

510
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:15,640
And I put in more here because in in the searches I found that there were many health claims on the benefits of which I'm.

511
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:29,110
So some takeaways from that study specifically they found that the probiotics in computer do affect the composition of intestinal microbiome.

512
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:38,920
Also increase antioxidant properties is dependent again on these factors of T the SCOBY or the fermentation process.

513
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:48,160
But generally the health benefits are therefore going to vary because they're nutrient profiles.

514
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:55,620
So and they conclude that there's a long road ahead having stricter regulation and.

515
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:01,300
Is there any question?

516
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:15,250
Well, I'll try to find the question in my head, but this is thinking about, you know, some computer does have like a alcohol percentage on it.

517
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:25,300
And we'll have those like labels you find like a difference between these ones and ones that do not have that alcohol in their nutrient profile.

518
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:31,090
Yeah. With benefits or. Oh yeah.

519
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:37,280
Again, I think it would vary by brand, so I'm not sure I feel like it would have less sugar though,

520
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,860
because more of that sugar is being fermented by the school.

521
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:50,049
Yeah. I know for a fact that a lot of kombucha because like ethanol is a natural product of the

522
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:54,820
fermentation that a lot of companies due to regulation have to artificially kind of remove it.

523
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:56,920
I don't know how they do that.

524
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:06,550
Did you see that if there was any like differences between like stuff that needs it in or some friends or have to like artificially remove it.

525
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:11,500
I guess I didn't can do that.

526
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:28,129
I guess I have a question. So when I think about the microbiome, I think that there's like a lot a ton of microbiome biota in there.

527
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:36,709
So I guess like really like how much like you drink kombucha, it would affect like that your gut microbiome I guess.

528
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:43,250
Like if you drink not too often, it probably wouldn't do much in terms of like having health benefits.

529
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:47,090
Am I correct on that? Yeah, that's such a good question.

530
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:56,000
I saw I think it's from the CDC saying that they even gave like an exact amount of if you drink too much,

531
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:59,900
it's actually maybe might have a negative effect.

532
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:08,600
So it's just interesting to note, like, what is that balance? What is that? What do you want to strive for in consuming with them?

533
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,770
Yeah. Did they say how much is too much? They did.

534
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:19,250
I don't know. Okay.

535
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:32,080
Great. I would say most of it.

536
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:36,379
So just a couple of things since this is our first food of the day. Just a couple clarification things.

537
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:43,400
Not that it was anything. I just want to clarify me. What is a branded food that needs a manufacturer provides the nutrition information?

538
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,900
That's why sometimes we consider clueless or, you know, suspicious.

539
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,510
And also they don't have to report everything.

540
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:57,290
So that's why if you look at a conventional foods, like a potato, economical potato, it will lose like a ton of information.

541
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:02,130
Right? But if I was like big brand potatoes, I could just select the things that I wanted to put in.

542
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:05,160
And I only have to include it if it's about a certain threshold. Right?

543
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:10,370
So there's like there's no higher percentage, more so than what's like an unbranded kombucha.

544
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:15,630
Well, that's thing so completely new on the market. So there is no canonical collusion now.

545
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:17,660
So normally we see what the food of the day is.

546
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:23,030
Some maybe like here's a great or whatever and then here's what the canonical reasons for this is so new.

547
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:32,270
There is only brand of information because everybody's different about labels, usually foundation or as are usually the best.

548
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:34,579
If you have the choice and you can look at that and we'll do that,

549
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:40,010
everybody's going to be lots of looking up from one data central through the course of the semester, I think starting on Wednesday.

550
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:46,370
But if you can get foundational, that's supposed to be there because it's that is now tested by the US at the church.

551
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:53,180
Okay. So are we going to 2:00 here?

552
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:57,440
So I am. I'm going to skip this. If you want to do this activity,

553
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:03,470
feel free do is I'm great craft this is you're thinking about an accessory organ and what could go wrong if something went wrong with it.

554
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:09,590
This is extremely popular. I'm going to skip that kind of move on to the end of the regulations.

555
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:16,010
I got a little feedback that there's going to be a lot of hormones and names of things that are not great.

556
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:21,820
So what I'm going to start doing is trying every time I mention a hormone, have these like study ready tables, ready to go.

557
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:25,310
Not that I'm going to read everything on the table. I think for study purposes, it's a good summary.

558
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:30,830
So there are several regulators in the videos that were posted that control digestive function.

559
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:36,799
It's really important that as things are stage three, digestive system secretions are happening at the right time.

560
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:41,600
Enzymes are secreted, refined by carbon, is free to read time, sphincters open in close at the right time.

561
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:45,370
And that involves a lot of inner organ crosstalk throughout the small intestine,

562
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:51,410
like into the stomach or the stomach, talking to the lower esophageal sphincter and central before the brain.

563
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:56,270
Important with all of these systems, organ systems, talking to the brain. Right. And so that occurs partially through hormones.

564
01:03:56,450 --> 01:04:00,880
Gastric secretion came online and partially through direct nervous connections,

565
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:05,690
but the parasympathetic nervous system, largely through the vagus nerve and the sympathetic nervous system,

566
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:14,780
right, in terms of its stress and thinking about the full of these have key roles and all of these roles have to be integrated with each other.

567
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:24,140
Now, some of these, especially cheesecake and the person taking a system came up in the last lecture, not in Warren's presentation, but in this.

568
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:28,459
And that's because some of these are also that these two are also anti appetite hormones.

569
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:34,160
Right. Because the body just started doing evolution that well at this moment to be a signal that there's something in the small intestine.

570
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,500
And part of what it's doing is to signal to the stomach or to the gallbladder.

571
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,600
In the case of sick,

572
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:44,660
we might as well use that same signal to signal to the brain that there's food in the small intestine the same way with the vagus nerve.

573
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:51,020
The vagus nerve can both detect chemicals so it can detect actual things in our gastrointestinal tract, but can also detect stretch.

574
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:58,879
Right. So they can it's a nerve. So can detect if there's food there by the physical presence and that can be of useful for signaling to other organs,

575
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,910
but also sending back to the home brain to suppress food intake through the victim.

576
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:09,259
In fact, I was part of a I didn't work, but I was part of a pilot study where they were trying to do vagal stimulation.

577
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:13,850
So basically that we connected by your back to stimulate people's vagus nerve to suppress their appetite.

578
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:21,390
Internet age is caused by a collision, which I thought they were going to do.

579
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:28,190
It was not a good idea. So here's one example of how these things can be related in a cascade, right?

580
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:32,510
So I'm not going to go through all of this, but you should be able to visualize as food passes through the stomach,

581
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:34,930
it's going to trigger this signal and that's going to happen.

582
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:39,110
And if you're thinking about this and this is going to be consistent throughout all of the endocrinology

583
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:43,520
we're going to cover throughout the whole year is think of whenever you think about one of these things,

584
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:47,060
the best way I find to think about it is imagine there's a deficit here.

585
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:50,090
So I can use this as an example, but more use the example of leptin.

586
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:53,180
So normally as we eat food and our back stores increase,

587
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:58,940
leptin increases that suppresses food intake to kind of restore some level of homeostasis through a negative feedback.

588
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:03,680
All of these hormones work that way too. And so if you're thinking about how do these things work,

589
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:08,820
the best way to think about it is think about what would go wrong if, for example, Sick didn't work.

590
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,270
How would that affect my digestion? What could go wrong?

591
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:15,830
For example, if we didn't make GLP one in our stomach to suppress our appetite, what would happen?

592
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:21,550
Right. So that's a good way to think about these things and try to place it in a broader in a broader context.

593
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:24,680
Right. So the last activity I'm going to do today is just that.

594
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:30,920
So I want you to pick some signaling pathway from this slide or this slide, and I want you to do a thought experiment.

595
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:35,900
What would happen if that didn't work? Either it wasn't secreted or a body didn't respond to it?

596
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:38,870
And how would that affect their digestive physiology?

597
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:46,220
So it's been a pick one, spend a minute thinking about it by yourself, and then we'll spend the rest of the last 15 minutes of class.

598
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:50,300
You talking with the people around you to try to like? Does that make sense?

599
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:56,590
Does that make sense? What I think would go wrong with this particular one was not working and then leave

600
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:02,040
whenever you're done that and submitted for it to the negative end of criminal activity.

601
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:06,500
Okay. And then the last few slides, if you want them, are just some summary points from.

602
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:17,180
Supreme.
