1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,410
In this module, I'll be

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,180
providing you with an
introduction to some of

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,495
the basic concepts in
environmental health sciences.

4
00:00:09,495 --> 00:00:11,760
You may be thinking
at this point, "Gosh,

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,160
we've already talked about
some pretty scary concepts,

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,510
lots of chemicals out there,

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,055
things that I'm exposed to,

8
00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:18,690
who's got my back on this?

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,220
What agencies are
out there that are

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,680
responsible for keeping
me safe and healthy?"

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,300
Well, it turns out
there's good news.

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,800
We'll actually be
covering a number of

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,750
agencies through the
course of the class,

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,400
but I'm going to start
with two right now;

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,830
the World Health
Organization and the US

16
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,425
National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences.

17
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:37,125
I'm starting with these because
they both happen to have

18
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:40,675
very useful definitions of
what environmental health is.

19
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:42,555
So if we look at the WHO,

20
00:00:42,555 --> 00:00:45,550
they say environmental health
is aspects of human health,

21
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,480
including quality of life

22
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,830
that are determined by
factors in the environment,

23
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,459
and they go on to specifically
include physical,

24
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:55,885
chemical, and biological
hazards in the environment.

25
00:00:55,885 --> 00:01:00,210
Now, NIEHS actually
has a much simpler,

26
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,650
more pithy definition, that
environmental health is

27
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,480
discovering how the
environment affects

28
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,195
people in order to
promote healthy lives.

29
00:01:08,195 --> 00:01:10,820
I want to point out both
of those definitions vary

30
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,185
implicitly address issues
related to food, and air,

31
00:01:15,185 --> 00:01:18,960
and water, and also waste
disposal, and sustainability,

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,080
and lots of other subtopics

33
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,750
within environmental
health sciences.

34
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,930
So I'd like to spend a
few minutes talking about

35
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,585
the global burden of
environmental pollution.

36
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:32,360
It turns out in 2015 alone,

37
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,640
there were an estimated
nine million people who

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,760
died as a result of being
exposed to pollution.

39
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,090
That's about 16 percent
of all deaths worldwide,

40
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,995
just from pollution exposure.

41
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:44,300
If you do the math, it's

42
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,460
three times the amount
of people who died

43
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,850
from Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome, tuberculosis,

44
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,840
and malaria combined, and
it's 15 times the number of

45
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,540
deaths from all wars and other
forms of violence in 2015.

46
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,130
Unfortunately,
we've also realized

47
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,190
that in the most
severely affected,

48
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,225
or severely polluted countries,

49
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,950
pollution is responsible for more

50
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,675
than one in four deaths,

51
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:12,920
and that around the world
about 90 percent or more of

52
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,050
pollution related
deaths are happening in

53
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,125
low and middle-income
countries specifically.

54
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,835
So we can already
start to see that

55
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:22,400
EHS issues are not the
same around the world,

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,875
they vary by time and place.

57
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,020
We also know that disease caused

58
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,775
by pollution is most prevalent

59
00:02:28,775 --> 00:02:31,160
among minority populations and

60
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,480
marginalized populations as well.

61
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,060
So I'd like to take a moment
here and break down what's

62
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,640
actually causing those nine
million premature deaths.

63
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,260
I've got two graphs
displayed here.

64
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,330
We're going to focus on
the one on the left first.

65
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,030
So this is a graph of
different types of pollution,

66
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,380
air pollution on the left,

67
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,885
water to the right of
that, then occupational,

68
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:53,735
then soil basically
contamination,

69
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:56,120
and we have the number
of millions of people

70
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,000
dying prematurely on the y-axis.

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,830
You'll notice each of
these types of pollution

72
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,904
has multiple colors of bars,

73
00:03:02,904 --> 00:03:05,360
that's because we have
multiple organizations

74
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,695
creating estimates.

75
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:08,870
I want to highlight that
the individual numbers

76
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,910
of those bars may
differ a little bit,

77
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,230
but the trends across

78
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,555
categories are
absolutely consistent.

79
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:16,430
So every organization
that looks at

80
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,245
this agrees that air pollution

81
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:19,985
is the primary cause

82
00:03:19,985 --> 00:03:21,830
of these nine million
premature deaths,

83
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,870
accounting for about
two-thirds of them.

84
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,180
That's followed by
water pollution,

85
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,820
then by pollution and the
occupational environment,

86
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,160
and finally by soil pollution.

87
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,710
So the graph on the right,

88
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,050
actually sums all those up
into total pollution deaths,

89
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,510
again about nine
million people total,

90
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,490
and compares them to other causes

91
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,380
of death that you may
be familiar with.

92
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,510
So total pollution
deaths actually

93
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,045
exceed deaths from
tobacco smoking,

94
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:50,120
from AIDS, from alcohol use,

95
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,430
from malnutrition, and from

96
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,845
the other causes there
including Ebola,

97
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:56,150
which we're all frightened of,

98
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,340
but which kills a
vanishingly small number

99
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,490
of people compared to pollution.

100
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,690
We can also look at the
global burden of pollution

101
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,315
by the amount of income that
different countries make.

102
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:10,930
So here, we're looking at a
range of types of countries.

103
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,530
We've got high-income,
down to low income,

104
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,670
and upper middle and

105
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,860
lower middle at the
center of the graph,

106
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,940
and then we're looking at

107
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,460
the estimated number of
global deaths in millions

108
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,225
here by different kinds of

109
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:25,375
pollution similar to
the last graphic.

110
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,590
So what we can see here,

111
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,105
is the patterns are different

112
00:04:28,105 --> 00:04:30,340
depending on the income
level of the country.

113
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,990
In the low income countries,

114
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,280
on the left here,

115
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,110
we see that the small majority of

116
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,300
deaths are caused
by air pollution,

117
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,410
and that water pollution is

118
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,750
a major contributor to mortality.

119
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,010
For the lower
middle-income countries,

120
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,315
you can see that here

121
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:46,610
air pollution is a
much larger fraction,

122
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,305
but water is still a substantial
fraction of mortality.

123
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:52,490
Then as we move into
the upper middle

124
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,010
and high-income countries,

125
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,450
you can see it's virtually
all air pollution

126
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,475
driving the global
burden of disease.

127
00:04:58,475 --> 00:05:00,200
So the causes of pollution,

128
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,775
the exposures that people have

129
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:05,555
differ in countries depending
on their level of income.

130
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,970
So the global burden
of disease also

131
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,400
varies geographically,
or by nation.

132
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,010
In this graph, if we look
at the lower left corner,

133
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,160
we can see a legend
where red here

134
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,990
indicates the highest death rate

135
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,180
due to environmental factors,

136
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,910
and light yellow indicates
the lowest death rates.

137
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,610
So starting in the United
States, where I am right now,

138
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,650
you can see we have
the lowest burden of

139
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,765
disease due to pollution

140
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:31,355
among all countries in the world.

141
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:34,205
We share this category with
places like Australia,

142
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:37,505
parts of Scandinavia, and
parts of South America.

143
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:38,840
On the other hand, if we go to

144
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,720
the low end of the legend here,

145
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,970
that red color, you
can see that's very

146
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,430
much concentrated in
different parts of the world.

147
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,740
We see red in Eastern Europe,

148
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,195
in South Asia, and primarily
in Sub-Saharan Africa.

149
00:05:53,195 --> 00:05:56,510
So again, the risk of dying
from environmental pollution

150
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,010
differs very much depending

151
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,050
on where you live in the world.

152
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,790
I'd like to give you
a local example,

153
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,170
or at least local here to

154
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,855
me at the University of Michigan,

155
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:07,475
Lake Erie, one of our
five great lakes.

156
00:06:07,475 --> 00:06:10,715
So if we look back in
history to the 1960s,

157
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:13,910
Lake Erie was heavily contaminated
with industrial waste.

158
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,850
In fact, it was so polluted
that the Cuyahoga River,

159
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,085
that flows into Lake
Erie through Cleveland,

160
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:21,290
actually caught fire
and burned more than a

161
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,255
dozen times in the
1950s and '60s.

162
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,015
This lead actually
to the passage of

163
00:06:26,015 --> 00:06:28,969
some pretty landmark
environmental health policy,

164
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:31,580
and resulted in the lake
and the river being

165
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,325
cleaned up substantially
in the 1970s.

166
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:35,850
So in the '80s and '90s,

167
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,280
and early 2000s, Lake
Erie was in great shape.

168
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,985
Unfortunately, if we fast-forward
to the summer of 2014,

169
00:06:43,985 --> 00:06:46,430
we replaced industrial
pollution with

170
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,740
farm runoff and
fertilizers that end

171
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,750
up getting introduced
into Lake Erie and

172
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,795
cause blooms of blue-green algae.

173
00:06:53,795 --> 00:06:56,930
So in fact, in 2014,
in the Summer,

174
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,315
there was a tremendous
algal bloom

175
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:00,440
that actually resulted in

176
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,120
the City of Toledo having
to close its water plant.

177
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,680
Blue-green algae puts
out cyanobacteria

178
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,990
which are harmful to
people and animals,

179
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,640
such that the water
that was getting

180
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,890
drawn into the Toledo
Water Treatment Plant,

181
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,350
was unsafe to drink
even if you boiled it.

182
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,980
This resulted in several
days of a population of

183
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,230
about a half a million
people not having

184
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,245
access to clean drinking
water or to sanitation.

185
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:25,520
So these issues are not

186
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,240
just happening in
other countries,

187
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,980
they very much happen here in
the United States as well.

188
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,510
Now, I'd like to give you
just a very brief history

189
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,115
of Environmental Health Sciences.

190
00:07:34,115 --> 00:07:36,275
This discipline grew
out of sanitation,

191
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:38,360
sanitation being
basically the science of

192
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,480
preventing communicable
disease transmission.

193
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,670
So it turns out almost

194
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,600
hand-in-hand with the
industrial revolution,

195
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,695
we had a sanitary revolution
in the 19th century.

196
00:07:48,695 --> 00:07:50,750
This changed our
perceptions and actually

197
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,880
changed the way society behaved,

198
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,830
and facilitated our
understanding of how

199
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,970
diseases could move through

200
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,070
the environment and
then get into people.

201
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,130
The revelations, during
the sanitary revolution,

202
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,305
actually impacted the
way we prepare food,

203
00:08:03,305 --> 00:08:04,715
we dispose of waste,

204
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:06,800
the way we design hospitals,

205
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,070
and the way we rear our children.

206
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,475
If we look ahead to
the 20th century,

207
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:13,730
EHS matured during that period,

208
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,820
we did a lot of work
trying to link hazards to

209
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,100
the physical structure of

210
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,010
chemicals and their
particular biologic effects.

211
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,260
We started to focus
more on how we detect

212
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,750
contaminants in hazards
in the environment,

213
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,090
and evaluating how much
of a chemical it takes

214
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,805
to cause a health
outcome in people.

215
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:34,190
Unfortunately, we
learned a lot of lessons

216
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,350
from many industrial disasters,

217
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,085
some of which we'll talk
about in a later module.

218
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,080
Now, in the 21st century,

219
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,910
EHS has a lot of technological
advances underway.

220
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,159
We're developing new
analytical techniques,

221
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,365
new instruments in
laboratory methods.

222
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:50,780
We're relying more and
more on biomarkers,

223
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,465
basically measurements
in human tissue

224
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:56,210
of the contaminants
that are inside us.

225
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,160
We're employing
informatics tools,

226
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,995
new computational approaches,
new statistical models.

227
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:02,810
We're delving deeper and

228
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,850
deeper into toxicological
mechanisms,

229
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,400
so we can have a better
biochemical understanding

230
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,575
of how the body
reacts to chemicals.

231
00:09:09,575 --> 00:09:13,475
We're using risk assessment
more to inform public policy.

232
00:09:13,475 --> 00:09:16,400
We're very focused on
issues of susceptibility.

233
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,660
So why does one person,

234
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,950
with a particular exposure,

235
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,780
gets sick while another person

236
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,995
with that same exposure does not?

237
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,770
Finally we're spending
a lot of time and

238
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,540
energy on exposure
assessment just to

239
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,890
understand what all of us are

240
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,220
exposed to at work and at play.

241
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,540
Bottom line is, this is an

242
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,670
extremely exciting time in EHS,

243
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,650
and it's become
clear now more than

244
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,595
ever that EHS is
truly a global issue.

245
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:42,430
I'd like to leave you with
just a few examples of

246
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,710
hot topics in environmental
health right now.

247
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,230
The one that's on everybody's
mind is climate change,

248
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,670
probably the
predominant issue that

249
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,305
we'll face in our lifetimes,

250
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:53,295
but we also have issues of
water and air pollution,

251
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:56,350
how we dispose of solid
and hazardous waste,

252
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,960
how nanotechnology and
the built environment

253
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,645
and pesticides are
impacting human health,

254
00:10:01,645 --> 00:10:03,460
how people are
getting injured from

255
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,695
the way the environment
is designed,

256
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,630
issues around sustainability and

257
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,130
the notion of green chemistry

258
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,880
are finding chemicals that
are not so toxic to us,

259
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,840
ongoing issues with regards to

260
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,015
keeping workers safe
in the workplace,

261
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:18,920
and unfortunately
the list goes on.

262
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,355
So hopefully, this has
given you a global view of

263
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,425
the impacts of
environmental health

264
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:26,180
on everybody in the world,

265
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,830
and also some future
directions that

266
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,211
our field is already
pointed towards.
