1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,980
Oh, excuse me.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:14,030
I just heard she gets lost, but I need to talk to you first.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:25,520
I'll tell you. This is a lot of construction on looking at the 809.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,299
This week's discussion today,

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:39,720
we will go over what is fine and we will review the problems that form question six because that seems to give a lot of people trouble.

6
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:52,110
Instead of an engaging morning today, we will work on problems that define wounds.

7
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:01,409
The first one is a mathematical formula of numerator and not contained within the denominator is a ratio and the explanation

8
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:09,840
for this is a proportion and the percentages among them are in relation to a whole or both implied and original.

9
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,690
Hold the numerator and things within the denominator and then the ratio in the

10
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:24,509
comparison between the two definitely not imply a relation to question two,

11
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:34,680
referring to the degree that you can see. Assume that once you have the disease, you're no longer at risk of having the second one.

12
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,579
And based on your zero, how many persons are at risk of losing the third at the end of the study period?

13
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:47,800
You're far from person or at least get one through three.

14
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,660
Which you can see by counting. The first line is going to be zero.

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,520
It's going to be or you can go over to here to the bottom three years.

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,070
They're going to they're still at risk.

17
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:19,640
Referring to figure one What is the longer person years of follow up during the five year study and then will be 11 years.

18
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:28,500
And you can see once again by adding the dash lines for leniency, they both have five.

19
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,910
So that adds up to ten and will be reversed for the one year, which gives you 11 years.

20
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:46,070
Referring to trigger one. What is the incidence rate of the disease represented in the figures?

21
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:54,409
This will be one case per one person years as you can see during this time.

22
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,220
One case was developed during the follow through in.

23
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,650
And there were 11 total person years from the previous question.

24
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:16,020
The number of deaths due to disease occurring in persons that have a disease over a certain period of time is greatly reduced.

25
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:29,090
Question six The Detroit population had 1 million people with lung cancer on January 1st, 2000.

26
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:41,960
700,000 people without lung cancer on December 31st, 2009 through ten years after 17,000 people were newly diagnosed with lung cancer.

27
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:52,320
What was the incidence rate for lung cancer in Detroit from 2000 to 2009 expressed in per 100,000 person years?

28
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,180
And for this question, you can see that the population is not stable.

29
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,580
It's not implying that 300,000 people developed lung cancer.

30
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,420
It was a population change from 1 million to 700000.

31
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,849
The average population size is therefore required to answer the question.

32
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:18,930
So you divide, add up the two populations and then divide by 250,000.

33
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:26,630
We're estimating total person, years at risk, 130,000 people.

34
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:35,750
The number of people you just calculate is multiply that by the ten year time frame and you will get 1,500,000 person.

35
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:43,850
And four, the incidence rate, incidence rate, we have 17,000 newly diagnosed cases.

36
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:52,820
So you divide those 17,000 incident cases by the 8,500,000 person years.

37
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:05,150
And then you multiply that by 100,000, you get 200 lung cancer cases per 100,000 person years working through the formula.

38
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:15,149
And then read the question and see what goes. Order. Four questions.

39
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:24,540
Seven The quantity expressed as the number of people in an hour who has diabetes on January 1st, 2008 divided by the population,

40
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,269
total population of Ann Arbor on January 30,

41
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:36,200
2008 is an example of prevalence because this is at one point in time the prevalence of the disease is about the same.

42
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:48,790
The. To preferring group to assume that participants with symptoms were diagnosed with mononucleosis on the first day of their summer.

43
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,070
What is the prevalence of mononucleosis on January 1st, 2010?

44
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:04,950
So you can see one of the things that is kind of the case is and you can see that there were two.

45
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,760
So this is out of 1000 total college freshmen.

46
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:17,600
So it will be two per 1000, 40 0.2% of college freshmen in the study.

47
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,720
Trying to figure to again what is the period prevalence for 2010.

48
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,910
And if you come up with our response, you'll see that there were five that occurred during this period.

49
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,960
So you have five out of a thousand or 0.5% of college freshmen in this study.

50
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,840
And it is important to say. College freshmen in the study.

51
00:06:46,850 --> 00:07:00,700
So you're specifying the three. Question ten In a big population, what happens to the prevalence of a disease when incidence increases slightly?

52
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,690
For this question. The answer will be if the duration increases or stays the same, the prevalence of increasing.

53
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:25,220
And for an explanation for this one, you will see the prevalence, the incidence and duration so that the duration increases or stays the same.

54
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,690
The prevalence will increase because incidence is increasing slightly.

55
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,959
If the duration decreases rapidly,

56
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:40,220
there will be fewer people with the disease and prevalence will therefore increase because there is only a slight increase in incidence.

57
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,570
We're going on to problems at four questions. Six.

58
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,480
Stroke is currently one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States,

59
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:59,050
according to the Centers for Disease Control, approximately 795,000.

60
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:14,060
It's not surprising that approximately 725,000 of the 325.7 million people living in the US experienced a stroke in 2017.

61
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,310
Of these events, 142,142 were fatal.

62
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,549
So calculating cumulative incidence. You follow this formula, which you can see on the screen,

63
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:33,980
which is we will live incidence includes the new cases of stroke divided by the total population at risk and 2017.

64
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,060
So getting these numbers, you have 795,000.

65
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,980
Which would be in your suitcases, unsure of the total population.

66
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:59,420
We are considering the entire population of 325.7 million people and the answer would be 244.1 new cases per 100,000 people.

67
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,820
For an explanation of why the denominator is the entire U.S. population.

68
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,360
Although it does not mean. Exactly what you would think it means.

69
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:18,280
Is the entire population at risk of stroke? If you're currently having a stroke, you're probably not at risk of a.

70
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,620
We've got the disease currently. Two ways to look at that.

71
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,280
If we're studying the an instrument,

72
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:33,210
we would not need to remove anyone with a prior stroke because someone can have multiple strokes in their lifetime.

73
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:42,350
And if you're studying first ever incident stroke, then I really, really want to run a stroke prior to 2017 from the denominator.

74
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:48,800
In reality, we usually don't know this number for a large population like the entire United States.

75
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:57,860
And because the denominator is so large, having prevalent cases in the denominator will not result in major distortion or cumulative incidence.

76
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,770
Because even if you took those people out, it would just be a very small difference in the number of counter.

77
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,670
And now for the activity study of the engaged learning.

78
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,360
We will have technical and engage learning, which was not on the agenda at the beginning.

79
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,210
If you can all remember that you were in the short survey under engage learning for,

80
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,450
then we will work on problems that define for the rest of the period.

81
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:40,440
And it's one question. Thing that you can do really at the end because you're working on problems that find so.

82
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:50,699
I'll give you this time to work on. Sometimes just.
