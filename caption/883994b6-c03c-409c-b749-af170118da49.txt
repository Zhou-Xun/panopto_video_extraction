1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:07,050
Okay. All right, let's go. Come on. Today. So today is Cyber Day.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,920
So we're going to spend all day on this. The reason we're doing this now.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,280
But the carbohydrate structure and the microbiome, you read it. All right.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,270
Is what a fiber is chemically is defined by its chemical structure.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,290
And what a fiber does is super related to the microbiome.

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,959
So what we're going to cover today is what turns out to be a hard to define thing is one of those, you know,

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,460
if when you see it, but when you actually try to define it for like legal purposes, turns out to be a little bit confusing.

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,100
And we're going to talk about the different types and roles of fiber in our lives.

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,910
So you don't have this slide. Don't worry about it's not that big of a deal. But sometimes I'll use the phrase nutrients of concern.

10
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,480
So every five years, they come up with the dietary guidelines for Americans, as they did in 2045.

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,630
If there are certain nutrients at a population level, many people are deficient in, they mark these as nutrients of concern.

12
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,550
And these didn't change from 2015 to 2020, but the same nutrients.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,280
So not a great job by our public health people.

14
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:13,890
But the current nutrients of concern are fiber, calcium, vitamin D, potassium and iron, specifically for childbearing age women and infants.

15
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,340
So those are the nutrients that we are most likely to be efficient.

16
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,670
And of course, today we're going to talk about the other ones all going too much until we get to nutrition.

17
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,849
631 So I'll start with the recommended intake for all nutrients.

18
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:36,540
We talk about the thighs, we're going to start with the recommended intake. So there's an adequate intake, not a RDA for fiber.

19
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,749
And I'll explain in a moment why the adequate intake is set at 38 grams for men, 25 grams for women.

20
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,190
It's actually technically set at 14 grams per thousand calories.

21
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,810
Men tend to eat more than women. So that's why it's higher for men. It's no special properties, just men are bigger.

22
00:01:52,020 --> 00:02:02,400
So when you scale it for calories. RDA or also the pregnant woman is 28 to a little higher than adult women and until it is 19 to 25 grams,

23
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:09,780
much to my consternation, the dietary fiber shows up under total carbohydrates on your nutrition facts label.

24
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,980
So if you're looking at a nutrition facts label, that's where you'll find it, right?

25
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:21,120
And I find this and you'll probably find this surprising will be as a biochemist, I would not like it to be here because functionally,

26
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,120
even though library is by chemical definition a carbohydrate,

27
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:29,250
it does not behave as we'll talk about today at all, like starch or animals or animal or plant.

28
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,350
It behaves like a totally different thing and I think it deserves a whole different

29
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,700
body category that should be completely outside of the carbohydrate thing,

30
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,060
because I think it just confuses people who don't know those things.

31
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,590
But a third is the fiber intake levels in the United States.

32
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:51,750
As I said, it's a nutrient of concern of only 5% of males and 9% of females meet the air for fire.

33
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,850
Right. So by that definition, you might argue that many people are deficient in environment.

34
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:04,680
Now, remember, of course, the I and the RDA, if you watch those videos, are set at a sufficient amount for 95% of the population.

35
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:13,050
So just because 90 because 95% of men don't need the air does not mean that 95% of men are not getting in a fire.

36
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,290
Right. So there's like a slight subtle distinction between the two.

37
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:24,179
As you can see, the low fiber intake is sort of across the board, depending on whether you're diabetic or not or men or women.

38
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,820
It's all pretty, pretty low. Now, you may ask, how did they set this and why is there not an RDA?

39
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,170
So this is I think is actually kind of an illustrated example of why this is somewhat difficult.

40
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,830
Fiber does a bunch of different things in our minds as we talk about that.

41
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,010
Both provides viscosity. It is a fermentable substrate, it does a bunch of different things.

42
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:50,730
So trying to figure out exactly what the right amount of fiber is for any individual person is harder because it does so many different things.

43
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,339
Right. And you'll notice these are these are not set for soluble versus insoluble fiber,

44
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,240
which again, are fundamentally different things that can do different things in our bodies.

45
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,309
So when they were trying to figure out what we should set as a target for the RDA,

46
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:13,290
they looked at observational studies of cardiovascular disease risk and then cross-reference that against those people's fiber intake.

47
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:22,710
And that's where they figured out that at 14 grams per 100,000 calories was a good cutoff, where that would be reduction of cardiovascular disease.

48
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:29,450
Now, you may think, well, all the things that fiber does, reduction of cardiovascular disease risk does not seem like the most important one.

49
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,330
In fact, I don't even think hardly at all. And ultimately two lines in the notes.

50
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,050
But that's how this RDA is said and has nothing to do with the microbiota.

51
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,620
It has nothing to do with gastrointestinal health, it has nothing to do with diabetes,

52
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,829
and it has nothing to do with proper flow of nutrients through the digestive tract.

53
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,140
It's purely based on observational studies relating that to cardiovascular problems.

54
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,480
So that's why they got the 14 grams per 100,000 calories.

55
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:59,460
You multiply that by 2020 500, you get 24 or 35 depending on if you're a man and not how this was.

56
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,980
Does that make sense? There's no idea. There is because it is an estimate, right?

57
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,520
Because there's not a good biomarker. There's no EMR. There's no EMR.

58
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,520
There's no RDA. And that's a that's a good point. So you have only seven EMR if you have a good biomarker.

59
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,110
And in this case, they don't have a hammer. They don't even have a backlog.

60
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,329
There's like no biomarker. Now, we could argue that maybe there should be biomarkers.

61
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:27,600
Maybe you want to look at serum acetate or you want to look at content in the gastrointestinal tract or gut flora.

62
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,170
You can think of biomarkers. But right now, it is not set based on any value.

63
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,530
It is just based on these occupational studies. Okay.

64
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:43,569
So Farber, as I mentioned briefly, last class is somewhat defined as a carbohydrate that is resistant to our digestive enzymes.

65
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:50,620
So that's important. Our digestive enzymes, not my bacteria's digestive enzymes, but my like the ones with my legal mix.

66
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,490
Some of them are whole polysaccharides, for example, cellulose.

67
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:03,190
Most of them are hetero polysaccharides. And they contain any number of different monosaccharides, sugar, acid, amino sugars, sugar alcohols.

68
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,720
There's a whole variety of things that could be the constituents of a fiber.

69
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:16,210
So I showed this slide last class and you can see all these things down here are the different monosaccharides type substances.

70
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,330
There are a lot of cigarets that could go into one of these fiber drinks.

71
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,729
So there is glucose or anything that's blue is a clue. There's a bunch of other things that you may not have heard of,

72
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:30,760
like sucrose or I can believe that people are whatever that one is, man, you're running acid.

73
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,680
But there's a bunch of different things.

74
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,400
And again, importantly, even if we could digest these, which we can't, we probably can't absorb things like manner on a gas, right.

75
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:44,140
That didn't come up last time. You're talking about the adults and going to work.

76
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:50,530
Right. And so because of this, there is an enormous variety of plausible polysaccharides that we could eat,

77
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,919
that we could put in our mouths and try to digest, that we cannot digest.

78
00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:00,870
And remember, we can only really digest starch, sucrose, and for some of us, lactose.

79
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,950
And those are the only ones we can digest. Almost everything else on here is digestible.

80
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:14,150
So one prior definition of fiber and this is actually ironically still used in Canada is dietary fiber versus functional fiber.

81
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:20,600
So dietary fiber was defined as a non digestible carbohydrate that has to be found in plants.

82
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,320
Right. It has to come from a plant. Right. That was a dietary fiber.

83
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,880
Right. It did not matter if it did anything to you, but it was non-negotiable and lived in a plant.

84
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,950
It was a plant. So that was what, a dietary fiber originally defined by the USDA.

85
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:40,850
But then you realized, well, what if you added something to it? So let's say you make cookies and you add in some sort of like fiber like substance.

86
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:46,400
Could that be a fiber? And many people would argue no, because it's not from an intact food source.

87
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,280
But food manufacturers argue, well, no, it's the same thing.

88
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,970
If I had cellulose in my celery and I take cellulose and I mix it in with my smoothie, it's the same cellulose.

89
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,320
It should be the same thing.

90
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,900
And so for labeling purposes, they had to come up with a separate definition at the time, which was called functional fiber.

91
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,310
Well, you notice there's a non overlapping Venn diagram if you're careful about the logic of this,

92
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:14,240
because a functional fiber still has to be a non digestible carbohydrate, but it has to display a physiological benefit to human health.

93
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,049
Okay. So that was the definition of functional fiber, right.

94
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,710
And again, we can debate what that actually means, physiological value.

95
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,339
This is not what the USDA uses as of 2016.

96
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,260
The USDA uses this definition, which I'm not going to read because I hope you guys can all read.

97
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:36,650
But basically it is the combination of dietary fiber, naturally occurring fibers that are intrinsic and intact in plants.

98
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,230
So they're going to be found in a plant and functional fiber in the second product highlighted here.

99
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,350
Right. So they've got both parts of that definition into one.

100
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:52,610
So it has to at some point exist in a plant, even if this thing you're eating was never in a plant and that chemical had to have existed in a plant.

101
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,630
But it also has to have a beneficial physiological effect.

102
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,900
So not just some physiological effect, some benefit.

103
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,390
So that means if a food producer wants to take their thing and call it a fiber,

104
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:09,140
they have to run a study to show it has some beneficial physiological effect.

105
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,309
And that is vague because that could be literally anything could be cholesterol reduction,

106
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:17,840
it could be weight management, it could be diabetes management, it could be improvement of gastrointestinal motility.

107
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,340
It could be fermentation or preferential bacteria. It could be virtually anything.

108
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,610
But it has to be a benefit, a physiological benefit in humans.

109
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:33,620
So because this definition changed in 2016, as you might expect, the industry has done a lot of studies of supplementing various things,

110
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,370
Irish substances into humans to see if they have a physiological benefit.

111
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:44,719
Because all of this is going to come down to they want to be able to say that their fiber one bar has a lot of fiber something in it,

112
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,820
because a fiber one market doesn't have any intrinsic things.

113
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:53,720
So they're going to add something to it and they can only call it a fiber if it was found in a plant somewhere and it has a physiological benefit.

114
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,010
And so that's our current. Now, USDA definition of fiber, right.

115
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,980
Has to come from a plant, even though it has to exist in a plant, even if it doesn't come from a plant, has to have a physiological.

116
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,710
So what does that mean? That means there's now a lot of things that are called fibers.

117
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,180
So here's a bunch of words with a lot of weird letters that maybe you can't pronounce,

118
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:19,370
maybe I can't pronounce, but include the fibers that are currently approved as of this year by the U.S.

119
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,890
So in 2016, when they first came out with this definition,

120
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:27,469
many people already had good data about some of these things on the light, that they already had some physiological benefit.

121
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,240
So for example, cellulose was already well known as some of the bolt species as an insoluble fiber.

122
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,400
So that was already included on the left.

123
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:41,240
The things on the right are the things that in intervening five years, there have been tests done to show that they had some physiological benefit.

124
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:48,770
Now, why are these spaced out in a way like this? That's because some of these, for example, psyllium husk is an extract from a psyllium.

125
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:59,540
Husk. The active ingredient in that is actually a heavy cellulose, which is called our revenue is Ireland, which we'll talk about in a minute.

126
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,140
Right. So originally the benefit was just the extracted psyllium husk,

127
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,080
but then the intervening time somebody extracted the original Zealand or synthesized Rubio's island, shown it had the same bent.

128
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,970
Right. So that's why a Rabbitohs island was approved in 2021.

129
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,020
The opposite happened with mix. So all fibers which are mostly cellulose.

130
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,550
Cellulose, was already approved the first time because it had been shot from purified samples,

131
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:27,230
but then they showed that mixed cells also had similar effects. It's not why that's on the right.

132
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:34,549
Glucomannan is the active ingredient in guar gum. These things on the right, they don't have there has never been a sort of cognate.

133
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:39,620
So sometimes it's an extract which is a not totally purified extract like mixed olive fibers.

134
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,549
Sometimes it's a purified substance like, say, cellulose around exactly what do you say?

135
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:49,580
Approved. Does that mean like the USDA says it's safe or they say that if you add it to something, then you can say it's a fiber.

136
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:57,020
All of these are generally regarded as safe. So the IRS, which is the USDA standard for you, complain about these mean that you can call it fiber.

137
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:02,390
So if you put five grams of resistant starch number two in your food, you can say you've got five grams of fiber.

138
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:09,590
You know, again, you don't have to specify whether or not fiber insoluble or it necessarily even that it's resistant starch number two.

139
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:15,139
But now it is. Right. And I honestly think this creates a ton of confusion for the whole right,

140
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:19,250
because now people used to think, oh, it has this like plant type substance, it's good for me.

141
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:24,080
But now they're like, Oh my God, it's got a Rabbitohs island. Is that what is that I can't even pronounce?

142
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,080
That is not even good for me. So that creates some application.

143
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,430
But this is why sometimes a target can become meaningless.

144
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,940
Not that these things don't have a benefit. Of course they all have some physiological benefit.

145
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:40,130
But by determining the people were deficient in fiber, people were then like, I should eat more fiber.

146
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:46,700
Food manufacturers then wanted to like make cookies that had lots of fiber in them and therefore they needed to put something in the cookies to say,

147
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:53,600
Hey, these cookies are actually good for you because they've got that right, which is the general cycle of the food industry over the past two years.

148
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,370
Does anybody have any questions about sort of how these definitions operate now?

149
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:05,870
So why add some new fiber that I'm working with and let's add some fruit pectin that I'm studying that I think is really relevant.

150
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,060
And I want to put it in the foods because I think it's really good for people because it makes, I don't know, detergent or something.

151
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,440
I would need to demonstrate that, right? I come from a plant and I need to demonstrate it's got some physiological.

152
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,540
But those are the two criteria to be useful.

153
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:25,999
And there's a committee that looks at this that decides whether or not it's met the bar of physiologic or but there's a lot of stuff.

154
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,639
So what I want you guys to do is spend a few minutes and I want you to kind of debate some of these questions I've been throwing out there.

155
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:38,660
Like, is like fiber really a carbohydrate and like, what the heck is a net carbohydrate and why am I including soluble and insoluble together?

156
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,860
And I want you guys to think like, how would you change food labeling if at all?

157
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,459
Maybe you like the way things are now. There's a there's a downside, right?

158
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:52,070
If you put too much information on the label, people are going to be like, I'm not going to read this like 45 page booklet that's hanging off my memo.

159
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:58,670
But on the other hand, are we providing the right information? And so those are the things I want you to sort of talk about and discuss.

160
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:03,110
And then you're going to have a group activities. You have to submit groups for testing, approve.

161
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,920
And then I want you to kind of come to some consensus. You have to answer all of these questions.

162
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,380
Just answer the questions that you think are the most sort of interesting or debatable or noncommittal.

163
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,600
And you're like, Everything's great. USDA is doing a great job. Good job, everybody.

164
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,970
High fives all around, keep you up with your stuff.

165
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:27,130
That's why I'm so excited about that. 10 minutes on that. I know this.

166
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:41,590
So we're talking about. Sure, because why don't you think about don't know what?

167
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,380
Three, four, six.

168
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:55,410
When? Now, where?

169
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,900
I want you. That's a good idea. This is a technique.

170
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:16,900
Years now, I suppose I just want to you to clarify whether or not I just got that.

171
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:25,940
You want something that you might like to add?

172
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:32,230
Yeah, I know.

173
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,740
I don't know.

174
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:49,370
It's not the kind of thing I've rehearsed, I think, especially in science.

175
00:15:50,740 --> 00:16:04,120
Like the whole family. Yeah, you see that?

176
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:24,910
Okay, so I can think of five by working conditions and I think if they don't,

177
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:52,690
are you going back and are you just going to actually never play like all the time and everybody's going to bring you diarrhea and signs saying like,

178
00:16:54,090 --> 00:17:00,270
I'm just making something like that.

179
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:08,590
Like, yeah, it was all the time that we have to make teams.

180
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:31,030
I, they had 16 years ago, I was like really cheap.

181
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:55,840
I haven't heard that it's, it's okay for them to handle that.

182
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,880
She has to be like that.

183
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:08,530
But I think that's where the regular she doesn't say much very different.

184
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:36,910
You're very biased because I mean that's not something that just like even people as far as like the vice president all the time.

185
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:49,050
So they typically do. Yes. I was just like, there's nothing watched.

186
00:18:49,060 --> 00:19:04,500
And she's like, oh, my God, it's not this one around.

187
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:18,580
Like like, what's the matter with you?

188
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,830
I guess you're saying move with the times.

189
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:39,830
Let's talk like things like, you know, like if you're probably 30 and 31 days, you have 15 grams of fiber one after another, like.

190
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:48,370
Yes, yes. I mean, it's getting famous.

191
00:19:49,440 --> 00:20:33,580
Oh, I was like, we have all these great costs and they don't like, yeah, these recommendations are going to come for all your diet and stuff,

192
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:48,760
but that, you know, you want to I mean, it's expensive because my dad used to say to me, if you're not going to do.

193
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:59,950
I guess so.

194
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:15,270
Presumably they should out more minutes on that here.

195
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:24,570
Yeah, me too. Yeah. I'm not going out of my mind.

196
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,280
And I have a green screen or something.

197
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,500
It's just an inside joke.

198
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:42,330
That's all I have to say.

199
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,620
Yeah, I think our whole record. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know why.

200
00:21:49,620 --> 00:22:24,209
It's by no surprise that I'd like to be doing, you know, this is going to be like,

201
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:33,360
90 minutes, and I'm like, okay, so we so we have a couple minutes of your time.

202
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,989
So does anybody sort of want to share what thing was interesting to their group

203
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:45,240
and sort of what they sort of settled on in terms of changes or not changes?

204
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:59,230
I guess I would just like generally talk about how they should be able to sit separately because like carbohydrates.

205
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,190
Well, that too.

206
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:08,259
But carbohydrates and fiber should be listed separately because I think generally people understand that carbohydrates are an energy source,

207
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,219
whereas like fibers digested by body.

208
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,970
So I think separating that would be important.

209
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:20,590
And then like separating sensible and insoluble because they have, again, functional differences.

210
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:25,290
Right. So yeah, so kind of in between the two things you said there.

211
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:32,079
Right. So it's quite common for people to manually calculate net carbohydrates, which is sort of like total carbohydrates minus fiber.

212
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,940
So effectively it's sugars and starches because if you're trying to limit the carbohydrates,

213
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,229
there's actually really no benefit of lemon in your fiber, although some people, when they're told limit their carbohydrates,

214
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:48,370
look at the label, and then they're like, oh, I shouldn't have this now at all or whatever,

215
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:53,080
because it's got a lot of fiber in it and therefore it's got a lot of carbohydrates. So I should avoid it would maybe that's not the point, right?

216
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,890
Maybe if it's something that's really high in fiber but low in starch, it's something that maybe women's.

217
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,790
So that can be confusing for people when we talk about how hard it is to.

218
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:07,360
They have something worse. Yes. So the second one is, what's the value of the collecting corpse?

219
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,120
It's important for those that are doing the counting.

220
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:18,709
For example, if they want to eat 30 grams of carbs, if we just can differentiate between the dietary fiber and the total,

221
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:24,410
perhaps it would be easier for that because we know that 85 is one month increase glucose levels, glucose levels.

222
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:29,210
So that's why it's important to differentiate between them. In fact, not only will it not increase, it will probably decrease it.

223
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:39,390
So it's actually helping antagonist. Yeah. We said that it would be good to show which fibers are added, which are not for things like fiber one bars,

224
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:44,780
because I think the general public probably use them better than they are because of the fiber content.

225
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,280
But if you could see that, they just put it in there to make a claim that you have different opinion.

226
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:55,390
So you're kind of taking maybe sort of the similar framing to sugars versus added sugars and is being like, we're adding this.

227
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:01,250
No, that's one good framing. And I think this group here added kind of another good thought about that, too, which is actually the thought here.

228
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:06,420
But like if you know, you have an intolerance to a particular type of fiber, it might help to know if it's a net food.

229
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,639
Right. And so not just labeling it as a general class of added fibers, but for example,

230
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,940
knowing that I have an intolerance to radicals, I need to know it's in my foods.

231
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,120
I think I'm going to guess the answer to this question.

232
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:24,320
But when you said that they don't have to say what fiber they're adding may still be in the ingredients, right?

233
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:33,380
So it's like that kind of like closing the gap of the knowledge, like, oh, added fiber and then knowing what potential added fibers would be to see.

234
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:39,670
Right. But I would argue that compared to a lot of ingredient based things, that's a really big ask to the normal consumer.

235
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,010
That's like, yeah, that's what I would.

236
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:46,250
So for example, like how many people before this week knew that a rabbit was silent and psyllium husk for effectively the same thing,

237
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:51,380
or that inulin and chicory root where you have like, no, you're not that to know that like,

238
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,590
oh, it might be called inulin and it might be called chicory root. And those are the same thing.

239
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,520
And that's the thing I got to look for out on the pack, because it doesn't just say like fermentable fiber.

240
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,599
Yeah, well, also people I mean, the whole trend now is like, oh,

241
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,100
if you can't pronounce it or whatever in the ingredients, you probably shouldn't be consuming it.

242
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:12,880
And I think that gives a false perception, especially with something that is like you don't have a biochemistry background,

243
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:18,280
like maybe maybe you just can't talk good. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

244
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,129
Like, I mean, I don't think anybody argues that we should be reducing the amount of actual pectin we eat.

245
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:26,450
And I'm sure there are people out there who can't pronounce all technology. Exactly. And we don't even know what it is.

246
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,360
Right. And they might see like, oh, my God, it's got a little pectin in it that way. Whereas they don't know that that's what started.

247
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:38,540
I think like with that, like it kind of like creates like positive but possible like negative stigma towards like added fiber,

248
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:45,259
like the way that like added sugars are like just like, I mean obviously like added fiber has more benefits than like added sugars.

249
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:49,069
So like saying like, oh, this is different, something is added, it's not good.

250
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:54,530
And like, same with like soluble versus insoluble. Like there's no like I for like the specific fibers,

251
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:59,509
like our people like supposed to like distinguish like, oh, should I have more soluble or insoluble?

252
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:03,140
Like when it's like a difficult question to answer that like USDA.

253
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:09,440
Right? So that's a good point. Right? So you want people to see added fiber and think of it as added sugar because there's

254
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,330
not compared to sugar the same health risks of consuming the fiber as opposed to,

255
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:19,870
you know, what it is, which is a very good point. And like you said, nobody even has a dry for soluble insoluble fiber.

256
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,710
So like for example, I have no idea how much of know.

257
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:29,080
It's like some portion of 38 grams per day, but like I don't know what that is and people really haven't done that to try to do anything to me,

258
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:33,890
even though again, I feel like soluble, insoluble fiber are almost as different to me as fibers are.

259
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,460
Carbohydrates in terms of what they do with their bodies are so fundamentally different in the way that our bodies and right.

260
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,810
You know, opens up another question of like, should we be adding sizes?

261
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:52,510
I don't know. I just like I did the vitamin for a function that made me think a lot about like, like material somewhere already.

262
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:57,830
It just seems like if people supposedly are deficient, even though we don't even know,

263
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:02,360
like what the necessary intake is like, you've got the adequate intake,

264
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:10,819
it just know it makes me think a lot of like what if we are just naturally consuming it and instead we're overproducing other things.

265
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:17,600
Yeah. So obviously there's a trend in food production where we take a perfectly good food that has got all the nutrients and then we're like,

266
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,960
Oh, we made a terrible mistake. And then we think and back then that person's supposed nutrients.

267
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:26,270
The flipside of that though, is we have a lot of extremely successful global food fortification programs which are doing

268
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:30,979
exactly that and that to reduce the burden of disease dramatically over the past 150 years.

269
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:35,180
Right. So, for example, very few people would get enough vitamin D if there wasn't vitamin D fortification, our foods.

270
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:42,590
Right. So there's some things that we want to have in our foods. And again, part of this is because these have been long known nutrients of concern.

271
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:46,910
But there is, you know, public health. People do want people eating more fiber now.

272
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:52,610
We want people eating more. Just inulin. Well, maybe not, but is that better than not eating fiber in general?

273
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:59,090
I know it's hard to say, right? Like is eating 28 grams if you're a woman of inulin per day worse than eating none.

274
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:03,280
I mean, people talk about what inulin as a minute, but like. That's a hard question to answer.

275
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,230
And some of those we don't even have data for. Right.

276
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:11,140
So I think part of it is just like, let's try to find as much ways that we can get fiber into our food supply in the way that,

277
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:15,880
you know, 50 years ago we were like, oh, we're trying to get rid of rickets. Let's get a lot of vitamin D into into our foods.

278
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:24,240
Okay. Cool. Right. That was great. So I have a couple of things that we're gonna go through, the classification, we're get to our food.

279
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:31,410
So there's a few different ways to classify fibers, of course. As a biochemist, I think most elegant way is like chemical structure.

280
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,749
But as you will very shortly learn,

281
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:38,309
that is actually going to turn out to be incredibly difficult because it turns out different classes of fiber don't

282
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:44,010
even have the same chemical structure as another way to think about it is in terms of solubility or viscosity.

283
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,230
So this is one major important property of fiber.

284
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:50,730
This affects the transit time and rate of withdrawal of food passes through your gastrointestinal tract.

285
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:55,950
So soluble fibers in principle could be fermentable biscuits or absorbent.

286
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:02,400
They don't have to be, but they could be any place where insoluble fibers are never any of the food, right?

287
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,690
They're never fermentable. They are never biscuits and they are never absorbed.

288
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:11,160
Right. Because they just sort of float separate in the water by the purpose of them being inside.

289
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,000
So there's no such thing as a fermentable insoluble fiber, insoluble fibers provide bulk talking.

290
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,860
Right? That's their primary. Right? So they're like a physical scaffold. And I thought you guys even are bacteria and on takeout, right?

291
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:28,350
So they go through us and they provide help for soluble fibers can be all of these other classifications.

292
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:32,790
The permanent ability is can be broken down by your microbiota.

293
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,870
That's how we would define it. Right. But who is microbiota? Your microbiota?

294
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,919
My microbiota. The average person's microbiome reports on a person's like microbiota.

295
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,610
Anyone's microbiota. Microbiota have different feeding preferences.

296
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:49,030
Right. So that may sound like in principle, it's easy to figure out whether something smells good,

297
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,260
but it might be preventable for some people, but not fermentable by others.

298
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:55,470
Right. Depending on what the thing is. But that's the definition of ferment ability.

299
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:02,400
Viscosity, obviously, is sort of how big it is still. It's transit time and digestion and the level of absorbing so talked about on the next slide.

300
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:07,019
So here's some examples of some things that are high versus low viscosity.

301
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:12,870
As I said, cellulose is almost always going to show up as the most causative movement, although.

302
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:17,700
Right, because it's an inside fiber glucans such as things in oats are going to be high viscosity.

303
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,849
Same with pectin. Those are largely in fruits and things like psyllium.

304
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:27,130
But you can tell it's high by sparsity because if you take the pure thing and you put it in water, what you'll see is it makes the water right.

305
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:33,440
If you ever had like Metamucil or better fiber and you just put it in water and then you let it sit for 5 minutes and you start to notice against it.

306
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:37,320
That's what we mean by viscosity. We already talked a little bit about permeability,

307
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:42,450
whether or not it has prebiotic potential agnostic to whether the bacteria is good for you or bad for you,

308
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:50,069
it is being fermented by something in your gut. And then the last thing is Absorbance and Absorbance could be things like ions, peptides and chillers,

309
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:55,320
and then to absorb colognes like calcium and iron and some things like especially.

310
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,000
So you can look at being can absorb lipids, right? Because they happen to be a little more hydrophobic structures.

311
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,100
They might sequester bile acids. Right. And so these are some ways to think about a fiber and we'll go through an activity at the

312
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:09,900
end where you try to categorize different types of fibers in based on these problems.

313
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:16,020
The goal of this class and subsequent classes here is for you to be able to think like, well,

314
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:20,549
under what conditions would it be beneficial for me to have a low fermentable fire or a

315
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:25,500
high fermentable or a fiber that absorbs a lot of calcium or a lot of biology or insight,

316
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,670
if I'm right, because the goal here is we start out with the definition of fiber,

317
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:35,790
but I want you all to be able to leave here being very proscriptive about the fiber like you person A who has condition x,

318
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,970
any fiber result and you're going to know how to pronounce that name of that time.

319
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,550
Right? So that's the that's the goal of this class to think about what the benefits are of different types and then be a little more directed.

320
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:49,530
And so you're not just saying eat more fiber, you're going to say, I think you need to eat more of this particular type of fiber,

321
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:55,680
which you can find in this particular type of maybe the actual food that exists as a matter of taste.

322
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:01,380
The first one that I'm going to talk about is a class of fibers called Glucans.

323
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:09,120
They are whole polymers of glucose, so you should be able to guess what fruit ends and glycans are going to be the actual soft.

324
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:14,100
There's a couple different types here that are made. One is cellulose, which we've talked about before.

325
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,280
That includes beta, one forming just cannot be broken down by our bodies.

326
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,800
Remember, apples is alpha one for what you do.

327
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:27,030
However, beta glucans are beta one three and you get you may think well that's a pretty similar one for one 3 to 1 carbon.

328
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:33,030
So totally insoluble. Sort of like the canonical insoluble fiber glucans.

329
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:37,260
Totally right. Right. So that one carbon difference makes all the difference in the world,

330
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:42,210
even though they're both for polymers of just glucose just derived in different things.

331
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:48,000
Here are some sort of natural sources of them. And again, that one bond has a big difference.

332
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,350
Lukather Fermentable Lou Anthracite cellulose is not fermentable.

333
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:57,960
Those is the major source when we think of Glucans in most of our diets, largely.

334
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,820
All right. So that's the canonical thing we say.

335
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:06,300
If you want more glucans elements, that is going to bring us to Maria who's going to tell us all about this.

336
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:13,730
I want you to talk to your friends and.

337
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,580
You know you want to. Yeah. Okay.

338
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:31,370
Let's do this. Okay. So I'm got to talk to you about Owens.

339
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,330
I know it sounds boring, but it's not. Bear with me. Okay.

340
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:39,890
We're going to start with taxonomy and forms. Talk a little bit about the history behind them.

341
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:46,160
Macronutrient profile and structure. I'll talk briefly about two major health claims and then I'll give you my recipe.

342
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:50,540
Okay. Taxonomy and forms so that.

343
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:59,720
Oh, it's reclassified under the genus now, which is an obscure Latin word with roots that means nourishment or to desire.

344
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:04,670
Didn't I say interesting? Yes. So in a sense, humor is the common old.

345
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,420
The one we encounter most often and most commonly around the world.

346
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,819
The reason to not use one type of read. All of that is more common where I'm from.

347
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,000
Greece, Turkey, Iran. Those areas.

348
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,440
So it belongs in the Grass family.

349
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:31,170
And that particular family that includes Oates, also includes other grains like wheat and barley have long grasses and some livestock grasses.

350
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:39,030
It is grown from wide and the annual production is 25 to 20 million.

351
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,429
That was for 2022 to 2021 with Canada being the top producer.

352
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:49,130
There used to be Russia that typically uses it for domestic consumption.

353
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:56,820
But in Canada. All right, so we have different forms of oats that are available.

354
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:03,110
I have started with the least processed. So the whole oats grows are.

355
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:09,240
What you get. So you have the old plant there to get the floor at.

356
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:13,520
And then when you remove the hole from the.

357
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,780
From the old grain. That's when you get the whole oat groats.

358
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:23,679
They are the ones that take the longest to cook and they are better in savory dishes.

359
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,680
They take 30 to 45 minutes cooking on a stove, top steel cut oats a little bit more processed,

360
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,910
but the least processed from what we typically encounter in the market.

361
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:41,530
They take 20 to 30 minutes. Basically, you take steel blades and you cut them three, four in three or four pieces.

362
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:46,300
Scottish rolls their stone ground, great for porridge, take 10 minutes.

363
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:54,669
World Oats, the most versatile form and the one that is most commonly encountered in the market where you have steaming.

364
00:36:54,670 --> 00:37:00,490
And then they go through some steel rollers and then you can determine the thickness of the product.

365
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,040
The more thick it is, the more chewy the texture is, the quick oats,

366
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:10,690
the version of rolled oats or old fashioned, as they're called, under a different name.

367
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:14,410
And they are on the thinner side of the rolled oats.

368
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:23,049
And sometimes they're chopped too, to make cooking faster, instant oats the most process.

369
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:30,820
Typically, the ones that come with with more added sugar and added salt as well, they are steamed.

370
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:35,960
They are typically now freeze dried, they're chopped in very small pieces.

371
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:43,370
And if you've noticed that oatmeal packets and a lot of powder comes out, they are very thinly prepared and they need the least amount of time.

372
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:51,730
In preparation you can just add some hot water. The oat bran is basically the outer layer of the whole grain oats.

373
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,379
It is used to add fiber to different foods.

374
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:06,670
The oat flour is used as a thickener, it's used in baby old cereal and so on, and it's basically whole old groats that are browns history.

375
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:22,240
Okay, so we have evidence of oats in the in the pasta like tool of the upper Paleolithic men.

376
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:29,260
And those were found in a cave called the ground up, at least in Italy.

377
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:34,720
And that was 32,000 years before present.

378
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:43,390
A really long time ago. It is that was in wild oats that they found then we have from the.

379
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:54,410
Neolithic era in a cave where you see there the above a drop that is also thought to be Sodom from Sodom and Gomorrah.

380
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,700
So they also actually found storage of bubbles there.

381
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:11,510
And then we have indications of the importance of oaths in human societies from like the 12th dynasty in Egypt where they had large storages for it.

382
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:23,330
The cultivation, the domestication of all this is more recent than that place, around 1000 B.C., which is later compared to other rings.

383
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:33,500
Okay. So you see the migrant micronutrient profile here, and this comes from the USDA food data.

384
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:39,200
I have used our legacy data. There were no foundation foods when I searched for oats.

385
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:47,330
But this is a really good quality data that has been used repeatedly for policy,

386
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:52,069
public policy decisions, for research, for a number of different places.

387
00:39:52,070 --> 00:40:00,980
And it's it's pretty thorough. There were 18,845 brand products, but I did not pay attention to those.

388
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:07,400
Okay. So in terms of protein content, it is on the higher side compared to other grains.

389
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:14,390
And it does have a more a better amino acid profile compared to other ones.

390
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:21,140
Total lipids, it is higher in polyunsaturated like acid.

391
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:33,710
Second is and when on saturated fat the oleic acid and then we have some saturated fats, we have folate and implement again resting.

392
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:38,210
And then the fiber is the most important component there.

393
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,230
It is an excellent source of fiber. You see here, 100 grams.

394
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:46,970
The typical serving is around half a cup, which is like 40 grams.

395
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:54,020
And then for fiber, it does have both side level and insoluble.

396
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,520
40, 60 is the rate there, the insoluble.

397
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:04,249
You have some lignans in there, the soluble, you have the beta glucan.

398
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,430
So we mentioned before and here is the structure.

399
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:12,350
I just brought this up to show you where the beta glucans are.

400
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:25,250
And then if you go back and look to the to the first slide where they had the forms, you can see how it changes the more we process the oats.

401
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:36,150
So manipulating the structure of the plant changes its content to okay conditions of interest.

402
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:41,070
Of course the the most. Oh, I forgot about micronutrients.

403
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,970
The micronutrient contents. It's also of interest here.

404
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:55,200
Eat. It is a good source of manganese. An excellent source actually, because it's more than 20% of the daily value.

405
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:03,810
It does have some phosphorus less bioavailable than other sources like Coke, copper and selenium, and it's a good source of iron.

406
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:10,080
We do have some guidance that comes with the absorption there, some folate, but not a significant source.

407
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:17,339
Okay. Going back to the health claims, the main ones are for cardiovascular diseases.

408
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,860
We did talk a little bit about the cholesterol lowering effects.

409
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:27,540
So that, of course, has been heavily examined by the scientific community type two diabetes mellitus.

410
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,930
Also, we did briefly touch on the glycemic response.

411
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,009
There are claims for obesity, cancer, two mycological conditions inflammation,

412
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:40,469
celiac disease and some other properties like helping with immune immuno modulation,

413
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:45,780
the fine tuning of the immune system, gut microbiome or alteration, but in a favorable way.

414
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:50,700
And then some identify the microbial action. Okay.

415
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:56,759
And this brings me to our study so I know how well you can see the infographic.

416
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:05,310
It used to be helpful to patients, but here we have a very big study that is actually very recent.

417
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:21,480
We had 74 randomized controlled trials and that included four 4937 people, mostly with high cholesterol, obese and with mild metabolic disturbances.

418
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:25,350
And this was a systematic review out of the 74,

419
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:37,830
59 were used for the meta analysis and what they found is four where we had old supplementation interventions,

420
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:46,080
they noticed improved levels of total cholesterol, LDL glucose, body mass index weight and waist circumference.

421
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:52,889
As I mentioned, there are some claims for inflammation and oxidative stress,

422
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:57,959
but they were not there wasn't enough information or enough studies out there

423
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:04,500
to make a claim when those also limitations the interventions were compared.

424
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:08,940
So a number of different studies with heterogeneous controls.

425
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:19,649
They did find that the people in the intervention group had lower a C glycated hemoglobin and a diastolic blood pressure,

426
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:25,770
HDL and upper level for a TV. There is, of course, some risk of bias here.

427
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:31,860
So here you see the results of the terms of the study, the Met analysis.

428
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:40,320
In the first one, you see the results comparing on supplementation with dietary restriction versus just the same dietary restrictions.

429
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:46,229
You see significant changes for total cholesterol, BMI, LDL, HDL.

430
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:53,730
And one thing and then for the second graph, you see comparison,

431
00:44:54,090 --> 00:45:01,139
obesity is again of all supplementation intervention versus that huge, heterogeneous group that I mentioned.

432
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:06,840
So different kinds of individuals there. Again, changes in BMI were significant total cholesterol.

433
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:11,730
Triglycerides also have obesity. Okay.

434
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:25,200
So here we have in this study, we had a trial compare of the population with circulating type two diabetes patients middle aged,

435
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,600
overweight and treated with on diet, hyper glycemic medications or insulin.

436
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:42,540
The median dose for Bharat Glucan was 3.25 grams and the median duration of the interventions were four and a half weeks.

437
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:52,919
So they noticed improved at one C fasting glucose to our postprandial blood sugar and insulin insulin response.

438
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,230
Basically they did not find significant changes in fasting insulin.

439
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:11,640
Kerry, the last sighting that I have for you today, and I've started taking advice from stronger evidence to less strong designs.

440
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:21,240
But here we had we had 16 studies and then 14 of them.

441
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:27,410
Yes, 14 were controlled trials and two were uncontrolled observational studies.

442
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:34,280
They found a moderately beneficial effect of oats on glycemic control,

443
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:39,830
including glucose and insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles for patients with type two diabetes.

444
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,590
And here we see the outcomes of that.

445
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:52,489
The first one is the A1 C and the second is the fasting, which are very commonly measured in these studies.

446
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:57,260
So very, very consistently small positive changes there.

447
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:00,979
Okay. And here's my recipe, which is the important part. Now you're waking up.

448
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:07,220
I can see it. Okay. So half cup of water, half a cup of banana, all the walk and half a cup of rowboats.

449
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:12,800
You put them in a bowl, you microwave them for two, two and a half minutes or whatever the package says.

450
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:19,600
And then you remove them and you add in chocolate chips, coconut flakes, chocolate tastes,

451
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:25,420
toasted hazelnuts, half for one couple experience raspberries, blackberries and banana slices.

452
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:35,210
And you enjoy it, and that's it. Questions for me.

453
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:43,549
I have one and I might have missed it, so I apologize if I did.

454
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:53,390
But for that I would say that you did that. MODERATOR You break down for was that just like from the field or was that one of the ones that you had?

455
00:47:53,600 --> 00:48:01,880
That's a very good question. So that the food that I chose was old includes foods for USDA food distribution program.

456
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:07,760
So that was the product that I chose because from a public health perspective, it had importance for me.

457
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:14,160
So it. Questions.

458
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:20,830
Are you sure? Guys.

459
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:42,060
So I'm actually just going to go back to the slides here to point out something that I think is actually pretty relevant.

460
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:46,030
So if you look here, I was talking about oats, this a major source of pain.

461
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:48,070
And that's that is our primary source of pain.

462
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:57,999
But you'll notice part of the of the growth here includes things on the cell wall and that includes things like cellulose and and other things here,

463
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,020
including rather than fiber that it.

464
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:08,109
Right. Well, okay. Which is the reason I'm saying that is because that is the next one that I'm going to talk about.

465
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:20,500
So Rabbitohs Island is another class of fibers that are called hemi cellulose and so this is their chemical structure,

466
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:24,190
they are generally heterogeneous and then branched.

467
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:31,240
A key point here being branched if you will. Also the primary glucans, beta glucan and cellulose were not groups that were linear chains.

468
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:35,049
These are branch and that thing again may seem like somewhat of a minor.

469
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:41,740
One patient actually in general makes most common cellulose is extremely water soluble and extremely fermented.

470
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:47,679
1.3 And so one of the common examples here would be around was island, which is the active ingredient.

471
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:54,790
So was so its actual structure here is hollies Iowa's so what's going on up here is Iowa, which is maybe a sugar that you're not familiar with.

472
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:59,649
It's got these chains and then it's got the occasional linkages to around us here.

473
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:04,450
Right. So it's it's as I close with occasional branch points here.

474
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:08,590
So that is one example of a branched fiber.

475
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:12,340
Another example here is Glucomannan, which is found in a lot of different root vegetables.

476
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:19,530
It contains structures of mannose and glucose, generally in alternating form with the occasional again branched point.

477
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:25,000
So the key thing with cellulose is, is they're branch and that branching is going to mean that they can't pack as tightly.

478
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,760
That lack of packing is going to make them more water soluble.

479
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:33,010
That's going to make them more available to bacteria to be fermentable and potentially more so.

480
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:34,809
That's what heavy soils are.

481
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:40,270
Now, these have a whole variety of different functions, of course, depending on the monomeric structure and where the branch points are.

482
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:48,880
Okay, the next one, next two groups I want to talk about. So the first group, all glucose, good parts, these ones, all fructose ruminants.

483
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:54,309
Right? So this should be really pretty easy to remember. There's two main fruit tams that we consume.

484
00:50:54,310 --> 00:51:01,930
One is Inulin, which I mentioned about two times. That is a21 poly fructose, but it always terminates with a glucose, right?

485
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:05,820
So that's got like thousands and thousands and thousands of doses and then one glucose, right.

486
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:14,500
And that might affect its ability to be, I guess it called beta two one linkages, which is a linkage we've never heard about or never talked about.

487
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:21,020
But again, you should be able to kind of think about how those were. LEMON Which is another illegal fructose is the same thing.

488
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:23,270
But now the Polish who wanted to say something.

489
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:29,090
Generally, fruit heads are extremely fermented, very, very, very fermentable, and they're generally highly absorbent.

490
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:34,129
So that means things tend to stick to from cans or whatever. And they are very, very common.

491
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:37,880
And things like chicory root, which is the main source of inulin, onions,

492
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:43,940
Jerusalem, artichokes, asparagus, agave and Hippocrates, and that is potassium.

493
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:51,740
So for cans generally, almost all for except for that one last glucose rating, on the other hand, are glycans.

494
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:56,120
Forget that these are real glycans lots and lots of poly galactose.

495
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:00,110
It could be out to one threes or off one sixth. That of course affects the properties of it.

496
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:04,069
Again, just like the beta glucans, just like the fruit tends very soluble,

497
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:09,760
generally pretty fermentable needs to be found in things like chickpeas, broccoli, lentils, kidneys and soy products, right?

498
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,060
So there's a lot of different things. You see.

499
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:15,110
There's a lot of lack of overlap of these things too, where different foods have different versions of these.

500
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:21,290
And again, for all of these fermentable structures, you can imagine a particular bacteria really liking that particular structure.

501
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:28,010
It happens to have some enzyme that is really good at cleaving off Alpha one six linkage of a two probably loose.

502
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:34,040
Okay. So those are the ones that the structure of are are reasonably well known and relatively straightforward.

503
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,910
The next group becomes even more complicated and I'm going to be showing you the structure.

504
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:42,020
These are the gods. So these are always heterogeneous and they are always arranged.

505
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:48,229
Items are now the property companies. They tend to have this more physical sticky property and they tend to be the

506
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:51,890
things that were extracted as things that have physical sticking properties.

507
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:55,590
So you'll notice almost all of these are coming from generally root things.

508
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:59,419
So like gum Arabic also in case you got them gum, pride, guar gum.

509
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:03,920
These are all things that were extracted from some plant and some like gelatin, like substance.

510
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,450
Now originally these were usually included as additive to the food.

511
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:11,749
So you want your food to have a little more of a jelly like structure, maybe a little more creamy structure.

512
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,570
You add one of these to it. So it's more of a textural thing.

513
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:19,129
But of course, as we talked about at the very beginning, because they have these properties of being fermentable,

514
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:23,450
sometimes really water soluble, they can have beneficial physiological properties.

515
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:28,610
So you may not think that guar gum is even a fiber, and that might be the kind of thing that is in your ice cream.

516
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:34,550
But guess what? Your ice cream now has fiber in it because Markham has a physiologic property and it is derived from a plant.

517
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:40,159
And these are most commonly found is additives generally in things like cough, sirup, soda, granola bars, chewing gum and ice cream.

518
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,400
Right. So if you ever see high fiber ice cream, take a photo of it. I'd like to see that.

519
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,760
But in theory, anybody selling ice cream involves ice creams on guar gum in it.

520
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:50,810
They could advertise as a high fiber food. Remember, this is a different type thing.

521
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:55,940
So just to kind of show what I mean by the structures, the structures of these gums are pretty diverse.

522
00:53:56,210 --> 00:54:05,400
So guar gum, for example, is over here. It's Glucomannan, which is mostly Mentos with galactose chemical, also known as Gum Arabic looks like this.

523
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,340
So it's a rabbit of lactose free radicals with a lactose attached to it.

524
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:16,460
And then Gum Korea, which is shown over here, is unlike any other pronouncing that what you can drink from no galactose.

525
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:24,559
And so again like for urine with multiple branches it so there's no real consistency here they tend to be a little bit less soluble.

526
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:30,440
They send a form like a gum, like substance. But again, they kind of provide structure, they're fermentable and they're somewhat pliable.

527
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:35,570
And again, coconut milk almost always has gum Arabic added to it because it adds to the texture.

528
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:40,340
Normally, if you just have most nut milks, just plain novelty, you just grind apartments in it.

529
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:47,030
So you'll notice it's very, very watery tasting. So they add this as an additive to make you think that it's got more of the milk feel like milk.

530
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:52,790
And again, they don't advertise it, I don't think in this case. But this so delicious could certainly argue that they are depending on how

531
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:56,159
much gum Arabic has added a fiber source for you because again it's optional.

532
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:00,340
But. All right. So life class here are a class called Texans.

533
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,209
They're generally found in fruits and jellies. They are extremely water soluble.

534
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:07,300
All of them are extremely water soluble and they are extremely fermentable.

535
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:14,379
Right. So they have all of all of these because of that, they are very common in internal nutrition formulas because they are really,

536
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:18,610
really good at supplying a lot of prebiotics to your to your bacteria.

537
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:23,410
The natural sources tend to be sweet, sweet fruits, apples, strawberries, citrus fruits.

538
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:30,550
And they are generally included as an additive for that same sort of jelly like substance in things like jams, proteins and of course, fruit.

539
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:37,810
So you didn't think of your roles for a fiber source? It turns out they are right, so everything turns out to be nice.

540
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:44,319
So we've covered a lot of these. I guess what I want to maybe highlight about these is please don't try to memorize these.

541
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:48,330
And for God's sake, please do not try to draw or memorize 2 to 2 memory.

542
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:53,050
What the structure. Design. I want you to know the rough classes and roughly where you can find them.

543
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:58,900
Right. But I do not want you to remember the actual chemical images. I know you should probably all appreciate that if it's a fiber and a chemical

544
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:02,950
linkage that is not broken by of amylase or any of our disaccharides written ones.

545
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:11,140
Right. So that property you should know and I want you to know the general properties of it, is it fermentable, is it soluble, is it is it biscuits?

546
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:15,340
But that you don't need to know the details and you don't need to memorize any of the names of these.

547
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:20,500
So just the classifications we talked about. Question on the galactic flag and galactose,

548
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:27,819
I think no products if you have a lactose intolerance cause you're not breaking down the glucose in the galactose.

549
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:33,729
Is it a good chance then that you are also like, Oh, hey, I probably shouldn't eat chickpeas, broccoli and a bunch of other things I know.

550
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:40,080
So that's actually that's a really, really good question. So the reason that's a good question is, remember, lactose is glucose and lactose, right?

551
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:44,560
That particular linkage is the thing we can't break with our lack of lack of lactase.

552
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:51,360
That's the problem there. But there is no linkages that look like a lactose linkage in here.

553
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:59,649
Right. So it's completely unrelated. So whereas 60% of the population can operate on lactose, 0% of population breakdown of like none of the samples,

554
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:03,270
and therefore they're always going to end up in larger questions.

555
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,700
Then maybe getting somebody has some representation. But it's incredibly.

556
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:12,130
You're talking about heavy cellulose, as you were talking about, like the lack of caffeine.

557
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:16,360
I missed what you said. Could you? Yeah, because there are always branch.

558
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:19,600
So imagine something like cellulose is a long, linear chain.

559
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:23,110
You could pack a lot of those chains together. That's why they're not site, right?

560
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:25,960
So they form these long, tangled fibers that are not them.

561
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:30,250
But as soon as you start putting, like, branch points in that chain, now they don't pack this type.

562
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:33,459
Right. So this packs well, this does not pack. Right.

563
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:39,700
And that lack of packing is what makes it water soluble, because the water can kind of get in here but also makes it accessible to the bacteria.

564
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:45,100
Okay. And that's true for pectin and and some of the gum.

565
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:49,239
And there's some overlap here. You might hear like all the silver listed here.

566
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,570
Is this having cellulose? They're not perfect definitions here.

567
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:57,340
They're not perfect regions. Okay.

568
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:03,370
So this is the last part about maps. So these are the Fermentable and oligosaccharides groups that we've talked about here.

569
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:08,860
So fruit dancing glycans tend to be the things that are the most commonly associated with

570
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:17,050
fodmap intolerance also and scales which are short for three or four or five oligomer lines.

571
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:24,190
So this is now a summary of all the things that we've sort of talked about and which ones fall into the potential fodmap class.

572
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:31,930
So disaccharides, the DNA fodmap is disaccharides. Lactose is the only one that falls in there generally, although this may be changing now.

573
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:36,250
Sucrose and molecules are not considered as part of our at risk group or difference.

574
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:39,820
On the other hand, for monosaccharides, even though the classification is monosaccharides,

575
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:42,400
almost always the monosaccharides we're talking about here is fructose.

576
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:47,140
Because as we talked about, last class, fructose is generally absorbed by the majority of people.

577
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:52,720
Polyols It's all. Polyols There's no non no not problematic polymers generally.

578
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:56,680
Polyols have the same thing. And here are some of the sources where some of these things can be found.

579
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:02,440
Of course, this is not a complete list. If you just Google Fodmaps, you can get a long list of all the things that you would have to eliminate.

580
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:07,630
But you can see this involves quite a large number of foods that you may enjoy on a daily basis.

581
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:12,520
So we've talked about this a little bit already, but just kind of be a little more rigorous of what goes on here.

582
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:18,050
The Fodmap elimination texture basically involves a standardization where if

583
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:21,100
there's a four week removal and then you introduce things over three days,

584
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:27,310
check the symptomology, wash out for 3 to 5 days, add another class of foods, check for symptomology, and then go back.

585
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,300
You keep repeating that with different groups of foods. So you might say, All right,

586
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:38,350
I'm going to completely eliminate all of these for some period of time and I'm going to slowly add those back to my diet and see how I respond.

587
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:43,600
Right now, you've learned a little bit more about this. You might say, oh, well, now I might even want to be more specific.

588
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,860
Which of these have fructans? Which of these are black? Right.

589
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:50,230
Because you can be a little more narrow in terms of the which of these are called tolerable for not.

590
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:55,090
But again, depending on what you use, depending on what you know about these things, you can.

591
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:03,400
Now, fodmap elimination diets are generally pretty effective and they're for most dietitians now the sort of front line treatment for IBS right now,

592
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:08,430
of course, this involves a lot of foods. Again, as I said, my class from the world is lactose intolerance.

593
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,220
It is my lactose. It's all the problems. It's like sort of cheating at Yale.

594
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:18,700
But this is a meta analysis showing a bunch of different archetypes where they did fodmap elimination diets versus general dietary advice.

595
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:24,160
You can see in almost every case except for two, there was some beneficial effect on IBS severity.

596
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,540
And this is true both IDSA and IBS and on ESD.

597
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:32,290
Right? So all three forms of our ideas are generally alleviated somewhat by fodmaps.

598
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:37,630
And as we talked about last class, there are a lot of limitations because as you get rid of these fermentable oligosaccharides,

599
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:41,120
by definition you're going to have a reduction of microbial diversity, right?

600
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:46,000
Having a diverse set of foods for your bacteria allows you to have a diverse set of bacteria.

601
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:51,520
Right? So as soon as you start cutting out the fructans, all the bacteria that like the front end, are not going to be able to survive better.

602
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:54,340
So it can reduce microbial diversity.

603
01:00:54,550 --> 01:01:00,910
It can be hard to adhere to if you go to all those foods for a long time, and as was mentioned, last class can cause nutrient deficiencies,

604
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:04,660
especially around things like fiber, because many of these fibers,

605
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:08,290
if you cut out anything that has fiber, you're going to exacerbate deficiencies in fiber.

606
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:15,030
Calcium, protein and potassium are largely because of cutting out milk if you have to kind of milk and then the other vitamins are in there.

607
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:22,570
Another issue potentially, although this hasn't been as well documented for people who are on board, my diet is very suddenly now.

608
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:25,810
People are paying a lot more attention to the exact foods there.

609
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:30,100
Now, for most people that might be okay, but that can be pathological for some people, right?

610
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:34,389
It can cause regression, which is the condition over thinking about your food and being like, Oh my God,

611
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:38,260
I've got to Google this thing to figure out if it's got this thing and I'm really stressed out about it.

612
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:42,370
It would be it would have been a problem or in extreme cases, arfid, which is a type of eating disorder.

613
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:45,210
It stands for avoiding restricted food intake disorder. Right.

614
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:50,500
So could cause you to just be like, I'm afraid of food, so I'm going to avoid eating pretty much everything I'm telling them, right?

615
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:54,750
So those are two things that have to be really, really carefully monitored when somebody is on about restrictive.

616
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:59,950
And again, the idea is to find the narrowest set of foods that can be eliminated so that

617
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:02,979
you're only eliminating those depending foods for as long as you need to.

618
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:06,510
And everything else can come back if you do not want to ever recommend it.

619
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:10,890
Because I'm a long term fodmap restricted. Okay.

620
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:17,610
So I mentioned this really briefly in in the notes, but there's a lot of health benefits generally for fire.

621
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:24,720
And as I said about 45 minutes ago. One of the things I want you to be able to think through is these are all going to be the same of that.

622
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:31,860
Right. So if you have an immune system problem, maybe what the solution is is changing your gut microbiota to sort of retune your immune system.

623
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:38,760
If you're at high colorectal cancer risk, you may want to think about things that are going to cause inflammation in your in your gut.

624
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:44,550
However, if you're suffering from constipation, you'd have a different strategy. If you're looking for glucose control, you might have something else.

625
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:51,420
So I'll just give you one example of how a thought process you might go through for selecting a particular fiber or a particular condition.

626
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:58,590
So one of the most demonstrable effects of people having a high fiber is hyperlipidemia or reductions in LDL cholesterol.

627
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:02,610
LDL cholesterol is, of course, the biggest risk factor from cardiovascular disease.

628
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:06,389
Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death in most Western societies.

629
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:10,390
Rachel, any reduction you can have in cardiovascular disease is good for your public health.

630
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:15,210
And again, there's lots and lots and lots of data that fiber can reduce cardiovascular case.

631
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:23,309
In fact, that all as I said in the beginning, adequate intake was set by how effectively astrophysics now was able to pick a fight over this.

632
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:27,540
This is what I would want first. Obviously, I want a fiber that is soil, right?

633
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:30,870
Because I needed to interact with things in the aqueous environment.

634
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:38,160
Right. So cellulose is soils is not going to help you. All right. I also want it to be something that can stick to my results.

635
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:44,790
I'll sort of derived from cluster, so secrete bile salts into your gut and they stick to this fiber and then I poop it out.

636
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,420
I've just gotten rid of a bunch of that cholesterol. Right.

637
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:51,570
And that's actually a major strategy for reduction of cholesterol is called bile salt sequestration.

638
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:57,450
So I want something that's adherent to miles, maybe even to cholesterol, although most of the cholesterol isn't all about salt.

639
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:01,680
And now here's a question for you. Do I want it to be fermentable or not?

640
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:14,920
You know, when it's four months full than like the bacterial metabolism for ten years.

641
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:18,660
Right. So I just built this amazing like net to catch all this bile salt.

642
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:23,850
If it's fermented, it's just going to, like, release all the body's cells back. So I specifically want something that is soluble,

643
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:29,910
adsorbed to bile salts and non fermented right now would be the ideal source that I want for colostrum

644
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:34,190
right now that if you're going through this for something else like weight control or hypoglycemia,

645
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,680
you might have a different lot. But that's the logic I would go through for cholesterol.

646
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:41,370
Right. And it turns out the most canonical example of this is a rhino's eli,

647
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:45,400
which is a silly moss extract which you guys ranked in like the 18 best food and 40.

648
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:51,029
It was like I think slightly above pizza, but it is the most demonstrable fiber for reducing lipids.

649
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:59,010
And because it has all the properties, it is very different from bile salts, it is extremely non preventable and it is soluble so I can get to my gut.

650
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:05,460
So it just sucks up those bile salt and excreted it. So that is why that particular fiber works very, very well.

651
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:09,270
So I'm not going to. Yeah. Can you repeat the source of the fiber yourself.

652
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:13,890
It really. Oh. Psyllium husk around the mouth. That's the thing that's in Metamucil.

653
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:19,259
It's the same I don't know what better fiber is the only kind of fibers around them.

654
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:24,870
So maybe something that I don't know quite I do to the day psyllium husk on Monday.

655
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:28,990
So we hear a lot of herbal supplements. I feel like we're going maybe need to report psyllium.

656
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:37,700
Yeah so what I want you all to do and you don't do this now, but this might be the kind of thing I might ask on a short answer question on a midterm.

01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:43,050
I coming up in five weeks, for example, would be if you were to pick a fiber that would be exceptionally good for diabetes management.

658
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:48,029
What would be the properties of that kind of fiber somebody came to you were like, I have a low fiber intake.

659
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:51,479
I am concerned about diabetes or had diabetes. What kind of fibers would work?

660
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,780
Well, for me, right. And ideally, you can kind of go through some of these properties and be like,

661
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:57,389
here are the kinds of things that might work well for diabetes management.

662
01:05:57,390 --> 01:06:01,630
And if you're really good, maybe you'd be like, here's a food that has a bunch of that stuff that you could actually have.

663
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:07,209
Okay. So. So that's all I have for now. The last activity which I have.

664
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:15,960
And again, we'll sort of stop here. You can either do this here by yourself or in your groups or do later in the weekend is sort of this fiber matrix.

665
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:20,530
So here's a bunch of different fibers that I have talked about and here's a bunch of different properties across the spectrum.

666
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:22,690
So I think this, if you could fill out this table,

667
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:28,000
might be a helpful study tool to sort of organized all the different things you've learned about all of these different types of fibers.

668
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:29,050
And to be clear,

669
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:35,220
there's not going to be those black or white answers to all some of these blocks is going to be like kind of the right kinds of the apples,

670
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:40,250
because this is sort of last activity. And then the last few slides are just sort of people.

671
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:47,140
Sugars and fiber has microcrystalline cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose.

672
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:55,010
Interesting. So it would be entirely insoluble because NFIB would actually presumptively not hold cholesterol results.

673
01:06:55,310 --> 01:07:00,810
I don't know. I just think about environmental means. So we're like roughly or about, okay, great.

674
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:17,480
So like I said, I'll hang around here in case you guys have any questions and otherwise, I'll see you guys on Monday Night Football next weekend.

675
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:20,130
Yeah, yeah. That's fun to have.
