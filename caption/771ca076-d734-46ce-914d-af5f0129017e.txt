1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:14,700
Okay. Welcome back. Today is the last day of the last second part of the last topic.

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,510
Right. So and then next week,

3
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,850
we will go over the exam together and you will be able to kind of like start the exam here so

4
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,629
that you have questions and then it will be a take home that will be due the following week.

5
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,380
And then last week we don't have class. Okay.

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:46,860
So, so it's been a while. I hope you had a great Thanksgiving and it looks like it was years that we were going to like on this topic.

7
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,430
And I remember we were talking about principal component analysis to evaluate dietary patterns

8
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:00,000
and I'll I'll kind of layer review with you again quickly all the steps when we go into the lab.

9
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,370
But first, I'm going to kind of like finish there and then the lecture part.

10
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:14,430
So, so some of the limitations of BCA and and the reasons why it kind of like it's been criticized

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,350
a lot in the literature is that it involves a lot of subjectivity and arbitrary decisions.

12
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,780
So there are many aspects in which kind of like it's not really like, you know,

13
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,709
one or the other thing that is very clear cut of what you have to decide.

14
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:41,190
Right? So, so there are many steps in which you I mean, whatever decision you make may have kind of like implications for the analysis right now,

15
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,440
for example, collapse in there and two food groups.

16
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,610
Remember I told you that depending on how you group those foods, you may get one thing or the other.

17
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,360
And I told you to pay attention, but degradation when you are working in populations that are in nutrition transition because

18
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:05,220
you put together groups that belong to kind of like different nutrition decision partners,

19
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:13,290
even though they may belong to the same kind of like, you know, food group.

20
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,040
That makes sense in terms of collaborations.

21
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:24,570
If you put them together, then you are not going to be able to disentangle those kind of like neo traditional from more modern nice patterns, right?

22
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,739
So, so collapsing did it. And the food groups have it's an important esthetic in which you have to to pay

23
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,680
attention because because it may have implications for the rest of the analysis.

24
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,410
Then you already had a flavor of what happened with a number of factors to start.

25
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,139
You have some guidelines. Definitely.

26
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:56,310
So you know that I mean, the first thing for sure is that anything with one below one eigenvalue is not worth to retain.

27
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,650
But that's not really a good rule because I mean, you know that you have many, many above.

28
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,000
One is still and you the one really to be retained, in fact, of 12.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,190
Right. I mean, that's not the purpose. I mean, you don't do this to come up with so many summary of what it was.

30
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:18,180
You really want to come up with this a few, right? So that the first rule is more like yeah, it's more like a scenic one,

31
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:22,590
but kind of like isn't is very I mean the thought about it is not really helping you a lot.

32
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,600
Then the second rule, which is a very explained variability,

33
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,910
is kind of like usually you look at the scribbled and remember I told you that

34
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:40,230
it's called grade level because in theory if you do something like this,

35
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,180
right, so it means that maybe you have one here, one here,

36
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:55,050
but here for a guy from in the list that this right so then a very clear breaking point where you say okay I'm going to write this

37
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:06,540
post for the rest and remember that this is that these these are all of the part of the papers and this is the the eigenvalue.

38
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:15,620
Okay. Talk to me and know that I have to live with this.

39
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:25,490
Okay. So so maybe has it higher here than behind the barrier that is explaining that you really want to retain factors,

40
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,600
explain a lot of the Miami and other desires. Right.

41
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:35,380
So you want to read in the first ones, right. And the idea is that with this script, you are looking for a breaking point.

42
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:43,779
So then after I kind of like something like that, then you don't want to read these because they are not I mean, they, they violated their opinion.

43
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,310
It is very little. But the problem is that things are usually not that clear.

44
00:04:48,640 --> 00:05:00,790
And you probably remember that, that we we see things more like this that so we have instead of like a period breaking point most of the times.

45
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,060
Well, what about this? Like the school and the legal exam, right?

46
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:10,360
So when you have this situation is difficult to say. Shoot, I read here today that he had a shooting day there.

47
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,589
Right. So so that's, again, subjectivity.

48
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,180
And I think that in this issue, rightly so, here or there.

49
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:26,649
So then in the end, what happened is that you end up retaining the fact of them make more sense also.

50
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:33,969
Right. And even though that's that's an important kind of like I mean, you definitely need interpretability because otherwise I mean,

51
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:39,640
there's no I mean, there's no point in reading and after that doesn't make any sense.

52
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:46,780
Right. Because you have to splain what it means. Right. But also, it's kind of like subjective and arbitrary.

53
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:53,259
Right. Because sentence I mean, the interpretation is going to let you depends on the person who's interpreting by some some people

54
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,339
may see patterns where there are no really clear patterns and some and the other way around.

55
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,180
Some people you don't really know a lot about the study population.

56
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:08,230
You may kind of like miss an important things about the diet of the population and you may feel like, Oh, this pattern doesn't make any sense.

57
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,959
And other person may come and say No.

58
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,050
I mean, because look at these foods that are actually and then are part of the culture for whatever reason, right?

59
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:21,190
So so again, that's another kind of like arbitrary decision.

60
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:32,139
Also the rotation method, actually, and this is the one I'm going to display here is also way arbitrary.

61
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:45,310
So there are we most of the dietary patterns that you will see in the literature that when people use BCA, they always will say not always,

62
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:52,000
but most of the times, like 99% of the times they use the body mass rotation because it's an hour or so on a rotation.

63
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,650
And then that way you kind of like give the independence of the factors, right?

64
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,330
So they remember that the factors are built, build independent so they are not correlated with each other,

65
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,600
which is a nice characteristic in the sense that they then they want to confound each other.

66
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,430
Right, because they are not going to reduce each other.

67
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,860
But on the other hand, some people argue that it would be better to have other types of rotation,

68
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,860
like an oblique rotation that will allow for some correlation.

69
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,569
Because, I mean, why why do the borders need to be uncorrelated?

70
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,719
I mean, there's not really something that has to be like that.

71
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:35,080
But I don't I guess people use the body mass rotation because that's what most people are using and looks like a reasonably approach,

72
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,240
but it's not the only one. Right. So again, this is another suggested kind of like selection.

73
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:49,030
And finally, I mean, this is not really subjectivity, but it's kind of like the way that people name the patterns is very, very salad.

74
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:56,530
Right. So that based on how people interpret them, right. So then you find things that more or less resembling the same goal, different ways, right?

75
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:02,499
When you have the typical healthy, bland base veggie burger, I mean,

76
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:11,050
people call it healthy the nutrition conscious American healthy if it's done in the U.S. so you can find many names, right?

77
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:21,160
So sometimes when it relates to and people sometimes focus on the based on their healthiness right here,

78
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,809
sometimes you focus on the names based on regions.

79
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:34,180
So kind of like certain time period, like for example, an additional locally made cosmopolitan and or Spanish, Mediterranean or whatever.

80
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:41,050
So then it's kind of like, I mean, you will find tons and tons of patterns that maybe in a way similar in terms of health,

81
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:46,680
but kind of like they they are different because they, they have different foods that belong to that region.

82
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:56,700
And sometimes people decide to call the patterns based on the kind of like the nutrients that those that parties are going to contribute morally.

83
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:01,420
Right. So then sometimes they are called like high fat or Miami Rich or whatever.

84
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,940
So then you go to the scientific literature and you will see, I mean, all sorts of names.

85
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:14,259
So there's not really kind of like consensus. So somehow you how you need to name about them, you can come up with your own, which is okay.

86
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,500
But at the same time, I mean, makes kind of like comparability difficult, right?

87
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,440
Between between different study populations.

88
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,569
So anyway, because of all these issues, because of all those issues,

89
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:35,290
in terms of the limitations of the sensitivity, it's always good to do a sensitivity analysis.

90
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:46,960
And do you know what it says in sensitivity analysis? Now, you have never heard that what sensitivity analysis is not a specific analysis.

91
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:56,050
So it's just making sure that if you analyze the data in different ways, kind of like taking into account, for example,

92
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,709
different ways of grouping the food or taking into account different ways of adjusting for total energy

93
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:08,350
intake or taking into account different rotation methods or taking into account different number of factors.

94
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:16,270
When you do the analysis, your results, you're expecting that they are going to be robust, that they are not kind of that different.

95
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:24,070
Right. Because if by changing something, the results are completely different, then you start feeling a little, you know, insecure about your data.

96
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:30,210
Right? Because it means that just changing something, you get different results and different conclusions.

97
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,800
I mean, that means that the data is not very solid. Right.

98
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:42,920
So so that's why I mean, this is not only for PCR, this is for any analysis that you want to do in life is good to do sensitivity analysis,

99
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,930
some types of sensitivity analysis that people do. Is that okay?

100
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,690
I did my analysis in the whole study population,

101
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:57,180
but I believe that some people with certain criteria like for example, some disease or whatever may be biasing.

102
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:06,340
So I'm now I'm going to seclude them right until you exclude them and you still get the same result or very similar in the other population,

103
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,940
then you feel more comfortable that, well, it doesn't matter if I put them or not.

104
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:20,440
Right? So I've seen this is biasing, right? So sensitivity analysis is just a way of trying the analysis in very different angles and seeing that,

105
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,010
well, it doesn't matter what I do, my results are more or less robust.

106
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:30,850
Okay. So for PCR, that's very important, particularly for the number of factors that you want to stress, right?

107
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:38,290
Because it's not that clear many times that you should stomach two or three or four or five.

108
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:42,730
Right. And also they the brutality sometimes can be a little tricky also.

109
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:54,429
So then is good for you to do this. So like you look at the first eight factors and you feel like the the a seven and six doesn't make any

110
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:01,780
sense that 54 I mean I will be between two and four then I will kind of like encourage you to okay,

111
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:10,210
let's do two first or three some smarter than two and then four, right and right, two, three and four and see how things change.

112
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,860
These are going to change, right? But that's going to help you to kind of like decide like, oh,

113
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:21,500
it looks like when I've written three these the parts are more clear than one are within only two or the other way around.

114
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,200
Right. So, so this is what we are going to do today, right in the lab.

115
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:34,420
The last time we were, you had to decide how many photos you wanted to retain, and that's up to you.

116
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:40,390
You can decide whatever you want as long as you justified from kind of like the criteria we have, it's okay.

117
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:47,850
And then in the in the last question, you will have to now retain less or more, right?

118
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:53,440
I mean, if you have to do everything in just one, but kind of like you have to live with and then more.

119
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,920
But if you retain three, you can choose to retain two or four, right?

120
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,559
So then you retain two or four and then you look at your that again and then you do the same process

121
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,920
of trying to see how interpretable they are and how they are associated with with my current fashion.

122
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:14,530
And then at the end, you will have to kind of like decide which ones you would kind of like if you would

123
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,560
like to keep two or you would like to give three or you would like to keep four,

124
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,450
right? Okay.

125
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:33,870
So so Picanto is one of their most of used data driven method to come up with three buttons.

126
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,410
But there are other approaches.

127
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:46,030
I mean, a little more sophisticated but rarely used in reality in immunology, is to do what we call confirmatory factor analysis,

128
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:55,600
because PCR is more exploratory factor analysis is more data driven, while confirmatory factor analysis basically is based on a priori hypothesis.

129
00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:04,960
So exploratory, is that driven completely based on whatever correlations exist between the food groups and go

130
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:10,370
from artifact analysis based on your prior knowledge of how the variables are going to grow.

131
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:21,639
Okay. So this so I mean, it's good because it has a prior knowledge, but and it's based on estrutura which your mother.

132
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,250
So it's kind of like way beyond the scope of this course.

133
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:31,690
But the problem is that you won't see very often in nutritional epidemiology, you may see it in other fields,

134
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:40,150
but not in nutritional epidemiology, because it's it requires that correlations between the variables to be very high.

135
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,780
Okay. So then the problem is that in nutritional epi,

136
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:50,830
nothing is high five because we have so much measurement error that the correlations are on the weak moderate side.

137
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:58,690
So then the problem is when you have this situation of weak, moderate correlations, then the the structural question, mothers never converge.

138
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,820
I mean, basically, the models, you never come up with anything.

139
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,069
I mean, I tried and didn't get anything right.

140
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:11,229
And I know that. I mean, some people have been able to do it, but it's not is not that common.

141
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:16,330
And I believe it's because of that, because you really need high correlations, which you rarely have in the personality.

142
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:28,810
So, so other approaches and I put novel there, but they are not that novel because they were kind of like proposed like maybe 20 years ago.

143
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,780
But that happy news is actually not this year.

144
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:43,730
Of course I'm good in here because so then you can compare it are kind of like in a way Gaussians of PCR.

145
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:50,590
I mean they are very kind of like related. I mean, and you also use proprietary SAS, which kind of like related to flutter analysis.

146
00:15:50,950 --> 00:16:01,100
So, so what happened with BCA is that you are always kind of like basing your analysis in the correlation, the matrix of the group.

147
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,910
So basically you are splitting variability in the effort.

148
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:10,059
And some people have criticized that maybe variability in the efforts is not that important for the BCA.

149
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:19,330
So maybe what is more important is how the variability in those would explain intermediate biomarkers that are related to the disease.

150
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:28,330
Right. So that's why people kind of like came up with something different that is called

151
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:35,890
revision regression and partial list discourse regression and the alternatives to BCA,

152
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,970
they share many things together actually.

153
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,790
You can even do them with the same proc flutter in SAS they are.

154
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,370
The two of them are data reduction technique.

155
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:59,590
But here you are really doing is that you are going to kind of like get a combination of little variables different the foods that

156
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:08,560
account for much of the information contained in a set of response variables and the response variables are usually biomarkers and okay.

157
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:12,579
Nutrients, right. So then you can use either some nutrients like for example,

158
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:17,409
let's say that you think that a dietary pattern that is rich in vitamin A and

159
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,580
vitamin E is going to be associated with whatever disease you are starting,

160
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:30,520
right? So then you will try to to come up with patterns that represent a combination of the food that is plain variability in vitamin A and vitamin E,

161
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,960
not no variability in effort, but variability in those key nutrients.

162
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:45,940
Or let's say that you have kind of like biomarker like, I don't know, like cholesterol, I mean, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and and CRB, right.

163
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,540
Markers or inflammatory markers, for example.

164
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:57,969
And you think that foods that are related to those biomarkers are going to be associated with eventually with my current information,

165
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:03,730
because, you know that high cholesterol and high inflammatory markers are risk factors for myocardial infarction.

166
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:14,130
Right. So then you come up with combinations of food that explains variability in cholesterol and triglycerides and CRB or whatever.

167
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,410
Right. So in those biomarkers, right. So you can use kind of like a mix of nutrients and biomarkers.

168
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:28,750
Certain issues. Right. So. So that would be for revision regression now.

169
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,700
But this is progression is like a compromise between PC and radio generation.

170
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:43,960
So the idea is that you explain viability in both in the food like PC and the respawn variables.

171
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:50,670
I mean, the key nutritional biomarkers like radar recognition. So in a way, this this is like a nice compromise because I mean, viability.

172
00:18:53,170 --> 00:19:03,550
So the advantages is that this is not completely, positively method.

173
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:08,070
So it's not completely data driven because you are introducing some upgrade information.

174
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,909
So I'm assuming that really expanding by already in this particular biomarkers

175
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:16,410
that I know they are associated with the disease are going to be associated.

176
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,719
I mean, the partners that I get from that will be associated with the disease.

177
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,780
Right. So so then in a way that's good. I mean,

178
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:30,360
you get some arbitrary information also is good when you have kind of like is you

179
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,589
mean you think about the possible mechanisms of dietary fats and this is I mean,

180
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:42,790
you're hypothesizing a biological pathway now we're looking at correlations between some foods and some disease.

181
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:51,910
Right. And in that way, kind of like the racism, the major concern with PC, which is that these are purely that method right now.

182
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,550
They look very appealing. But but actually, they may not be necessary.

183
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,010
Better. Right. So we we try when this this came up for the first time.

184
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:11,560
I mean, some I think it was a German team who I remember it was a world a long time ago that they proposed it for the first time.

185
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:18,910
They did a comparison. They had a single case control study in diabetes.

186
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:27,900
And then they look at dietary patterns that explain kind of like diabetes using BCA bells and and duration the three methods.

187
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,129
And then they came up to their conclusion that degeneration was the best one for them because

188
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:39,610
they it was the one that got more dietary patterns that were associated with diabetes.

189
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:51,769
Right. So then we, we decided to kind of like copy them and try to see if we could get dietary patterns by age with the generation

190
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:57,000
of people that would be associated with myocardial infarction and check which method would be better.

191
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:03,129
Right? So what we use response variables was we use adipose tissue,

192
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:09,370
low levels of gasoline Hellenic because we know that in this population of course it is very protective for myocardial infarction.

193
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,280
We use trans fatty acids also because we know it's a risk factor.

194
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,740
We use intake of saturated fat,

195
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:24,340
intake of folate and intake of fiber because at that point we thought that those three derivatives could be associated with myocardial infarction.

196
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:32,379
And then the only problem that you have when you use these two methods is that in BCA,

197
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:40,240
you can retain as many factors as you want more or less, but introduce one regression and place the maximum.

198
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:46,090
And I mean the factor that you can retain is the number of response variables that you have.

199
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,740
So you have five response variables. You come up with five parts.

200
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:55,600
Okay? So then, then in order to make the comparable for BCA, we all also within five patterns.

201
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:05,320
Okay, so, so we did that and then what happened is that, I mean, it's very difficult to summarize this data.

202
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,600
So that's why we call these graphs.

203
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:17,589
But the idea is that we got kind of like a healthy pattern with BCA that actually it was associated with a lower risk of MRI,

204
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:24,880
which is kind of like consistent with, with the hypothesis, right for it.

205
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:34,389
Our factor four in BCA had high intakes of coffee, sugar and palm oil and was also kind of like associated with higher not risk.

206
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,209
But what sorry. I'm always telling you that you should.

207
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:48,170
You'd also you should think alright warning here and then we also our fifth pattern which was high in alcohol legume simply and saturated.

208
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,850
This was also kind of like associated with a low.

209
00:22:51,100 --> 00:23:07,929
I also for my four plus we found also a similar veggie kind of lie and in a healthy pattern that explains high variation in fiber intake and

210
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:20,080
that was associated with lower odds of in my order for Vytorin less what type of high energy drinks liquor wine beer and in a saturated.

211
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,620
All a low, high in the intake of high fat dairy products.

212
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:30,849
And that was kind of like associated with a degree shots which are kind of like and you think about that.

213
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,850
I mean, people usually feel like things that.

214
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,570
I mean, the legal number doesn't necessarily be health reasons,

215
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:48,960
but it happens that alcohol naturally increases HDL and that you really see it is protective for me.

216
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:56,700
I mean, it's kind of like a little controversial because it's not the same in every population, but in these populations are still.

217
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:05,190
Okay. And then for religion regression really from the the the factor that was similar to the other two

218
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,920
that were high in veggies and this variation in fiber intake and was associated with a lower odds.

219
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:16,170
So interestingly for us we found that BCA was working better.

220
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,389
I mean, we were getting three dietary powders associated with Am I for less?

221
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,660
Only two. One for only one. So.

222
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:30,330
So we cannot. I concluded that in the sense, I mean, that there is no method better than the other.

223
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,690
It depends on your research questions and your study population.

224
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:40,440
So your goal is to this hypothesis is limited to this preset group of response variables.

225
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:46,980
Then definitely the relation may be good because the most flexible definitely.

226
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:55,310
And the you want a more exploratory analysis and Bailey's may be a good compromise between the two.

227
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,400
So then I mean conclusion there's not really a better method.

228
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:07,590
I mean, the three are there for you to use and these two are not that you want to use them in the future.

229
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,120
These are duration and they are not more difficult than BCA.

230
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:19,200
I mean, the analysis is very similarly in the interpretation of the parties and everything is similar so you can use them in the future.

231
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:26,090
If you are interested in explaining variability in up in a set of responsible tables instead of only default.

232
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,930
Okay. We won't do it today. But. But for you to know for the future.

233
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:38,860
Okay. Any questions? Okay, sir, I was about to.

234
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:47,740
Okay, so now we have the rest of the class. So now hopefully you will be able to finish the homework, which is great,

235
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,610
because I'm sure you are in the middle of going to like the end of the semester exam.

236
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:56,109
So the more you can finish, the better so you get back to working.

237
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:07,030
But for the sensitivity analysis of the last, remember, I'm going to remind you where we were at.

238
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,860
So last time we were kind of like looking.

239
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:20,540
I was telling you to retain eight factors. First, to take a look at how many factors would you end up with.

240
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:27,650
Right. So then I was asking you this question. See, the script has a break, which it hasn't.

241
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:34,390
Right. I may remember it was kind of like it was more like that smoothing or not like a clear chart, right?

242
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:41,680
I did. But our our data today, I mean, many of them are not really very easy to interpret right now.

243
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:46,720
How many factors would you retain? That's up to you. But really, the number should be between two and four.

244
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,890
No more than that. Right. And then I as you now you have run the analysis with the factors you want to return to three or four.

245
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,530
And then why did you have those two, three or four?

246
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:04,750
Then you have to go and see those patterns that you have retained associated with myocardial infarction.

247
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:09,540
Right? So now you are going to run a typical logistic regression analysis.

248
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:16,480
And remember, this is a much case control analysis. You have used this that I said before, this is the historical studies.

249
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,700
How much control analyzes do you have to run logistic regression? Conditional logistic regression.

250
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:27,220
So you use the standard estimate. And then I want you to kind of like do the analysis two ways.

251
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:39,459
One, remember that what you have from the reporting analysis is a variable that is going to be called factor one, factor two of three of active four.

252
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,960
I mean, depends on how many patterns you retain, you retain.

253
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,550
Julie, will you factor one factor to your routine? Four will be a factor one, two, three and four.

254
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:52,060
Right? And those score, the three scores.

255
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:55,800
Right. But those scores are in a way meaningless, right?

256
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:59,620
I mean, don't look at the numbers because they don't make much sense.

257
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,379
I mean, it's not like zero one, two, three, four, but will you know if that is a score?

258
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:12,580
So the idea is that the higher the score, the higher the compliance with a button and the lower the score, the lower the compliance.

259
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,330
So then you can either analyze it as a continuous variable.

260
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,260
You are assuming that the association is going to be more or less linear.

261
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:27,910
So the higher the higher the odds right of over may or as we always do in nutritional epidemiology,

262
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:35,050
you can classify, categorize the variable in quintiles, for example, one, two, three, four, five.

263
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:40,000
And then you can look at the variable like categorical analysis.

264
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,840
So then you compare,

265
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:48,940
you take the first quintile as the reference and then you compare the second with the first author with the first, fourth and fifth.

266
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:58,260
Right? I mean, the idea is that this analysis that they show you here, that's how they are done, right?

267
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:04,959
So then you have your five quintile. So I took my score variable or the factor one.

268
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:11,350
I divided it in quintiles and now I'm used I'm putting those quintiles in there in the logistic regression.

269
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:19,030
And then I need to remember the first one is always the reference. So that's why the ratios one and whatever they get in the analysis this year.

270
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:24,370
I think so. So I want you to do the analysis both ways.

271
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:29,170
The score variables are continuously variable and set quintile.

272
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,150
Okay. I told you quintiles. Right. And you check to make sure.

273
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:48,010
Yes, that's categorical using windows. And I'm asking you the factors associated to I don't know why, but here it's which company should be so.

274
00:29:50,550 --> 00:30:00,060
Time to do the arts. And then you have to look at the likelihood ratio at this because remember here we are not adjusting for anything.

275
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,750
These are kind of like simple and adjusted model, simple models.

276
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:13,980
And then you look at the likelihood ratio test, then it will give you the overall kind of like and and significance of the model, right?

277
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,820
And then look at the odds ratios also to see how they work.

278
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:28,680
Because sometimes when you have one continuous variable, you are assuming that the the odds is constant, like for every unit increase in the score.

279
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:36,300
I mean it will be always the same price. It will go like that. That's, that's what continuous mean is that there is some linearity in the scale.

280
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:46,079
But by when you categorize them the variable, you may do it because you may think that that is not necessarily like a linear association.

281
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:53,610
There may be like a threshold association, like maybe people very with very low compliance are here.

282
00:30:53,610 --> 00:31:02,340
And then you need kind of like maybe in the beginning you see anything and then suddenly in the third quintile you see a drop, right?

283
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:07,860
So that would be like a threshold association or maybe or maybe you see like some linearity, it's okay.

284
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:12,780
Or maybe you see some kind of like things like way like you see kind of like an

285
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:17,040
increase in the and then suddenly the last quintile is really going very high,

286
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,570
kind of like more like quadratic, right?

287
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:26,850
So that's why, that's why sometimes you do categorical analysis when you don't know how the dose response association is going to be.

288
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:31,679
I mean, how they. Well, the reason what is the shape of the association?

289
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:37,350
Right. So and then I'm asking you, you need to adjust each factor.

290
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:42,000
But then for the others, which I told you many times, they are uncorrelated.

291
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:49,770
Right. And you have to think about this on your own to think of at least two additional potential co-funded you would

292
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:55,770
like to have included in the regression model and remember that age and sex and already matching factors.

293
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,360
Okay, so you don't need to I mean, I don't want you to mention those. I put that here, right?

294
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:06,959
Like it's a six, an area algorithm acting factor. So then I want you to think about all their potential confounders.

295
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:14,130
Okay. So that's, that's, that was for the first part that hopefully you started doing last week.

296
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:21,659
Now you go to the last question when we are going to do the sensitivity analysis.

297
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:28,770
So the idea is that now you are going to do exactly the same, but instead of that, you decided to return to two factors.

298
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:32,909
Now you're going to return for sample three, right? Or you decided to redo three.

299
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:37,080
Now you're going to retain four or retain two, right? So it's up to you, right?

300
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,150
And then you do exactly the same.

301
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:46,230
So you do kind of like you retain those factors and then you run the logistic regression analysis again to see how they associate.

302
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:52,670
And then at the end, you have to discuss your findings, comparing them with the previous ones and they say which approach is better,

303
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,309
but they need to retain entity of returning for returning three, right.

304
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:01,050
Depending on what you're deciding. Okay. And I think that's it, right?

305
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,280
Yeah. Okay. Any questions?

306
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,790
Okay. So hopefully I hope that you can finish that here.

307
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:20,610
So then any lesson, so you have plenty of time to do other things next week.
