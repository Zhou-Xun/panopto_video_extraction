1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,890
Okay. All right, we'll get started. I know this doesn't work, so don't worry about the money.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,900
So today is going to be the first of two units on energy value.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,010
So today is energy expenditure and the meeting of Calorie and Z because there's no

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:23,880
class emanating from 100 minutes long since it's been such a long weekend or another.

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:32,220
One day or Wednesday, we'll do energy intake, not finish that, and then we'll move on to that question after that.

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,750
And this is the results of your 2022 food rankings.

7
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,870
As you can see, Pioneer had had a rough go of it, whereas eggs seem to be somewhat on the rise.

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,259
And then avocado has continued to dethrone kale, which led for the first four years.

9
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,470
So I've have a problem.

10
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,290
All right. So today, like I said, we're going to go through energy balance, specifically energy expenditure.

11
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,730
As I said, the first and last line of any of the learning objectives, which are what I used to write the question, so I'm not going to release.

12
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:11,220
All right. So the first thing that I want to go through as it pertains to calories is something called the Atwater factor.

13
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:18,500
So a guy whose first name I forget it, but I'm pretty sure his last name was Atwater figured this out in the 1800s.

14
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:26,910
So even though was a chicken breast and a steak and keep warm, I'm very pretty widely in terms of what they have in them.

15
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,330
The protein content content in them is the same in terms of calories and this has been tested across a whole number of foods.

16
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:41,250
So, for example, if you look at a food label and it says it's like 21 grams of protein and 15 grams of carbs and 21 grams of fat.

17
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,520
And it's this number of calories. They don't actually burn that food in a calorimeter to figure out how many calories that they use these numbers.

18
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,270
So you can do the math on any level that you have, that it should be calorie carbohydrates for protein type for lifts and not.

19
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,690
So that's how we know how many calories are in. This is a fundamental there's not that many fundamental laws of nutrition but this is

20
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:06,170
certainly one points of order are two ones that you may be a little bit less familiar with.

21
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:13,260
So ethanol, which is considered the fourth macronutrient under the Senate bill, four grams or almost as many calories per gram as fat.

22
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,620
We'll talk about this a lot when you give a whole lecture specifically on

23
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,930
alcohol and then fiber asserts generally is marked as two kilograms per gram.

24
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,950
What we will see as we talk about fiber and again being a whole class on fiber,

25
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,860
fiber varies between zero such as things like cellulose to much higher, closer to four.

26
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,259
If you think about things like normal dextrose, right? So fiber actually varies along depending on the type of fiber.

27
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,829
And as you will learn many, many, many times over, fiber is not just one thing.

28
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,280
Copper is a whole constellation of different things, but a whole constellation of different circuits.

29
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,370
But for purposes of packaging, usually it's marked as to calories for friends.

30
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,129
All right. So this always comes up.

31
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,470
This is a pretty common debate, I would say less so in the scientific literature and more so on, like Twitter and stuff.

32
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,000
Is that are calories all the same? Are calories equivalent to each other?

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,120
So if I get a calorie from popcorn or I get a calorie from diet soda or I get calorie from a steak, are these calories like functionally equivalent?

34
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,250
So what do you guys think? I touched on this a little bit in the readings, but who wrote opinion that know saying that?

35
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:25,620
You know, because I think it said like protein, you need to put in more to get the energy out of that compared to, let's say like carbs.

36
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,170
Yeah. So for example, even though there may be a certain number of calories in not much of a protein

37
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,680
depending on your chewing of it and its breakdown and as well certainly its protein,

38
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,549
the ability of us to digest and absorb it, the amount of energy that we get,

39
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,580
the protein is probably not going to be exactly that for it's going to be a little bit much.

40
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,780
But that also depends.

41
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:52,920
For example, if I took white powder, which is an extremely digestible protein, usually I can get almost all of that for kilocalories program.

42
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,210
So again, it varies depending on the protein. As we get to the protein unit, you learn about the package you get really.

43
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:08,070
Any other thoughts on? How about, like a.

44
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,940
You think calories are the same from carbs or from fat? Obviously, they have different Atwater factors.

45
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,700
Right. But let's say you were eating a bunch of sugar versus a bunch of butter and the calories were the same.

46
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:26,440
Do you think those would be the same calories? No. Why not? Because one of our producers might be outside the packaging market.

47
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:35,050
So let's say we adjusted for you're eating four nights of fat, but then 4/4 didn't cover.

48
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,300
Well really just for the. Yeah.

49
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,610
I still consider them different just because they deposit in the body differently.

50
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,860
It's interesting.

51
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,110
So that's why I agree with you to what extent it actually turns out that fact, that perception is that is not as much as you might think it would be.

52
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,420
They don't deposit necessarily different in your body, but they're certainly metabolized really differently in your body.

53
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:04,679
Yeah, that's a good point. But that Bergquist as a matter of fact, I think it's the same because if you go back to the what is gallery,

54
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,620
a gallery is the energy needed to raise the temperature of water of one end of water by one degree Celsius.

55
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,460
So if we go back to the definition, they are the same gallery as the Kennedy.

56
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,640
But if you want to convert food, of course they differ between the size of and what we are eating.

57
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,910
If we have protein, they might be we should think about the efficiency, how much we are,

58
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,620
and how much energy is available for us to absorb from the molecules of the food.

59
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,460
But I think if what we are talking just about, calories is the same thing. Yeah.

60
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,410
So let's bring both of your comments here. So he is right technically.

61
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,600
And, you know, we have a molecule where it's a technical thing, a calorie is a counter, right.

62
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,139
So if it's measured as a calorie is a calorie. No. Is it the same? Does that affect our bodies to think?

63
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,240
Well, no, of course not. Right.

64
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:52,590
People eat higher saturated fats are going to tend to have higher circulating cholesterol, but that's not the same as energy balance.

65
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,780
Right. So, for example, if you're thinking about it in terms of energy balance, a calorie was always is a calorie.

66
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,410
Right. If you can account for some of the various machismo and Haneen brought up about

67
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,790
variation in digestion calories are calories in the terms of energy balance,

68
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:13,050
which is what we're talking about right now. That is not true in the terms of like diabetes management or in terms of hyperlipidemia

69
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:18,180
or reducing cardiovascular risk or dealing with celiac or anything like that.

70
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,220
But purely in terms of energy balance, calories are basically the same.

71
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,100
And there's been lots and lots of studies where they put people on low calorie,

72
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,240
sort of low carb or high fat diets and they hold the calories the same and their body weights are indistinguishable.

73
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,340
So there's really no difference between the two. And this was a real debate, I would say, up until about 2018.

74
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,690
People would still argue, oh, no, there's something different about carbs having carbs as something to do with insulin.

75
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,919
And that somehow affects energy balance.

76
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:49,229
But that turns out not to be true, or at least not to be true to an extent that is important to we will talk in,

77
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,840
I believe, the fiber lecture more about ultra processed foods.

78
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,179
But this kind of gets back to both the points that were made here of some foods are just really easy to absorb and really easy to digest.

79
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,330
Right. We very efficiently break them down. And I don't think that's bad. That's just true.

80
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:09,030
And I'll talk more about efficiency. So this may seem a little bit controversial, but I would say the nutrition people are really not in that.

81
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:16,380
If you can know and this is not an easy question to answer. Somebody is energetic and you can know somebody's energy expenditure.

82
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,340
You can predict their weight gain with very, very, very good accuracy.

83
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,280
Very, very, very good present. We can predict changes in lean mass and you can predict changes in performance.

84
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:32,610
No. Knowing someone whose energy intake accurately and knowing somebody's energy expenditure accurately is very hard in non experimental conditions.

85
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,639
We'll talk about food frequency questionnaires in a little bit.

86
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,460
We're going to talk a little bit about some of the measurements for energy expenditure today.

87
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,490
But to the extent that people have done experiments where they could give people food and know exactly what they ate,

88
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:49,799
so maybe they gave you a plate of food, let them eat it like that, measured exactly what was left and then monitor their food intake.

89
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,260
There's extremely good concordance between energy intake,

90
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,940
energy expenditure and how that affects positive or negative energy balance and in turn, how that affects their language.

91
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:03,629
Right. So you don't need to know anything more about a person other than their intake in

92
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,810
their expenditure to figure out whether or not they're likely to gain or lose weight.

93
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,910
Now, there's a lot of complexity in that, right? There are some little differences. There's sex differences, there's differences in foods.

94
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,310
But all of those are encapsulated in what is knowing their energy intake and their energy expenditure.

95
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,350
Well, let's just go through one example. I'm going to talk about avocado oil.

96
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:27,750
So this is a very simple sort of like to predict or think about a spherical cow type example.

97
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,790
So avocado oil, in fact, most oils have about 124 kilocalories per tablespoon.

98
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:37,099
If you go back to that water factor and measure how much volume is a tablespoon and multiply that by nine,

99
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,150
you will get pretty close because avocado oil is surprise, surprise, almost all the.

100
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:46,650
And so if you take the 134 times, you just imagine that all of us did no other change to our diet,

101
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,640
but we all just started having a tablespoon of avocado oil every day. No other changes.

102
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:57,030
That would be a top total of 45,000 more calories over the course of a year.

103
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:04,319
Now it is perfectly efficiently absorbed and stored, which is the spherical counterpart of this argument simply not true.

104
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,280
Part of this argument that has nine kilocalories program.

105
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:13,380
So whether fat is in our body or whether fat is in our food, it still has nine kilocalories per gram, right?

106
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,400
There's no difference. It's still the same. So it's all perfectly efficiently stored as fat and you take 45,216 divided by nine.

107
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:26,570
You would gain £11 over the course of that year. Right. So that's how food can be converted into changes in body.

108
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,910
Now, of course, it's a ridiculous example. We do not officially absorb it.

109
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,300
We're not all going to not change our diets and only add one more tablespoon of avocado oil.

110
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,090
But that's how these things can be, right? So if you're thinking about a change in somebody.

111
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:44,370
Bodyweight. You can sort of. You can use their energy intake and changes in their energy intake to predict that.

112
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,879
Now, there's something we'll talk about in about half an hour called adaptive thermogenesis.

113
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,180
It's also going to make this difficult. But this is sort of our our starting example.

114
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,219
Okay. So I'm going to take a pretty big left turn. My left.

115
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:02,430
Your right. Turn to something called an eye contact. So hopefully many of you have something like this before you're going to need a piece of paper.

116
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,530
You can write on the back of the notes if you want.

117
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,149
So content maps are what I'm going to do is give you a list of stop words that hopefully give the readings.

118
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,260
You're pretty familiar with most of these words, and I want you to try to connect these words to each other.

119
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,440
So, for example, energy intake and energy expenditure relate to each other in terms of energy balance, right?

120
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,460
So getting a full list of words in a minute. And when you spend 15 minutes, you trying to connect these words.

121
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,000
Now we're going to do this like at least five times, maybe six over the course of the semester.

122
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,550
And the reason we're doing this is it's a good activity for you to write.

123
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,790
Wait, I actually don't know how this all fits together.

124
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:37,070
I don't know, for example, how digestive efficiency you have anything to do with energy intake.

125
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:37,650
All right.

126
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:44,010
So I want you guys and the people around you to try to get some help, spend about 15 minutes trying to draw a map of these things somewhere.

127
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:50,969
I recommend some kind of paper, but if you want to use an app or something here and just move it, I will circulate around.

128
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:56,270
In case you have any questions about what can mean when we're done, I'm going to get you to submit a photo of this to great crowds.

129
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,670
It does not have to be correct. Those might not be perfect.

130
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:07,500
But if you want feedback on your concept now, draw a little circle and it'll start being like help or confused or whatever,

131
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,510
and then I'll give you feedback on that one, right? But there's so much to get the function that you don't have that energy.

132
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,389
Okay. And I'll give you about a five minute wait.

133
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:49,470
You're not going to want to draw a lot of thinking and stuff like that, like, okay, I love this one, not having all of those.

134
00:11:50,320 --> 00:12:16,020
But you know, some of the fans want to ask you I need you found a great concern at the top of misunderstanding is from younger fans as opposed to

135
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:22,890
start you just start with someone literally any two things existing the some energy balance so try to get the whole thing in your head.

136
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:32,040
It's about what you'll find you to start to be like, why do you know?

137
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,810
Like, I'm not doing well.

138
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:52,950
It's a matter of fact. I think that's exactly the same thing I'd like to keep right now and not you don't know how I might see that.

139
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:07,700
So for instance, yeah, so like you said, energy balance, the energy seems like not useful and then all physical and digestive.

140
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:18,990
I mean, I don't think we can argue that this is right under energy balance.

141
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,650
Well, yes, that's right.

142
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:42,300
And the other thing I hope for is, you know, as you start to work with and not.

143
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

144
00:13:49,840 --> 00:14:08,510
I it's just that every time something like that happens, I just wish I was expecting her to do that.

145
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:13,700
Oh, I'm sure you can also.

146
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:25,400
Yeah. Oh, I think that would count towards maintaining too much power to put it in the middle.

147
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:41,180
So that's 1600 times more like how this might sound.

148
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:58,080
Like something like we had to say no to that song here.

149
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,340
Yeah. Yeah, something like that.

150
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:09,800
So. Or we could connect to them through a house cause we don't even know he wasn't here.

151
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,130
That's the basic problem.

152
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,420
Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.

153
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:24,840
Yeah. Yeah.

154
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:44,030
Well, I wish I would go to, like, 30 minutes orientation, so I, like, have a few, and then I would do like to try and do it like,

155
00:15:44,360 --> 00:16:04,330
you know, not only 10 minutes of our lives like this, it just felt like it and then, like not going to church and then coming down there.

156
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:18,050
And there were so many people, like, working with all of these different characters in equal measure.

157
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:25,190
Yeah. Like those are gonna be okay.

158
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:47,149
So that's like a tool, for example, where you say, I just want to know what it is that I like to ask but didn't like it.

159
00:16:47,150 --> 00:17:00,770
I have to say that I could have lunch or something like that, but I'm just trying to, which is I guess it's the both of them.

160
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:07,990
Okay. And energy. So how would that be?

161
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,560
Clash of the Titans?

162
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:20,450
Oh, I don't know.

163
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:37,100
Like as much energy instead of just so you know, I just.

164
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:54,140
I just. I just. I just a higher rate of transparency.

165
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,780
I mean, that's high tech skill, you know, just.

166
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,930
I just think it's torture.

167
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,810
I just imagine that means how do you utilize matrix?

168
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:17,930
So it's not that let's see how how much energy you're going to get outside of the box.

169
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,140
Or is it just the energy?

170
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,800
Just it, yeah.

171
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:42,350
Sounds like I'm like a parking lot, so you're gonna have to call me later down here.

172
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,590
Yes, absolutely.

173
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:15,450
What's going to happen in the case of a soldier is that if think that I firmly believe that I should be in an area where there's a great atmosphere,

174
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:30,650
which is great, we certainly will spend like two or three more minutes on that.

175
00:19:32,600 --> 00:20:00,050
And that's how we make the Middle East such a well-known example where you guys are on top of the screen in regards to the crown prince.

176
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:09,890
So I guess I guess I started reading that.

177
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:33,530
So what I usually start by saying and stuff like that, I feel like I have that same feeling that it was hard, you know, how does it how you look like?

178
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,630
You know what I mean?

179
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:51,829
Consequently, you know, it's like waiting for you.

180
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,910
And I understand that feeds back into apathy.

181
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,710
The calories, the excretion.

182
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:20,850
Yes, it is ways to take things that if you want to collect the ones that everything there is to know.

183
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

184
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:30,840
I could. I can kind of see how many people would be like how long you can do it.

185
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:58,410
Yeah, I need to actually use this because my writing is actually all messed up, so energy intensive to go to.

186
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:11,430
Just let me have a ton of outrageous weight loss effects.

187
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:31,640
And that's like, I don't know, they're really hard to read around.

188
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:38,730
And a lot of people say that the U.S. is kind of you don't eat more calories.

189
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:46,440
Okay, so when you're done and again, this does not have to be complete, just take a photo or a screenshot or whatever of your thing.

190
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,480
And then there's an activity called this for today. If you wanna get points for it, it seems like it's useful.

191
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:56,970
And again, if you have anything that you want clarity on just basically or arrow or something.

192
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,950
So when I graded because again, I'm not grading for completion, but if you do have questions, I'm happy to answer any questions you have.

193
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,299
Just kind of mark that somewhere here on your thing. For what it's worth, I don't think this is due in like midnight on Saturday.

194
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,460
But for what it's worth, I like I really do like these, whether you like them or not.

195
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,810
It's kind of irrelevant to me at this point.

196
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,610
But I really do like these because it is a good way to actually be like, Wait, how are these things connected?

197
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:23,790
What does it actually mean? How does this relate to? So you'll see. I'll use these a lot and it's fine if you don't know where things are.

198
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,970
That's why meetings as as groups. Okay.

199
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:37,470
So as I said in the notes and I like all the comments on perusal, I really think of energy expenditure specifically as metabolic inefficiency.

200
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:40,230
Now, this is pretty counterintuitive to some people.

201
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:48,210
If you're undergoing metabolism and you're releasing energy in the food and heat and is inefficient,

202
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,899
that does not mean that everything that's in efficient.

203
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:57,640
If you were perfectly efficient, for example, by avocado oil in the spherical cow, not all right.

204
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:02,010
That you're releasing no extra heat. Right. But if you're releasing heat, that's inefficiency.

205
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,180
If you're going from here to there and then back, maybe you had to go to the store and come back.

206
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,490
But at the end, you started where you went and you've earned a bunch of energy going there and back.

207
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:14,640
That's inefficiency, right? Again, there a tendency to think of inefficiency as bad.

208
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,010
Inefficiency is not bad. It depends on your purpose.

209
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:24,780
If you're trying to lose weight, you actually want to have as much in efficiency as possible, right?

210
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:31,950
For every calorie that goes in your mouth, you want to be at least efficiently processed into your adipose stores as possible.

211
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,899
And that can be accomplished by a whole bunch of different things, right? It could be because maybe it's like a pilot.

212
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:43,020
So it has very few calories or maybe it's something that needs a lot of mechanical digestion for it to occur.

213
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,470
Right? Maybe it's a kind of food that needs to get converted from point A to point B to point C out of pocket.

214
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:55,830
Right. On the other hand, if your focus is what a performance, you actually want as much efficiency as possible,

215
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:01,380
but you're wanting a raise and you take one of those personal yoga things that you eat while you're running.

216
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:05,580
You want every single calorie in that to be converted into your athletic performance.

217
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:13,740
Okay. So as people are more efficient, they're going to have more likely to a positive energy balance, right?

218
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:18,030
Because their energy expenditure is going to go down. Right. If they are more efficient.

219
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:25,680
Yeah. So even though like I said it's like wasting trade off to conflate that with good or bad.

220
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,610
Right. But every type of energy expenditure process is inefficient.

221
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:35,490
It may be quite healthy for me to go for a jog, but I'm burning a bunch of energy that I technically did not have to right.

222
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:41,180
That energy which shows up as exercise. Active thermogenesis is inefficient, right?

223
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:45,360
I'm getting rid of those calories from. I didn't really have to do that.

224
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,020
Right. So like I said, I'm going to keep bringing this up as inefficiency and that's really how I think of this.

225
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:56,940
So anytime something causes an increase in energy expenditure, you should be able to ask, where is that inefficiency coming from?

226
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,720
Right. And we'll talk about this a little bit more over and over and over again.

227
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:09,000
We'll talk about tons and tons of examples of this. So one example, one to me, very clear example in the market is gluconeogenesis.

228
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,970
So the process of gluconeogenesis and getting rid of a whole electron on.

229
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:15,850
So don't worry about it if it's not clear right now you start with something like lactate and

230
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:20,610
convert it to glucose and then you may undergo anaerobic respiration and turn it back into lactate.

231
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,930
But what if you started with lactate and you ended with lactate? You didn't make anything new.

232
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,910
You just started with lactate, turned it into something else and turned it back into like by definition, that is inefficient, right?

233
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,959
It's like going to the store and coming back might even be useful,

234
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:39,300
but it is inefficient and in this case it's inefficient to the level of for atpase have to be used.

235
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,380
So for equivalence of energy of ATP had to be used to go through this process.

236
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,490
So if you go through this process a lot, you're going to keep burning those for atp's over and over.

237
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:54,060
That is going to result in an increase in your energy expenditure. And that's something we see when people undergo a lot of gluconeogenesis,

238
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:58,840
their energy expenditure is quite a bit higher, not only because of this, but that's one example.

239
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,459
Another example and I apologize, this is a little bit small,

240
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:09,090
but the key point is the ATP on the bottom left is when reabsorb the last little bit of glucose.

241
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:14,400
And again, we're going to a whole lecture on this. Don't worry about the details, but the last little bit of glucose and galactose we absorb,

242
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:24,030
we use an ATP dependent pump to get it from our gut into our Integra site, into our entire site, and then into our blood.

243
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:29,700
So you see there's this ATP driven pump, and that's because it's working against a concentration gradient.

244
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,190
And again, we'll talk more about this in a couple of weeks.

245
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:39,290
But to get this glucose from our gut into our blood, every single glucose is going to use up an ATP molecule, right?

246
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:45,810
So that process is going to be inefficient because we're burning ATP and all we're doing is getting something from here to here.

247
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:49,380
We're not changing it. We're not doing anything else. We're just moving it around. Right.

248
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,220
This is one example of why when you eat a meal, your thermogenesis goes away,

249
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,389
because you have to burn a lot of energy to do a lot of these transport processes, for example.

250
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:01,260
And I'll show you an example of that in class. Okay.

251
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,770
So I like that there's a bunch of different methods for measuring energy expenditure.

252
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:11,730
Now, depending on the circumstances, you probably aren't only going to have access to the first two and not have access to the last two.

253
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:20,170
So I'm going to go through each of these sort of one by one. So the easiest, cheapest, least accurate one would be activity levels, right?

254
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,309
Just ask somebody how much exercise you do. And they say, I don't know.

255
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:27,730
I go for like a three mile run every other day and then you just estimate their energy expenditure from that present.

256
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:35,120
Everybody's the same size and that's what you do. So that would be like covering, but I'm sure of using apps that just do that right.

257
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,880
And they try to predict it from going down one level where you don't need to do an experiment,

258
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,530
but you need to know a little bit about the people are various equations and I'll go

259
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:48,060
through some of these equations I heard spending that and if you are on the next slide,

260
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,970
then the last two are more experimental measures.

261
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:58,350
So in the case of indirect calorimetry, you need to be in a sealed room where you measure how much gas you produce and how much gas you intake.

262
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:02,880
And then that can be used to estimate very, very, very accurately your energy expenditure.

263
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:08,760
The third the fourth method here is doubly label water, which I'll go through in another slide, but that's another experimental measure.

264
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,630
Now in dietetics it's going to be pretty rare that you're going to do the bottom two.

265
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:17,280
In fact, there's not even an indirect calorimeter like indirect following a route in Michigan.

266
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:23,459
One's in Chicago, the next closest one is in Richmond, Virginia, or Charlotte.

267
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,850
North Carolina is closer to some Canadian, but whichever of those two things.

268
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,020
And then there's one in Colorado, there's one in San Diego. There's not many of them, is what I'm saying.

269
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:38,610
So it's pretty unlikely that you're going to use indirect calorimetry in that kind of way, but only like water and principle can be done anywhere.

270
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:44,669
But it involves ingestion of very, very, very expensive radioactive water, which a not everybody wants to do.

271
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,710
And B, is very, very, very, very expensive.

272
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:53,780
So usually we use the bottom two things to inform equations that can be then used at an individual level, right?

273
00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:00,540
So that's what these are called. Okay. So in the case of indirect calorimetry, as I said, you're in a sealed room.

274
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,660
It has its limitations because we don't all live in sealed rooms for 24 hours a day all the time that these numbers do.

275
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:12,419
But in this small, sealed room, you can measure the CO2 and the CO2.

276
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,410
And the key thing here is you're you're measuring the production of the CO2.

277
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:20,820
Every single carbohydrate, fat or lipid we break down turns into carbon dioxide.

278
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:25,110
Right. And so if you can measure that carbon dioxide, you can use that to measure how many calories the person is.

279
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:28,860
Right. In the case of the water, it's a little more complicated.

280
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,560
Use water that's labeled and hold the hydrogen and oxygen.

281
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,240
You can use that to calculate how much water is excreted and how much carbon dioxide is excreted.

282
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:42,120
And again, the goal here is to figure out how much carbon dioxide that other different in one important way,

283
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:46,470
because you're measuring the the CO2 here directly.

284
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:52,500
You can measure that minute to minute. Right. So if you're an indoor a calorie tree can be like this is how much CO2 is right now.

285
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,090
And then maybe there's an exercise bike and then it shoots up so you can measure it at a very short time scale.

286
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:02,730
Whereas in the case of the blue label Water, you give somebody a dose and then usually you ask them to come back in about a week or so.

287
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,610
So it's at a much slower timescale. So you can't see sort of hour by hour differences.

288
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,770
You get to see all sort of like global changes in somebody's metabolism.

289
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:16,200
But the advantage is you can go home, you go off and live your normal life with double level water.

290
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,580
So you're not in a sealed room where you're being stared at by assignments.

291
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:29,940
So they all have their sort of pros and cons. So going back to how we estimate it, this is just one one example of how this can be estimated.

292
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:38,489
So the major, major, major part of our total daily energy expenditure, which I mean to try to be consistent in TV, is our resting energy expenditure.

293
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:42,600
Even for extremely active people, it's still usually the resting energy expenditure.

294
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:46,590
So somewhere around 70% of our total calories burned whether we do anything or not.

295
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,970
Even if we don't get out of bed, we're still burning about 70% of the calories relative to everything else.

296
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:55,680
Only about 15 to 20%. And of course, now this does vary depending on the activity level.

297
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,570
The person is exercise. So most people who've never taken a nutrition or exercise physiology plan,

298
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,400
this comes as a surprise because most people, if they think about how many calories they're burning, they remember.

299
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,570
Yeah, I went on that run yesterday so that most of my colleagues were right,

300
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,140
but I did go for a over a really long run yesterday because I didn't have to teach yesterday.

301
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:16,320
I went for like a nine mile run and that was totally like a quarter of my day's energy expenditure,

302
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:22,770
according to my, I'm sure, wildly accurate at the lunch. But that's still and that's like a pretty active day.

303
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:29,250
I don't run every day. I do think if you're trying to figure out what predicts your resting energy expenditure,

304
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:35,729
the best predictor of that is the amount of muscle mass you have or in this case, measured as how much fat free mass you have.

305
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:40,020
And this is measured in this data from a bio impedance analysis machine.

306
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:45,150
So you can see if you know somebody fat free mass with pretty good precision, you can just predict their BMI.

307
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,480
That is by far the biggest contributor to your BMI.

308
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:54,180
Right. So if you know somebody factory mass with about 85% certainty, you can figure out their basal metabolic rate.

309
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,350
And then I'll talk about need and and that in a second.

310
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:04,260
So here's a bigger experiment by the aforementioned Mifflin and St George, where they looked at a whole bunch of people.

311
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:10,860
So they took a whole bunch of people and they put them into accelerometers. So they measured their metabolic rate experimentally.

312
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,049
And what they're plotting here is their body weight.

313
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:18,240
So not quite their factory mass, that is their total body weight versus their resting energy expenditure.

314
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:22,620
And this may not look as impressive, but there's a pretty good connection between these two.

315
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:27,450
I wish they used different colors, but I guess this is like 1990 and like color hadn't been invented yet or whatever.

316
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:32,550
But based on the regression of these lines, they were able to calculate two different formulas.

317
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:39,750
So if you know somebody is fat free mass, which of course is better because fat free mass is the best predictor of energy expenditure,

318
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:45,050
you can use this equation for men and this equation for women. You can see they're like pretty similar, but not quite the same.

319
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:50,339
The slopes are slightly different and with if you don't know they're factory mass, which is clinically,

320
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:54,410
maybe more often the case depending on if you have access to a machine, that measure is percent,

321
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:58,560
but you can still do that by knowing their height and weight, of course, in the metric system,

322
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,730
because why not use the metric system and you can calculate it the same way, right?

323
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,620
This is a little bit less accurate because you don't know they're factory mass, right?

324
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:12,360
So the weight in this case could be fat mass or it could be fat free mass. But you can use either of these equations.

325
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:18,480
Most calculators you use online where they're trying to estimate your energy expenditure, that's what they're using.

326
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:22,350
One of these two sets of questions, and almost always it's this one, not this other one,

327
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:28,100
because up until recently it was quite hard to figure out you weren't percent fat and therefore your amount of fat free.

328
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:31,259
That's just so that's the question.

329
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:38,580
Without knowing the factory mass count, the BMR or the both of these are getting your BMR,

330
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,860
which you then use as part of the total daily energy expenditure, your eyesight issues that you might influence.

331
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:50,220
Both of these are based metabolic or resting energy expenditure, which in my heart lungs are the symptoms.

332
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:58,530
So for example, I can plug this in for myself. I'm like 43 years old, I'd like £165 or about 20% fat, so I can add all that up.

333
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,839
It will tell me what my resting energy expenditure should be.

334
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,680
Right, and again, it's not perfect would be accurate if I did spend some time in an indirect calorie.

335
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,510
It might be off by a little bit, but it won't be up by much. I probably it'll be accurate within about 50%.

336
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:18,070
Okay. So why about three months? Why does factoring this matter so much? If you look at the average person here, this is what they're at.

337
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:21,070
The percent of these different organs are in terms of their body weight.

338
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:28,630
So relatively healthy person might be something like 21% fat, 40% muscle, and then all these other organs are relatively small.

339
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,450
However, if you look at how they contribute to metabolic rate on the right, you can see all these other organs like your heart,

340
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:40,450
liver, digestive system, which are pretty small in terms of mass, actually disproportionately burn a lot of energy.

341
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,910
Right. And this makes sense because like your heart should like ideally keep feeding off time and you want that to happen

342
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:51,820
because it's not you make not be alive your brain again as much of your class maybe want that turned away all the time.

343
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:58,270
The key thing that's different, other than those things being bigger is that mass generally burns almost no calories.

344
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:05,499
Right. So if you take away that part of fat mass and you kind of expand the rest of this pie chart, that's what you're fat free masses.

345
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,510
And that's why your fat free mass is the biggest predictor. Now, you might think muscle is the biggest predictor, but it actually isn't.

346
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,460
Right. Muscle is about the same as the liver.

347
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:18,190
And if you go to a program basis, you burn many fewer calories at rest in your muscle than you do in your heart,

348
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:22,659
your liver, your digestive system, your kidneys. Those all burn a lot because those things are always working.

349
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,660
Right? Right now, my I'm finding people not working, but I'm standing.

350
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:31,910
I'm sure something's being lazy right now. My hands are still contracting. They're not working very hard at all.

351
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,810
Oh, my heart hopefully is working. My kidneys ideally still working, my liver ideally.

352
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:43,150
So they're working all the time. So that's why those components are really important in terms of your visual metabolic rate.

353
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,860
And we'll talk about what's going on in almost all of these organ systems over the course of the semester.

354
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:54,000
Okay. So the next component here is the thermic effect of goop, right?

355
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:57,390
So as you eat a meal, your energy expenditure will increase.

356
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:03,670
So this is just showing a trace from an indirect color of somebody who is just sitting around and eats three meals.

357
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:12,460
And the meals are the earth, right? So you can see their basal metabolic rate in kilojoules, which converts calories at these 43 is pretty low.

358
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:15,490
And then they eat a meal and suddenly their energy expenditure jumps up.

359
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,250
Now that is normal because they got up and they were like eating their meal with

360
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:25,010
like a lot of emotion or they were running around while they're eating their meal. This is just the energy that is burned by eating them, right?

361
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:28,840
So you can see there's a pretty, pretty predominant if you look at somebody, individual traits,

362
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:36,159
usually somewhere around ten or 15% of your total daily energy expenditure is the three to the right.

363
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,610
So if you started with your basic metabolic rate set, it was like 1600,

364
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:45,160
you could add about 10% onto that, another 160 to account for what the thermic impact of food might be.

365
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:51,310
Of course it varies depending on a lot of things. The most important two factors are the size of the meal and the amount of protein in it.

366
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,990
It turns out, as Joon Ho mentioned earlier, protein is quite difficult to digest and transport.

367
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,850
It's also quite difficult to synthesize.

368
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,730
We'll talk about this all in unit three protein unit, but that's the biggest contributor to the thermic effects.

369
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:08,500
So if you know how much protein was in a person's meal, you can pretty much you can better predict they're very competitive.

370
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:12,040
Now, that's not to say eating a lot of protein is beneficial for weight loss.

371
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,999
That's not true because it turns out we are very satiated by protein.

372
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,140
So it's actually quite hard to meet all your calories and even if you try really, really, really hard.

373
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:27,840
Okay. So this paper came out actually the day after I gave this lecture last year.

374
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:33,090
And I want to say, like, power amended what I said, but it's a little bit different.

375
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,600
So I'm going to go through the study in a little bit of detail because this is actually really trivial.

376
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,910
So if you want to learn more, there's like an optional assignment about this study that you do in like two weeks.

377
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,300
So they used doubly labeled blocks for this study,

378
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:52,470
which means they're going to be using they're going to telling us about their total daily energy expenditure, not their basal metabolic rate.

379
00:38:52,830 --> 00:39:06,690
Why is that? Measuring the CO2.

380
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:14,400
It is measuring the CO2. That's correct. No, because this tool gives us how much energy they are using.

381
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:21,419
We cannot know that we are not exactly for these people, how much we cannot divide them, which is not the total amount of energy expended.

382
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,020
Exactly. Since we can't measure it at a minute to minute or hour by hour basis.

383
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,990
We don't know when they age. We don't know when they exercise or if they exercise.

384
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:32,130
We don't know if they have lots of fidgeting, which is neat.

385
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:38,340
All we know is the total calories burned. So remember that one level water only tells us about total calories.

386
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,500
It doesn't give us the resolution of the individual things.

387
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:46,590
So they only are looking here at total daily energy expenditure, which again is a limitation of that.

388
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,360
So they look at a whole lot of people.

389
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:54,000
So there's this registry called like the label Water Consortia, the International Consortium, where they look at.

390
00:39:55,410 --> 00:40:00,209
They basically put all the double label water requirements that almost anybody has ever done into one really big database.

391
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:05,730
But why? There's a lot. So each point here is a person, either older adult or a younger adult.

392
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:11,370
And luckily, as you can see, the biggest predictor of total energy expenditure remains at 3 minutes.

393
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:15,149
Right. So if you knew the person's factory mass, again, pretty good precision.

394
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,730
You can measure their total daily energy expenditure.

395
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:23,040
If you look really, really carefully at this line, though, there's a couple of things that are not quite linear about it.

396
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,710
So, for example, there's a bunch of red dots here that are above the line but not below the line.

397
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:33,450
Right. So for these people here, which are juveniles, it's a little higher than you would expect.

398
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,910
The other thing that you can see is there's a lot of variation as you get to being higher in fat free mass.

399
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,910
Right. So it gets less accurate as you get higher. Okay.

400
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:46,880
So what's going on here? Obviously, one big determinant of energy expenditure is sex.

401
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:54,870
This is largely, again, driven by changes in fat free mass. So if you separate the males in blue from the females in yellow,

402
00:40:54,870 --> 00:41:00,000
I could flip these to you can see over the course of their lifespan, this is what's going on.

403
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:05,730
So as your small your energy expenditure increases because you're getting bigger and then it stabilizes and then

404
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:11,910
it's pretty flat from about when you're 20 to about when you're 70 and then it starts to decline above 70.

405
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,460
And that's because largely your muscle mass deteriorates as you age due to age related atrophy.

406
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:21,780
Now, this was a big surprise because people used to think there was more of a linear decline.

407
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:26,850
We peak at 20 and sort of linearly decline to 70, but that does not appear to be the case here.

408
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:30,360
It appears to be pretty stable from 20 through 70.

409
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,000
Now, this is a cross-sectional study mostly, so most of these people are one person.

410
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:40,020
So we actually don't know for an individual person it might decline or something, but this was actually quite different than what we thought.

411
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:45,810
Another thing which was kind of surprising to maybe some people was that if you looked at these,

412
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:50,430
you would say, well, if this person I don't know here, let's take let's pick on that.

413
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,140
That's that person there. Imagine that.

414
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:00,750
They're waiting. They're not gaining weight. They're not losing weight. They've been this weight for a while and most people are pretty weight stable.

415
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:09,750
What that means is that person, if they're weight stable and they're burning that many calories, that means they are also eating that many calories.

416
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:15,090
Right. Because of their weight sitting because energy balance has to exist. So if you look at the average across these two,

417
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:23,490
you can see the average is that women tend to be stabilizing around 2400 calories and men stabilize at around 3100 calories.

418
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:26,220
Now, this is quite different than what the USDA will tell you,

419
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:31,950
which is that women should be eating 2500 calories, 32,000 calories, and men should be eating 20 £500.

420
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,760
Now, in the paper they talked about this is kind of a surprise,

421
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:39,270
but everybody in the nutrition field kind of already knew that because they already

422
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:42,990
knew that we were kind of lying about the 22,000 calories and 2500 calories.

423
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,230
Because the idea would be that people are bad at estimating how much they're eating.

424
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,510
They overestimate or underestimate portion sizes to underestimate snacks and things like that.

425
00:42:51,720 --> 00:43:01,350
But the truth of this is the average woman and the average man are eating 3100 calories and 2400 calories, not 2500 calories and 2000 calories.

426
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,650
That goes into our recommendations. Okay.

427
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,549
The third thing about this paper was, if you look at the total energy expenditure relative to the fat free mass,

428
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:15,580
you can see again, it's pretty linear, but it starts to break down as you age, right?

429
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:20,880
So as you age, your fat free mass decreases, but as your fat free mass decreases your total energy expenditure.

430
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:25,950
So you can see each individual is going to go through a sort of velocity like this, right?

431
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:32,399
So their mass is going to keep in fat free mass is going to keep increasing and then it's going to go back down here and we've got this as well.

432
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,950
And then this is this is one. All right. And then the last thing I want to show, which is the big take home thing here,

433
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:43,200
is that if you now adjust their energy expenditure for the differences in fat free mass,

434
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,100
you can see men and women are virtually indistinguishable for each other.

435
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:50,730
Right. So men tend to have much higher factory mass of women.

436
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,300
But after you adjust that factor away, they're basically the same.

437
00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:01,260
Right. So you can see across here the difference between men and women is not remotely significant across here, across really any issue.

438
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:07,050
This little blip here at the beginning represents this little blip I talked about at the beginning here,

439
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,479
where as you're growing, you actually have a much higher energy expenditure than your fat mass might dictate.

440
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,870
And that's because throwing is very metabolically expensive.

441
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,800
Making muscle and making bones is very, very, very expensive.

442
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,130
You have to burn a lot more calories you need it actually turns out it's really inefficient.

443
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:28,169
And that's why we get this little peek as if people are first when they're born and then

444
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:33,270
it kind of runs down in the by the time you're reaching your adult size and above 20,

445
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:34,680
everything sort of flattens out.

446
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:41,880
And like I said, if you're interested in this study and you want to support a little bit more, there is an activity related to that.

447
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:53,340
The next slide is activity.

448
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:57,990
You have to calculate the number of calories stored in £1.

449
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,920
That is four for 54 gram of adipose tissue.

450
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:10,600
Based on that and what a factor that you have from the slaves in the beginning, that is a one gram release.

451
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:15,610
So nine kilocalories. So keep that in mind.

452
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:24,530
And also, it's mentioned that 87% of it is present in the adipose tissue so that this tissue is not 100% lipid.

453
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:31,090
So keep that in mind. For 54 grams, 87% of that is lipid.

454
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:36,340
How many calories are there in that 87% of lipid?

455
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:40,270
Of course, 54 Grand Central Station.

456
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,730
So spend some time to calculate the calories.

457
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:51,680
If you are done early, you can go ahead and try it for one month and one day.

458
00:45:51,780 --> 00:46:02,820
So the rule is, if you can if your calorie deficit is 500 calories a day, you can lose up to £1 of weight in one week.

459
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:11,499
So that's. Editors said, work with the people around you.

460
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:31,600
And then if you have any questions, just like us over at the moment, we have a lot of categories and this is not the way you can just multiply by.

461
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,700
I think it is just one. Maybe you're supposed to subtract that one.

462
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:48,400
Are you saying he was trying to tell you something that is so divided by Gregory?

463
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:55,100
All right. Well, what do you say?

464
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:02,620
Oh, he said yes and one and then multiply.

465
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:09,600
Right. So so we got to do that.

466
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,390
Created the topic. Was that that's possible. Yeah.

467
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:35,830
Yeah. Yeah. I think that's really not about 1997.

468
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:46,650
Yeah. I'm fine with that.

469
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:51,280
You multiply that by God.

470
00:47:52,790 --> 00:48:10,870
Yeah. So based on that I just so that somebody is going to tell you something entirely different.

471
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:19,209
Yes, it is. My God, it was nice. Taxing the calories and thinking about how many calories.

472
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:24,010
So you're saying like salaries.

473
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:34,749
Oh, I want to say to that next time I'm going to divide this one day.

474
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:45,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I'm going to eat 24.7 because you can do it both ways.

475
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:53,889
Yeah, I know the maximum. I wanted to write it.

476
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:59,850
That's just 1.9267 ten.

477
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:05,690
I think the wrong number of 1390.

478
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:10,820
But that's like every roughly every night.

479
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:31,600
Right. You probably got four times in the past few years on these times.

480
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:42,500
So this is is are we gonna do this?

481
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:58,380
You know what I mean?

482
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:06,819
What happens over the next three weeks?

483
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:17,620
We come in and around of the dictionary, which is not something that comes up.

484
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:27,470
And then there are about 308 and it's like I just about it.

485
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:35,700
But now I don't want to have like the slides.

486
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:43,690
I told you that this one, this is what's the worst slide.

487
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:48,850
Cool. So if you're in a negative. Yeah, do it afterwards.

488
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:54,130
So what did you Catholic group. I never heard of it before.

489
00:50:56,490 --> 00:51:01,540
So that would mean lose all those calories in case I have to find something, so.

490
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:20,260
Okay. Yeah. EMR was 30. But you're right, it wasn't exactly the right question.

491
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:25,040
You are absolutely right. I think you're right.

492
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:32,760
Well, I guess I'm worried about the deficit per day by all accounts.

493
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:45,130
I think so.

494
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:49,670
Either way.

495
00:51:51,380 --> 00:52:04,880
She's a very interesting one by themselves.

496
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,990
So I was just.

497
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,940
There is resolve conservatism.

498
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:23,010
What did you mean? Oh, my God.

499
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:29,220
She's in my house.

500
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:50,930
Oh, okay. I don't really see one. I think that would be so fine, but I don't think the one exception for that possibility.

501
00:52:54,030 --> 00:53:12,310
Without asking too many people that are looking at me and wondering what I think.

502
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:17,550
But it was a little hard to translate problems.

503
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:25,260
And I think this one just got together.

504
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:34,080
So I just didn't want to take that basically because I was so into the Huckabee or whatever.

505
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:55,530
And then I started it by seven and eight and then it seems like a lot of calories and calories per day.

506
00:53:56,070 --> 00:54:00,000
This is about your heart right here. Yes, I know.

507
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:15,480
It's nice to watch you. Do you want to ask me what my last question.

508
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:26,570
All right, fine. Yes. You don't want to answer.

509
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:31,770
And I think most people are more or less there.

510
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,060
Hopefully for the answer to question one, you got something like 3500 calories.

511
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:42,420
If you take that 3500 calorie deficit and spread over a week, that should be 3500 divided by seven,

512
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:46,110
which would be 500 calories, which is why they call it a hundred calories.

513
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:51,420
So dietitians quite often will say, if you need to lose our weight, you will have to find a deficit of our calories.

514
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:56,850
So in principle, either do 500 calories more exercise or be $5 less of food.

515
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:02,490
And then over the course of a month, you should have gotten something like 115 calories.

516
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,870
And if you were to do it over the course of a day, you'd have to somehow get a 3500 calorie deficit.

517
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:13,649
Now, if we think of this person here, we up here at around 3500 calories,

518
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:16,820
that person could potentially achieve that and they nothing at all that will happen.

519
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,089
Right. But it's very, very difficult to do that. Certainly not recommended.

520
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:22,170
Definitely not sustainable.

521
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:28,320
So chances are if you step on the scale and you see that your pal, your weight flat with £5, that's not actually what happened.

522
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:34,050
Usually it's because of water and salt and so on.

523
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,330
Okay. So that's the fiber calorie rule.

524
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:42,480
And actually turns out that is kind of a useful approximation, but actually not correct because this is not a linear trend.

525
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:51,160
If you put somebody in a primary calorie deficit over time, they actually will not continue to lose £1 per week in that number for a long time.

526
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:57,800
And the reason for that one reason for that at least is something called metabolic adaptation, because this is also talked about before.

527
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:02,250
So this study from the mid-nineties shows this really nicely.

528
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,390
The group of people, they brought them in with the weight stable and the initial weight.

529
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:10,560
They then overfed them such that they had a 10% weight gain or a 10% weight loss,

530
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:14,280
and then a subset of them were returned back down to initial weight, back down to initial loss.

531
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:19,020
And so what they then looked at was how did their world daily energy expenditure vary?

532
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:23,370
So what they found was as people gained their body weight, their energy expenditure increased,

533
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:29,549
and then as people lost their body weight either because they returned from year to year or they just started from here.

534
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:37,260
And what the year they lost energy expenditure, their metabolism was varying based on whether they recently gained or lost weight.

535
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,549
Right. So this is a process of adaptive comparisons and this is thought to be a homeostatic

536
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:45,840
mechanism such that if you temporarily overconsume and you gain a little bit of weight,

537
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:49,380
your BMR will increase to burn off those excess calories.

538
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:55,500
On the other hand, if you lose some weight, your body will slow its metabolism in order to bring you back up to where you were before.

539
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,660
So the theory here is that everybody is at some sort of set point and your body's metabolism

540
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:04,200
is varying to get you back to what it thinks the correct weight for you should be.

541
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:10,230
Now, you and your body may disagree. In fact, many people disagree. But there is this set point that exists in people.

542
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:16,650
So energy expenditure is quite dynamic. This also means that as you lose weight, your BMR is going to keep decreasing.

543
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:20,820
Right. So that's why the 500 calorie rule won't happen indefinitely.

544
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:27,479
So this is a quite short term experiment. So this was done over the course of a few weeks in an inpatient setting in New York City.

545
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:33,490
But the question persisted for many decades Was this just a short term phenomena in that somebody at the tables would shoot up,

546
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:37,200
but then a few days later would come back out? Or was this a long term problem?

547
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:43,079
And so the answer to that actually came ironically out of a television show called The Biggest Loser, which was very popular.

548
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:51,210
It only felt like six years ago. And they followed these people using indirect calorimetry in the same way.

549
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:53,610
And what they found, I'm kind of cutting through a lot.

550
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:57,880
Stop is that these people, if you're unfamiliar with the show, undergo a massive weight loss, right?

551
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:03,880
So they come in and then on TV, people scream at them about whatever, about people exercise hardcore or something and they lose weight.

552
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:11,739
And what they found is at the end of the game show, after 30 weeks, they lost weight and their basal metabolic rate, the clock rates,

553
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:19,200
you can see the average decline for these people, which started off as quite heavy to begin with, was somewhere around five, 600 calories.

554
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:26,410
So they had this reduction. But then if you followed those people six years later, they still had that reduction in their basal metabolic rate.

555
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:30,970
Right. So this effect is adaptive. The genesis was not transient and it was not temporary.

556
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,780
It did not go on for a couple of weeks and then just naturally come back down.

557
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:38,980
That trying to sustain you in whatever your set point was, was persistent.

558
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:43,180
Now we think at least six years and probably throughout somebody's life.

559
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,470
Right. So these adaptations are not short term. They're quite long term.

560
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:52,240
If you look at these patients, are the actions of these patients, these are game show participants.

561
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:56,350
If you look at how much weight they regained,

562
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:02,340
that was also important to their adaptation because as they gain weight back, the adaptation decreased, right?

563
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:08,050
Because now they're getting back to their normal previous baseline weight and then that was getting them closer to where they were.

564
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:12,580
Right. So again, this is over the course of six years.

565
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:18,010
So another way I think kind of a nicer way, even though it's a little bit of a smaller study, is a paper that came out a couple of years ago.

566
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:24,010
So in this case, look, at what point is there like some sort of set point in your life or like your basal metabolic?

567
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:28,120
No. So we don't know. And it's a really good question of like, when is this established?

568
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:34,570
And some people think maybe that set point can like pick up but can't figure out, you know, we don't really know.

569
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,800
We know pretty well that it's probably established by the time you're about 30 or 40.

570
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:41,470
But where it's established in relative to adolescence, we don't know.

571
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:45,100
Part of the issue with that is it's quite hard to do these studies on adolescence.

572
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:49,120
It's hard to put analysis or study. We're going to intentionally cause them to gain or lose weight because of that.

573
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:56,260
But it's a really important question, and people are only now just really trying to study how individuals vary because as you can see,

574
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:59,590
if you look at these people, there's quite a lot of variation between these people.

575
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:02,979
This person was at like a -2000 calorie adaptation, right?

576
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:08,810
So there is some person to person variation here that seems to be important, but we don't really know what causes that person personality.

577
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:13,630
But it seems like it's pretty important to you end up with a lot of patient in situations where

578
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:18,040
someone maintains basically the same weight for their body composition changes substantially.

579
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:23,440
Does it become the same adaptation if they, you know, lose a lot of muscle and gain fat or vice versa?

580
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:29,970
So all of these measurements here are already adjusting for changes in that previous work, which is a really good point.

581
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:34,150
Right, because one of the reasons why your energy expenditure goes down when you lose weight is you lose that pre mass.

582
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:40,810
But this is on top of that. This is after accounting for the caloric restriction induced avalanches of happiness.

583
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:43,180
Yeah, that's really the point. Okay.

584
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:47,809
So this is a different study, which I kind of like because it's a little more generic, so it's a little complicated.

585
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:53,510
So I'm going to go through this in a better way. So they put everybody on a caloric restriction of like 20%, right?

586
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:55,790
So that it was then it was in patients that knew exactly what they were eating.

587
01:00:56,060 --> 01:01:02,180
They then measured their energy expenditure at baseline and then after one week of caloric restriction.

588
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:06,129
Right. So they really hadn't lost that much weight, 20% restriction over the course of the week.

589
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:10,910
You're not going to lose that much weight. But it was a way to measure sort of like how responsive is those?

590
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:20,260
Are those people's adaptive thermogenesis is start that sense of how different is their adaptive reconnaissance over the course of that?

591
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:26,680
And you can see it very, quite a lot. Right. So this person had a huge adaptation there, like energy expenditure went down at 400.

592
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:31,730
This person had like almost no adaptation. This person for some reason their energy expenditure increase a little bit.

593
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:36,380
So that initial short term. So this is kind of getting the Kenneth question like how can you measure this?

594
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:41,360
So this was over the very short term, they could measure and they saw this wide variation similar to this group,

595
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:44,090
also saw this wide variation in energy expenditure.

596
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:49,579
They then kept them on the caloric restriction, same 20% caloric restriction for another six weeks.

597
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:56,150
And what you can see is, is a very linear trend between how adaptive are you and how much energy did you lose.

598
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:00,410
So this person who had very little adaptation, these two people who had very little adaptation,

599
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:08,420
lost a lot of it because their metabolism decline as they lost weight for these very people up here, they had got quite strong.

600
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:15,410
So as they're as they started losing weight, their metabolism slowed very, very rapidly.

601
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:17,749
So that made for them weight loss much more difficult.

602
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:22,640
So they only had about 2 to 4% weight loss compared to these people, which had 10 to 15% weight loss.

603
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:26,450
Right. So this suggests that if we can measure somebody's adaptive thermogenesis,

604
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:32,360
we can actually probably come up with some good predictions of how effective caloric restriction are going to be for those people.

605
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:35,780
Right. And again, what's causing this baseline variation, we don't know.

606
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:39,800
But that would be another really helpful thing if we knew how these people varied from one another.

607
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:47,920
All right. Questions about that. Is this kind of area why things like yo yo dieting tend to be more damaging

608
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,460
just because you're kind of you keep hitting your body and it keeps doing it?

609
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:56,530
It could be. Although I think there's probably other reasons in terms of expansion and the adaptations

610
01:02:56,530 --> 01:03:01,000
like short term adaptations of fat storage that are probably more damaging but plausible.

611
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:06,430
Yeah, I think if you've been living in like an extreme calorie deficit for a long time,

612
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:10,959
like how long does it take for you to get like you have to go all the way back to your set

613
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:15,760
point in order to like get to a more manageable calorie deficit where you start to actually,

614
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,630
like, lose weight in a proper way. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

615
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:25,510
You're right. So, I mean, it's discouraging, but yeah. So like, if you lose weight, that deficit is going to keep persisting.

616
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:29,350
Right. So now you just have to restrict food intake more if you want to keep losing weight.

617
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:34,090
Right. Which is why I mean, there's a lot of reasons. That's one of the reasons why losing weight is so difficult.

618
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:37,270
Right? Because you might have been successful for a certain part, your body adapts.

619
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:44,460
And now to keep being successful, you have to keep getting more and more of an energy deficit at some point, which is going to be not sustainable.

620
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:49,280
Right. Because you're not this. I guess that's what I like to say.

621
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:53,479
Okay. So this is kind of exactly what I'm saying. This is just a bullet point.

622
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:57,200
So if you start off a negative energy balance, you'll have some loss of mass.

623
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:01,430
If you have negative energy health, it will have at least a negative energy balance, all because of the weight loss.

624
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:07,310
Usually this also causes reductions in battery mass. So all of these changes are in addition to reductions in factory mass.

625
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:13,390
But now, given the differences your equations have given you, you could already model what the changes in factory mass were due to.

626
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:20,210
Now, as you lose weight and lose battery mass, you're going to have a reduction in your energy expenditure,

627
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:24,570
which means your initial negative energy balance will be smaller than it was before.

628
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:29,180
Right. So maybe originally you were in a 200 calorie deficit. You would have an adjusted by 100 calories.

629
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:34,580
Now you're only 100 calories. Right? So the weight loss trajectory will decline over time.

630
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:42,110
So virtually every single lab in the world that says if you cut your calories, you lose weight at this rate does not take this into account.

631
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:46,430
Right. So like, for example, chronometer, which I quite like doesn't take this account.

632
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:48,650
MyFitnessPal doesn't take this. This is pretty important.

633
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:53,510
And I'll show you a graph on the next slide that shows how important it is, the one that I like.

634
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:58,570
And there's watch activities that are related to this in class this year is the Notify Me planner.

635
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:02,659
It does taking this into account so it estimates somebody's adapted from a genesis

636
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:05,960
based on baseline characteristics and takes into account to show this trajectory.

637
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,970
If you're like super in a public policy, which I'm like, absolutely not. But some people are.

638
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:20,870
Here's an example of why this might matter. So there was a sugar tax in I want to say New York might have been San Francisco.

639
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:25,460
I wrote in my notes somewhere, so where they estimated they were going to cut sugar by taxing sugar.

640
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:29,510
And they said, well, we're going to able to cut people's intake of sugar by this sugar tax by 20%.

641
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:35,320
And therefore, that's going to reduce the whole negative calorie deficit by 40 calories a day because they're not going to anything else.

642
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:42,680
I'm thankful instead of soda. And they projected they would get these people would get 10% weight loss over five years.

643
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:48,589
And that's because they presumed a linear trajectory. Right. They presume that 40 calorie deficit will be true and there'll be no change as we,

644
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:52,970
like, super successful and we still disappear and and not have the impact.

645
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:57,770
And if you model it with that static model of going up to 40 calories per day, you get the red line.

646
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:02,570
But if you include the dynamic model, which is the adaptation of your energy expenditure for the average person,

647
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:05,210
you get the much less impressive look,

648
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:10,700
which is like it a little bit of an effect, but we're talking like less than a kilogram effect from this particular intervention.

649
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:12,980
Again, like with my avocado example,

650
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:17,510
presuming they don't adapt by like not having soda instead of having like six more sugars in their coffee or whatever.

651
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,320
Yeah. So it's important.

652
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:25,280
So it's important when whenever we're thinking about any intervention that might cause weight loss, we always need to think about this adaptation.

653
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:33,350
Okay, you have 50 more minutes. So the last thing we're going to talk about is the relationship between energy intake and energy expenditure.

654
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:40,420
Because as I said on Wednesday, we're talking about energy and so forth is what is the actual relationship between.

655
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:46,220
I used to be in the Navy almost a lifetime ago, but for a while I was in the Navy.

656
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,240
And so this study was appealing to me because it was done on a bunch of, I believe,

657
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,719
Marines and what they did because they could tell exactly what they ate,

658
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,940
because the Marines like all the instructions and do what they're told,

659
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:00,830
they could measure what their energy expenditure was and they could measure how much they ate.

660
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:05,450
And on a day to day basis, there was zero relationship between these two things.

661
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,540
If you tried to draw some line through this, like scatterplot of nothing,

662
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:14,990
you would not draw a line because on a daily basis their energy expenditure had no relationship with how many calories they've earned.

663
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:19,579
So maybe these people here were doing a lot of like running and burning a lot of calories.

664
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:24,080
And these people here were like admirals and sitting on their desk and complaining that these guys are like not working harder.

665
01:07:24,830 --> 01:07:29,420
Those people were not adjusting their food intake on a daily basis.

666
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:33,620
However, if you average those people over the course of a week right now,

667
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:38,630
you look at their average weekly intake and their average weekly energy expenditure.

668
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:41,080
Now there's a very, very good relationship. Right?

669
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:46,190
So what this means is that we do adapt our intake to our expenditure, but we don't do it day to day.

670
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:49,790
We do it somewhere longer than a day, less than a week.

671
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:58,140
So if you over absenteeism, over exercise, if you exercise a lot, eventually you'll adapt with your energy intake, but probably not right away.

672
01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:02,479
Right. So if you start running and you weren't running before, you may not eat more on the first day you start running,

673
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,260
but over the course of a week you will probably eat more, whether you think about it or not, whether you know you're doing it.

674
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:12,650
Another way that looks at this is an asked about increased energy expenditure to lose weight.

675
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:19,160
So I would say the vast majority of the public probably thinks the best way to lose weight is to exercise more.

676
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:25,219
I feel like that's just more common. This is like not true. This is something more to hammer into you a thousand times over this semester.

677
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:26,570
This is absolutely not true.

678
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:32,750
There is very little evidence that increasing your physical activity will cause dramatic weight loss, and there's lots of studies about it.

679
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:36,680
But I'm going to go through one called the E mechanic randomized clinical trial.

680
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:42,829
So 24 we trial starting with overweight men and obese men and women and they group them into three groups.

681
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:47,090
So one year they said, do you think? And then one group they put into a medium match.

682
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:53,630
And when they put into a high exercise group. So for those of you who don't, you know, do a lot of calorie counting.

683
01:08:53,750 --> 01:09:00,320
Six, five calorie per day, increased physical activity is quite a lot. That is about the equivalent of going on a one hour run every single day.

684
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:06,050
Right. So that's a lot more that they do. And they followed these people up for, I want to say, six months.

685
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:10,160
So what they found here is there was pretty modest weight change here.

686
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:14,480
Right. So there was a little bit more weight loss that wasn't significant between the baseline group.

687
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:18,559
The group that was doing moderate is gluttony and the group that was doing heavy because of the

688
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,820
change was pretty small with a little more two kg and it was not statistically significant.

689
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:30,380
And again, this is the equivalent of sedentary people who are not exercising, going for a mile run every single day for six months.

690
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:33,170
So we're talking about a very severe exercise intervention.

691
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:40,400
The reason for that is because their energy intake increased pretty much exactly to match their energy expenditure.

692
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:43,610
Right. So these people were not specifically told to change their energy intake.

693
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:48,559
They were just told, do your prescribed exercise, but their energy intake increased to match.

694
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,100
And again, it was somewhat dose response that you can see in the control group because they didn't actually

695
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:55,160
have any change in their energy intake because they didn't have any increased pressure.

696
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:59,450
So even though they were thinking about it, they were increasing their energy intake.

697
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:06,319
Right. So again, this is very similar to the Marines example here where as their intake of as their exercise increases,

698
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,470
as their activity increases, they adapt by increasing them.

699
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:16,130
So the only time that physical activity is beneficial in losing weight is when it is also coupled with energy restriction.

700
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,760
Exercise alone almost never causes weight loss. Right.

701
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:24,220
Almost. I mean, I'm sure there are people out there that are top performing at a population level almost.

702
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:27,200
Right. And again, that's because of this adaptation.

703
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:33,200
And we don't know right now what the signals are from the exercise that causes us to want to eat more.

704
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:33,740
Right.

705
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:41,000
We don't know exactly how that happens physiologically, but something is happening that is increasing the appetite of people who start exercising.

706
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:47,480
Okay. So to be a little more positive because I realize I'm being a lot of a downer here, the last few slides are not wildly encouraging.

707
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,810
We're going to finish with one other thing, going back to the Biggest Loser cohort here.

708
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:57,920
So it turned out if you looked at the Biggest Loser cohort, some people were able to sustain their weight loss and some people were not.

709
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:01,559
Not surprising. If you put anybody in a weight loss thing, some people can sustain it.

710
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,240
Some people can.

711
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:09,890
Now, if you compare what was different between these people, the difference was not that they were able to more actively restrict their energy intake.

712
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:16,999
Right. You can see the change in their energy intake from baseline to six years later was the same between the two groups,

713
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:26,210
the people who were able to maintain weight loss. The distinguishing characteristic here is they had much, much, much higher physical activity.

714
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:31,160
Now, you may say, wait a sec, didn't you just say exercise doesn't cause weight loss?

715
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:36,290
And you're right. Exercise does not cause weight loss. Exercise maintains weight loss.

716
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:43,100
Right. If you lose weight and then you increase your physical activity, that is the best way to maintain weight loss.

717
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:47,570
And the reason that happens is because of that calorie deficit that you increase, that adaptive,

718
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:54,440
the re genesis that happened as you lose weight, those calories you lost and that adaptive, the re genesis, you replace those with exercise.

719
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:55,760
And if you can do that,

720
01:11:56,060 --> 01:12:02,030
then you'll keep the energy expenditure you'll be able to keep in the same negative energy balance and you'll be less likely to gain the weight back.

721
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:04,650
And this is not just true of the small Biggest Loser cohort.

722
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:08,810
There's a much larger study where they've looked at tens of thousands of people who've lost weight over the course of many,

723
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:13,790
many, many different studies. And always the distinguishing characteristic between people who are able to lose weight and

724
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:18,079
keep it off compared to people who lost weight and were not able to keep it off is their

725
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:23,270
level of physical activity and it's pretty girls responsive to is this consistent across

726
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:27,380
ways that people lose weight versus like going on a TV show versus like getting surgery?

727
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:32,450
Yeah. So this is. Yeah. So that larger study that I just mentioned, the National Weight Control Registry study is added.

728
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:37,580
You could lose weight from any literally any way that you lose weight. Right. So it's not it's not dependent on being yelled at by Jillian.

729
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:41,110
Feels like there's no coordination.

730
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:45,440
Okay. Like that. So, like I said, exercise is a little bit complicated.

731
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,160
Exercise is, of course, very healthy for you. I say this many times also over the semester, exercise is great.

732
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,620
Just because it doesn't cause you to lose weight doesn't mean it's bad.

733
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:58,040
But where it's useful in the context of energy balance is keeping weight off, not in the context of causing an energy deficit.

734
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:04,880
All right. That's it. That's all I have for you guys for this week. So enjoying your long weekend and back to Appetite.

735
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:07,160
And we're doing that next week.
