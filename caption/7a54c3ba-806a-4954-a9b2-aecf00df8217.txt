00:00:00,277 --> 00:00:09,217
Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the 57th edition of the Summer Session in Epidemiology at the University of Michigan.

2
00:00:10,717 --> 00:00:16,267
My name is Eduardo Villamor and I serve as director of the summer session.

3
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:29,047
This is the oldest uninterrupted epidemiology summer program in the country, so you're all most welcome.

4
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:33,577
This year we have over 200 participants from

5
00:00:34,657 --> 00:00:38,167
over 15 different countries enrolled in 21 courses.

6
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:44,797
There are two clusters of courses around specific topics.

7
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:59,197
Some of you may be enrolled in those clusters, and all our courses have a remote component, as you know, and some of them are also taught in person.

8
00:00:59,437 --> 00:01:04,987
So it's a very diverse experience that we are offering this year.

9
00:01:06,127 --> 00:01:14,857
The purpose of this brief meeting is to introduce our team and to make a few announcements about the

10
00:01:15,457 --> 00:01:21,367
mostly logistics of the summer session and obviously to answer any questions that you may have.

11
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:38,587
Our team: so the most important people for the next three weeks are Jody Gray, who is our program administrator.

12
00:01:39,217 --> 00:01:43,477
I don't know if we could highlight Jody or you could wave.

13
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:56,557
So there is Jody. And I'm sure many of you may have interacted with Jody in preparation for the summer session.

14
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:02,347
And we also have Maria Gilson, who is our program coordinator.

15
00:02:02,617 --> 00:02:07,057
If. Maria, are you somewhere?

16
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:12,397
Yes, there is Maria. All right, excellent.

17
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:18,757
And we also have Jessica Kolbe, who is our program assistant, and that is Jessica.

18
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:25,597
Our IT support expert is Joanna Kovacevich.

19
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:35,677
And she may not be with us yet, but she will be actively involved as well through the course of these three weeks.

20
00:02:38,707 --> 00:02:44,597
So the best way to contact any of us is via email.

21
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:54,967
We will be in and out of SPH during the summer session.

22
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:58,116
And you know, chances are we might run into each other.

23
00:02:58,117 --> 00:03:13,207
But if you need to reach us again, the easiest, most efficient way would be via email, and we will be happy to get back to you as soon as possible.

24
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:21,427
Now, every week,

25
00:03:21,427 --> 00:03:29,887
at the beginning of each course, there is a deadline for dropping or adding a course.

26
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:40,797
Sometimes you get to the course you wanted to take and perhaps after the first day you realize it may not necessarily be what you were looking for.

27
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:54,907
So if that's the case, that said, that's all right. And what you have to do is to contact our team, Jody and Maria, by 4:00 that day,

28
00:03:55,357 --> 00:04:01,837
the first day of class, to let them know that you want to drop or switch or add another course.

29
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:14,557
Now all our courses run on Canvas, which is the online platform that the University of Michigan uses for all its didactic, didactic purposes.

30
00:04:15,097 --> 00:04:20,076
And everything really happens through Canvas.

31
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:25,087
So all the course materials are accessed and available to you through this system.

32
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:36,787
You should all have received links of the Canvas from the Canvas system to the sites of each of your respective courses.

33
00:04:37,327 --> 00:04:40,146
If you haven't by for any reason,

34
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:51,517
please reach out immediately to us and we will make sure that you will have those links and will be able to access your courses.

35
00:04:53,417 --> 00:05:01,907
The Zoom links for accessing the courses remotely will appear in the Canvas sites.

36
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:13,817
So it's obviously very important that you will have access and all homeworks and any other requirements

37
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:21,677
or activities will need to be submitted online through canvas as well as with the materials,

38
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:28,697
slides, recordings, etc. You can also access through this system.

39
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:37,897
Each course will have a media assistant.

40
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:52,537
So in case there are issues with access or IT problems, while you are in class,

41
00:05:52,927 --> 00:06:01,297
you can reach out to the media assistant immediately who will be there to help you.

42
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:13,297
And if they cannot sort out the issue, of course they can reach you with IT and we will solve any problems immediately.

43
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:23,377
The media assistants for the courses that will be taught in person will be obviously

44
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:32,826
at the corresponding classroom in SPH and they will also be assisting with helping

45
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:37,236
connect and making sure that the people who are taking the course remotely are

46
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:47,257
able to participate in the course as those who are taking it in person textbooks.

47
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:59,347
Again, you should have received information through the canvas site or the syllabi of your courses as to which textbooks were required.

48
00:06:59,707 --> 00:07:09,786
And we very much hope you had a chance to acquire them, if not well, and you begin your courses

49
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:17,197
this week, we invite you to please review the textbook requirements and

50
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:23,587
get them as soon as you can. Now,

51
00:07:25,587 --> 00:07:29,177
some of you may be taking these courses for graduate credits.

52
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:42,467
And if that's the case, I would like to emphasize the importance of making sure you know what the grading requirements are of each of your courses.

53
00:07:43,307 --> 00:07:56,357
That should be clearly stated in the course syllabus, but if for any reason it's not, please very early in your course, the first day,

54
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:07,847
reach out to the instructor and request from the instructor de requirements a clarification on how your grade is going to be assigned,

55
00:08:07,877 --> 00:08:13,517
whether it is through homeworks or a paper or a project.

56
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:24,196
So this is very important because the courses run for a relatively short period and it's it's is key

57
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:30,977
that everybody can plan accordingly to complete the requirements and obtain their letter grade,

58
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:37,817
which is what will appear on your transcript. I believe.

59
00:08:40,177 --> 00:08:52,777
Course Evaluations. Hmm. You will have an opportunity to fill out an evaluation of each of your courses and of the session as a whole.

60
00:08:54,037 --> 00:08:59,887
Typically, on the last day of the last course that you may be taking.

61
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:09,397
So the instructors will provide you with 10 minutes for you to fill out those evaluations.

62
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:16,057
And I really would like to to ask you to please do fill them out.

63
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:18,637
We take your feedback very seriously.

64
00:09:19,027 --> 00:09:30,787
And I think that over the years, it has really helped us greatly to improve our session and to keep it at the highest possible standards.

65
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:37,596
So please, again, when when the instructor provides you with those 10 minutes to fill out the evaluation,

66
00:09:37,597 --> 00:09:49,567
do take the time and let us know what your experience was like, both for the specific courses and also for the for the session as a whole.

67
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:56,666
There will be two lectureships.

68
00:09:56,667 --> 00:10:05,137
We we every year we have between two and three high profile lecture ships in epidemiology.

69
00:10:06,987 --> 00:10:16,107
So this year we have our Schottenfeld lectureship next Wednesday.

70
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:21,107
And this Wednesday we have our Brachman Memorial lectureship.

71
00:10:21,507 --> 00:10:25,737
They are at 12:15 Eastern Time.

72
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:32,357
And they will be broadcast live via Zoom.

73
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:37,127
So again, if you are in campus, we invite you to attend.

74
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:48,377
The Brachman will be remote, but we will have a special room for those who may want to attend in-person.

75
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:54,047
And the Schottenfeld lectureship will be live, in-person at SPH.

76
00:10:54,787 --> 00:11:02,047
And again, both of them will be broadcast live. On the third week

77
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:08,477
this year, we also have a special presentation of a documentary

78
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:23,557
on epidemiology and it will also be announced and advertised in terms of the venue and details very soon.

79
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:27,307
So we also invite you to to consider attending that.

80
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:38,316
Are there any other items, Jody, Maria or Jessica, that I may have forgotten

81
00:11:38,317 --> 00:11:47,727
and you would like to add. >> I think you've covered most of it, Eduardo.

82
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:51,897
I just want to emphasize, first of all, good morning, everyone,

83
00:11:52,377 --> 00:12:00,087
and we look forward to you being with us and hope this is a really rewarding experience for you.

84
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:13,307
I just want to emphasize that, as Eduardo said, the best way if you find you need Maria, Jessica or I at any time, email is the most efficient.

85
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:17,697
We're sitting here monitoring our emails all day.

86
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:23,607
And so we'll respond quickly. So I just want to be sure you know that.

87
00:12:23,607 --> 00:12:28,047
And don't hesitate to reach out if you do need need us for anything.

88
00:12:28,137 --> 00:12:35,417
We're here for you. >> Excellent.

89
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:45,677
I actually found a couple of smaller things for those who may be taking courses in-person.

90
00:12:47,657 --> 00:12:57,437
So usually there are some post-pandemic changes in in some of the facilities we we used to have.

91
00:12:58,997 --> 00:13:12,017
So unfortunately, there is no place nearby to have lunch if you are to stay for the full extent of the day.

92
00:13:12,977 --> 00:13:22,966
But there is a small convenience market couple of blocks from SPH called the Strickland's Market.

93
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:32,237
And well, I guess you could probably get some, you know, snacks there if if if you need them.

94
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:36,617
There are also some vending machines around the School of Public Health.

95
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:41,447
I cannot vouch for the nutritional value of the products that they offer, but,

96
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:45,646
well, you know, it's a matter of of percentages, of course.

97
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:55,567
And at the University Hospital, there are many, you know, venues where you can certainly have a snack, take a coffee, etc.

98
00:13:55,577 --> 00:14:00,347
And the hospital is really a couple of blocks away from SPH.

99
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:03,887
Um. All right.

100
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:12,947
I guess without any any further ado from from our side, perhaps we'll be happy to answer any questions that that you may have.

101
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:17,717
Um. I think we have a.

102
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:27,117
Questions and answer module in zoom open for that.

103
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:39,567
>> I think we can ask people if anyone would raise their hand or just sort of let me know that you have a question by waving.

104
00:14:40,737 --> 00:14:43,857
Steve Modell has a question. Ben has a question.

105
00:14:45,227 --> 00:14:53,097
>> Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Villamor, I was wondering the in person courses, are they also online?

106
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,497
>> Yes. All the courses have an online component.

107
00:14:59,507 --> 00:15:02,617
So. Yes. Okay.

108
00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:16,243
>> Thank you very much.

109
00:15:16,243 --> 00:16:01,827
>> Any other questions or.

110
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:30,527
Yes. Nolaundron, yes.

111
00:15:33,427 --> 00:15:49,377
You may be muted. >> Of course I would be muted.

112
00:15:49,527 --> 00:15:55,017
My question was more about Canvas. So my name is misspelled by one letter.

113
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:58,436
Of course it would be the last letter of my first name. So how do I go in

114
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:01,826
just to edit that. I was going to send an email but since I'm here and I have you all.

115
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:06,027
>> Oh, we apologize for that.

116
00:16:06,027 --> 00:16:12,117
I'm sorry. So Jody or Maria, what would be the best way to fix that?

117
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:17,277
>> I can try to go in and fix it. I actually think it's going to be an IT question once we have you in,

118
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:23,777
but I will correct it if you just shoot me an email the correct way or what's wrong and I'll I'll take care of it quick.

119
00:16:24,537 --> 00:16:27,577
>> Thank you all so much and I'm really happy to meet you. Bye.

120
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:33,917
>> Happy to meet you. Thank you.

121
00:16:36,117 --> 00:16:40,166
>> Oh, yes. Caroline.  >> I think you may have mentioned this before,

122
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:47,486
but I just want to confirm there will be recordings provided of the lectures afterwards so that if we had to miss a small portion of one,

123
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:50,637
we are able to catch up. Okay. Yes.

124
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:55,677
For the for the duration of the of the courses there, the records will be available.

125
00:16:55,707 --> 00:17:12,217
Yes. All right.

126
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:17,496
It seems that there aren't any further questions.

127
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:23,687
eOf course, if any come up, by all means, as we said, do feel free to reach out to us.

128
00:17:23,707 --> 00:17:32,077
We'll be happy to assist you and well, without there being additional items.

129
00:17:32,497 --> 00:17:46,567
I welcome you again and wish you for a very rewarding experience and all the best in your in your learning experience through these three weeks.

130
00:17:47,497 --> 00:17:52,357
Okay. It's been a pleasure. Hi, everyone. Thank you very much.

131
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:55,686
Thank you all. So thank you. Bye bye.

132
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:56,347
Thank you.
