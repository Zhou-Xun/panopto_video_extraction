1
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay, good morning. Everyone that's got started this is our last date of the 3 week.

2
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Course I really appreciate all of you for staying with me throughout this 3 weeks.

3
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So, as we have a evaluation today, i'm gonna first continue with the logist regression lecture, so that people more people will join, you know, in a minute, and then we will conduct it policy by evaluation.

4
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So yesterday we talk about it just regression. So essentially, the logistical question is a generalization of linear regression, and the main difference is in the outcome type.

5
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Why change from continuous outcome to binary Hong Kong?

6
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Because this binder outcome introduce a specific link function, we've called a larger function to link the expected value of the outcome and the linear predictor to take care of many issues for download the the range of the outcome

7
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,000
always live between 0 and the one for probability, and also for you know the the variance is linked with the mean and many other issues.

8
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So. So the main change of this logic link is in the interpretation of interceptor slow.

9
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So the main main difference is the outcome is now 0 to one.

10
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And now we use this link, and the link will change the interpretation of the slope and intersect right.

11
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So now this flow will be the log off the prediction predicted value. give all the holders being 0.

12
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And now, that's the intercept and Now, the slope will be the log of ratio the slope for any specific whole variant will be log out racial when you change to that call very by while you on him keeping all other

13
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:53,000
poverty fixed so that's the main difference between a just regression or the and you see the interpretation of inter 7 and the slow.

14
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So this is a quick review we learned yesterday, and let me know if I have any questions.

15
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So we also talk about. We can use the regression to model 2 by 2 binary data when they expose both the explosion.

16
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'll come be binary with these 2 by 2 contenders table and the logist regression. When we apply on this table we will get the same odds rational ascoming, so that exponential of the slope they

17
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
promote this regression will be the same as the Os Racial estimate.

18
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
From this data, but that's just a simplified case of legislation.

19
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The largest regression can be applied to more general cases when the exposure is continues, or when there are more than one variable in the moment.

20
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Beyond this model hand up we talk about this example of alcoholism versus beer, and the cigarette tax rate. it's been different with this regression model demonstrate the interpretation

21
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
of different slope and the issue of confounding interaction.

22
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You know the fact modification, all of those carryover from polynomial linear regression, a module of just regression.

23
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So those are the same. the only thing change on the interpretation of the variables.

24
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And yesterday we were here. So remember, in linear regression we have something called R Square, which is the square of the correlation between the observed the Y and the predicted wife on the model.

25
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You know, just replacement, Because, observe, the line is binary.

26
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We can no longer compute this this number anymore, although some logist regression. They can do something similar to the pseudo elsewhere.

27
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Today we're gonna talk about another metric which is unique to binary outcome is called auc area under the curve.

28
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll talk about which curve with hardware here another name is the C.

29
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Statistics, c. standpoint corners. So see Statistics and Aoc.

30
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
They mean the same thing. So yeah, you can see this many times right? different time.

31
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
A lot is used by different people, but they actually mean the same thing.

32
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Statistics. So the idea is that once we fiddle the this regression model, we can use the model to make prediction on the probability of why being 0 1.

33
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But then, based on that probability, we can take a cut off to really predict the Y to the one you can really predict the y to be 0 1.

34
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And then there's observed the Y. being 0 one Then we could have a correct prediction, or an incorrect prediction, and the incorrect tradition can come me the false positive and the polynomial so in

35
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:29,000
general. For example, in this case, in the alcohol data fact, if we use our affiliate logic, regional model, computer P.

36
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Hat for every single observation based on the X. I know we use the cut off of 0 point 0 9, 5.

37
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Who cares about alcohol, alcohol right Don't ask me where this call come from, because it's always arbitrary, but with most likely you know, pick a call out to balance the positive versus the

38
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:59,000
positive versus the positive. So we've we we make a prediction I find a prediction we'll always have to pick a call out to balance the 2 type of arrows.

39
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So the color itself is all different. So once we pick a cut off, we'll make this have a nice big you know prediction on the Y being 0 one and corresponding to the true y being 0 one could make the income error in this particular

40
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
case we clock. we correctly classify 77 point, 3% alcohol.

41
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I mean the true party rate is very good. However, the in the Non Hollywood also awesome. Colossie.

42
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Fine, 75% an hour alcoholic to be alcohol.

43
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Those are quite high pop thoughts as well. Right? So how do we summarize predict?

44
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You know, a cloudifier like this, like a logic regression.

45
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But this whole ausc idea apply to any kind of a classifier for binary data. there, you know, for those of you who learn machine learning.

46
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
There are all sorts of machine learning tools like the poor vector machine, like, you know, going to be parting.

47
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
They work just like logist regression. They can make prediction.

48
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Sometimes they could make a battle of addiction, something they make a worse prediction.

49
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
How do we compare different pre classifiers? right?

50
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So because this false positive rate and false and a true profit rate, they go against each other, and the actually they don't go to me.

51
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If the false party degree in the false negative rate, they go against each other.

52
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The false positive rate and the true positive rate. they actually, you know, go along each other.

53
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If you want to increase the true positive rate, you want the true power, it will be 100%.

54
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Then your fast father will also be very high, Right? So eventually, again, depend on how long?

55
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Because you can always show the color so that you have a two-party rate of one.

56
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But their fault probably will also be one. So similarly, if the color is so high that your 2 party rate, you know your fault. Other rate is 0.

57
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Then you have 2 polynomials. also. Do you want to pick a good cut-up right?

58
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So because they they both continuously change the kind of part-up. So we actually put on the curve.

59
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We call it receiver operating characteristic per So this current is got a rock curve of roc curve.

60
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's not specific to legislation you apply on any classifier or binary data.

61
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So essentially, we draw things like this: the false part, the rate on X access, the true positive rate on the on the Y-axis.

62
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Okay. So the true positive rate is also caught from time for the sensitivity. The false body rate is called the one minus the specificity.

63
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But nevertheless. So there are different net terminology, always right.

64
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So the idea is that you want to tune your you know.

65
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Vary your caller. so I you got a curve out of it Right So, because every call i'll give you a different closet finder, and then you've got a curve all of it.

66
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So when you have a curve here, I show a perfect occur.

67
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The blue one. Basically, you go all the way to the top and then go fly.

68
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So the idea is that it's very trivial to have both files, all different to automatically 0.

69
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,000
How do you achieve that? You just navigate anything to be positive, and that will That's trivially both rate is 0.

70
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Similar. it's trivially both for it to be why just declare everything to be positive.

71
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But these are useless. Priscilla curb connecting this lower bottom and the proper lower, lower, left, and upper right corner by the curve, is the operating curve of your classifier.

72
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So a perfect classifier will have this black curve basically go straight up, then go flat.

73
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Which means, you, you know, basically for all the caught up, except for the preview.

74
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:34,000
One of all the part of you have a purpose take you all way back to 2,000.

75
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm sorry if you ask the question yeah if you ask questions.

76
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Please feel free, but you know otherwise. Please meet yourself. Thank you very much.

77
00:15:46,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So this particular blue car is the is. the curve is the rock curve for roc curve, for a perfect closing part, in the sense that almost all the call options have the trivial one with give you a clue.

78
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
How they bring the one at 500 to 0 which is a perfect problem.

79
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Usually you Don't you're not this lucky right so the idea is that you want to curve to get as close to this blue live as possible.

80
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Okay, so. but how do we quantify performance of positive fire?

81
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
We use this area under the curve. So you essentially is a Uc.

82
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Is the area under the rock rocco so now the area under the curve is one, so that's a perfect classic variable.

83
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You'll have a Oc. one Remember what we're trying to use Aoc to quantify the performance of the logic regression model for prediction, which is the same purpose of all R squared Remember R.

84
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Squared has a range from 0 to one right here we don't have our square anymore.

85
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So we use a Uc. We also want aoc proper rate from 0 to one.

86
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:59,000
This is the worst classified. One is perfect classify. So in this case the first classifier will have area under this black, the blue curve to be one, because this is just a unit.

87
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Square. the area is one, and then, if your car is diagonal, which means your true value rate, the fourth value is always equal, and this a customer.

88
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
With this rock curve we have a Uc. of one half 0 point 5 right?

89
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Because area under this particular black a blue line is 0 point 5.

90
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So what kind of closet are we achieve about aos 0 point 5. Well, we don't have a diagonal rock per This is the case when you basically don't even need to look at the the predictor you just randomly flick a

91
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:45,000
call I may make you know classification. Okay, when you don't really look at any information from your data.

92
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You just make random gas. You have a car of rock car with 0 point 5.

93
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So essentially. if a classifier has a roc above point 5, which means you're doing better than random gas.

94
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If you're classified as a lc smaller than a point of 5, which means you're doing even worse not random.

95
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yes, which is not something you would like. So these are different from on Our Square in the size.

96
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
0 means your the worst. I have a possible class of are.

97
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You always make all the prediction wrong. Think about even the random guys, we've got half of the prediction right right.

98
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:29,000
But if you always make the prediction wrong, they don't have a wrong car with 0, so so the Aoc actually has some more practical interpretations of probability.

99
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So Aoc, remember, is always a number between 0 and one right.

100
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
One means perfect 0 means worst possible 0 point. 5 is random.

101
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Guess. So what a Oc. really satisfies the probability exactly that's right. If we randomly pick up alcoholic and or not alcoholic, you know our data set.

102
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So basically that's a positive case and the negative case is that i'm done.

103
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Our classifier will look at both of them look at their data.

104
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Look at their predictor. Apps i'm trying to predict the probability for each of them to be alcoholic. I said the Bellfield got a P.

105
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Key, one and P. 2 pi. So if our classifier give a higher probability for the outcoholic?

106
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
No, no, no alcohol. No. we think they are from Florida.

107
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Basically we write to have a hollywood's higher probability than the now as a holiday case, you know, without looking at the why we're only looking at Alright.

108
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So that's a good case. otherwise if our classifier give a lower piece for the alcoholic than not on what is a discordant case.

109
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So the A Uc. is the probability. So our classifier give a concordant case.

110
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Okay, if a Oc. is one which means our classes are always run.

111
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The alcoholic higher than any now alcohol, because this is a random pair.

112
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
If Aoc is 0, which means our costs are always run.

113
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The alcoholic. The law of the holly which is way wrong.

114
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:13,000
If aolc's, point or 5 which means essentially our class varies, It's just flipping coin to run them, which is just a random guess, right?

115
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So you can. You can get a Oc. Point 5 without even looking at the data.

116
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Are you just running them gas, so that's the what aoc stands for so essentially.

117
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's best for you know the chance that all classifier will correctly write the alcoholic above the non alcoholic, given their acts.

118
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So now You've got intuition why we use the eoc right? it's not really.

119
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
We just want to do the under area under the crop.

120
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The area under the car is very intuitive, but they also have a probability.

121
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Interpretation.

122
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It turns out that our the classify the logic regression model we build based on the the beer tax rate for predicting alcohol.

123
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
If you really plug it in, we actually got aoc of 0 0 point 5 Oh, 5, hey?

124
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:15,000
He'll see the the rock her phone here is indistinguishable from the 5 more which means the logist regression model.

125
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,000
We fit it, based on this data, it's almost as good as the random guys.

126
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So basic one saying, using the beer tax rate for that individual to predict whether that individual is alcoholism or not.

127
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Alcohol it's no better than just randomly this, this variable is not pretty predictive in this model for the outcome, which is also consistent with the very high P.

128
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Value and the lowest vote. So this variable doesn't really contribute much is the same as just randomly cast

129
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Well, that's what so essentially the conclusion is that using a logic recorder model on this data set is now very helpful.

130
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You may be, the data is not sufficient, Right? Maybe you need to look for other variable to predict, or you need to try other more specific models either way.

131
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But this particular model on this particular variable is not really useful, and there are actually statistical tests.

132
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So you want to say, say no. Aoc of 0 point.

133
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
5. 5 apparently, is not any better than 0 point. 5, right?

134
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
But if you have a positive fire, have you got an Ac.

135
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Of 0 Point 6. I would drive here right so you buy for if you're classified as a curl like this.

136
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Then that's probably you know 0 point 6 right and the code like this.

137
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Maybe 0 point 7. Okay, this maybe 0 point 8 and this may be 0 point 9, right?

138
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm saying your real real class apart, may have aoc of any number, if you's below 0 point 5 is useless right?

139
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
By What if you gather Aoc 0 point? 6. Oh, 0 point 7.

140
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You want to remember the Aoc. it's also a statistic also depend on the data.

141
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's also random. So it turned out that aoc also has a sample distribution.

142
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So this some point distribution idea, apply to anything you compute from the data, which means that actually there is a disable path.

143
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Once you have the password. you have the data there's a disable test and test whether your aoc is significantly more than 0 point 5 or not.

144
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Okay, So you sadly you can pass whether you're your your class vary is significantly better than random guests, or if I even pass by the Aoc, it's a little bit larger than a pivotal, for example or you

145
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
know they're not. Now there are a lot of risk calculator right?

146
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
If you you go online, for example, you can. You can get this lung cancer risk type of layer.

147
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,000
They ask you your age, your family history of cancer but you're a smoker or not know how many pack you smoke many things like this.

148
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Finally they tell you, Oh, your probability of getting long has the next year.

149
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Is this much you're probably getting all cancer the rest of your life?

150
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Is this much right? There are many calculator for different diseases like this online.

151
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
They don't give perfect prediction right because they're just a predictive.

152
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Some of them are people using, which is regretting all the from large coal data.

153
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So you know, figure out a new way, development new or better classified.

154
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You want to show you a better than a state of arm, right?

155
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
What you need to do is that you apply yours and the state of R on the same data set.

156
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Maybe the state of our calculator predictor Give Aoc of, say, 0 point 7, and yours got Lc: 0 point 7 5.

157
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I know you can run a pass on your set. 0 point.

158
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,000
7 5 is significant, larger than the other one right so That's the demonstration showing you probably better pretty predictor not a state of art.

159
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So that's usually what people do in your paper you know building a logic, regression, model or other model for the prediction disease risk giving giving covariance a lot of research.

160
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I like along this line. So here we got a aoc of 0 point 5 5, using only beer tax, right?

161
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You might wonder what if we add another covariant model?

162
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And this is the logistic worker model, using both peer test and the cigarette has.

163
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Now we got aoc of this model of 0 point 5, 1, 5.

164
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So usually when you'll add a new predict in your model your Aoc will increase, but very just like R Square.

165
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But there's no guarantee Okay, most likely will increase but they may actually decrease by any case.

166
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I don't really believe this is much better than random guess Anyway, i'm not running the pathway. I can't say for sure, from my experience this is no better than the random guys of 0 point.

167
00:25:47,000 --> 00:26:01,000
5. So essentially the rule of form you might say what is the use for A. You'll see the rule of thumb is that you know Aoc of 0 Point 6 is barely useful because it's no better than random Guess right it's

168
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:11,000
better than nothing. but in in a practical application you have to have Aoc, maybe 0 point 6, 5, or 0 point 7 to be really reasonably useful. right?

169
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So that you don't make too. much mistakes you know prediction, and you'll see a point 8 is typically better once you've got a Oc.

170
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Point 8, I think. most likely it's useful in practice he will see Point 9 will be very, very good.

171
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Well, that also depends on the nature right? some of the prediction you don't wanna make a lot of mistakes. Some of them you can make of all those things. For example, you know, a lot of the as far as I know, right from a

172
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
limited knowledge of the medical practice, or based on things like this, based on prediction.

173
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
For example, you know, when some some mother is pregnant right, they will use the calculator who not hold on the age.

174
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
You know other things like to calculate the chance of hiding.

175
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
For example, down some for the for the kid to have a dancing room right?

176
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Because to, really have that, you need to do that. Do the your basic path.

177
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Have a little chance of having a miscarriage. right?

178
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So they have to balance the the person. account. right If your chance of having a, you know. genetic problem feed us is very low, then they they don't actually recognize it.

179
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Do the genetic path, because that itself is in basic. But now there are a number in basically path where they only take the the block right rather than the you know your basic one.

180
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
But basically there, you have to make a judge based on the predictor right?

181
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
What's the chance, you know there might be a genetic thing going on that hugely?

182
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Depend on the age of the of the mother. There are also cases, for example, you know.

183
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh, after some 8, right after, for example, 40, there is some particular 45.

184
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I think the now is 45. They do the call recto sort of a scope, right to to check the call up to cancer at more than 50.

185
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You know everybody do like, you know. Every women do like a mammal ground, or things like those. right?

186
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So all is caught up or based on ridiculous right? because after after a certain age, especially, you know, after a certain age, your chance of having particular diseases is high enough so that worse the rest of doing particular tests right?

187
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So basically to balance, you know, pros on account, you have to do the prediction like this.

188
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And then, if you have, like a family history of particular disease, the age, how have you drop right?

189
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Because with the half panel this is history. your chance is higher than people of the same age.

190
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Right. So all of this of medical decision, you know, decision tree.

191
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So many times are underlying there's a prediction system like this, based on the best knowledge of the prediction for yourself.

192
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Right right now. Most of the prediction are based on very general predictor, like age or family history of gender, just like this.

193
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Right. but, as you can imagine, those kind of predictions are very good.

194
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Usually the the Aoc under those prediction are for example 0 point 7 0 point 8, something like that.

195
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's useful, but it's not perfect so on an individual level The prediction could be way wrong.

196
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:13,000
That's why, you know people are trying to improve the prediction by incorporating more and more mobile markers right like a genetic markers right?

197
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Those are very individual markers, and those kind of things hopefully can make much better individual level prediction.

198
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Right. And now that will improve a lot in the whole, because nobody want to do all sorts of the past every year, right?

199
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
If they have a much better prediction on the individual level, then we can avoid a lot of tests.

200
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
So that's all I want to say about just your question and how you'll see, you know, prediction so on so forth.

201
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Any questions before I wrap up. This is the very last lecture, very last slide.

202
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So while appreciate and congratulate you, you know.

203
00:29:46,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Stay. stick with me through through here. Any question

204
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Okay, Thank you very much. So now we are we have enough people here. let's go ahead.

205
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You know. Go to the homepage so i'm I was told. I need to reach are 15 min and cost every one of cost.

206
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
On the last day, you guys time for the doing this course and program evaluation.

207
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So what you can do is that you can go to the homepage of the course.

208
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Click this link you'll see 2 evaluation There's a course evaluation you need to fill out for every single course you take of the summer school when you go in there.

209
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:57,000
There's a I think, selection box you know. Pick Basically, you pick this one right and then go ahead with the evaluation. and then, if you have another course in the afternoon, you need to do it again, for that one another

210
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:05,000
problem, you evaluation is for the whole summer program, and if this is your If you don't have a class this afternoon, then please do this as well right now.

211
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,000
If you have a call this afternoon, then you Do this in the afternoon, That's what I was told apparently.

212
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:23,000
If you want to do it now, I won't stop you But I was told that you need to do the one at your last class of the summer program, and we appreciate all your feedback as always.

213
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:30,000
That help us improve the course so this is the first first time I'm teaching this I always incorporate feedback from, you know.

214
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Previous years, try to improve as much as I can, so I I believe the same for other instructors.

215
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So we appreciate the time. in the evaluation is totally anonymous.

216
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So please be different. You know about about what you feel about the you know.

217
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
How how can we improve? So I I will give you 50 min on this, and hopefully, that's enough.

218
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And then we'll continue from there thank you very much

219
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Okay. for someone access still denied. Let me. so sorry for that.

220
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Let me see if that house right? So this is just a link.

221
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
How about? I just post a link in the chat Hopefully, that works.

222
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:50,000
See if you can use this. This is all I can do, and also the link for the program.

223
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Evaluation that's the link for the 2 survey Awesome?

224
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Yeah, and that thanks, i'm really really glad I don't hear that, you know.

225
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Sometimes you just have to hack all the way through, you know.

226
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I told them they're usually on day one it's still then fix it until the name appreciate that

227
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So there's a question asking about How long the closet here, and the recording will be outline.

228
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I don't know the the exact answer is that it will have the program, but as far as I know, the camera side is always there.

229
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So I still have the camera iphone 4 years ago, and I I I don't know whether they you know you still have access after that one, but personally I don't remove them, and the the recorded electro ivd you have to

230
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
like 3 or 6 months zoom will, deliver to save storage.

231
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And the program is asking us to give them a copy, so that if they can keep the recording forever, but I don't know whether they will provide access to you forever.

232
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So again, it's a better question asking them because I they stored on on the University server, which I have no control of.

233
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
It is very big storage, if you want to dial things, you know.

234
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I think you could do it now for that. You know you people things on your own computer.

235
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Of course, that can keep for another week. The recording will be pretty big.

236
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Nevertheless. so the answer is I I don't know the exact number.

237
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Sorry about that, please, Stephanie. malic tomorrow everything will disappear.

238
00:38:44,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That's not the case, but at some point I did you

239
00:39:34,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Yeah, let's give like a 5 more minutes I hope that's not if you're finished already, you know feel free to take a break

240
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Okay. I was wondering if, everybody has finished. Do anyone need more time

241
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Awesome. Thank you very much. for your real time. Alright!

242
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
So for the rest of time today. we're gonna go over exercise this.

243
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:19,000
So we're first gonna review the lecture 10 I mean

244
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Open it also. by the way, yeah, there's no well, Simon, today anymore.

245
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:42,000
So if you turning everything, then it's all all set and for those of you taking for non-credit, I believe the the program will either email or male or both to give you the certificate

246
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:53,000
for completion. I don't know when maybe in a few weeks. so they will let you know if you have question, you know, regarding that, or even receive that feel free to to to let us know.

247
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:06,000
But you really you know they control that. and for those of you who take 4 credit. I am going to some Major Grace hopefully over this weekend, because I'm, i'll have a travel starting next week.

248
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,000
But I believe the program will not post it until maybe a a few weeks later.

249
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
So if you don't see your grade next week is totally normal.

250
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It's probably take them until later. august the positive But you you are going to receive your grid Ivd in August. I you know. if later on, that you still don't feel great.

251
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Let me know. let them know we'll fix it and as long as you you participate in your summit.

252
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Everything. you should gather fairly. We know fine great that I can.

253
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Problem is, I I couldn't promise a hey?

254
00:47:44,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Or a possible heavy one. But yeah, you really need to sort of do really bad together, being or see. Okay, any question regarding any of these logistics issues

255
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Okay. So now let's review the the quiz so number one.

256
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Again the multiple choice, like everything to do with modeling your regression Number one.

257
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
The error are normally distributed with the variance that is highly related to each X.

258
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Variable. the coffin barriers. Is it correct?

259
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
So. so remember, the multiple integration has 3. Thank you very much.

260
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Normality, constant variance, and linearity. right So compton variance is the number 2, assumption, and the normality is the number one assumption and a linearity number 3 assumption.

261
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
There's one flight, so this one all the x variable must be independent of you.

262
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Each other. The Independence assumption we that was the last don't have to be independent.

263
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Actually, the acts are usually correlated with the among themselves, and also with the outcome.

264
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Why, that's why we you know we run a regression if everything is independent.

265
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:24,000
There no point running a regression, and also the apps usually are correlated, and that's where the confounding might happen.

266
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Right confounding happens because one X is cited with the other.

267
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,000
X. in the same time part of it will always want right that's when confounding happens.

268
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So this independent function is not, required for writing a lot of voting regression.

269
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Any question.

270
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Alright Question 2 is also a multiple choice of all confound visible compound.

271
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I'm founding the confounders in the multiple in regression will have will all have pivot less than 0 point 0 5.

272
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Anyway.

273
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:23,000
It's false. Hmm. Why, is that because you you said in the lecture, that even go some confounding present a P.

274
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Value less than 0 point 5. But if you know that if it really is the compounding, it's better to keep it so.

275
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I think it's false thank you very much you'll absolutely.

276
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,000
So yeah, the pivotal itself is random, so every time you collect a different data.

277
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
You have to change right so there's no guarantee that anything has a few battle that's that point. Oh, fine!

278
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
They could be. Lack of power could be randomness in data.

279
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Could be anything. So you know, we use key value to make our best judgment.

280
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
But we could be low. Keep that in mind. So this is incorrect.

281
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
So the definition of can follow. Remember, I showed you a Wikipedia page right?

282
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
The Confounder is something which will be both, you know.

283
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Associate with another variable exposure; also the outcome which confuse you right.

284
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Whether the the region or between the exposure and outcome is real or not.

285
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Or, you know, basically confounded play that role. But how strong the region it is, How big the samples have is all of them play about, you know, final keyword.

286
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Many things, and number 2: If x 2 is a compounder of association between x one and y, then we must use multiple linear regression to examine the association to x one.

287
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And y Is that correct?

288
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Yeah, I think it's correct. Yeah, thank you that's what we learn.

289
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I. multiple renewed aggression can help us to see by including actually in the model how much change between the relationship of X one and one.

290
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:09,000
If that relationship stays the same, that we are more comfortable because actually it's not been bounding much at all, but without relationship change a lot that we need to be cautious.

291
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Right. Oh, 3 a can find. There is a variable that all the association between 2, all the variables.

292
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:26,000
That is pretty much what that Just that right? It is the, you know, definition compound.

293
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
By the way, confounding is rarely unusual in case control studies.

294
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Anyone want to say something that's false that's false? Thank you.

295
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Yeah. and founding his company has nothing to do with your study design.

296
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Right I can find it everywhere that's why when you will be careful.

297
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:51,000
That's why we need to think about all the possible confounders between the exposure and outcoming interest and include them.

298
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:05,000
New York data collection and then include them New York data analysis to see there, in fact, how big of a public they are right, whether the particular conclusion between the exposure outcomes sort of a persistent even though you include the

299
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,000
confounded email model

300
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I think it's one typical pace is that when you write a paper you want to design a study, collect the data and that data right on paper, you say, Oh, we find association between some exposure and I mean an Allc which may

301
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,000
be interesting, right? Another reviewer might ask, Have you thought about, you know? possible?

302
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Confounding due to blah blah blah, I will answer.

303
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
You know, the best answer will be, Yes, we thought about that, and we include them in our.

304
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:42,000
You know, regression model, and the the association between exposure outcome of interest persist, you know, even after adjusting for container, and that's the best answer.

305
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Pretty much I can think about you, can give back to the your other reader means you are a thoughtful right? that's still doesn't completely solve the pace, because there could be other companies that were thought about.

306
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
There could be, you know, more complicated model There could be you know interaction or other things.

307
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
You're missing from a model right because you just pick one model parties.

308
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:08,000
You did you know back so that's a very important hey? doctor?

309
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Who can I say that? for same issue confunding is relative rarely in and issuing cohort studies.

310
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Then in case control studies. Yeah, confounding is compounding doesn't care about our study design, you know we do case control study, usually because we are dealing with rare disease where co-host study is not is not you know very

311
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:49,000
costly packet, but compounding he's confounding It doesn't care about the type of outcome it doesn't care about the type of study design and confounding this very I was like everywhere in

312
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:56,000
observational in epidemiology studies, because, you know, you can think about all the Arab, or carted with other variables. Right?

313
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
So pretty much components everywhere, so have to be locked for that.

314
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:07,000
But doctors here, in case country studies, you have a better administration of those concerns.

315
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Right, because no, not really

316
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:23,000
To control for controlling. you just need to be thoughtful. Yeah, think about all the possible confounder and and collect the data. right?

317
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
So regardless case control or Covid, you do the same.

318
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Actually your data analysis. he's the same regard as your study did not. It's only the interpretation in case control study.

319
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,000
You cannot estimate population level risk. you can only study off ratio, but you call us that.

320
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:48,000
You can do both. So Case control study is not actually as as good as covar Study right?

321
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Because you cannot evaluate population level risk, and also yours.

322
00:55:51,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Usually usually case can. No study is because you, you know, you enroll by outcomes. Right?

323
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Then, where the exposure probably happened in the past, you have to go back and take it up.

324
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:15,000
So because kitchen study is is usually right perspective. You are subject to more kind of bias in data collection, and so cova study is more reliable.

325
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:22,000
But his case and case control study is more cost effective or for rare disease.

326
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:37,000
That's that's the difference I have not included a lot of things you're welcome any other question here

327
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Yeah, many times, you know, some people conduct conduct a small case control study, find something interesting.

328
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Then they can write a grant proposal to plan for a larger scale. Cohort Study to validate that right?

329
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Because what you find case, mental study would be real book with all. also come from different kind of recall bias, you know all the time selection bias, because you pick your own.

330
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:05,000
You pick your own cases right, and to find those cases.

331
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
It's not. It's hard to be randomly selecting cases. Usually people just work with some hospital.

332
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:15,000
They they have a connection with right. So the cases are usually biased.

333
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Right so It's it's fun that it's interesting to find some association I have to be aware there could be still left in my right.

334
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
What kind of bias i'll recall bias that's?

335
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Why usually people design a larger scale cobalt study to validate what you find in the case control study.

336
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:36,000
If that's validated that give people a lot of trust or confidence, right?

337
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:44,000
So essentially this observational study, right, is subject to all sorts of a problem, but people do it for for convenience. Right?

338
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:53,000
And then what really give you trust i'll give you confidence is that many different groups independently conduct different kind of study, you know.

339
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Repeatedly find the same association, and then, after considering all sorts of confounding the association, still consists, and then, with some experimental evidence, say in clinical trials, or in animal study, or in other things, you know, also sort, of

340
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:18,000
the support of the same. hypothesis, you know, with all piece of evidence together, people gain getting confidence.

341
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:27,000
The common. And now we're really come come from one study of course, one, you know, wild design study large sample size was sorry. Bob.

342
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Hi qualified. You know, investigators will give people a lot of confidence, but personally, I only trust something if it has been independently validated by a different group in maybe in a different country.

343
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Right a lot of times if you tell me okay you'll find something.

344
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
And then you tell me that only appear in one hospital, in one populator.

345
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I would be very suspect you know how suspicious there's no reason that's very limited, right. If something is real, it should be.

346
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Why are the applicable in other places as long

347
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Yeah, feel free to let me know if you have any question.

348
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Now, question number 3. This is about a modeling your right and fit to read the table. Right?

349
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:27,000
This is the table summarizing multiple in your regression for rare State level pharmaceuticals already may or function.

350
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,000
You know we have seen this right is the day. So the question is so.

351
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Suppose we have 2 States, and they have the same level for our ownership, but they differ by 2 percentage points in their rate of female parallel or a power operated suicide.

352
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Then how many percent? Excuse me, How many percentage points?

353
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I expect to different in there rate of male fire on suicide.

354
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
So the male fire also is great. Yeah.

355
00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:01,000
To our exposure. So anyone else to pick the answer is it a single choice.

356
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I think it's more than 5. Why, is that yeah I think it's the put hands on the slope of female.

357
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,000
So it's yeah. which is 2 times 3.4, 2, 3.

358
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Thank you Marma, and that's absolutely correct right so this is what you're looking for.

359
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
We have 2 unit change in females which are rate.

360
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,000
The changing outcome is 2 times the slow so that's more than 5%.

361
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Thank you. And finally, this is again a multiple choice. Select all about Montgomery.

362
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Truth in the model selection, selecting a final multivariate regression model, require personal judgment as well as statistics.

363
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I would say, this is a correct that's what I call on conference.

364
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:57,000
There are many statistical tools help you to pick. Well, none of them is sort of a part.

365
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Sometimes they give you inconsistent conclusion. So in the end you have to have your own judgment.

366
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:12,000
But nevertheless the tools are useful, Right? But this is the person who use the tool which is, make the final final call.

367
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,000
So number 2. The model is greater number of significant coefficients should be selected.

368
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Not necessarily right. because the number of things that coefficient really nothing is random, right?

369
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,000
It show something, But, after all, is random. It depends on, say, like what? Yes, that showed right.

370
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Even if X. both X. one and X 2, both of them are associated with.

371
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Why highly significant? Well, if you include them both in the model, they both become insignificant because they cast all each other.

372
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:49,000
So you know the number of significant qualifications it's not really the final thing.

373
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Second, the variable X y was not like. Let me let me see.

374
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
And by myself, you know as simplely numerous amount of therefore, which I'm.

375
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,000
A monumental model. I said, actually 9 through that one again.

376
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:18,000
This is not true. it is not a good by itself it may become significant when, together with others, and whether it's a little or not, on the first of all, why the variable is the good or not should never be the only reason you're including the

377
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:25,000
model. So the the pivot itself tell you something but it's not everything.

378
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Not for the last. People still pick their models right?

379
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And many people they pick model, using one approach, where, for example, you have, like 10 different variable.

380
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
You flat you don't want to put them all with all of them want to pick a few right?

381
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:49,000
So many people use. You know there are many software can help. You pick a few, for example, forward connection, backwards, and so on, and so forth.

382
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:59,000
But some people use this approach where they run regression one by one or each of the variable, and then say, out of the 10 they got 5, 6, and everything.

383
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Then they go. How pick the 5 and then build. another multiple regression model, And that's their final model, You know.

384
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I'm not saying that's the best approach but it is a reasonable approach, and many people take it, cause you have to end up with some some model.

385
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Right. So some people take that approach I would say don't be too mechanical, you know.

386
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Model selection, right? give some thoughts that's more more fun right and more more reliable ones.

387
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:41,000
And finally, the model is higher. R. Square should be selected again.

388
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:48,000
This is not true, because our Square is helpful. Bye, bye, everything right. When you include the garbage variable, your model.

389
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,000
You also increase our square by a tiny bit alright. So our part is helpful.

390
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Help you to know how well the model is parish with them.

391
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Rely on hardware solving right, you should rely on anything definitely.

392
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,000
The tools are only useful when you use them wisely.

393
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Alright, thank you very much that's all for the lack true hand quit any question before I Rob hop

394
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Okay. So now let's take a break for 10 min and for the rest of time.

395
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Today we're gonna first do the eleventh lecture you 11 quit, although it's you know it's not part of the great. but you know it's helpful to do it.

396
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Then, if we have time, we kind of do one of them, maybe one of the project, and then maybe we don't have time to finish everything.

397
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
But, you know, I already posted all the answer Keys for all the projects right?

398
01:04:49,000 --> 01:05:19,000
So feel free to look at them if you want happiness So let's take a 10 min break and come back out there 9 40, Thank you.

399
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Professor Jean. Yes, I was just curious I know you said

400
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:49,000
You're gonna work on grades this weekend and they won't be available until late August, .

401
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I don't know when they they you know I I will I will send them this weekend, but usually take them couple of weeks for post.

402
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,000
It. Oh, okay, so on. canvas we'll be able to see it.

403
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
And then, like it'll officially be on our transcripts by August.

404
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Is that what you mean or like? We will see normally on your on your, I think.

405
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:19,000
If you am student, or or something like that you have this we were in access where you'll see your Grace right?

406
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Yeah. The formal one, I think, will take a couple of weeks.

407
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I would guess. I don't know when they will post it but the Thomas, one is already there, right?

408
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:35,000
There's not much you know I I will I will take an individual look, but in the end the final what you really care is the final leather.

409
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Great Abc. right, and nothing will I will, I will, I will take into consider the to 10 as well, only shows your submission and your quiz right for the final grid.

410
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I will remember i'll look at your attendance sheet and also interaction cost, and also i'll go back, you know.

411
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Look at email things I will make the final call okay i'll happy will We'll not show up on cameras.

412
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Okay, sweet. I just wanted to make sure that we could also see that informal grades as well.

413
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Like next week, but awesome thank you so much I don't have a good idea of posting that on camera.

414
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:18,000
So So I I you know I would say unless you aren't in the you know, if you're really you know, Harry, email.

415
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Me i'll let you you know great but otherwise just wait 2 or 3 weeks.

416
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:28,000
You'll see it. rest. of short it should be should be very good, perfect, awesome. thanks.

417
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:58,000
So much.

418
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Okay, let's i'll continue so I think it makes sense to start with the quest, because the question you know really required to review the material in the lectures.

419
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
So let's first work on a quiz so i'd like to give you some time, maybe again.

420
01:14:52,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Mike. let me see how many questions in the quest.

421
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Oh, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4 questions right so let's give maybe on him in this on the quiz.

422
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:22,000
You have work by yourself, or you can. what kind of group that you know as usual.

423
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:33,000
And then, after 20 min, we review the quest together. feel free to use the you know the lecture notes as your reference.

424
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Okay, Any question.

425
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Okay. So I was seeing 20 min and now we review the quick together.

426
01:15:52,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Quizzy lava that's what i'm talking about

427
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Okay, welcome back. I I realized that 20 min may not be enough for you to finish this.

428
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:57,000
You know confidently. but we have a limited time hearing cloud today, so I want to review this.

429
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:04,000
So you know the whole point is for you to try it first and we review the answer. That's much better than you know me.

430
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Just going through Ls right directly without give you some time and for those of you taking for credit.

431
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Don't worry about this quiz at all this is not part of the final grade.

432
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:22,000
It's just a in-class exercise so let's start go right together.

433
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:27,000
So yeah, it could be quite challenging. honestly.

434
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:33,000
So we have a buyer outcome by year and sample size of 100 la pipe.

435
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:42,000
You know the probability outcome occurring the subject. Now I have 2 other variable X, one x, 2, and then we use the just regression, and then the feed. The model.

436
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Is this: the larger the P. he calls that. And then we know that the coefficient max one has a pivot of 0 point 0 2, and then call your patio x. 2 has a P.

437
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,000
0 point, 6 7, based on all of this information. Select all everything. right?

438
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:17,000
So this is a multiple choice. number one x. One appears to have a to be an effect modifier of the association between x one Y anyone wants to answer this particular choice

439
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I said that among subjects the same value of x one the odds of y occurring increases with increases in the value of x.

440
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:34,000
2 and I was only when it selected, because the odds ratio is e to 0 point, 3, which equals to 1 point, 3, 5, which shows.

441
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:40,000
A positive kind of correlation. Thank you very much, Sarah.

442
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Yeah, you have to survive this is the The odd ratio of add 2 is e to the 0 point 3, so you don't need to really do the math you know It's positive Therefore e to the party value

443
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:02,000
will be greater than one. therefore the odds will increase, holding that one. constant. Thank you.

444
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:11,000
This is correct. So going back to the first one so you said you only pick this one so you didn't pick the this one right?

445
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Could you tell us why you didn't pick the first one Because we don't really utilize the p value necessarily to exclude the values from the model.

446
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:35,000
And so, despite the fact that, like x 2 is a large p value, I I didn't think you would exclude it.

447
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Yeah, you'll talk about this one right so we shouldn't pick this one because the p-value. Oh, you're sorry i'm like I have it up on my screen.

448
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:55,000
It's a different yeah i'm sorry actually, the you know, the quiz trying to confuse people, so they actually give randomized order fire is a single person.

449
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Yeah, my screen i'm talking about the you pack modifier.

450
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:08,000
So why you didn't take that one so the effect modifier because we don't have an association between like x one and x 2.

451
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:14,000
That's usually what we utilize to say effect modifier or not.

452
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Absolutely thank you. Yeah, so to say x y is a pack modifier for X 2 we need to have the interaction charming the model, and we don't have that term.

453
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:28,000
So we can't say anything about you guys modifier thank you very much, Sarah.

454
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I I think you you did perfectly so. The second twice on my screen.

455
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Is that x One appear to be a compound of the association between X 2 and Y.

456
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Anyone want to say whether you want to pick this one or not?

457
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:01,000
I didn't pick it just because it's this specific scenario isn't really kind of comparing like a regression model.

458
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:15,000
It's more just the logistic so we can't say if there's a confounder, or not yeah, you're right. I mean to say X y is a confounder we need to have some evidence and one piece of possible

459
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:20,000
evidence is, if we compare the model, we will compare, you know, Simple.

460
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Hello! Just regression model with X. 2 only versus the one with both sides.

461
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
By the tax 2, we see the slow flags to whether that change or not. Right?

462
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:34,000
That's one piece of happiness, If the salt Max 2 change dramatically without swinging the model.

463
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Then X. one could be a component but without comparing 2 different model.

464
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:44,000
We can't really say anything so Thanks thanks Laura.

465
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:53,000
You answer everything up for this already, so x one is not you know doesn't appear to be a fact modifying, or because we can never really assess interaction here.

466
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,000
We never compare the 2 models we can't really say about compounding.

467
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:04,000
And then because the slow for X 2 is positive therefore the odd ratio is greater than one that's correct.

468
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Finally, whether act 2 should be in the model or not we shouldn't be looking at Pio just by itself.

469
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Okay, any question regarding this number one

470
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Again. Don't worry at all about the score you got It's really more important that we review the answers. yes, on so on on the on the one that is correct. right.

471
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:52,000
So just looking at the formula itself would you need to take the e e you to this to the slope of point 3 in order to figure out if it's gonna increase, cause the formula itself, if you plug in any

472
01:42:52,000 --> 01:43:00,000
x 2, because it's addition, shouldn't it be an increase. Yeah, you're right, just because this is positive it's sufficient.

473
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,000
If this is negative, then I would decrease.

474
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Okay, Alright, Okay, thank you. no problem yeah so when you take exponential party where you've got something greater than one.

475
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:14,000
We'll take if some of the negative I got something less than one. Well, that's the problem. Just look at assign will be sufficient.

476
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:25,000
You are absolutely right? Okay, question. 2. select all of the settings below in which this regression model would be useful.

477
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Number one we would like to determine if the incidence of or 2 says, new new bars vary by several characteristics of the new boards parents.

478
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Anyone think this is a alright? We thought it was correct.

479
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Why? Because it was comparing we had a We had a y that was binary, a binary variable for test yes or no

480
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:58,000
And then we would be able to use the other. The other characteristics compared to that yes or no.

481
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:09,000
So we thought that would be that's perfect yeah you are right So by recognizing the instances of perpetuity, you eventually have a binary Why, on each new board right?

482
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Whether they have it. they don't have it so the instance the rate, the whatever percentage the proportion they all actually talk about binary alcohol.

483
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,000
So So the the sink me. travel of this regression is that we have a binary outcome.

484
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:29,000
We have a certain predictor. So it doesn't really care the predictor whether it's by or not you could be, could be not doesn't matter.

485
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Thank you, Barbara. The second one we will like to know if the mean number of carriers.

486
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,000
P. How are you adults? it's partly with average quantity of alcohol consumption?

487
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Anyone thinks the second one

488
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:49,000
So i'll come here is the mean number of carriers key right?

489
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:54,000
It's a continuous outcome so we should use multiple a single linear regression depend on the number of covars.

490
01:44:54,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Does this regression do not apply here, So this one is third one.

491
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:11,000
We would like to model the rest. of patient? Wow! Okay, We'll let them model the risk of patient having a second stroke within the month of their first stroll. right?

492
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:17,000
How about this one

493
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Correct, Because because the risk, a few developing a second stroke in the years or no. Yeah, Absolutely.

494
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Thank you, Barbara. Yeah, I just trying to Read it and to see whether the data is yes or no Right? it's. you know It's not written clearly in the sentence.

495
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:42,000
You have just have to use your knowledge. And then think, how How would you organize the data as of this question?

496
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Fine, I would like to determine. the risk of developing food poisoning. It's the same thing right when you talk about the risk of some disease.

497
01:45:51,000 --> 01:46:01,000
That's yes, or no Okay, But if you talk about the the severe needs of the disease, or the number of occurrence of the you know the disease. that's continuing any questions.

498
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:10,000
So far.

499
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Okay, this one is relatively straightforward because of the same whole choice.

500
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:30,000
So investigate. I have collected samples, 81 40 of whom were recently diagnosed with stage, 2 press cancer and 40 stage 3 the event.

501
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:45,000
They got defined the variable F 0. If stage 2 breast cancer and access, one is Stage 3, and all women were fully employed with one diagonals, and one year later, if I think I mean which of the 80 women became

502
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:53,000
unemployed. they define all kind of wise law and unbelievable.

503
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:59,000
The investigate. Our failure just requires a model. I got this model Well, P.

504
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Did not probably are in point based upon this model. How many women in the data were I in point.

505
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,000
So before ask a question. I have a question, you know, sort of the side side question for you.

506
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:21,000
What kind of study design we have here is cohort or okay, control

507
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Case control. right? Why is that Because they if there's a there was a They have a diagnosis of breast cancer, That's how they made?

508
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
It. Oh, no, maybe i'm convinced myself too I think I think it was wrong.

509
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:49,000
I think it's a cold war study. because you took the those in the breast cancer diagnosis or state 2, and those in the breast cancer diagnosis.

510
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Stage 3 thank you very much you're absolutely right so now that it matters here.

511
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:01,000
But I think it's fun to think about right So typically we say cancer, no cancer, different kind of cases outcome.

512
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Are you? this political study, actually different kind of cancer is the exposure.

513
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:12,000
The outcome is unemployment right just because it's disease doesn't mean it's always outcome You see that they use acts to denote cancer.

514
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:17,000
So access. usually the exposure. That is why put, you know the employment.

515
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:23,000
So here. employment is how they want to study, whether having different kind of chance that will have an impact on being on point.

516
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:29,000
That's a very reasonable question to ask right so you have to think about what is really the outcome with the exposure in the setting.

517
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:33,000
So because they enroll by different kind of cancer like 40.

518
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Here 40 with stage 2, 40, with 6 3 they enroll by exposure.

519
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:43,000
That's why, it's a coalition it's not like not that it matters, but it's fun to think about it.

520
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:47,000
And then you you think about right. They enrolled by different kind of cancer.

521
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:56,000
They? Then they waited. Let me wait in a year. to observe the whole call. Right is a prospective polar study, which is more reliable because they waited a year.

522
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:03,000
They have no control on that, either. Those people become fine point of not, but they have to wait a year to observe. That's why cocoa study is more expensive, right?

523
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Because it take longer to click the data. But it's less bias Okay, Now the question is that how many women in the data were on your point anyone else?

524
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:36,000
How else would you want to pay, and why

525
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Well, I picked by women with stage 2 breast cancer and the term women with stage 3 breast cancer perfect.

526
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:51,000
And why is that? it's in terms of the old ratio?

527
01:49:51,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Because the slope of access point to excel to I think it should be the it should be the log the log aud ratio of the women have for the women.

528
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Let me see. Sorry of the whimmy house.

529
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Stitch 3 breast cancer. that was employed versus the women that have it to press the cancer that we're employed.

530
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:37,000
So I can. We can have the Audrey show by catholicicking the 5 other point 8, 5 power of the E value.

531
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Right, then it takes the way out 2.3 to a problem, and then we can tackle, or we can look at the at this full terms, and to tackle like the port ratio which should which should be 2.4 3

532
01:50:54,000 --> 01:51:06,000
that should be our answer and it's very clear that if the Audrey show is is plus one, then we can exclude

533
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Well, it thanks to the terms where there is more women's things h 2 than stage 3, and then yeah, oh, so we can.

534
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Yeah, and kicko, like the the other 2 from Zando.

535
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I think this this one is a for women with this 2 end term women with stage 3 have the ultimate show of 2 point, 3 3, I think.

536
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Thank you very much, you're absolutely right so you you pick the right answer. How?

537
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:46,000
How is it maybe easier if I go over what you said in the mathematical notation?

538
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:52,000
You know. Essentially you have this 2 by 2 table right what we have is like 40 stage, 2, 40 stage 3 total 80.

539
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:56,000
But we don't know how many of them become hindu in the add.

540
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,000
But now we need to figure out the interest app interpretation of the inner side.

541
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,000
So basically it's that's probably the that's what they use A. and B.

542
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Let's use you know, hey? you're gonna be right So the So the model is logic p equals a plus B.

543
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:21,000
I. So the intercept a equals minus 1 point. Not right.

544
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:28,000
So the the when, when access is 0, which is the stage 2 case, right?

545
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:33,000
So we have the all the P. so P. over my minus P.

546
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Will be exponential of what minus 1.9 5 we have to use a calculator.

547
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:49,000
But then you'll pick all the P. equals e to the minus 1 point, 9, 5 divided by one, plus e to the minus 1.9 5.

548
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:54,000
This is the case. you just have to use a calculator i'm afraid.

549
01:52:54,000 --> 01:53:05,000
So that's do the capital here right so it phone number 1.1 9, 5, divided by one plus exponential minus 1.9, 5.

550
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Oh, that's the peak and Then we got about this is about 12.5%.

551
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:24,000
So let's go back so p equals well 25%.

552
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:30,000
So if you multiply 40 by 5 point, 5% is on a equals 5.

553
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:37,000
So therefore there are 5 women with stage 2 brack cancer that already leads you to the first answer, because there's no other.

554
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Twice with 5 women in the stage, 2 can press cancer, but you can double check.

555
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:47,000
You know the way and plot X equals Y. You have 3 feet off, 1010 women with stage 3 press.

556
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Answer. So this is the correct answer, or also, I think session also was very correct.

557
01:53:53,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Up because the intercept and because the slope is positive, which means the audio is positive, which means there will be more women, 6, 33, that is, stage 2.

558
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:07,000
So that also limits you to only 2 of the choices right, but still have to pay.

559
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:11,000
The right one. by looking at it in terms of okay.

560
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:16,000
They? they take some compilation. But basically, we do what we did in lecture.

561
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:23,000
So any question here

562
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Could you go over how you get the stage? 3 one I know That's probably a lot ?

563
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Just a matter of mathematical aspect of it, so we know.

564
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Be able to log it. p equals a plus bx.

565
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Now, if X was one, then the login of P cool minus 1 point, 9, 5 plus 0 point, 8, 5. right?

566
01:54:50,000 --> 01:55:01,000
So now equals minus 1.1. So the same thing P will be e to the minus 1 point, one divided by one plus e to the minus 1.1. so just plug it back.

567
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:05,000
To equals one. We got the other group. Let me do it.

568
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:13,000
1 point, 1 1 point, one that's 25% basically one further.

569
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:21,000
So this key equals 25% in the stage. 3 group right?

570
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Remember stage. 3 group has a 40 people, therefore 25% give you 1010 women with a movie.

571
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:33,000
I employ, so that's another way of getting the 10 out of 40.

572
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:46,000
You can also look at all the ratio but that's actually more calculation than this one

573
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Any public question.

574
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Okay, let me move on Finally, we fit 2 separate logist regression model for the same outcome.

575
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Y. I'm. otherwise a regression of y and x one modeled with the reduction wire at 2.

576
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:24,000
So we are doing a model selection now, malawi has Aoc of 66%. Oh, 0 point 6 6 I'm.

577
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:32,000
All the 12. You'll see 0 point 7 3 okay that's all we'll give it Now we have 2 subjects. right?

578
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Peter has a value of y equals one sadly at the value of y equals 0.

579
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:42,000
What do you think are correct here? So number 1, 66% of our ability.

580
01:56:42,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Y is explained by dissociation with x. one. Is that correct?

581
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:17,000
I know you probably haven't got here many of you with the 20 min I gave you.

582
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:24,000
But you can give some thoughts right Now I think it's not crap?

583
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Why is that first, the variability this explanation, like feels like the explanation for R squared rather than the eightc value, and the real value should be it.

584
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:57,000
I think it will mean that we have larger city probability of the sorry.

585
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Can't pay this is written in the lattice you know It's actually one of the later choices.

586
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:09,000
But you're absolutely right. This This would be correct If this is 0 point 6 6 is the R.

587
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Square by it. Is not our square, so this is incorrect, You see, it's different from hardware.

588
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Thank you very much. a model is both x one x 2 in the model.

589
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:29,000
We'll have aoc greater than 0 point 7 3 so basic idea is that you know X, one alone have an Ec.

590
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Of 0 point, 6, 6 x 2 alone has a aoc of 0 point, 7 3.

591
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:38,000
If you put them together you will have a higher. You will see that both.

592
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Is that correct?

593
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:53,000
No. Why is that I mean I guess we don't know so?

594
01:58:53,000 --> 01:59:03,000
It's likely that with you know because x one can help you predict i' how to predict with both of them is likely that you predict better.

595
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:13,000
But it's not guaranteed so aoc is not like unlike Our Square, where our hardware always increased when you include a variable aoc doesn't have that property.

596
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:24,000
So he's very likely you have a fun is this is no guarantee until you really twice fit the model and number 3 actually the better predictor for wider X.

597
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:31,000
One that's true. There you see is higher Yeah, a Uc.

598
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Is the performance for prediction. right? that's 2 has a higher ucx one So here's the matter, I think of a whole lot.

599
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:45,000
So everything else you call. if you just want to do prediction, I would think X 2 is a better predictor, Right?

600
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:55,000
You wanna use it per day, and finally us predict the probability is more likely to be larger than a salad predicted probability with model 2 that minute with model.

601
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:12,000
One. Is that true?

602
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:18,000
I think that's true just based on fact that you see it's larger. And so you're talking about probability with the Auc.

603
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:23,000
And so he should in theory have a larger predictive probability.

604
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Thank you very much. You are absolutely right, Remember, hey? You see, not only has this interpretation of area under the curve, also has the invitation of being the probability of giving you a concord and pair here, because because Peter is a

605
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:54,000
one is a case salary is a control. so concord and pair happens when the model predicts a higher probability for Peter that's out, and because model 2 has higher, you'll see them model 2 has higher chance given a component

606
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:00,000
here, right? so model 2 is more likely to predict a higher, probably for pizza than for sales.

607
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:19,000
So it is absolutely correct. Okay, any question for this quiz

608
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Alright, I think you did really well. very glad so for the rest of time.

609
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Today we have 2 projects i'm thinking we focus on project B.

610
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:37,000
And then project a you know is there I I sent I signed you all the answers keys yesterday.

611
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Give you a while I can take a look but it's not a necessary to to submit, or do it at all.

612
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:52,000
So for the rest of the day we Do a project elevenv and I want to give you more time for you guys to talk to each other, because it's the end of the path.

613
02:01:52,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Right. so i'll give you a 30 min which no actually 35 min with with the with time in the break included worldcom.

614
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:09,000
You 11 B. But there's no there's no sprash sheet evolved there's no data.

615
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:30,000
It's just some calculation I I think the keys for you to again try some exercise actually hold on a second Try some exercise like this right to further consolidated you understandable to this regression But more actually what you guys will talk to each other

616
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,000
right, you know, costmates for 3 weeks. Yeah. And although virtually right, so have some fun.

617
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Have some yeah, I will give you like 35 min on this, including a break free to chat, or also feel free to do it yourself, or take a break, and then we'll go over this together and that, will be all for this

618
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:56,000
course. Okay, Any question.

619
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Alright, it will be 35 min, including break, and then I will see you.

620
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:32,000
After that. see you in a bit

621
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:21,000
Okay, welcome back. everyone. hope you had a joyful time together.

622
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Alright let's for the rest of time let's go over this exercise together.

623
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:45,000
So a lot of calculations. so number one obesity is defined as Bmi over 30 kg per neither square in the I'm Eps data, 3,140 of the 9,003

624
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:50,000
121 subjects have a bmi of 30 kg per 1 million square or higher.

625
02:39:50,000 --> 02:40:01,000
So what's the off of being always here? anyone I do it can do the off

626
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Oh, yeah, a point 5, 0, 8 cool. Could you tell us how you get this number?

627
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:19,000
Yeah. Sorry. I took a ratio of ratio of obese divided by ratio.

628
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Not only so. the numerator is going to be 3, 1, 4, 0, divided by 9, 2, 3, one, and then the denominator is going to be 6, 1, 8, one divided by 9, 2, 3, one.

629
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:42,000
So you are doing this. Okay, let's go with thank you.

630
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:45,000
I think You're absolutely right that's the one style of time right? So P.

631
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Equals this. if you use the power that you should be at 0 point 3, 3, 7, alright.

632
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:59,000
So if you do p divided by one minus p you should got this 0 point 5 one, so that that's that's the cute.

633
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:07,000
That's the off I could call it a queue Okay, this way.

634
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:14,000
So you're absolutely right. you know there are many way you can't get the same number. you could like is that 140, over 9, 3, 2, one.

635
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:35,000
And then this whole thing, divided by like 9, 3 2, one minus 3, 1 40, divided by 9, 3, 4 one. that's also also also got a 2.5 one Actually, if you look at a formula, you could directly I think the simplest formula is

636
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:41,000
this 3, 1, 40, you divided by 9 3 2 one minus 3 1 4.

637
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:48,000
So that's the simply formula to get this on just the number of obes divide by number of non-obes.

638
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:53,000
We got the same pause, so that's the simplify ponder. So there are many.

639
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:58,000
The performer actually at least for the same number.

640
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:09,000
Any questions so far

641
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:20,000
Alright alright, number 2. So here we have the the rate of Vc.

642
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:36,000
In both male and the female so the question is what's the hard ratio

643
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:45,000
Anyone

644
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:53,000
We made a table so we made a table where it's.

645
02:42:53,000 --> 02:43:05,000
On the the The column is the obese and not obese, and the rose is male and female. and so oh, yeah.

646
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:28,000
So that obese, not obese, and then male and female, and then obese mail is 1844 not obesity, 3, 1, 9, 5 obesc, 1 2, 9, 5, and not obese, is 2

647
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:39,000
8, 9, 7. Okay. cool. Yeah. So then the odds will be 80 divided by Bc.

648
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:52,000
Which is at 1.2, 9, an awesome ratio will be

649
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:59,000
Thank you you're absolutely right so this is 3 4 a way of having an automation.

650
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:03,000
So i'll just show up i'll slide it different amount of that.

651
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:10,000
So from the question Actually, what i'm saying this is absolutely what what I'm saying is that you actually don't need the then figure out the numbers.

652
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:16,000
So from the question P. one equals 0 point, 3, 6, 6, My p.

653
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:21,000
2 equals 3 point, 3, oh, 9. from this we know. Q.

654
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:31,000
One equals P. one over one minus p. One: yeah. Q. 2 equals P.

655
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:37,000
2 power, one minus P. 2, on the whole r we'll be Q.

656
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:43,000
One over. Q. 2, so you can do this. You got the same number on your absolute line.

657
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:54,000
1 point, 2 9. any question

658
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:59,000
If we do the math, this thing will be 0 point 5, 8.

659
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:12,000
This thing would be 0 point 4, 4, 5, yes, 0 point 5, 8 over 0 point, 4, 5 fine. You know.

660
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:23,000
It's actually re referring no matter how to do it right that's why I use the wipe on it here, and not the same as That's very weird for you awesome You'll see that the os is

661
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:28,000
always larger than the risk. Right here is 0 point 5, one over there.

662
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:33,000
Point 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7. So all these bigger than risk.

663
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Here all is bigger than risk, and all this bigger at risk.

664
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:42,000
So the smaller. the rest is the the smaller the difference i'll be $2 at risk.

665
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:50,000
But all this always be good. There is

666
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:55,000
I'm not here. Let me do if instead we don't do the odd ratio.

667
02:45:55,000 --> 02:46:00,000
If we do the relative risk we've got t one over p 2.

668
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:06,000
That's 0 point 3 6 6 over 0 point 3 or 9 I don't know the answer.

669
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:16,000
Well, let me through the map

670
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:24,000
1 point, 1 8,

671
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Okay. So you see the operator at 1.2 9.

672
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:40,000
R the risk is 1.1 9 they're not the same, and all the ratio is larger than relative risk, which is again, it's not by coincidence, if you're rather risky, is larger than one and all ratio will always

673
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:50,000
be larger than the rest. Okay, so you essentially, the odd ratio will always be sort of a over at the main, in the Ralph.

674
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:56,000
By the If the risk themselves are low for rare disease, then the odds ratio will be close forever.

675
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Red right? So, for example, when you read a paper, they say, Okay, eating sugary sort of a food will increase your heart.

676
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:14,000
Attack right? all's rational say is 1.2 you don't really know what's the relative risk.

677
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:19,000
If they go report because they do a case control study right it's very hard to do.

678
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:28,000
A cohort study of heart attack you need like a meeting some people to observe a few right? So they usually do case control, and they they ask them in the ratio for that is 1 point. 2.

679
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:33,000
So you don't really know the true round of rest which of course, is the thing of interest.

680
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:41,000
But you know, because heart attack is so rare. right? so the true run risk will be about will be between one and 1 point.

681
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:51,000
2 will be close to 1 point. 2 so that's the whole point of doing all the ratio in case control study, because we know the number will be close to the true route of the rest.

682
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:55,000
On the other hand, let's say we read that kind of paper.

683
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:58,000
They say that you know the round risk is 1.2.

684
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:11,000
What does that mean? right? That means if you for example eat how many ram a sugar a day, Your chance of getting a heart attack within a certain time will be 20% more.

685
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:16,000
So that's a relative risk that's not absolutely different risk if you think about it.

686
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:23,000
The chance for someone having a hard life part. of having so low it's like one in the 100,000, or something right, given a period of time.

687
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:28,000
So you are thinking you are basically getting Oh, i'm drinking i'm eating this much sugar a day.

688
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:34,000
Then my chance will be from wine. a 100,000 now, and 1.200,000.

689
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:42,000
So it's a big change. 20% change relatively by you think about the actual change is actually you are still very, very unlikely to get a heart of that.

690
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:54,000
I'm you know i'm making off all the numbers so don't take, don't both my number what I'm saying Usually you see a odd ratio, 1 point something or even 2 point something from a case control study of

691
02:48:54,000 --> 02:49:01,000
a rare disease like this, right? you need to put the number into account to really understand what's the impact of that?

692
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:21,000
Okay So that's the whole point of what we're learning this, any questions regarding the operational relative risk all the interpretation

693
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:28,000
Okay, Number 3 can see that. now. we have a little just requesting model larger piece.

694
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Beta not plus beta one x and p is the probability of y equals one, and y here is being obese. X.

695
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:44,000
Here is male or female. So from this particular study, right? what is the vain?

696
02:49:44,000 --> 02:50:14,000
And al beta one anyone

697
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Yeah, we from Group 2 cracked our brains out here on this question.

698
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:31,000
And we were only like probably 80% sure that we knew e one.

699
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:40,000
But we what like we did. We did not understand how to to get B be B be, know, or be 0.

700
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:47,000
Even when we look back at the lectures, because every time the intercept was given, and this was the first time we had to calculate it.

701
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:55,000
Okay, But we thought that B one was basically the log box ratio that we use the Us.

702
02:50:55,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Ratio that we calculated before in question 2 I don't remember the number anymore to be honest.

703
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:19,000
That's the way very convenient to do it in the Hello in the Brower

704
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Okay, So the for the slope I cannot write data i'm riding the slope here.

705
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:41,000
It's done the log of the odd ratio I'm, not giving you 0 point 1 1

706
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:59,000
Well interesting. I think I'm: doing it wrong I shouldn't do the law actually, because in the browser if you do law isn't it? Ln: Yeah. they give you a a base 10 law you should really write law, Oh, and yeah, that's

707
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:06,000
So we got point 2 5 for that based on that you're absolutely right.

708
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:11,000
My bad, so I sure then write law. I should like law.

709
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:23,000
Ln: Yeah. and then for B 9 if i'm understanding this correctly.

710
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:30,000
The odds of being obese is point 5 o 8 that we got in question.

711
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:38,000
One. Would I be using that, then to determine B not, or am I going about it the wrong way?

712
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:47,000
Almost there, except that yeah, intercept is the log of something right?

713
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:54,000
Yeah, But here is the Logos of everybody But here. you can look at the Logos, you know X equals 0 group. Yeah, I knew that.

714
02:52:54,000 --> 02:53:00,000
Yeah. and I just didn't know how to do that like I yeah, So

715
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:07,000
So essentially here, Beta, naught is the log loss of the female who And now we're actually here.

716
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:13,000
If you did it this way. The female group has a log of this.

717
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:20,000
All of this man, so it should be the log you know.

718
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:39,000
Alright, log always in email. Last last, my smelling freely path.

719
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:50,000
So that will be the log of 0 Point 4, 5 on the way down here and see what number we caught here.

720
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:59,000
That's negative about 0 point minus 0 point hey? right

721
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:07,000
Alright 1 0 point 8, so that's what you should get for this one.

722
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:13,000
So essentially. if you're fiddle up just where the model on this data, these are the you know, in there's other slow.

723
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:21,000
How you should get any questions so far. Lots of questions We wrecked our brain on this one.

724
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:33,000
Try to figure out what. but so so what you did was be not is is when x one there is 0.

725
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:43,000
Yup, and in this case 0 met female. So then it was the It was the log odds of of obesity and females.

726
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:48,000
Exactly so. The thing that we were missing in our room is, we can figure out we just made.

727
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:53,000
We just made, we made. We made X 0 right? right?

728
02:54:53,000 --> 02:55:04,000
So then that would take that out of the thing but we didn't equate that to 0 being female that almost there.

729
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:13,000
That is good trying it's good trying you know next time you get it right

730
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:22,000
Okay, any other questions. So just to kind of clarify when i'm looking at these like 2 by 2 tables.

731
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:26,000
I generally. I like don't go about calculating p one and P.

732
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:38,000
2 like you did. But is that gonna be the like fastest, or like the easiest way to go about looking at tables in general like this?

733
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:44,000
Yeah, I mean it is all correct, right? I mean he this I think you got a payable that's probably fine.

734
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:49,000
But this this this problem doesn't give me the table So I I thought, going from piece easier.

735
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:57,000
But if you already have the payload, you can do the same thing, because, you know, you can do the the law.

736
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:03,000
Oh, down here in a female group that's simply 1 2 9, 5, divided by 2, 8, 9, 7.

737
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:10,000
Right. you can get the same thing from the table so you know every different path.

738
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:16,000
I have the same answer. right I didn't have the table so I didn't use the table, but if the table are already given.

739
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:23,000
You can use the table, do the same thing

740
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Yeah, I believe this will give you the same answer that's see Hey, Madison?

741
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:42,000
Right. So subject to a yeah. if you figure out the paper, then everything is also readable from the table

742
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:49,000
So what i'm actually trying to say is that to answer this question, this this number of May on the female.

743
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:53,000
Actually they're not really needed. You just need a p you have to go out and have it.

744
02:56:53,000 --> 02:57:03,000
But once you have the number you can figure out a table, and then you can also do it right

745
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:09,000
Sure I know. Yeah, Yeah. once you got used to it become clear.

746
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:20,000
But you know, in the beginning it's always like a little offky or okay.

747
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:34,000
Any other pop questions? Am I anyone here

748
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Okay, no question for so we we Now we feed a really fit of multiple regression logic model.

749
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:48,000
We have the Sdma interface slopes and pivotal, all significant.

750
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:54,000
And this is the full question where, as 2 is perceived, the mental health status.

751
02:57:54,000 --> 02:58:01,000
So basically they want to study whether X 2, I guess, is a confounder or not.

752
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:07,000
Anyway. So what's the interpretation of x 2 basically you can interpret it?

753
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:16,000
Either the this number or the exponential exponentiate number right exponential number, maybe easier.

754
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:35,000
Anyone

755
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:40,000
So let me first exponentiate right let's go actually 2.

756
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:55,000
What's this? 1.2 5

757
02:58:55,000 --> 02:59:06,000
So this thing should be some sort of odd ratio bye I'll go ahead is the ratio.

758
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:22,000
You know, between cool subjects, very far bye one unit.

759
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:32,000
Oh, I see mine, Paul. Oh, and this is not done yet.

760
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:40,000
All ratio. This is again obese. Right? Yeah. a hobby.

761
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:49,000
Obesity. right and then there's a condition right you're keeping all other variables, saying, But xy is gender here.

762
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:58,000
So basically i'm saying of the same dana

763
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:03,000
Right. So he's actually the ratio between 2 subjects different by one unit.

764
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:15,000
I perceive the mental health right, but they have to have the same gender

765
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:22,000
Right otherwise the comparison doesn't make sense so regardless whether they're both may or most female.

766
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:33,000
It doesn't matter. how's that same gender this is the same operation, which means that you know one more unit of perceive my new house school.

767
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:45,000
The high of the chance we've got that person got obese right and the difference in all these 1.2 5

768
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:49,000
Any question.

769
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:55,000
So probably here Mantle House School armies, I think right.

770
03:00:55,000 --> 03:01:01,000
The higher the score, the worth, the mental health status.

771
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:22,000
Otherwise you know it shouldn't be associated with obesity, you know positively right to be negative, so I don't know how I exploit it. but here probably higher school means the worst mental health any question

772
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:27,000
Okay, sending here. Now you have 2 subjects. Olivia is a female with poor.

773
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:37,000
Perceive the mandela house and the Zap is a male with very good proceeding on the house, and then the question is that that's the post.

774
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:48,000
Poor man. No house means higher school I I suppose that's the case based on the table right?

775
03:01:48,000 --> 03:02:02,000
Who is more likely to be obese

776
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:10,000
Actually, I think the the question here code is probably means good.

777
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:24,000
Manual health has higher school I don't know but it seems like That's the I just realized, too, there's a table at the bottom on age.

778
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:31,000
So it actually gives values for core versus Very good. Thank you.

779
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:40,000
Barbara, where is higher in school? Okay, So yeah. So actually, not only hire some employees, score 5. right?

780
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:44,000
Who is very good. Thank you very much. This is very healthy.

781
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:58,000
How are you doing the notice that So basically Olivia? has the X, one of 0 as X, 2 of 5. and the Zach has the X one and one has a tool of right?

782
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:04,000
That's what the same. No, exactly easier how do you mind wants to clown this, or I.

783
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:10,000
I can go ahead

784
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:16,000
Hello! You could think of all right, the logic of Peak or the log off of Pete.

785
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:34,000
Good evening, Olivia you essentially equals minus 1.2 7. that's you know, the intersex 0 point 2 to 7, and because i'll leave as female I plus 0 point 2 2 times course for is a

786
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:53,000
file right the logic of P. for zack it's the same thing, minus 2 point, 1 7 plus 0 1 2 7 times one, because it's male and 0 point 2 2 times 2, because it's a very good random house

787
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:57,000
right. So now you just need to doing the calculation.

788
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:12,000
You know, this one is Okay, I have the answer 0 point, 1 6, and this one is minus 0 point, 6 little sack.

789
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:30,000
One is lower, because the log of is lower which means the Os is all over me, which means the piece lower, which means, you know from this 2 number you already know, i'll leave you up

790
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:40,000
Nice,

791
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:50,000
Hi has It'll be always I already, know that by you I actually could see.

792
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:55,000
Got it exactly chance right? So this way you could actually figure out the P.

793
03:04:55,000 --> 03:05:03,000
Equals E to the minus 0 point, 1 6 divided by one.

794
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:07,000
Plus e to the minus 0 point. one so you can actually calculate it.

795
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:12,000
If you do this calculation, you don't have to to ask the question.

796
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:23,000
But if you do the population that's 0 point 4 6

797
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:39,000
And down here he calls same thing exponential minus 0 point, 6 divided by Lamp Pass exponential minus 0 point, 6

798
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:47,000
That's equal

799
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:54,000
0 point, 3, 5,

800
03:05:54,000 --> 03:06:00,000
Right so you'll see that i'll leave you I need a higher chance of being all these right.

801
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:04,000
But you don't need to figure out this number actually to Answer this question right?

802
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:15,000
Just look at the this predictor value you'd probably know the answer any question

803
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:30,000
So that's how you know let's just your question as a classifier as a predictor works right logging all the covariance we actually make prediction in the individual that's many of the online you

804
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:35,000
know, calculator of online risk predictor, i'm not saying all many of them are doing on the logist regression.

805
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:43,000
Some of you the other 2, which are similar but my name's Bill down with just 2 questions. So now you know to go any online, right?

806
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:54,000
For example, here, long as our rest. all line popular, right?

807
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:58,000
You guys can go there and ask you a few questions like age.

808
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:02,000
Gender male female, you know. Do you smoke? Do you have family history?

809
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:06,000
Once you put those in the online calculator will basically run.

810
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:13,000
The underlying model like this may not necessarily be a legislature, but similar, And then speed all probability for you.

811
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:21,000
Okay, and the probability will be associated with some time here right next year, next 10 years, you know things like those.

812
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:30,000
Any question.

813
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:36,000
Okay, does Mandela House appear to be a compiler related to General Visc.

814
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:57,000
Anyone

815
03:07:57,000 --> 03:08:04,000
Yes, it seems to be a confounder because otherwise if we didn't have any confounding.

816
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:11,000
Zack would have probably had the higher probability of obesity.

817
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:16,000
Sorry i'm not i'm not fully following you on your reasoning so.

818
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:25,000
If it's not a compounding then

819
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:30,000
No! what

820
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:50,000
I just thought that if if there wasn't any effect of obesity on mental health or mental health on obesity, then you should have seen still that in the question above, Zack would have had a higher probability of obesity

821
03:08:50,000 --> 03:09:02,000
So it is a confounder. I see so You're saying here, because they have different level obesity probability, and that's driven by by mental health.

822
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:07,000
So madhouse has a right on the probability obesity.

823
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:16,000
Yeah, you are right. but you know that that but that answer is to the question whether whether Lando House has a slip significant.

824
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:20,000
In fact, i'll basically which he sensory is asking whether this pivotal is significant.

825
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:28,000
Now it is definitely significant. but this question is asking whether it is a compounder for the other variable To answer this question.

826
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:31,000
Usually we we look at a coefficient for the other, variable for gender.

827
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:45,000
So you look at the the coefficient for gender by itself is 0 point, 2 5, right in the original, single, simple in your breadth model. the gender has a 0 point, 2 5 slope for all these of you by the

828
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:57,000
you know, Martha, my nose. The slope for gender becomes 0 point, 2 2 7, so which reduce a little bit from 0 point 2 5.

829
03:09:57,000 --> 03:10:10,000
But now, by much right. So which means that Yep. if Mandelaus is a confounder for gender, then with manual housing model, the impact for gender should change.

830
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:15,000
And all the changes not so big, so you could be a confounded by you would be a very weak one.

831
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:22,000
From this evidence. it's not depends on there at all does everyone with me.

832
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:30,000
So compare the slope X. one in single, in the regression versus module.

833
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:40,000
In your regression changed from 0 point, 2, 5 through 0 point, 2, 2 7.

834
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:55,000
Therefore tax tool. Yes, unlike the it will be you know strong and follow the Oh, excellent!

835
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:58,000
So that's the problem right because the coefficient of X.

836
03:10:58,000 --> 03:11:04,000
One doesn't change much so the fact of x 2 as a confounder for X.

837
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:10,000
One is either 0 or or very small so that's the yeah, answer to this question.

838
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:16,000
You might have

839
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:29,000
Any question. So basically a different question, also different things. right? So the effect modifier is looking at the interaction and founders look at the comparison slope of 2 models, right?

840
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:33,000
And if you look at the actual itself, you should look at its own slope and the pivot.

841
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:38,000
So different quality to look at

842
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:50,000
Alright, let's move on 1 2 I don't wanna take, drag you all the way to lunch today, So Number 5 we find the model in question 4 to include the interaction.

843
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:59,000
Now we have interaction from same thing. but now, including factor term. yeah, we have a previously.

844
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:05,000
You'll see 5, 7 one Now we'll see 5 7 4 so barely increased.

845
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:10,000
Okay. The question is, does perceive. my new house appear to have a strong association with obesity.

846
03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:19,000
You may all email

847
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:25,000
So

848
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:33,000
This is a little more involved, because you know, to look at separate.

849
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:39,000
Let me do this. This is a little more involved. for the sake of time.

850
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:45,000
Right, so you need to pick up. So you Fact I know how our BCD.

851
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:53,000
You may want a female separately in this model so Let's first write out a model right to log it of P.

852
03:12:53,000 --> 03:13:01,000
You calls right minus let's just say p naught plus B.

853
03:13:01,000 --> 03:13:11,000
One x x, one well, 2, x 2 plus b 3 x one So that's the model.

854
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:17,000
So what really happened is that because at X one now is find this binary right?

855
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:20,000
So x one youx line 0, which means p mail.

856
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:27,000
Remember now we have the model larger. the p and female equals p naught.

857
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:32,000
Now we just plug in X Y equals 0. Then the dyx one disappeared, plus v.

858
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:40,000
2 x 2 boss, and the third form also these up here that's it right.

859
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:44,000
But if X y equals one that's the male group now we have logic.

860
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:49,000
A peak he calls. Now you have a look at it right? B.

861
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:56,000
One, you know, plus b one, because I find one plus b, 2 x, 2 plus b, 3 x 2.

862
03:13:56,000 --> 03:14:03,000
So that equals V last plus v one well p, 2 plus b, 3 x 2.

863
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:07,000
So you see that those in fact, because that's why it's binary.

864
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:14,000
So in each of the group of X, one dichotoma by one x 2 actually has a different impact, so that you pack of X 2 is P.

865
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:23,000
2 in female group, but B 2 past d 3. you know the male rule, so that you, factor back to actually change.

866
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:28,000
Depend on x one that is saying x one is a fact modifier by 2.

867
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:39,000
That's the exact same reason why we have this you know interaction time being significant. right?

868
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:51,000
So from this 2 numbers, and that's plug-in This is because 1 point, one through 3 off 0 point, 1, 5, 3 tax poop on this.

869
03:14:51,000 --> 03:15:04,000
Yeah, you know some number minus 1.1, 2, 3, plus you know, minus 0 point 0, 3, 9. right.

870
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:12,000
Pause. 0 point, 1 5, 3 plus real point 0 point 1 2 2.

871
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:27,000
That's cool, or that equals I have to do the math you Know point 1 point, 1 6, 2 awesome 0 point 2 7 bye, that's cool. So you see that slope or x 2 is different. You may own a female.

872
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:39,000
Group. Now the question asks which slope is higher. Apparently we see that you fact or flow F 2 is higher.

873
03:15:39,000 --> 03:15:44,000
You mail

874
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:56,000
Right, which means stronger association. You may

875
03:15:56,000 --> 03:16:01,000
Well, this is a little involved, right? because you have to spell out the interaction model.

876
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:07,000
So Saturday has 2 you know model depend on the Mendel's work, and to compare the slopes right?

877
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:17,000
So Hello involved? any question

878
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:21,000
Alright. Yeah, for the sake of time I will i'll walk through this.

879
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:31,000
What is the operational obesity for a male with perceive the manuals for 2 relative, or may always perceive, Metal house of 4. That's in this particular model, right?

880
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:40,000
Because we are male, for we basically look at X one equals one. So i'll look at this equation right when Xy is one.

881
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:50,000
Now we just change. I know how school right from 2 to 4, therefore we are reduce the matter of school.

882
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:57,000
I mean, even with my high school by 5 by 2. there are for those Logos ratio should be this thing times too awfully.

883
03:16:57,000 --> 03:17:03,000
Show by the All. R. we will be exponential of 2 times the slope.

884
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:10,000
Samo. 5. right? You actually have to do minus 2, because you are.

885
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:13,000
You are comparing the score with 2 versus 4 or 4.

886
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:23,000
Right. So now nothing will be. if you do the math, that thing will be 0 point 5, 8, right?

887
03:17:23,000 --> 03:17:28,000
So the person with us. my house quarrel 2 will have lower off.

888
03:17:28,000 --> 03:17:32,000
Not the person about how cool. So the operation was left by one means lower off.

889
03:17:32,000 --> 03:17:36,000
If you'll flip them, the operator will be bigger than one, just a matter of whether it's popularity.

890
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:50,000
But basically you need to look at the right flow and modified by 2

891
03:17:50,000 --> 03:17:56,000
Question.

892
03:17:56,000 --> 03:18:03,000
Yeah, and all these you don't have to pay numbers because the you know the answer, she answer is already you know, shared how long yesterday, Right?

893
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:10,000
But if you're interested in going through yourself and double check you know is is online.

894
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:19,000
So finally, the question is regarding for this. Right now we have 2 model: Why is the multiple in your grandmother? remember?

895
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:24,000
With the Aoc of 571 now it's an interaction model with Aosc. 5 7 4 4.

896
03:18:24,000 --> 03:18:41,000
It's a little higher. Well, the question is that for this describing association of gender and the perceived man or house status with obesity, you prefer to model you for or model your file and why

897
03:18:41,000 --> 03:18:51,000
Anyone

898
03:18:51,000 --> 03:19:15,000
There's no right answer right now. I just wanted to see you know you all your your algorithm

899
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:19,000
Okay, you know, one thing you could there's there are multiple answers right?

900
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:45,000
One thing you could. You could see that model 4 has Aoc 5, 7, one my model of 4 as Aoc equals 0 point, 5, 7, one and model 5. as Aoc goes 0 Point 5, 7, 4 therefore Mario 5 So I pick

901
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:51,000
it. Nothing wrong with this argument, although you know it just predicted a little about it.

902
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:56,000
Right. second thing. you can look at that, can you? for interaction?

903
03:19:56,000 --> 03:20:10,000
Firm, and basically B: 3, right? you model 5. Yes, last 1 point o 5 mono port, right? model models.

904
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:16,000
Well, and 5 are nasty and P. value is that some point of 5.

905
03:20:16,000 --> 03:20:25,000
Therefore model 5 is battle that's also something we we're mentioning pop right, because they're not that you can look at the pivotal.

906
03:20:25,000 --> 03:20:30,000
The additional term. In this case the pivotal is a different problem is significant means.

907
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:49,000
The term probably is real, so we're picking right so both of these tell your model 5 this better than model, for, on the other hand, some people may argue, you know, aoc improvement from model 4 to model.

908
03:20:49,000 --> 03:21:04,000
But if negligible, I don't know even know how to call the sales, and I can actually live Google, anyway.

909
03:21:04,000 --> 03:21:22,000
So their fault we prefer so basically you can test a difference between that. You'll see i'm not running the test. But I'm pretty sure the last you have like one a 100,000 data points the improve ooc is probably not

910
03:21:22,000 --> 03:21:31,000
significant. Everything else you call it, for a single model

911
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:37,000
Which is modelful right? that's also about an argument so your improvement? Prediction is negligible.

912
03:21:37,000 --> 03:21:45,000
So why do you prefer more complicated model? So So that's an argument might give you a different answer to this question.

913
03:21:45,000 --> 03:21:49,000
So the key is now, you know which answer is correct, or rather, you know how you can.

914
03:21:49,000 --> 03:22:03,000
Justify your your model selection

915
03:22:03,000 --> 03:22:22,000
Alright that's awesome for this project any question

916
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:35,000
Okay, So that's all for the 3 weeks I really appreciate, you know. Say, the last time that you you stay with me every day in the morning. really enjoy it at the time and speaking with you I really appreciate all of you who are

917
03:22:35,000 --> 03:22:42,000
participating interacting in class. you know, the first year I teach this was in cost in person.

918
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:55,000
The second year I taught it people to the covid remotely, and no one speaker thing pretty much. i'm speaking to a black screen for 3 weeks, which is depressing, you know, and I understand people are going you know a

919
03:22:55,000 --> 03:23:04,000
lot of things going on in in 2020. But after 2 years now, I think this year we run really well, remotely, really appreciate all of you.

920
03:23:04,000 --> 03:23:12,000
But this party, and especially for those of you, you know, show your face, which which which means a lot, I mean, thanks so much.

921
03:23:12,000 --> 03:23:17,000
Yeah, and I I I I wish you a great lesson or a great weekend.

922
03:23:17,000 --> 03:23:26,000
And you kinda got it so pivot and the grace, you know, reasonably soon let me know or or let the program know when I have any question.

923
03:23:26,000 --> 03:23:40,000
Otherwise have a great rest of your day. and take care, bye, bye, thank you very much.
