1
00:00:05,728 --> 00:00:07,999
Hi, I'm Peter Jacobson.

2
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:12,245
We're continuing on with our discussion
of the US health care delivery system.

3
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:12,898
And now,

4
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:19,370
we're going to focus in more detail on the
health care delivery part of the system.

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:25,140
There are a number of different facilities
where patients can go to be treated.

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,780
We can start at the top
with public hospitals.

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,969
Public hospitals are those that
the government owns and operates,

8
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:39,342
such as the Veteran's Administration
facilities, the Indian Health Services,

9
00:00:39,342 --> 00:00:45,458
public hospitals in New York City and
other jurisdictions across the country.

10
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:51,529
Second, as you'll remember from the chart
in the last segment, there are academic

11
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:56,674
medical centers for the highly
complex care needs that patients face.

12
00:00:56,674 --> 00:01:01,722
But patients could also be
referred to specialty facilities.

13
00:01:01,722 --> 00:01:05,089
Remember, in the last segment,
we talked about joint ventures.

14
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:09,940
Specialty facilities could be for
women and children but

15
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:16,307
could also be joint ventures for
specialty hospitals where physicians and

16
00:01:16,307 --> 00:01:23,900
health systems form a joint venture to
provide cardiac surgery or cancer care.

17
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,260
Then, there's a series
of safety net clinics.

18
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,520
Safety net clinics are facilities
where people who are uninsured or

19
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:39,490
underinsured can present for
acute care or primary care needs.

20
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,490
This comes in a variety of sources.

21
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,770
One Is the Federal Qualified
Health Centers, or FQHCs,

22
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,550
which are federally funded
safety net providers.

23
00:01:52,550 --> 00:02:00,040
What's interesting about the FQHC is that
it's one area of agreement In an otherwise

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,790
contentious health policy environment
between conservatives and liberals.

25
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,286
Under the Affordable Care Act, funding for

26
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:13,955
FQHC was significantly enhanced.

27
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:19,070
Patients who may not
have access to FQHC can

28
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:24,530
also present at free clinics,
where they don't have to pay anything.

29
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:29,420
Another form of safety net
clinic is faith-based clinics,

30
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,920
where the same level of care is provided
as at the other safety net clinics,

31
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,520
but there's also normally some
type of faith-based activity.

32
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,716
In addition, patients can present
at emergency departments where,

33
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:50,966
under federal law,
the Emergency Medical Treatment Act,

34
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:55,901
EMTALA, hospitals are required
to screen patients and

35
00:02:55,901 --> 00:03:03,120
treat unless they can't provide
the service needed at that time.

36
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,670
Recently, retail clinics and urgent care
clinics have emerged to fill the gap

37
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,910
where patients have had trouble getting
access to their primary care provider,

38
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,500
their physician or nurse practitioner or
physician assistant.

39
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,380
Retail clinics, in particular,
are low-cost and

40
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:30,370
available in places like CVS and
Walgreens.

41
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,650
Urgent care clinics provide
a little wider range of care and

42
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,952
are staffed usually by physicians.

43
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:45,340
And both urgent care and
retail clinics take insurance.

44
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,880
Aside from acute care that would include

45
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,260
the primary care we've been
talking about and in-patient care,

46
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,670
patients particularly who either
are young and disabled and

47
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:06,480
older toward the end of life with multiple
health needs, persons at nursing homes.

48
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,930
Most nursing homes are for profit and only
a few very wealthy people can afford them.

49
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,390
They're very expensive and long-term care
insurance really hasn't filled the gap.

50
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,260
As a result,
Medicaid actually is the primary

51
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,690
financing agency for long-term care.

52
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:34,360
To be eligible for Medicaid financing,
however, patients must

53
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,960
basically divest all of their
assets before Medicaid will pay.

54
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,680
The types of nursing homes can
include skilled nursing facilities for

55
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,880
those who need rehabilitation care,
assisted living for

56
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,720
those who can live
independently with some help,

57
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,320
adult care centers and
separate rehabilitation facilities.

58
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,430
To use a rehab facility and

59
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,880
to be at least covered by Medicare,
you must stay in the hospital for

60
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,000
three days and
then be referred to rehab facility.

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,350
If you're eligible for Medicare,

62
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,600
then the Medicare would pay up to
100 days of rehabilitation care.

63
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,980
For patients who are discharged from
an inpatient facility who still need,

64
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:28,191
what we call, post-acute care,
that is ongoing care after discharge,

65
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,940
there are a couple ways they can get it.

66
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,720
Depending on how serious the care is,
they could go to

67
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,810
a rehab facility that's known
as a skilled nursing facility.

68
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:48,900
Or, they can be treated through outpatient
physical and occupational therapy.

69
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,140
In some cases, medical social
services would be provided and

70
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,970
durable medical equipment.

71
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:02,210
What's notable about post-acute care Is

72
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,080
that it's generally a part of the monthly

73
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,050
payment for
a managed care organization and

74
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,600
part of your insurance coverage
under commercial care.

75
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:24,010
You could also be eligible for home health
care depending on your acute care needs.

76
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:29,510
One of the advantages of home
health is that it allows patients

77
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:34,440
to return home and
get the care they need and

78
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:41,415
not to spend as much time in either a
skilled nursing facility or the hospital.

79
00:06:41,415 --> 00:06:46,390
So the idea is to provide care
at the lowest possible level.

80
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:51,780
And that would be in the home
with a home health agency.

81
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:57,890
Another part of the structure of the deal
with end of life care is in a hospice.

82
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,614
Hospice care is specifically for

83
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:06,070
terminally ill patients in
the last six months of life.

84
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:11,580
In contrast to all of the above
facilities where treatment is provided,

85
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,640
the idea is to provide minimal
treatment and maximal pain management.

86
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,070
The idea is to keep people out
of pain as much as possible

87
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:28,990
when there's no more medical
intervention that is advisable.

88
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,200
A lot of it is built around emotional and
spiritual support.

89
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,520
Many families find that hospice care

90
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,070
really helps them manage the end of
life for one of their loved ones.

91
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:50,280
Let's turn now to look more in depth
at the medical care workforce.

92
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,770
We can divide the workforce
into two broad segments.

93
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:59,350
One's physician and the other,
non-physician practitioners.

94
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,640
Let's start with primary care physicians.

95
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:07,270
Primary care physicians are the point
of entry into the system

96
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,590
where you can have your yearly physical or

97
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:17,820
if you have a medical problem
that you need to have diagnosed,

98
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,650
let's say, you're fatigued, you present
with your primary care physician.

99
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:28,080
If your primary care physician detects
a disease that requires more specialized

100
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,770
care, he or she can refer you
to a specialist, let's say,

101
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,490
a cardiologist or
non-cardiologist for cancer or

102
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:45,390
neurologist if there's a potential
problem with the brain.

103
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,470
But there are also subspecialists,
for example, some surgeons only

104
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:56,570
specialize in surgery on hands,
some only on fingers.

105
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,898
Other's more broadly to
be transplant physicians.

106
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:06,170
Many physicians have banded
together in multispecialty groups

107
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:11,010
where you can have an array
of specialists contracting

108
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:16,110
with the health system to provide
all of the systems' specialty care.

109
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,460
I mentioned before you can have
independent practice associations

110
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:26,160
that tend to be groups of
primary care practitioners.

111
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,480
One trend that we see is that
physicians are increasingly

112
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,856
employees In a health system or
the hospital.

113
00:09:35,856 --> 00:09:40,360
That's a major trend from 30 or
40 years ago when

114
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,999
most physicians were independent
contractors and had small practices.

115
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:50,400
It's just getting harder and harder
to compete in the marketplace unless

116
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:57,130
you belong to a larger group affiliated
with or employed by a health system.

117
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:02,280
Managed care organizations like
Kaiser Permanente have long employed their

118
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,580
own physicians who have bought
into the concept of managed care,

119
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,860
of preventive care.

120
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,520
But increasingly, larger health systems

121
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,320
outside of managed care
are following that same model.

122
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,850
On the non-physician practitioner side,
we have a number of different groups.

123
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:30,875
First, we have nurses who provide
all sorts of care in both acute and

124
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,230
non-acute settings.

125
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:39,404
Nurse practitioners are generally
nurses with higher level degrees and

126
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:47,070
tend to be holistic in how they
provide care and treat patients.

127
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,820
Also, another group similar to NPs
would be physician assistants.

128
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,930
Physician assistants are trained
under physicians and tend to provide

129
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:03,850
more technical care, suturing,
wound care, things of that nature.

130
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:09,780
But, in many organizations, NPs and
PAs are substitutes for one another and

131
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:15,990
both are quite capable of meeting most
primary care needs the patients have.

132
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:21,950
In some organizations, NPs and
PAs will have their own panel of patients.

133
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,147
Other non-physician practitioners include

134
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:31,095
nurse anesthetists who
assist anesthesiologists and

135
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:36,729
midwives who assist in
the birthing process.
