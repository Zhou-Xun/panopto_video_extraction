1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:35,920
But. Yeah.

2
00:00:50,690 --> 00:01:06,130
So. You know.

3
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:48,600
Right. I.

4
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,240
Yeah. So, yeah. But I think I went something wrong.

5
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,030
So. Otherwise.

6
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,850
Yeah, I.

7
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:50,130
Yeah. What, nine?

8
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:44,580
Yeah. My BlackBerry is now.

9
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:04,740
It's not. Yeah.

10
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,940
I would suggest.

11
00:04:50,820 --> 00:05:32,510
But. Yeah.

12
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:53,370
Yeah. I was like.

13
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:16,020
She? I figured out.

14
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:44,820
Hey, everyone. So while we're in this nice housekeeping stage, I just want to make a couple of announcements.

15
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,630
Um, one is like to be a little careful.

16
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,910
We have about 10% of the class currently out with COVID.

17
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:02,489
And for a lot of folks, it is symptomatic. So I would recommend, if you can, wearing a mask indoors while you're in the university buildings.

18
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:08,670
We've got pretty good ventilation in here. Some of you probably have far less ventilation in your housing.

19
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:17,459
So do be careful if this does affect you, especially if you have symptoms.

20
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:26,870
Please take a test. Please stay home. Please rest and don't have a panic about class assignments, though.

21
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,050
That's the last thing we want you to do is be worried about trying to complete things here.

22
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,780
COVID can really, if you haven't had it, can really knock you out and be tiring even if it is a mild case.

23
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,980
So please like take it easy on yourselves.

24
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:48,990
And we as a as a teaching team have about two years of experience of dealing with accommodations and helping everybody to,

25
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,160
like, make it back to class and finish the class successfully.

26
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:57,160
So there's plenty of things we can do if you miss assignments or class materials, that kind of thing.

27
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:05,280
All right. The other thing is that we will have our first written proper assignment coming up in a couple of weeks.

28
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,510
I think it's September the 29th, I want to say, but it might be the 26th.

29
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:16,769
Don't quote me, but it's coming up soon. And we have group office hours on Thursdays in 1690,

30
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:24,030
which is the big lecture theater directly opposite here next to the community room in the other building of speech.

31
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,629
And that happens every Thursday. You're quite welcome to come along and I think probably close to the deadline.

32
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,570
We'll get a lot of you coming along and asking questions about assignments.

33
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,750
You can also come and ask me questions during this 10 minutes at the beginning of class.

34
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:45,870
So just be aware of that. I suspect probably some of you will have questions about that assignment and how to do a decent job at that.

35
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:56,009
So please note too, if you can't make that and you want an individual appointment, Sara Rosenblum is offering individual appointments right here.

36
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:03,780
You can is the sign up for that there's the policy start on information 1130 2:01 p.m. every week on Thursdays.

37
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,820
So do come along and chat with us. You don't have to chat with us about homework or assignments.

38
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:15,540
You can chat with us about any old thing. Okay. But that's where we're guaranteed to be on Thursdays.

39
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,740
All right. It's almost ten past. I think we'll get started.

40
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,300
So today. We've got.

41
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:37,820
A case study for all of you based on maternal mortality, and I like to say maternal well-being.

42
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:48,320
If you were able to have a look at the readings and listen to the podcast, maybe you'll notice that these are it's quite a heavy topic for some folks.

43
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,620
So let's all be kind to ourselves in the discussion.

44
00:09:52,220 --> 00:10:00,379
One of the ways we're going to approach this is by having you think about some of the skills that you'll need in that first assignment,

45
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,730
which are practical skills that you need for advocacy.

46
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:13,129
So you're thinking about interest groups, you're thinking about the different viewpoints that they might have on this question of

47
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:18,440
maternal mortality and trying to figure out how to define maternal mortality as a problem.

48
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:27,080
Because something that's going to come up again and again in this course is the problem definition is a big part of advocacy.

49
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:33,170
Trying to frame the problem in terms that help your cause and your argument is a really key skill.

50
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:40,520
So we're going to take you through one way to do that today, which is the four s model, which is sit, stand,

51
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:49,190
strategize and say we're going to have you guys do a bit a little bit of group work in class with me, myself and Donna.

52
00:10:50,270 --> 00:11:03,030
So we should be ready to go with that. And there are lots of different models for advocacy as well that will cover during this course.

53
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,150
This is just one way to start thinking about how do you define a problem?

54
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:14,260
How can you then use that problem definition to your advantage when you're trying to create some change?

55
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,520
So for everyone's information, we just had our housekeeping.

56
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,630
I'm going to lecture for just a short period. Ask basically ask you a couple of questions, have a little bit of discussion back and forth.

57
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:31,750
Then we're going to do some group work and then everybody coming together at the end for some reflection.

58
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:39,129
And basically here we're trying to help you understand the different levels of

59
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,970
resources and political power that different interest groups have using this case.

60
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:48,250
Study of maternal mortality. Okay. This is my daughter.

61
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:53,319
So she was born. She's. She's a lot bigger than this now.

62
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,170
She's six and a half, but she was born over in the hospital Children's Hospital across the street.

63
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:08,499
And so just a reminder that this is kind of a personal topic for some some people who will have thought about this quite a bit.

64
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,710
Some people will be encountering this issue for the first time.

65
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:20,470
A friend of mine made her this U of M had made one Z with a blockade on it, which is quite adorable.

66
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,840
So any excuse to show you guys a baby picture is fine by me, so.

67
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:33,460
We've assigned you some readings for this class, and there's been a pretty heavy podcast on this.

68
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,349
So reflecting on anything that you may have covered in preparation for this

69
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,220
session or in preparation from other classes where you've touched on this issue?

70
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,050
Thinking about maternal mortality as a policy problem.

71
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:54,870
So not necessarily straight up a public health problem, although that might be a framing that you choose to use.

72
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,030
But how is maternal mortality a policy problem?

73
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:08,640
What are some different ways that you personally might define this as a problem that should be addressed by policy in order to make things better?

74
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,170
Oh, sorry. Almost missed you at the back there. Yep. Here, let me grab one of these.

75
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,620
I am going to check it, but not all the way. So we get.

76
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:58,690
One of the readings talked about Medicaid as being like a mechanism to invest back into provision and care for maternal health.

77
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,810
So that's a policy space.

78
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:08,020
Yeah, definitely. So if Medicaid in this case is the solution, the idea I mean,

79
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:15,820
we're going to talk about this quite a bit today and a commonly put forward policy solution is better access to health care,

80
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:22,240
including better access to mental health care for people who are pregnant and also after birth.

81
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:29,830
But if that's a solution, then maybe the proper policy definition is this is a problem of lack of access,

82
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,730
is the problem of not everybody being able to access the same support,

83
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:40,930
maybe not adequate health care, maybe you have health care, but it's not really good enough quality for your needs.

84
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,920
Thank you. Or maybe it's not culturally appropriate, which is another issue.

85
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:52,920
So, you know, maybe you want to have support during this time that reflects your own experiences.

86
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,650
Right. And so a lot of people giving birth don't have that.

87
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,629
Great. What is another way we could approach this as a policy problem?

88
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:09,720
Define this as an issue. Please.

89
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:22,420
Thanks. Like women who are people of color and more likely to lose a child or to die themselves.

90
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:27,880
So that's definitely a problem. Yeah. So in the reading, which is quite a bit.

91
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,500
Thank you. Particularly around black mothers experiencing this problem.

92
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,870
But that's not the only disparity here, but it is one of the biggest.

93
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:46,240
So we could define this as a problem of health disparities in that this affects different people differently in society.

94
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:57,080
And likelihood of having a very bad outcome from birth does unfortunately increase depending on your identity and your your cultural history.

95
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:04,980
So there are lots of other ways you could get at some of the drivers of disparities around this issue as well.

96
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,560
So it's multiple different problem definitions there.

97
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,120
What are some of the things we can think of when we define this as a policy problem?

98
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:25,300
Please. I remember in the reading there was like a lot about unnecessary C-sections and like kind

99
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,610
of lack of quality in the care even once you get to the hospital or like birthing center.

100
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:44,799
So maybe like making national standards for care, like sort of outlining the necessary qualifiers to get a C-section or like like other types of care.

101
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,510
But setting standards like that could be policy. That's great.

102
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,000
So you're again going above and beyond and giving me some solutions, too.

103
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:57,280
But, you know, at the heart, then the problem of not adequate access to care,

104
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:04,150
potentially you can get at care, but the care you're receiving is not appropriate.

105
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:11,200
Some people will argue that there are too many C-sections being given and that there are

106
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,300
factors that drive health systems to offering C-sections when they're not appropriate.

107
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:22,030
So there's a lot to discuss there. Any more definitions of this as a policy?

108
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:40,230
Please. I remember in the reading it talked about that 60% of maternal deaths are preventable.

109
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,489
So that definitely shows that it's something that can be prevented.

110
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:51,450
And there are multiple programs like the AIME program where it was talking

111
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:59,160
about like working with hospitals to develop programs that take into account.

112
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:05,970
It was like hemorrhage and hypertension, best practices.

113
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,980
And those actually have been shown to decrease maternal mortality rates.

114
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,660
So if those programs were just implemented at a larger scale.

115
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,590
We could prevent a lot of maternal deaths more evenly.

116
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:25,590
So notice then how you're defining this as a problem of not just mortality, but preventable mortality.

117
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,720
And I think we could also tie in preventable injury during birth and afterwards, too.

118
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,240
Thanks. Sorry. Sorry for reaching. Yeah.

119
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,990
So they you're arguing for more consistency in how we handle these and the spread of best practices.

120
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:52,140
So one thing that people haven't mentioned so far, which I think is and when I think about this, I think about it as a cluster of problems.

121
00:18:53,300 --> 00:19:01,610
And the reason why is I think this is a really good topic, a case study to have a look at for this question of problem definition,

122
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:08,870
because there are so many different ways to approach this as a problem and you as an advocate might want to do that framing in different ways.

123
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:19,400
First of all, one of the things we didn't mention was really problems of actually ascertaining what is a death for someone who is pregnant.

124
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:28,010
For someone who is giving birth. For someone who may have given birth because different places in the US measure this in different ways.

125
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:33,980
And there's a ton of issues with how you define a death in those contexts.

126
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:40,910
So Michigan is a state actually measures differently and counts differently in different buckets.

127
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,400
Deaths that occur while you're pregnant. Deaths that occur when you're giving birth.

128
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,970
And deaths occur within one year of giving birth.

129
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,560
That counts as a maternal death for these these statistics.

130
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:00,350
That's a bit of an issue potentially, because if different states define this in different ways,

131
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:09,710
we soon start to get a bit of a problem in terms of we might have a wrong a misconception of the scope of the problem, the causes of the problem.

132
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:18,620
I hope that you can see that somebody's dying while pregnant, somebody dying while giving birth and somebody dying one year after the birth.

133
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,309
There might be really different causation there and different issues.

134
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:26,720
So this could point to different solutions that might be necessary from a policy perspective.

135
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:36,290
So we do have to kick a lot about that data, including one of the readings points out that there's a lot of data errors here.

136
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,840
Did anybody take a look at that one where they're trying to correct basically the

137
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:48,380
conception that maternal mortality rates in the US were much worse than they actually are?

138
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,160
And part of the issue is we added a tick box.

139
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,380
So a very simple thing to data collection.

140
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:07,100
Added to data collection requirements caused more and more people to actually notify deaths as maternal deaths.

141
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:14,670
And that's exaggerated the seriousness of the problem. Now, this is a very serious and very important big scale problem.

142
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:22,640
The US is still compared to other similar countries in a worse situation than we would expect for a rich country.

143
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:33,050
And there are still incredibly serious disparities among who is affected by these maternal deaths and maternal injuries.

144
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,580
But at the same time, we actually have the statistics wrong.

145
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,440
So we were pointing to some states like Texas saying you're the worst state in the country.

146
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,190
And some of those statistics were incorrect. Now, I'm.

147
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:55,590
I don't plan to go through all these different program definitions, but hopefully you can see that some of the ones we came up with are up here.

148
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,190
So we've got the fact that this is disproportionate, disparate across the US.

149
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:09,560
I've mentioned that there are problems of definition and that mortality gets measured before, during and after birth.

150
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,040
We've mentioned poor access to care, poor mental health.

151
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:22,159
We didn't really define this as more societal or community based issue in the sense of looking for other upstream causes.

152
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,219
But that's what I would expect from public health students.

153
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:30,430
Right? Thinking about how empowered the person is who's giving birth, right?

154
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,600
Are they able to advocate for themselves or the barriers to that advocacy?

155
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:44,240
Are physicians maybe not listening to their choices or the other things that are affecting their ability to actually feel empowered in this situation?

156
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:53,930
Right. And that goes, too, for societal things such as your level of income, your level of housing security.

157
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:02,239
These factors can influence, you know, exactly how you receive care in this situation.

158
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,639
If you don't have good transportation, maybe you're not going to get as much prenatal care as somebody who does.

159
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:16,940
For example, if you are in a a situation where your income or housing insecure, it can be very difficult to forego work to attend an appointment.

160
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:25,700
Right. So all of these things that go on day to day affect people's ability to actually take up care,

161
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,830
particularly preventative care that may reduce the amount of maternal mortality or maternal injury.

162
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:41,300
And that's before we even get into discrimination and injustice, which we've already brought up in the discussion.

163
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:47,360
But I also want to add another environmental stressor might be exposure to violence

164
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,810
either within your community or within your own family in terms of domestic abuse.

165
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:59,480
So all of these upstream causes we want you to think about.

166
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,370
I will mention, too. This isn't just a contemporary problem.

167
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:09,559
We could choose to frame this also as a problem of history in the context of where

168
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,190
people are forced to live and the kinds of healthcare that they can access.

169
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,280
So we can think about, for example, problems of redlining.

170
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:22,430
We can think about patterns of breastfeeding, who was encouraged to breastfeed and who was not.

171
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:32,780
Breastfeeding has a nasty bit of history related to slavery in the context of having black women feed white babies.

172
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:42,320
And so the medicalization of birth as well, in the context of delivering fewer,

173
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:50,630
less emphasis on community health workers, on doulas, more emphasis on people with a lot of advanced medical degrees.

174
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:58,980
And so. You can start to see how complicated this is and why I picked this for this assignment.

175
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,140
Because your position as an advocate might benefit from any number of these framings.

176
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,070
You should also be aware, though, that there are competing frames here.

177
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,960
Everything I've talked about is very much within the realm of public health, within the realm of realm of health services research.

178
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,360
And I'm preaching to the choir here in terms of public health framings of this issue.

179
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,230
However, there are some alternate framings which include things like being much more individualistic.

180
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,060
So, for example, focusing extensively on the woman's health.

181
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:41,250
So is the woman obese? Is the woman, you know, basically, do they have underlying health problems?

182
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:50,880
This is a framing that's often used in this kind of debate to basically almost blame the individuals concerned for these preexisting conditions.

183
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:58,049
You could choose to, if you were more on the conservative side and you wanted to do something about this issue,

184
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,470
framing this in the context of family health,

185
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:10,409
which quite often gets used as a framing or in terms of centering on the infants rather than the mothers.

186
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:16,469
That's a frame that often gets used. You might choose to foreground substance abuse,

187
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:24,300
which is something that politicians like to do when they talk about maternal mortality, is allude to drug addiction.

188
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:33,450
And unfortunately, at the moment in contemporary politics, that's being connected more with criminalization of individual women's behavior.

189
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:42,000
So unfortunately, when you combine that with the discretion of that law enforcement officers have in certain parts of the country,

190
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,370
we're seeing some folks be arrested for being pregnant on the justification that this

191
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:53,220
is saving the the unborn child in some way and improving their health outcomes.

192
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:04,390
So. This is the kind of different frames that probably don't come from public health that you might encounter in discussion of this topic.

193
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:11,460
Any more questions? For the moment, anyone this is bringing up, any thoughts for anybody that they want to share?

194
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:22,650
Okay. So we're going to move on to I'll just introduce this briefly.

195
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:30,180
This is going to be for our group exercise. So you can use this framework for pretty much any advocacy work,

196
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:34,650
especially at the beginning when you're trying to figure out what is our position on the issue?

197
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:40,230
What are we going for, actions that we're going to take in response to this issue.

198
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,490
It's a very simple framework with four S's. So sit.

199
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:51,930
Where does your organization sit? Within the political structures that you talked about with Professor Greer last week.

200
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:56,130
Right. What power do you have as a group? Where does that power come from?

201
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,030
For some folks, it might be they some groups will have a lot of money.

202
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:07,890
Other groups will not have that. But they might have a lot of allies or they might represent, let's say, medical experts.

203
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,920
And so some of their authority could come from expertize.

204
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:15,120
So I'm asking you to think about the resources at hand, as well as your group's position.

205
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:20,690
Where do you stand? So what is your position on the issue?

206
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:27,860
What ideally would you like to see in terms of maternal mortality and how are

207
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,460
you framing the problem and how would you like to see the situation improve?

208
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:38,770
Strategize. So you're going to put the two together so that how can you leverage your position

209
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:43,660
as a group within the political system and the resources that you do have to hand,

210
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,520
as well as the stand that you're taking?

211
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:53,740
So the position you're taking on this issue and we're going to ask you in the exercise, which I'll I'll show you some instructions in a minute,

212
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,290
to come up with some simple steps that you can take,

213
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:04,210
that take into account the limitations that your group might face and as well as the advantages and resources that you have.

214
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:12,790
Finally, because advocacy is very much about crafting a message for an audience, you're being asked here to to say something.

215
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:19,610
So. What is actually going to be your message to the public in this context?

216
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:27,049
So it's about how you can deliver the message in a way that will engage your audience,

217
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:36,110
that will whether they are your allies that you're trying to bring in or the general public, or whether you're targeting a specific decision maker.

218
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:40,130
And you can start to figure out what you're going to say.

219
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:47,510
So these four things, like I said, it's very simple. We're going to have you think about these in groups and.

220
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:53,190
MBA. So we have a lot of real groups.

221
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,019
And I think you'll notice too, there's a couple of decision makers in there,

222
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,920
some senators and I picked a couple of people from Texas where this was a very big,

223
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:08,290
widely discussed issue, in part because the data at that point said that Texas was the worst state.

224
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:18,870
So I'm going to have you guys form some groups, about five or six people in each group, which means some of you will have to stand up, don't hate me.

225
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:26,220
And so if you could start to do that now, have a stretch form a group with five other people.

226
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:31,590
I'm going to start allocating some of these and I'm going to start on this side and then I'm going to go round.

227
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:38,740
So, John, if you could give me a hand, that would be great. Yes.

228
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:54,050
Yes. Okay.

229
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,750
I got people over here who look pretty confident that they. You guys group.

230
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:03,660
Okay. Thank you. All right. I'm going to start at the top. So I want you to represent black women, but I think justice, please.

231
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,580
Thank you. Who's the next group right here for?

232
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:12,270
Perfect. I'd like you to be the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, please.

233
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,450
Okay. What is this? Six.

234
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,420
I want you to be. Oh, public health awakened, please.

235
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:28,620
Yeah. Who needs an extra member in that group? Come on over. Fantastic.

236
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:33,210
Can you guys please represent the Century Foundation? Thank you.

237
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,720
All right. What do we got? Six. Perfect. I want you to be bid.

238
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,970
Senator Bill Cassidy. Oh, tricky one.

239
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:48,060
Yeah. Come on. I know you guys can do this. All right.

240
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,320
Who's this? Who's a group of six or seven of us? You're a seven.

241
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,660
Okay. I want you to represent Senator Maggie Hassan, please.

242
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,670
Okay. I want you to be Senator Maggie Hassan.

243
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,410
Thank you. All right. Who's next? Four.

244
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,870
And they're a different group. Okay, so I want you guys to be the Guttmacher Institute, please.

245
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:18,240
This group. Can you please be the Texas Department of State Health Services?

246
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,990
Thank you. Your group? Perfect.

247
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,110
Representative Sean Terry. She's an awesome firecracker from Texas.

248
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,210
Okay, we're falling over you guys.

249
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,540
Okay. I want you to be Senator Lois Cole. First phase from Tech, also from Texas.

250
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,309
Oh, yes. We got to handle the Republican points of view as well. All right.

251
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:44,730
What if what if I got in a group? Fantastic.

252
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:52,050
I want you to be the Texas Medical Association, please. Okay, well, we got over here.

253
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,740
Hi. High five of you. Perfect.

254
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,790
I want you to be safe, Texas moms. All right.

255
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:05,490
Safe. Save those moms. Okay. All right.

256
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:09,420
Did you guys fancy being the CDC? Sure.

257
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:14,430
Okay, we're going to do a little bit of global health, too, but I think. Yeah, I think that would be fun.

258
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,660
Thank you. Okay.

259
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,340
I'm going to have you guys be the National Birth Equity Collaborative, please.

260
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:27,630
All right. Sound good? Okay.

261
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:32,190
Can you please put your hand up if you do not have a group? Is there anyone who's been left out?

262
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,509
No. Good. Perfect. Remember the names of your groups?

263
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:42,030
These are real groups. You can look them up. Please designate one person as a reporter.

264
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,110
Here are your questions. If you want to do this analog.

265
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:52,170
We do have paper, pens, post-its, a chalkboard, whatever you fancy.

266
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,770
I suspect most people will. At least some people will be using the device.

267
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:01,170
I want you to work through these categories of questions. So sit and strategize.

268
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:11,810
Say at the end of the report there is a jam board link on canvas and it looks just like this.

269
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:21,690
Every group will have a link. I want you to pop your sound byte that you're going to come up with at the end of this exercise.

270
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:29,430
On the jam board, please. And then we will come back together to think about these reflection questions.

271
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:34,070
I'm going to give you until the hour. So till 11:00, please.

272
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:46,760
And I'm John and I are going to come round and talk to everybody, the families as well.

273
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:54,600
So I know I know.

274
00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:02,870
I know that there's always something more.

275
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,990
Yeah. To. All right, great.

276
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:16,650
Let's give everybody the. From the.

277
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:29,300
So let's go for something.

278
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:59,580
There were. I mean, I think colleagues.

279
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:16,770
I think that's one of the things.

280
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:34,850
I think. You know the guy.

281
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:17,460
Our Ethan. And then you go back to.

282
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:29,230
As supposed to. Why I.

283
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:44,170
This is not. I is instead.

284
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:53,850
It's just for my get. But this one guy thinks.

285
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:11,850
So maybe we can work other to keep them here.

286
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:27,710
I was like, You know what happening here?

287
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:39,420
Everything that I could do that.

288
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:58,290
We're not. That's 10%.

289
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,270
Yeah. Yeah.

290
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:28,480
Yeah, you know. So why?

291
00:39:53,700 --> 00:40:13,590
Yeah. So.

292
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:26,040
Yeah. It is not the.

293
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:34,180
We don't care about. Yeah. So maybe.

294
00:40:37,140 --> 00:41:01,830
Resources. The. Where show you.

295
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:15,840
I think. I actually.

296
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:36,940
I think. Yeah.

297
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:57,650
Something like. Of the.

298
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:07,970
Our. We the first.

299
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:28,770
I. I never.

300
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:42,620
Never. Let's time.

301
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:59,060
Our includes. I.

302
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:46,770
Yeah. Now?

303
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:58,050
Sometimes. Oh, yeah.

304
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:26,490
That's. She's like.

305
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:55,790
I guess we listen to. I see that have been lying.

306
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:19,320
If you want to. I really feel like it's.

307
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:42,450
Okay. Yeah, that's right.

308
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:55,520
Standing. I.

309
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:19,240
Why? I have.

310
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:38,510
You know. Because I was.

311
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:13,400
ABC News.

312
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:21,490
What we know and what we. I've done this on the box and maybe this.

313
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:51,190
So this is quite strong. Different.

314
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:14,540
Yeah. What's.

315
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:28,490
For special occasions. Or I, the government.

316
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:47,390
Maybe like. You got?

317
00:48:52,720 --> 00:49:09,670
I don't. Yeah.

318
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,830
Yeah. Yeah, I think a lot.

319
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:45,200
Yeah, but I.

320
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:52,870
Yeah. Right now.

321
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:36,010
This is. Which people are.

322
00:50:42,790 --> 00:51:07,240
They have. If local radio transmission.

323
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:21,840
Now. We?

324
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:44,670
I. Yeah.

325
00:51:51,990 --> 00:52:05,030
Sorry. I know it's tough.

326
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:12,470
Especially. When I visit.

327
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:20,070
Visiting. Also.

328
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:38,080
You know, there's. Okay.

329
00:53:49,510 --> 00:54:16,980
You know, we're looking. Yeah, I know.

330
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,860
Hello. So we have another bell, another 5 minutes.

331
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:27,290
Everybody, if you haven't made it to the strategise and say stage stages I would skip to is

332
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:36,790
particularly the say because we're going to talk about that collectively our.

333
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:56,930
You. Okay.

334
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:45,120
If you. I thought about.

335
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:15,530
We talk about. Now.

336
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:52,380
We have a company. Looks to me like.

337
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:06,900
Population is. Yeah.

338
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:43,990
Talking about. The main, they.

339
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:51,420
He. Love.

340
00:57:56,630 --> 00:58:09,360
I decided to have. How long?

341
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,480
Lovely. So then I don't think I think about it.

342
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:34,760
Maybe it's like trying to. Yeah, that's.

343
00:58:36,190 --> 00:59:01,320
We're going to support these bills. Yeah.

344
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:12,050
And it's good to see. But I.

345
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:29,660
Get ready for this great family game.

346
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:58,460
Oh. I feel like.

347
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:21,080
It's. Yeah.

348
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:39,690
I. Oh, look at that.

349
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:50,210
I mean, it's not like.

350
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:57,350
Yeah. I got my bags.

351
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:02,830
Okay. I'm going to give you one minute to wrap up anything you have not finished.

352
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:09,820
Make sure you got something on your say tab and had a little thought about the reflection questions.

353
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:30,570
There is same. So we have two parallel.

354
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:43,490
But all of the parts of the album that I.

355
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:54,440
When we get back the next time.

356
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:04,950
I just want to give myself a. I am so happy to see that.

357
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,610
If you're there observing from.

358
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:20,090
How I feel so that we get close to each other.

359
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:27,160
Yeah. You know how I looked at my father like any of that.

360
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:35,290
All right. Okay, so let's come back together and let's discuss this a little bit.

361
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:38,630
So, John, if you wouldn't mind. Thank you so much.

362
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:42,100
Like navigating that. And then I will do the slides.

363
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:45,250
So we put the jam board up. All right.

364
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:51,370
We're going to start. Okay. So I'm going to go pretty much in order.

365
01:02:51,700 --> 01:03:03,099
What I'd like you to do is start with your sound byte. Tell me what you're going to say and then any interesting anything you want to

366
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:07,100
highlight under the strategies tab in terms of actions that you're going to take.

367
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:12,280
Okay. Great. So we got black women. But in justice, you're representing that group.

368
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:21,850
What did you tell us about your soundbite? Yeah. So Black Women Birth Injustice is a grassroots organization committed to empowering black,

369
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:25,120
multicultural and trans folks throughout their and beyond their pregnancy.

370
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:33,910
They encourage education and promote policies that kind of go against unnecessary medicalization and birthing practices,

371
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:39,610
as well as providing resources like doulas midwives in their training as well.

372
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:46,040
Great. So what are some of the some of the things that you put on to strategize?

373
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:50,830
Well, just tell me your favorite one that you think you could take to create change.

374
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:58,389
Well, I think as more of a organization, we have like lobbying power in state legislation.

375
01:03:58,390 --> 01:04:07,510
And because this is an organization out of California, we think there's probably a majority of legislators that kind of agree with our

376
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:14,230
mission and we'd have legislative support in the state legislative branch.

377
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:21,370
So we would lobby for legislation that expands access to alternative birthing resources.

378
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:26,200
I know they talked about medical in our readings and having.

379
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:31,670
Insurance options that cover doulas and midwives,

380
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:43,220
as well as also legislation that would standardize of the protocol for emergency and emergency incidents during the birthing process.

381
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:52,580
Yeah, great. And I think too. So you're a grassroots group, you're California focused, so you would be trying to use your connections there.

382
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:59,480
But I think a great strength of the group is that you did this research and you talk to women and you can share experiences.

383
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:07,070
So one advocacy strategy that you might take as a grassroots organization is to get people to testify about their experiences.

384
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:15,350
Have materials available for the public that talk about women's experiences before, during and after birth.

385
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:18,739
So you're trying to highlight those problems of disparities.

386
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:22,250
And so some of your authority then comes from that.

387
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:25,570
It helps to strengthen your argument. Okay, great. Thank you very much.

388
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:31,390
Let's go to the next group. You know, I.

389
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:39,390
So our group was the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,

390
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:49,800
and they're a professional organization of 60,000 physicians, health care people who are in ob gyn gynecology.

391
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:56,220
Mm hmm. And they believe in equal access to care and practices that promote maternal and infant health.

392
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:06,450
And they do a lot of stuff they provide, like, best practice guidance, but also initiatives to increase abortion access,

393
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:11,700
reduce unintended pregnancies, and reduce disparities in health based on bias and prejudice.

394
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:15,180
Mm hmm. So you got a very long soundbites. Yeah.

395
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:24,600
But I do expect maybe that a bit more from your kind of group where a lot of your authority is coming from professional expertize and status.

396
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:29,130
Right. So notice how I'm talking about the authority for the argument that you're making.

397
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:35,700
Who are you able to represent? Can you represent particular evidence?

398
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:40,120
Can you show experience? Can you represent a profession in this case?

399
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:48,270
Right. And I would imagine that under strategize you, for example, you're providing members to testify in their,

400
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:51,810
you know, their white coats that they may or may not actually wear to work.

401
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:58,889
You sometimes see in congressional hearings, folks stand up and they'll give that their professional opinion.

402
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:07,320
And you can talk about the what your members observe in professional practice, which is a real strength maybe for some of these coalitions.

403
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:18,780
I like that you kind of mentioned they have the resources here and especially you're a medical specialization.

404
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:22,950
If I just had you be the American Medical Association,

405
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:31,409
you might have had a much harder time coming to a position because you have a mixture of different physicians with different political views,

406
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:36,870
too, and you're trying to represent that membership. But as a specialization, it's a little bit easier for you guys.

407
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:41,160
Great. I'm going to pass on to these guys behind.

408
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:52,620
Okay. So you guys are you guys, Bill?

409
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:56,490
No, you're not, are you? What was your group? We were public health awakened.

410
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:00,299
Okay, let me find you. Do you know what number you are? On the side of?

411
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:05,200
15. Okay. Nobody get dizzy.

412
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:08,740
There we go. All right. So tell me, start with your sound bite. What are you going to say?

413
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:14,590
This group is comprised of public health professionals and policy researchers who understand health

414
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:19,000
disparities in their communities and have a platform to advocate for vulnerable populations.

415
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:21,609
We advocate for them through policy recommendations,

416
01:08:21,610 --> 01:08:27,640
empowerment initiatives and tools to encourage understanding contemporary health issues in the context of social justice.

417
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:32,890
We believe that the political process is and voting is key in introducing change,

418
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:39,280
and that health equity is a guiding principle that can put the right people in positions to introduce policy to protect mothers.

419
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:43,630
Okay. So notice that you're using obviously public health language.

420
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:48,940
It's language that all of us in this room, in a public health program probably are quite familiar with you,

421
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:55,150
talking about social justice, talking about equity. So very public health oriented perspective.

422
01:08:55,690 --> 01:09:01,870
Do you think that that helps you? Do you think that that hinders you in any way in trying to put your message out there?

423
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:07,749
I think it definitely helps us because these are the people that are part of this organization,

424
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:13,450
are very directly involved with the community, community health workers and other local organizations.

425
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:19,660
So I think in that case it can be very beneficial and they have a perspective that other groups might not be able to provide.

426
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:27,370
But at the same time, this can also be a limitation because not everyone is completely open to hearing a public health perspective,

427
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:32,950
and that can affect when our group does outreach to the general public and in the community.

428
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:37,299
Right. And public health is, as we all know, is a very controversial issue right now.

429
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:42,700
So there are going to be some people in society who don't want to hear from public health experts in any way right now.

430
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:50,200
But your strength is also public health expertize in that you can talk about maybe the experiences of community health workers,

431
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:58,300
workers or other community practitioners. And so that gives you a different perspective than the medical perspective that this group had.

432
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:04,300
Great mixed feelings. Where are you on the jam board is also the next one.

433
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:07,930
The next one made it easy for you. Perfect.

434
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:13,180
Since you guys sent you foundation. Okay, tell me about your talking point first.

435
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:20,650
So we're a progressive think tank that conducts research and drives policy change for economic, racial and gender equity and education.

436
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:25,210
Health care as black maternal mortality is one of the primary issues related to equitable health care.

437
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:29,110
Our efforts work to bridge this gap largely through publications and dissemination of

438
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:32,440
research to educate legislators and other stakeholders on the importance of the issue,

439
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:40,450
as well as how to address it. Okay. So I think especially let's have a look under your strategies.

440
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:44,229
You've got research publications and information here.

441
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:48,250
So as a think tank and we had a couple of think tanks in the mix here,

442
01:10:48,730 --> 01:10:56,740
a lot an often underestimated source of authority and and support for coalition creating changes information provision.

443
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:04,959
You need somebody to formulate policy positions to put information out to the public and especially I think in your case,

444
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,850
we talked about connectivity with members of Congress and legislators like we could

445
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:17,230
see the Century Foundation is maybe a hub of organization around legislative change.

446
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:22,660
You're trying to network and use those connections to push your message forward.

447
01:11:22,990 --> 01:11:30,459
And so in a coalition, you quite often get some groups that are a bit more grassroots working with a think tank that's a bit more connected at

448
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:38,410
the legislative level to try and coordinate information briefings and do the legislative politics side of things as well.

449
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:44,790
Great. Next group, please. Okay.

450
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:49,130
Who are you and where can I find you on this board? Third.

451
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:59,600
Uh huh. So you guys had one of the toughest challenges because you're representing Senator Bill Cassidy.

452
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:06,900
We're imagining you, I guess, as his staffers. So what was Bill's position on maternal mortality?

453
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:14,550
So Bill's position was he was concerned about the maternal mortality rate.

454
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:19,140
However, he didn't really.

455
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:23,230
Well, he. He didn't really.

456
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:31,000
Okay. He dismissed like health inequities by race and kind of insinuated that.

457
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,940
Black women are not there.

458
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:46,190
More maternal mortality is not as important because it's so much worse than white women's maternal mortality.

459
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:52,340
And so you're doing a great job of being euphemistic. He just said out and out some stupid racist things.

460
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:57,770
Yeah, exactly. So you just had this really difficult challenge because he's a doctor.

461
01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:02,870
He does have a history of acting on maternal mortality issues.

462
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:05,780
He cares a lot about prenatal care in particular.

463
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:14,480
But in trying to publicize the legislation that he had co-sponsored with another senator, he said some very dumb things,

464
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:23,930
predominantly that his state wouldn't look nearly so bad in terms of maternal mortality if we just excluded all the black people from the data.

465
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:32,090
Wonderful, wonderful statement from Senator Cassidy that so you have this difficult task because he's

466
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:38,840
obviously not educated about disparities and he publicly just put out this statement.

467
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:45,019
However, it's also a challenge for our Senator Maggie Hassan team because you're coming from

468
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:48,650
a different which is you guys down the front coming from a different perspective.

469
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:52,880
You guys have to figure out how to work in coalition around this piece of legislation.

470
01:13:53,360 --> 01:14:01,520
And we're talking about Senator Cassidy as somebody who is one of the most likely senators to support legislative action on this.

471
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:04,370
So you've got to figure out that that bridge. Right.

472
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:13,340
So some of your actions, for example, improving transportation is definitely something he could advocate for, particularly.

473
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:25,000
And he sponsored this bipartisan legislation. And there's definitely, among some conservatives, a push to change the definition of maternal mortality,

474
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:32,660
to frame the problem in a slightly different way. And I think the team for senator, though, his caucus probably encountered the same thing.

475
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:35,960
She wants to redefine the data. I think.

476
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:44,420
Partly selfishly in the senators representing certain states or legislatures representing states don't want their states to be the worst.

477
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:51,770
So they quite often are sponsoring state level bodies to try and look at the data again and redefine the problem somewhat.

478
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:57,710
Great. So thank you for dealing with this difficult position from Senator Cassidy.

479
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:07,230
All right. I'm going to come down the front then, if you guys. Long way over for Maggie.

480
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:11,520
Yeah. Oh, no. Well, tell me.

481
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:16,380
Tell me your say as it shows on your screen, and I'll refresh. Oh.

482
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:24,870
It's really quite. It's that close.

483
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:28,910
All right. Just give me a best summary we haven't got.

484
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:41,660
Essentially, our say is basically urging people to contact their representative and support a bipartisan bill that promotes access to maternal care.

485
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:47,200
Right. And especially we talked a little bit about how one of the ways in which Senator

486
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:51,550
Hassan and Senator Cassidy overlap is that they care quite a bit about prenatal care.

487
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:56,739
And the challenge to that is going to be there would be a lot of people in the wider

488
01:15:56,740 --> 01:16:01,570
coalition of interest groups who would define this is not just a prenatal issue.

489
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:09,000
They're going to define it as an issue for people giving birth and people after birth for a period of time as well.

490
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:14,499
So that's the challenges. You want to talk to each other in order to get this bill actually sponsored.

491
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:21,070
But then the the difficulty with that is facing pushback maybe from other allies on your own side.

492
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:25,270
Yeah, that's definitely a challenge, but not to our center.

493
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:30,460
Hasan has a really good track record with passing bipartisan bills,

494
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,650
so we were definitely think that that's a strong point of hers and we put it up on our board.

495
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:39,280
Yeah. And successful senators in particular have to work with each other.

496
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:47,679
There's only 100 senators in Congress. They have to form relationships that are long term and go on more than the legislation in

497
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:53,050
question in order to be able to get to that track record of passing bipartisan bills,

498
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,860
which can be very frustrating for everybody else outside the legislative process,

499
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:01,810
looking at that person and saying, well, I wish we could move them further in this direction politically.

500
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:06,700
All right. I'm going to speed up next group, please. You guys behind.

501
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:13,990
Thank you. Yes. So we are a nonprofit research organization that uses evidence to inform policy.

502
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:19,390
Our primary focus at the moment is disparate access to reproductive health care across the states.

503
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:21,580
And to demonstrate this,

504
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:28,450
we are mapping current laws and policies impacting abortion on a state by state basis due to the recent overturning Roe v Wade.

505
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:30,340
Yeah,

506
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:42,040
so we talked a lot about how we can use our research as we have our own or our own journal and a lot of up to date information to collaborate with

507
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:47,139
other advocacy groups that are able to use the research and information that

508
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:52,990
we have to do that boots on the ground like work to actually cause change.

509
01:17:53,350 --> 01:18:03,489
We also talked a lot about getting our map more accessible to the general public so that the your average individual will be able to know,

510
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:07,360
like, what is going on in their state as it's changing every day. Yeah.

511
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:13,659
So you're definitely more in the information provision kind of role and some personnel in the office is having to

512
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:20,170
track all these bills and bits of legislation and but providing that as a service to a greater coalition of allies,

513
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:25,269
which is challenging because if you're, um, you need to get the information out there,

514
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:31,450
but at the same time you got to make sure that you're, you're actually heard, right?

515
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:35,410
You've got to raise awareness. It does rely on you cultivating a strong public audience.

516
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:42,380
Okay, one behind. Have I got the Texas Department?

517
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,880
We do. We'll do a couple of these groups. Tell me your say. All right.

518
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:52,730
In Texas, we are striving to empower pregnant mothers to know their health risks and speak up.

519
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:56,840
Together, we can empower, educate and eliminate avoidable deaths.

520
01:18:57,530 --> 01:19:08,420
And so we kind of went with putting focusing more on empowering pregnant mothers to kind of take on this issue.

521
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:13,220
And that's difficult because as a health department, we can't really be political.

522
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:20,140
And in Texas, which with a conservative majority, can be challenging.

523
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:24,560
Right. And it's a difficult state to advocate around.

524
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:28,339
And also, as a government, there are certain things that you cannot do.

525
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:33,260
I like how you've put this in your reflection here in terms of you can't really get too much into the

526
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:38,720
deeper social roots of the problem because your authority is to speak about health issues and health care.

527
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:42,860
Right. And then so necessarily speaking about community health,

528
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:48,830
you've got to judge your political audience and the opinions of the public when you're making those statements.

529
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:57,330
Okay. So we're going to go send it to co-host. Behinds and then you guys over there, I think, and then we'll wrap up.

530
01:19:57,810 --> 01:20:01,120
So. Miller.

531
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:07,050
Oh, and then we'll do Syria and then the two of you can kind of trade off against each other.

532
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:12,090
So tell me your say, first of all, for Senator Corker,

533
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:19,079
we had her say that as the chair of the Texas State Senate Committee on Health and Human Services and a proud mother of two.

534
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:24,520
It is her goal to support all Texas mothers in their efforts to protect life at every stage.

535
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:27,720
So she just has this habit of sort of twisting.

536
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:36,270
That even like she is very anti-abortion and she isn't even that supportive of, you know,

537
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:42,360
postpartum care either, which we initially thought because she's short in the expansion from 6 to 3 months.

538
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:47,300
So it's a lot of twisting and making it seem like she's an advocate.

539
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:52,260
So we felt like she would sort of phrase it in this way. So this is a really good example of framing.

540
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:55,709
So if you look at all her press releases, it's look at me.

541
01:20:55,710 --> 01:21:01,070
I'm expanding access to care for women in Texas by supporting this legislation.

542
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:12,160
Look at me being bipartisan. A lot of her actions in the legislature were actually to dilute the bill to make the extension of health care less short,

543
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:16,710
a shorter extension to several months rather than the originally proposed six months.

544
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:24,150
So you've got to be really careful when you're researching this for your assignments to try to latch on to that.

545
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:30,390
Don't just take the first impression of the issue that's put forward in someone's press release.

546
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:34,980
All right. We're going to, for the last one, want to call on Sean Kerry's group.

547
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:38,790
And then don't worry, next time we do this, I will start on this side of the room.

548
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:48,060
So. So Gary is a Texas representative advocating for legislation supporting maternal health and passionately fights for mothers in Texas.

549
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:52,230
After authoring a bill for the expansion of research into maternal health and mortality,

550
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:56,130
it's evident that there are racial disparities surrounding health, which is one of her interests.

551
01:21:56,490 --> 01:22:04,140
And as a member of the maternal Texas Maternal Mortality Task Force, she's dedicated to addressing the issue of maternal mortality in Texas.

552
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:07,680
Right. And especially like you to again,

553
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:15,720
I'm going to have to come to a consensus between Sean Theory's position and senator caucus position are actually quite far apart,

554
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:22,560
especially once you go outside maternal health to consider reproductive health and those kinds of issues as well.

555
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:27,329
All right. We're going to wrap it up there. Come see me if you have any questions.

556
01:22:27,330 --> 01:22:42,730
We'll see you in a couple of days for the next part. Thanks. It was gone.

557
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:46,980
Hey, I just got in. Maybe just turn the video.

558
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:48,034
I don't think you want.
