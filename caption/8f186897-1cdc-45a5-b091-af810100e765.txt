1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,540
Yeah, I remember. And like this process enabled.

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,730
I think it's actually good because it's not like, you know, but it has intuition.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,330
It's very basic. It's not like the meaning of data.

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,590
Yeah. This is if I guess it's recording Panopto now.

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,220
So this is the only one that makes everyone allow the slides to be recorded?

6
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:33,570
Yes. Okay. Oh, my God. Yes. I mean, you seem to know all of them.

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,260
Absolutely. No, it somehow it doesn't look like as many as I thought a 100 would look like and then not hear all of them.

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,720
I know, but we're close. We're at, like, 85%. But I don't know.

9
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:53,180
I mean, when I count, I guess that's why that message me as a stranger on the screen.

10
00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:00,470
Okay. But at time, we're doing interaction.

11
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:07,019
Yes, that's interesting. All right.

12
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:14,040
We're going to get started. Um, I promise class won't just be the four of us awkwardly standing in front of you all the whole semester.

13
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:23,370
But, um, so welcome. If you're wondering which classes is this is biostatistics 699 one of several classrooms that will be used in this semester.

14
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,690
Um, we're going to talk, spend time today talking a lot about logistics and schedules and all of that.

15
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,800
But for now, we're, we're all gathered together, the four of us professors, the 100 odd of you.

16
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,190
And we thought we would start off by just introducing ourselves.

17
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,500
In case you don't know who we are. And so we're just going to go in alphabetical order by last name.

18
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:55,740
Um, we're not going to get a chance to go through all 100 of you, but hopefully we get a chance to get to know you as the semester goes on.

19
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,790
So I'm Phil Boonstra. I'm an associate professor here in the department.

20
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:06,870
Um, this is year five or four that I've taught this class.

21
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,230
Some of you might know that I'm also a graduate of the department, so I took this class, um,

22
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:20,160
as a student to Jeremy was one of my professors, so I've kind of been on both sides of this course.

23
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,510
Yeah. So I headed off to Jane. Hi.

24
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,010
Hello. Hi. I'm Jean Morrison. I'm an assistant professor.

25
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,550
This is the third year that I've taught this course.

26
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,499
The first year was online, and I will say it's dramatically better in person.

27
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,809
So it's really nice to see all of your faces when I'm not teaching.

28
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:53,340
699 I work in statistical genetics and some causal inference if you.

29
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,330
I stay for your Ph.D. and you want to take the causal inference class.

30
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,550
I at least teach that this year and might teach it in the future.

31
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:09,470
So I'll just advertise that for the future as well. Thank you so much, Gene and Phil.

32
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,700
I'm Brimah Mukherjee. I am the chair of the department.

33
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:19,520
I was on sabbatical in University of Cambridge in England for the past semester, and I did not get much done.

34
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:27,170
I lived a hog woods like life and it's good to get back to teaching and research and retraining my brain muscles.

35
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,130
It has been wonderful every time we have taught. 699.

36
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:38,450
Most of the time I have taught with Jeremy and once with Tom and Bryza, and it has always been a wonderful class.

37
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:46,010
We have taught ourselves many things, the instructors among each other, and it's wonderful to have Phil and Gene join the team.

38
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:51,229
And together we are going to teach you about how to solve practical problems.

39
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:58,670
And the process starts today. But the class cannot be successful without your active engagement, so please make this class yours.

40
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:04,550
Whenever you ask a question, please say your name and introduce yourself if you want to.

41
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,390
I welcome you to 699 and look forward to a great semester.

42
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,989
So I'm Jeremy Taylor taught class maybe 18 times.

43
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:23,750
I don't know exactly how many, but quite a lot. It was actually predated my existence in this department.

44
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,969
Mort Brown, who's some and some you may see him around develop this course many, many years ago,

45
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:34,610
it sort of morphed a little bit, but it's basically a structure that's been around for 25 years.

46
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:42,010
So I'm a professor of a department. And so so what we're going to do today, I guess I should flip the switch.

47
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,879
We're going to introduce the class. So that's what we slides on.

48
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,200
And there's a campus site with lots of lots of slides of his slides on the campus site.

49
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:07,570
And. And then we're going to talk to the service lives about what it's about, what the concepts are and expectations a little bit,

50
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:14,770
and what your activities and duties will be in them as a sort of a rather complicated

51
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,470
schedule in terms of what goes on and what they and what room you're in.

52
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,649
And that's sort of not wasn't our wish to have it that complicated,

53
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,240
but we tried to make sure we could get rooms which are big enough as often as we could.

54
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,920
So anyway, so Phil will go through that and then a 1:00 so we'll have a break.

55
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,280
We usually try to have it like a five minute break in the middle of a class and then at

56
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,020
1:00 there'll be a guest coming in who is going to present you with the first project.

57
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,900
And so that's. Two, 2:00.

58
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:55,950
2:00. So. Romo is sort of set that project up and and will introduce him but as a gain I want to just emphasize what Obama said.

59
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:03,660
That person's a known statistician and begin to sort of describe a little bit about a project to measure scientific goals and the data.

60
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,500
And you should be really actively sort of thinking about,

61
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:14,010
so what questions do you need to complete the task that you're going to be required to do for that data?

62
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:20,880
So you don't want to leave this class at the end of a period, sort of in a fog about what what you're supposed to do next with the data.

63
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,900
Okay. So I'm going to present this overview here for class and.

64
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,380
You know, even I go through this, feel free to ask questions and.

65
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,050
Okay. So alphabetical order. So I get lost.

66
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,960
So. So, yes.

67
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:55,710
So the objectives here are to give you sort of experience and training and confidence to handle sort of statistical tasks when you get the real,

68
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,770
real problems in a real setting.

69
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:03,920
And, and and then sort of questions that are being asked, you're trying to learn something from the data that's being given to you.

70
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,820
So it's both and as both an aspect of analysis of the data and sort of designing studies, two will be covered in this class.

71
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,219
And so, you know, many of you will be leaving or even if you're going on to a PhD program somewhere,

72
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,260
you might you'll have to look at data over your career over the next few years.

73
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,930
And, you know, so this is first to give everyone some experience in sort of how you might

74
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,620
approach that data and how you might look at it and analyze it and report it.

75
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:42,120
So try to make you ready for a real world. So this. And so, you know, we're you know, we've designed the course to sort of help you achieve that.

76
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,569
So help you apply the sort of concepts and methods and techniques that you've learned in your

77
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:54,480
classes and sort of the principles to that you've learned to real applications and service.

78
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,570
It's not a tech, the sort of questions you're going to get sometimes it might be a little vaguely expressed.

79
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,830
So you have to sort of convert the scientific objectives of of the questions from the

80
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:10,580
investigators into sort of what's a viable statistical strategy to answer that question.

81
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,560
And so you have to think about what's how you're going to do it, and then you have to implement it in terms of, you know.

82
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,640
Doing the analysis and writing. Writing.

83
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,950
And then the end of it. Reporting. It's a reporting it into two sentences.

84
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:30,100
One is one is written and one is oral. And so you'll be doing both of those things in the course of a semester.

85
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:40,090
And so just more along the same lines. So you've learned stuff from sort of textbook examples,

86
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:46,230
and I know some of you done projects in classes too, but this is class is all about doing during projects.

87
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:54,820
And so these are real projects. It's a real data sets. And so, you know, you're trying to learn sort of the skills you've learned from a, you know,

88
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,320
somewhat abstract theoretical setting in classes to, to what to do with real data.

89
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,230
And figure out a reasonable strategy to address the problem you're faced with.

90
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,160
A strategy doesn't have to be super complicated. It could be quite simple.

91
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,980
You have to do something. What's appropriate for that question?

92
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:17,339
And another point which will become very obvious to you as you start to see what other people are doing,

93
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,639
is there's not a unique answer to these sorts of questions.

94
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,780
There's lots of analysis approaches you could take and lots of ways of sort of nuancing the data or choosing

95
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:33,870
subsets of the data or whatever you however you want to approach it with several possible potential answers.

96
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,810
And many of them might be good. Some might be a little better than the others, but I don't think there's one answer here.

97
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,970
And so here's a bit about the structure of a class services.

98
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:55,459
There's going to be four projects. So just for your information, you know, 18 years ago, 20 years ago when I started teaching a class,

99
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,560
there are five projects, so you're getting a good deal.

100
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:06,790
And they're going to require using statistical approaches, each of them and three of them involve analyzing data.

101
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:14,440
And one of them is concerned with designing a study. So some so you'll get sort of exposure to all of those things.

102
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,069
You know, projects are chosen to be different from each other.

103
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,979
So it's not like you're going to be doing logistic regression for every single

104
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,390
project designed to be sort of introduce different skills and use different skills.

105
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:32,339
So will be, you know, that's sort of a main task, the main focus of our classes doing these projects.

106
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:42,060
And so these projects will be presented by usually a outsider, an investigator, a scientist who's probably doesn't have much.

107
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:48,599
One has limited statistical training, and they're not expected to tell you how they think you should do it.

108
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,440
Statistically, we're just supposed to sort of say, I'm, you know, a scientist.

109
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,510
I got this data, I got these questions, and, you know, I need help analyzing the data or answering your questions.

110
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,350
And there'll be a variety of statistical methods required.

111
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,790
I just give a so generic list here. And so, you know,

112
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,709
sometimes you'll have done classes which were methods that covered and but there might be cases

113
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:15,560
where the data sort of a methodology which is right or appropriate or you think is appropriate,

114
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:22,950
you haven't covered in whatever classes you happen to have taken. And so will be that that might happen and we'll be we'll talk about methods to.

115
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,530
Okay. So this is sort of a complicated bit.

116
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:37,700
So you'll get you took us quite a time to work through this was actually got to be five

117
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,170
different rooms used during the course of a semester and it'll become a little more obvious.

118
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,250
And half of the students half of you have been assigned to Jean and I.

119
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,300
So you have a JJ team so you can you can think of that.

120
00:11:54,390 --> 00:12:01,040
We have was of a PB team. So so a metal filler will go through that if you haven't seen that already.

121
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:08,120
So you're sort of assigned to us. And so and so what'll happen is sometimes we'll be all together in one room like we are today.

122
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,799
Sometimes we'll be split into two rooms. And then you have your JJ group.

123
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,530
You go with where we're going in the other group, you get with them.

124
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:24,680
So and sometimes you'll be split into forums.

125
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:32,240
So that's four days you're doing presentations. So that's the reason there's four instructors here basically because when you do oral presentations,

126
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,080
we go to separate rooms and that was forums available for us.

127
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:44,420
So do go to your assigned room. Okay.

128
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:53,360
So this will become clearer as we move along. So what's going to happen in my class time is there'll be discussion of a project,

129
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,140
so that'll be sort of a significant part of time and that's somewhat unstructured

130
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,300
sometimes because it's up to you to sort of ask questions or to give your thoughts or,

131
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:06,680
you know, such. So talk about what you're doing for a project and then whether that's suitable or not.

132
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,990
So that'll be, you know, you and us doing that and the visitors when they come.

133
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:19,330
Some of the time you'll be presenting orally to your colleagues in four separate rooms.

134
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,180
And and that'll be Eva.

135
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,870
You present what you've done so far.

136
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,540
I'm a project halfway through it and we go five interim.

137
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:37,340
So halfway through a project sort of span of time for each project, there'll be an interim presentation by half of you,

138
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:43,730
sort of half of a pupil who in June and I's room will present an interim report or a report,

139
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,680
and the other half and unionized room will present a final report or report on that.

140
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:56,790
And then we'll be talking about, you know, lectures, if you like, on statistical methodology topics.

141
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,420
Those topics will be sometimes, you know,

142
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,740
highly relevant to a project and sometimes a little less relevant to sort of the ongoing projects, but important.

143
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:12,510
And then we'll talk a little bit more in sort of a. And professional development type of things about, you know,

144
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:20,440
how to think about collaborating with with non statisticians, how to effectively communicate and collaborate with them.

145
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,530
Okay. So this is a core component as projects.

146
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:36,739
And I said this for projects and. So we had someone come in and will introduce the project and describe an incident.

147
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,510
You know, may well have some slides, but sometimes it's not totally.

148
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:50,400
You know, it's not totally clear what their goals are, what, you know, they have generally a question, but they're not we're not it's not a question.

149
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,670
And, you know, to, you know, do a t test of this, it's much more sort of scientifically phrased.

150
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,480
So you have to sort of make sure you when you listen to that,

151
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,180
you have to think about how can you for what what sort of analysis plan can you formulate for the data.

152
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:14,510
So we're going to introduce the project and you ask questions to clarify to to understand the data, to understand the research objectives.

153
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:25,760
And then about 3 to 4 classes later, I don't know the exact number is there will be some of you will present an interim report service.

154
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:33,380
Okay. So there's four projects. Projects two and four presenting interim reports on.

155
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:41,710
And then projects two and four. You also present final reports on Project three as a final report.

156
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,780
Oral report, but no interim report on Project one.

157
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:52,240
There's no oral presentations at all, but you've got a hand in a report of some form.

158
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:58,030
Okay. Just we'll go through this more. So this is just sort of the idea of what you do.

159
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,590
So for projects, you have a period of time to work on each one.

160
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:09,910
Some of them you'll be presenting orally, even halfway through the end, and you'll always be handing in a written report.

161
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:19,240
And so Project one is. We're actually just sort of a written report.

162
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:24,760
We'll we'll talk about this more. But for a written report, it's going to be sort of structured a little bit.

163
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,590
It'll be sort of a template driven thing you have to do to fill out, and it'll get explained more.

164
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,799
And then Project two and four sort of a projects type of projects we've had.

165
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:44,020
I've always in this class over years you get a dataset and half of you get randomized to give an

166
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,040
oral presentation halfway through the interim and half to give your presentation at the final.

167
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,619
So that's project two and four and that's schedules is available on canvas and people will

168
00:16:53,620 --> 00:17:00,459
go over it a few minutes and usually upload those or presentations prior to the class.

169
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,910
And we will look at them and, you know, do show up.

170
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,660
You may not be scheduled for know particular Tuesday to present, but you know,

171
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,680
you're expected to show up and, you know, somehow, you know, support your peers.

172
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,470
You also can learn from them quite a lot of what they're doing. We have.

173
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:20,320
You know, they have some different ideas of how to do it and you might might learn something from that,

174
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:25,580
or they have some neat graphics or visualization, which you might learn from and those sort of things.

175
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:32,299
So you really are expected to show up even if you're not presenting the man you always hand in a written report,

176
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,340
which you upload sort of before the final day when presentations are made.

177
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:50,770
Any questions here? Okay.

178
00:17:52,260 --> 00:18:03,180
Yeah. Right, right. So we had, as you probably realize, we had some switches of our classes, classrooms, and somehow as a glitch in our system.

179
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,629
And so one of a section has four sections and you know,

180
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:12,690
you signed up for one section and one of them somehow they managed to claim save a class was only going to be on Tuesday.

181
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,440
That's not true. We're going to be every single Tuesday and every single Thursday.

182
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,060
It's one, two, three. Always. One, two, three. So, yes.

183
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,130
I don't know. We have to try to rectify that. It's hard enough to get it in place now.

184
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,180
It just got screwed up. Yeah. Don't.

185
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:33,639
Don't think if you're in what happens a section that happens to say you only have class on Tuesday, but you've got two or three.

186
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:46,420
Right. On Thursday. You do not. And it's a project three is going to be done in pairs and we'll be we haven't done it yet,

187
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,380
but we'll be assigning repairs and it's concerned with study design.

188
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:00,110
And there'll be an oral presentation at the end of that and and some sort of structured written report as well.

189
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,530
So at the end of that, that'll come along. Okay.

190
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:09,970
We're going to be lectures on topics. You know, sometimes they'll be very relevant of a specific.

191
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,870
Data you're looking at at a time.

192
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:21,810
Sometimes they'll be on sort of other topics which, you know, we we believe in every graduate from U of M biostatistics should know something about.

193
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,770
You may or may not have seen it in classes, depending on what classes you've taken.

194
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:30,600
So for some of you, that might be a bit of a repeat of stuff. You know, if I was you, it might be new.

195
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:37,350
We'll try to present it in a way which is a little more sort of intuitive rather than sort

196
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:43,650
of a mathematical details in terms of sort of understanding of what this methods really is

197
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:48,270
trying to achieve and how it is to Paris and how it does that and what sort of ways to think

198
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:52,050
about it rough and sort of how to implement it and what are the theories associated with it.

199
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:00,900
Okay. So we're happy for you to collaborate with each other in this class.

200
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,299
You know, do talk about the projects and potential analysis.

201
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:12,030
You're thinking about your pit, your peers. So that's typically people quite like to do that.

202
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,360
It's quite sort of fun for you to sometimes to work together.

203
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:21,120
You have the same projects throughout the semester, but you don't expected in May.

204
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,629
You've sort of talked about it and worked through sort of what you might, might do.

205
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,490
You're expected to actually implement it yourself and write up your own report.

206
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:37,780
You're not sharing reports except project your own paths. And you can share other things you can share.

207
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,000
You know, I is how I.

208
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,510
You know I found with friction in oh which makes these nice graphs you know you can tell your friends about that function but don't sort of say,

209
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,620
well, here's the code and you know, what do you use this, you know, sort of you know, try to.

210
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,179
Be too collaborative in terms of sharing,

211
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:02,020
but mainly I think sort of talking to each other about how you're going to approach analysis is a very useful thing to do.

212
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:10,050
Okay. We'll get a lot more in through the course of the semester.

213
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,510
We'll cover a lot of these topics in a little more detail.

214
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:19,110
But, you know, you're going to make all presentations and, you know, PowerPoint or PDF and they're going to be.

215
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:29,420
Slightly different length. Sometimes they're going to be longer. 13 minutes each in most cases will be spread over two days.

216
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:34,340
But when we do those and then sometimes they'll be rather short, very short, 7 minutes each.

217
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,930
And so we're going to have a two hour spell of class one, two, 3:00.

218
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,959
We're going to fit in 13, seven minute talks.

219
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,570
So words have to be very, very concise so that it'll become more apparent as we move along.

220
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,799
A mess, you know, so we'll go through this more.

221
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:01,280
But the expectations of written reports in terms of a format and a length and and those sort of things are not they're not long,

222
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,990
but they're not short either.

223
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:13,459
You know, just remember, we have to read these and we have and it's this is this is like 25 hours work for us to read one one project.

224
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:21,050
So it's a substantial amount of work. And yes, the important thing is the second bullet here.

225
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:25,730
This is not written for a statistical audience. This is written for the investigator.

226
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,260
So you want to write something which they can understand and you may or may not realize.

227
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,250
But most investigators you work with don't understand the equations at all.

228
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:40,639
They just sort of blank counters, like, you know, like we look at X-rays of a heart and we have no idea what it shows.

229
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,620
Right. For them looking at equations, they have no idea what it shows. So don't try to explain things in terms of equations.

230
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,290
It doesn't mean you can't have, you know, an equation in there or to just sort of be precise about what you're actually doing.

231
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:58,730
You don't it's not it's not written for a statistical it's it's written for the audience of of sort of medical journals and investigator.

232
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,600
Okay. So you're, as I say, writing it for a non statistical audience.

233
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:10,560
And we're going to talk a lot more about this sort of stuff as we go along. Okay.

234
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:15,940
Project one. There'll be more details later.

235
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:21,070
We have a sort of a template driven report structure we've we've thought of to do for that project.

236
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,680
Mrs. Just a little bit about what reports look like.

237
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:35,500
You know, we're going to put your name on the top, put your your ID number on there as different sections.

238
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,840
And, you know, we'll we'll go through this more detail,

239
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,540
but sort of try to learn a good structure of reports and sort of an important thing you learn from this class.

240
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:49,830
I mean, it's also on the syllabus. Sweetheart in a lot of detail about this.

241
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:57,920
You should all be. I mean, that's okay if it comes up here.

242
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:06,150
Yep. So, you know, reports usually have tables and figures in them.

243
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:10,430
I mean, it's a sort of a major way to convey your data.

244
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,450
But you're working on findings.

245
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:21,860
And, you know, this is sort of an important thing to get to try and get good at and, you know, try to be have the figures particularly be clear.

246
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:26,320
You know, that means fonts picking off and, you know, figures should be self-contained.

247
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,350
Too many people, when you look at an article,

248
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,050
you sort of scan through a little bit of a text to be look at the tables and figures and sort of you can make them self-contained,

249
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:40,980
but it's sort of an important thing to do. Um, again, we're going to go through these sort of things in more detail.

250
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,350
Okay. So here's a task item.

251
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:52,930
You hopefully all saw of an email three or four days ago saying you're expected to be required to do this, Piers, training, services,

252
00:24:53,590 --> 00:25:06,549
training in sort of how to be a responsible researcher in terms of both sort of ethical standards and privacy and all sorts of issues.

253
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:10,180
So as these two modules in Piers and.

254
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,969
We're asking that you obtain certification in these two modules so that I don't see

255
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:21,160
anyone gunmen recently they want to take our suggestion and do remember last few days.

256
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,660
No. All right. Well, you got to do your own vacation.

257
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:30,070
So we take each module takes maybe 2 to 3 hours something.

258
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:36,580
Yeah. Well, if you're 20 of your quick and how much you skip through vertex but with text to read

259
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:41,160
and you get some questions about sort of ethical behavior or something like that,

260
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:45,400
I mean, you have to take a quiz at the end and you have to get like nine out of ten, right?

261
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,800
You and if you don't get it right, you have to do it because again, if you still don't get nine out of ten, you have to keep taking it again.

262
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,770
So so it's kind of just like go to the quiz and hope to get it right.

263
00:25:55,310 --> 00:26:01,100
Anyway, the other modules that you are not required, like there's one about like taking care of animals in the lab.

264
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:06,139
Like, that's not relevant. So you're welcome to.

265
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:11,290
But these are them to look for these two. So that's what we'll be checking.

266
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:19,470
You just read a report? I probably. Can I be sure I've had who's taken down some of his already?

267
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,430
Okay. So maybe 50% of it or something like that. Well, good.

268
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:33,970
I mean, graduate students who are graduate research assistants are sort of required to take me so seriously.

269
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:39,130
Okay. So as far back as I say, January 17th, we'll.

270
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,249
So, you know, you're going to be getting data, which, you know,

271
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:50,879
it's not necessarily very easy for us to find suitable data for this class for you to work on.

272
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,060
And sometimes the people who provide the data are a little concerned about it sort of leaking out.

273
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,150
You know, we've invested a lot of time sometimes in collecting these data.

274
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,940
And so, you know, even though you're going to use it and have access to this data for the projects,

275
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:11,159
it's not so yours to keep afterwards and to pursue on your for your for your own purposes.

276
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:17,490
So as we ask, we're going to ask you to sign this data use agreement, which basically says,

277
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,340
I understand this is confidential and I won't use outside the class and I won't save it for long term.

278
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,630
So. There's something on.

279
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:33,930
Canvas with this agreement. So we just ask you to sign it and upload it, I assume?

280
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:42,220
Yeah. I'll double check that. You'll be able to upload it as just a PDF if you can just electronically upload that site.

281
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:51,550
And I said, January 13th, I think I made the due date of the 17th, but I will.

282
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:02,249
Okay. So we'll talk more about grades two, but grades signed about this aspect based on my written reports.

283
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,459
And so that's basically three quarters of a grade.

284
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,440
And as an aspect based on my oral presentation and that's a quarter of the grade and there's

285
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:15,090
much more details of this in the syllabus and we can go through it at some later class.

286
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,270
The first project tends to be downgraded a little bit to.

287
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:29,680
Among other things, we'll discuss sort of how the grades or have a scores are assigned them and the expectations for participation.

288
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,579
And, you know, I'm late to report policy.

289
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:39,100
I don't know. It's always a bit of a. You know, it's hard to know what to do.

290
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:45,640
People have genuine reasons why sometimes a reporter's like and plagiarism.

291
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,459
Service is an in-person class typically.

292
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:57,810
You know, my 18 odd years of teaching this class, you know, the vast majority of students show up to every single class.

293
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:03,070
This is not so easy being offered on Zoom. This is expected to be here.

294
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:07,060
You're going to gain a lot more by being actually present.

295
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,920
There'll be a lot hopefully a lot of discussions and interactions which since, you know,

296
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:17,740
being here will make that much more beneficial and more interesting, more fun for everybody.

297
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:24,340
This may all be recorded on Panopto. So after class you can look at the class.

298
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,329
A lot of a class type is unstructured in the same way as we discussion of a

299
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:33,970
projects and so a mess obviously works much better if people are in person.

300
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:46,130
Whereas my campsite, if you go to it, you know, there's 20 years of sort of saved material on the site with,

301
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,880
you know, lots of lecture notes like this lecture now has, you know, a version.

302
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:56,419
This thing about introducing my class with the version from, you know, 2018, the version of 2019, the version 2020.

303
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,420
But there's also tons of material on sort of statistical topics.

304
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:08,090
There'll be, you know, folders on regression modeling and folders on survival analysis and folders on generalized linear models and on generalized

305
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:15,560
mixed models and the whole range of stuff which will be using some of those during the course of the semester.

306
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:22,820
There's also instructions on reports and examples of past reports which we'll probably go over with

307
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,970
appropriate time and sort of some professional development information where sort of a day to day activities,

308
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:34,510
which we'll talk about today more. Okay.

309
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:38,940
So I've said a few times, be engaged. It's more enjoyable, more fun if you are.

310
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,580
You know, you're in the sort of environment where, you know. He's supposed to be somewhat protective.

311
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,899
Don't feel bad about asking a question.

312
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:56,040
If you don't understand, it's better that you sort of not necessarily ask a particularly smart question in this environment.

313
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:01,860
When you're sort of out in a different work environment, we're not going to judge you on the questions you ask at all.

314
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:09,360
So we encourage you, even if you're unclear about the, you know, what's needed and you figured it might be a stupid ask my question.

315
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,489
I mean, we sort of it's better you may be surprised how many of your colleagues don't really follow what's going on.

316
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:23,740
Like you said, we really encourage you to be interactive. And we will allow lots of time for questions and comments and discussion.

317
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:34,000
So a little bit of advice, though. We're we can talk a bit more about Ms. get working on the projects early focus on answering the question.

318
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:40,680
Quite often a simple statistical approach is going to be just fine for a project for data.

319
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:45,190
It's not about what's for cleverest, most tricky statistical approach you can do.

320
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,620
It's about answering the scientific question. The last thing maybe this is my personal thing,

321
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:56,509
but try and think in terms of the models and their interpretation and whether they achieve

322
00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:01,510
for scientific goals rather than thinking in terms of sort of a code and the software.

323
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:07,750
And then so be driven by a sort of a scientific and with statistical principles, not in terms of sort of driven by the code.

324
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,639
And. Yep. So it's most students, it's an extreme.

325
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:25,940
This is an extremely rewarding and useful class. And if you have any if you've attended some of our, you know, alumni lectures, people,

326
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:30,679
you know, alumni come and get some sort of lecture from time to time to speak all of them.

327
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,990
We'll talk about you know, I may remember it with I remember it fondly or not.

328
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,200
It's not so clear. But they definitely remember this class and six of them.

329
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,910
And many of them say things like, it was the most useful class in the program and we end.

330
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,770
So I think that is. That's it.

331
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:52,119
Here we have any more. Christians.

332
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,700
I think now Phil is going to go through the schedule and.

333
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:09,129
Yeah. 3.36 pages. Six pages, excluding figures.

334
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:13,660
So you can have tables and figures to write. And, you know, we'll talk about it more.

335
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:19,940
But I mean, if you do six pages and four lines, it's not like we're going to put a big X for it and give it back to you.

336
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,770
I mean, we're we're not going to be that strict. We just don't want you to be cognizant.

337
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:30,820
Part of a skill is, you know, being concise and sort of reporting the things and.

338
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:36,360
But the appendix is not counted as part of the six pages, but that cannot go on it.

339
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:44,610
If there is a possibility for this table as sort of a six page of text, if you like, plus tables and figures,

340
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:51,089
but you think of a relevant one, and plus you can have supplemental material in addition where you put extra things.

341
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:55,620
But remember, we're not really going to look at that too much. We might look at it a bit, but not too much.

342
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:02,840
And we don't want 25 pages of supplemental materials. Something which you think ought to be in there, but not just dump everything you've done in.

343
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:16,650
Okay. You suffered. Okay, look.

344
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:24,820
We should. So this is the canvas home page.

345
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:27,930
One of the things.

346
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:38,750
So what I want to point you to and make and kind of walk you through is this class schedule, which I see that some of you I can like.

347
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,000
Yeah. So there's a good number of you on there right now, which is great.

348
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:49,730
I got like notifications of people requesting access to it just because we were still working on it.

349
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:54,069
So I just it's you have everybody should have access now. So if you do,

350
00:34:54,070 --> 00:35:02,980
let me know if you have trouble getting on to view here because you shouldn't like that would there's something that we need to figure out why.

351
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:14,470
Okay. So there's this is the main this is kind of like your map for this semester that we're that we filled out partially and that we're filling out.

352
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,000
So each day is represented by a row.

353
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:27,250
And obviously, in addition to the date, it kind of tells you like what's on tap for that day.

354
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:36,280
Um, there's columns for each of the projects. And so when a particular column, project column is grayed, that means that's like active,

355
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:42,310
that's, that should be on your mind for those days, meaning there's something to be working on.

356
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,690
So there's a start and an end for each column.

357
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:51,880
And you'll notice, just like in real life, there's going to be some overlap of, of projects.

358
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:57,490
So on the 24th is when your first project will be due.

359
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:06,180
And on that it's not really overlap I guess. But on that same day, you're gonna be introduced to your second project and then, um.

360
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,430
Sorry. Probably would be appreciated by zoomed in here.

361
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:19,880
No. So function now to the old fashioned way.

362
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:35,530
So this is Project three. You'll receive it on February 16 and you'll probably still be like hopefully not starting,

363
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:41,700
but polishing, putting the finishing touches on Project two for the next class presentation day.

364
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:55,170
Okay, so scroll back up. In addition, there's a topic column that just is more for just as much for our purposes as it is for yours,

365
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,530
because we fill that out over the course of this semester.

366
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:03,760
It lets you know. Roughly what we'll be talking about in class that day.

367
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,630
Um. There's a reading's column that is conspicuously empty here.

368
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:14,390
I'm not sure if that's going to stick around or not. We haven't obviously filled that in.

369
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:21,500
Probably most important, because it's most complicated is the last two columns.

370
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,520
So you all know there's four sections to this class.

371
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,570
Um, the section that you registered for is basically immaterial.

372
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,950
That doesn't really matter at all for this course.

373
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:38,270
Obviously, that's where you'll get your grade, like. Well, yeah.

374
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,780
So in Wolverine Access, it still says that section that you registered for.

375
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:47,420
We've basically promoted you all and added you to subsections.

376
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,850
So half of you, like Jeremy said, are in the Braemar Phil section.

377
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:57,290
So that's. And I'll show you how to figure out that case.

378
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:02,180
So you always go to the room if you're in the Braemar feel section,

379
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:08,300
which you will be for the duration of the semester, you go to the room in the Braemar Phil column.

380
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:20,090
Okay, so today we are all together and 1020 um, for example, next week, Tuesday the 10th, we are,

381
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,810
we're also all together but in a different classroom because this classroom isn't available on Tuesdays.

382
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:33,200
All right, but everybody is going to a different classroom, 1755, the following Thursday.

383
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,890
So a week from today, we have our first, like split day.

384
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:42,890
1020 is the Braemar classroom. 1755 is the June Jeremy classroom.

385
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:51,690
Okay. Because there's two different colors. The following Tuesday.

386
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,310
This is the last example. I give different classrooms, but different rooms also.

387
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,970
So you'll notice that there's color coding here to the classrooms as well.

388
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:07,370
Not to go into the details, but we wanted to optimally use the classrooms that were available to us,

389
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:14,470
subject to the size constraints as a class and also the availability of the rooms.

390
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:27,780
And so we're trying to minimize, for example. The the days that were used in 1755, because this is just a little bit better space than.

391
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,900
1755 OC.

392
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:39,270
So the less so next important thing is which which of the 250 group rooms are you in.

393
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:44,940
So that's that's most easily determined by this next tab in the Google sheet.

394
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:50,390
Days when was two two days in a row for. Oh, yeah.

395
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:58,120
Okay. So Jeremy wanted to remind me, just so he mentioned in his slides, this will be a good segue way.

396
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,940
So there's some presentation days,

397
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:06,510
so there is not going to be anything in the topics column because that whole day is devoted to student presentations, which is you.

398
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:11,650
So there's we're not leading anything that day that will be exclusively students presenting their work.

399
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,390
So on Project two and four, there's two days in a row for interim presentations.

400
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,810
Is there more that you wanted me to say on that, Jeremy?

401
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:32,710
Okay, so that's the Segway into here and that will be in the forums, not two rooms on any presentation day will be in four rooms, not two rooms.

402
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:40,360
So to find out where you go on those, just navigate to the next tab over which is the up or Mahtab.

403
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,690
This tells you two things. This tells you which of the 250 group.

404
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:50,020
Classes you're in and individually tells you which day you need to go on presentation day.

405
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:56,460
Okay. So. I'll just pick an example.

406
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:07,730
So if you're this person, Rachel Davis. You find your last name and you first of all, this tells you that you are in the Phil Bomar classroom.

407
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:12,250
Second of all it tells you that I'm project to.

408
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:20,390
Excuse me. You have an interim assigned to you and you are going second on the day of the interims.

409
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:33,640
Reading over to the Project for Black columns, the same person has a final assigned to them and they're going fifth in order on that day.

410
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,520
It's all for the OR. These are for the oral presentations.

411
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:42,240
Okay. So everybody should have one interim, one final.

412
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:51,270
And if you are in one professor's classroom, the one day for Project two, you'll be in the other professor's classroom for the other day.

413
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:58,290
And we also tried to make it so that if you start early on, one day you start you're kind of later on the other day.

414
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,390
Obviously, that can't be perfect, but that's kind of the objective criteria here.

415
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:11,300
So these 51. People are in fill our classroom.

416
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:18,300
If you don't see your name here, that likely means that you are in the Jeremy classroom, which is here.

417
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,870
Oh, sorry. There's us. There's color codes here.

418
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:32,840
So for those who are interested in such things, this is the dark two palette from the color brewer package they're consistently used across.

419
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:37,400
So Orange appears in the main tab as well, but orange is always one 6880.

420
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:48,130
This lovely green is always 1122 OC So that's for presentation room 1680 is my presentation to.

421
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:55,980
This is a Jeremy classroom. If you do not find yourself in the field my room, you should find yourself in the Jeremy room.

422
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:00,030
If you find yourself neither, then that's a problem. And we need to fix that.

423
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,450
Same way to interpret it here, though. And if you find yourself twice, that's also a problem.

424
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:17,510
Rooms are down here. Jean is in 1755 Jeremy's and g020.

425
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:24,420
Okay. So kind of like we're just like doing the tour of School of Public Health this semester.

426
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,680
Finally, this is just because this is in the tab, too.

427
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:36,820
This is where you can. So we've got a number of office hours set up.

428
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:41,420
Each of us has an individual office hours. I don't know if we settled.

429
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:46,890
That will be zoom always or is it up to us? Okay.

430
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,490
So each of us has an individual office hour scheduled throughout the week.

431
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:55,380
Mine is Zoom. I'm not sure about my colleagues.

432
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:05,150
That information is on the syllabus. Separately, we have two paired professor office hours, so it's helpful to kind of like for us and for you all,

433
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:08,520
for us to bounce ideas off each other as we're engaging with you.

434
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:14,219
So those are always on Mondays at four and Tuesdays at five.

435
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,970
And yet another classroom probably should pick a new color for this. I just realized.

436
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:23,240
So you can kind of see who's signed up for those.

437
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:32,820
We'll fill this out. So this is this is like the in-person professor office hours Monday and Tuesday afternoons.

438
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:49,780
Do I miss anything? Uh. So if you have a conflict like your sister's getting married on the seventh day and it's one of the days when you're.

439
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,410
With presentations going on, you've got to let us know. Yeah.

440
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,490
Around now. But don't let us know. Three days before I got presented with.

441
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:09,270
Especially if you're presenting like it's we can probably we can make it work easier if you'll just be gone and you're not scheduled to present.

442
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:14,250
But if you're scheduled to present, then we have to obviously make an adjustment there.

443
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:20,720
So everyone should look at that very soon and tell us if there's a problem with the presentation based on that person.

444
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:30,570
And if you're and just to clarify, if you're an interim member for projects, two and four interims are spread over two days.

445
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:35,220
The numbering scheme for interims is.

446
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:42,910
Does that reflect that? So for example, I think this I 13 is the last.

447
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:56,230
Interim Day. So we have to clarify it since it's not exactly half, but either i7 or I6 will be the final person on day one,

448
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:00,220
and then the next person will be the first person on day two of interims.

449
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,570
So I 13 is actually going last on the second day of interims, for example.

450
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:16,560
Yeah. The story. Uh, says a.

451
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:21,290
For the first day. Text.

452
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:27,430
The text arrives. Oh, thank you.

453
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,180
Okay. Yes, thank you. I will. I'll make that adjustment.

454
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:35,870
I'll add the A's in the base, and then I'll make that clear. Thank you for pointing that out.

455
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:41,760
Yeah. Yeah.

456
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:45,670
Go ahead. We're not.

457
00:46:49,620 --> 00:47:02,590
Good question. Yeah, good question. So if you are agreeing on a certain project, you go to the green room for all four interims and finals.

458
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:09,610
So, yes, if you're not present, then you go to your the room that you are going to present or that you had presented previously.

459
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:20,990
So. So, for example, New Honor Chen is present in interim sex.

460
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:28,970
They will also go to Vermeer's Room for the final presentation days only as an observer and an audience member.

461
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:36,830
For a project to correct. And then that same person will go to my room.

462
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:44,990
The first on interim days they will be an audience member and final days they'll be present in ninth.

463
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:54,330
Good question. Yeah.

464
00:47:54,340 --> 00:48:00,220
So this is your road map. It links from our homepage. We will keep that updated.

465
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:05,920
And my homework is to add that and be notification that I forgot it.

466
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:12,360
Forgot to put in. Okay.

467
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:44,810
Okay. So this is. So if I can figure out how to make it both screen.

468
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,660
Well, I think it's big enough. So this is just a couple of short slides.

469
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:58,620
And these were motivated by a desire to give you a sense of what timeline you need to

470
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:04,409
work on and sort of save you from suffering later due to not starting early enough.

471
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:11,639
So I'm going to be a little repetitive in this presentation, and it's because starting early is the key to success.

472
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:18,270
And so I'm going to say that a couple times in a couple of different ways and try to convince you to do that.

473
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,860
So as Phil showed on the schedule, there's these blocks of gray for each project.

474
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:30,900
And if you look at how long do you actually have in total calendar days from

475
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:34,320
the moment you learn about the project until you need to hand the project in.

476
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:38,579
So the average is 29 days, the first project is 19 days.

477
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:44,850
So in just more than two weeks you will be handing in your final project for Project one.

478
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,400
Project four is a little bit longer.

479
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:56,459
So thinking about this in terms of the whole timeline, how am I going to get all of this work done is going to help you again,

480
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:01,470
to not suffer and to enjoy the work that you're doing and to produce work that you're proud of.

481
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:06,959
So this is sort of a roadmap of how you might go about starting this project.

482
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,480
So the first thing that I want to stress is just don't wait to jump into the data, right?

483
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:19,500
You'll get the data presented to you today. I'm going to encourage everyone, go home, open the data and do something with it.

484
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:26,399
Make a plot and make a summary. Look at the data and try to understand something about how the data works.

485
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,480
So the first questions that you're going to want to ask yourselves are.

486
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:36,280
Does the data look the way I expected it to? Right. So is there missing data?

487
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:44,170
Is did I think this field would be an integer? And then sometimes it has words in it or it's a date or what is this field?

488
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:51,550
Generate some first summary statistics. Right? So if you see there's an age column, the nice thing is, well,

489
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:58,330
maybe I'll make a histogram of age or maybe I'll see what the average age is or I'll see how much missing this there is in that column.

490
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:07,810
And then at this point, you can even start thinking about your final project and you might start thinking about what is going to go in table one.

491
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:15,610
And we'll talk a little bit more about what table one is in the next couple of classes, and we get really into what a report is.

492
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:23,530
But even at this stage, you might start thinking about what of this summaries that I'm generating might I want to show someone in my report.

493
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,720
Okay. So now we've opened the data. You've looked around a little bit.

494
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:35,930
We're now at the stage of making a plan. You should really get to this stage within the first several days of looking at the data.

495
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:39,720
So in that first week, you want to start generating ideas.

496
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:45,780
What kind of analysis strategies are you going to use as you generate these ideas?

497
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,829
You may find that trying to think about this generates questions, right?

498
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:55,350
So don't start with. Well, I can't think of any questions. Start with how am I going to analyze this data?

499
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:59,280
And then that will lead you to your questions. So you'll think, Well, what am I going to do with the missing data?

500
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:05,010
Why is the data missing? Why is the data like this? How am I going to manage that in my analysis?

501
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:11,580
So try applying some of your ideas in the first week so you don't have to wait until

502
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:16,260
you think you have a perfect model to try fitting something and see what happens.

503
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:24,510
If you're giving an interim presentation in P2 or P4, you're interim presentation is now coming right up.

504
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:28,980
So we're a week in and you should be thinking about what's going to go in your interim presentation.

505
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:33,299
And as you start thinking about this, even if you're not giving an interim presentation,

506
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:37,980
you can think in this manner as a useful way of propelling yourself forward.

507
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:44,070
For me, it's very useful to think, what would somebody else ask me about this if I was presenting it to them?

508
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:50,970
Right. What questions would I anticipate getting? And then answering those questions leads me to do better work.

509
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,379
Okay. So now we have some initial analysis ideas.

510
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,830
We've done some initial data exploration.

511
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:05,510
And I'm going to encourage you to at this point start writing. You're not going to want to start writing.

512
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:09,920
You're going to want to keep like fiddling around in the data and wait until your model is perfect.

513
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,989
Don't do that. Start writing now so you can start the introduction.

514
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:19,459
You can start the method section before you know what your final model is going to be.

515
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:20,900
And I would encourage you to do that.

516
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:27,319
In fact, as you write the method section, you might find that it helps you figure out what methods you should do.

517
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:31,790
Right, because you're you're writing about what you did. And so you think, well, why did I do that?

518
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:37,220
I should be able to justify that. Or should I check this model and see if this assumption makes sense?

519
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:45,229
So based on the initial results that you've gotten, you might now start to think about refining your strategy, right?

520
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:51,230
So if you don't, if something about the results doesn't make sense or you don't like the assumptions that you made, now you're going to go back,

521
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:57,530
do it again, do something different, talk to your friends, see what they did, see what things they're thinking about.

522
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:04,790
I think Jeremy mentioned collaboration with your friends or classmates, and I think that's a great idea, in fact.

523
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:15,030
If you can push yourself to talk to people who you haven't talked to in your time here, who aren't your usual group that you've done.

524
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,900
601602 with that can also be.

525
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:31,770
Be good, right? You'll you'll learn from other people. These days are like ballparks, but they're hopefully to to guide you to do this.

526
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:39,870
Generally earlier than you thought that you would have to. So I'm going to encourage you to try to have at least a partial draft.

527
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:46,650
I said by day 17, so about two weeks in, it'll need to be earlier than that for project one because project one's a little bit shorter.

528
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,170
And at this point, you might still have analysis to complete.

529
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:58,800
And then the last step is give yourself more time to revise than you thought that you were going to need.

530
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:08,340
So by three weeks and you should have a very clear picture of what your analysis plan, as your report should be, partially or mostly drafted.

531
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,750
You might be done running your analysis, you might still be rerunning, tweaking a little bit,

532
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:20,100
doing some maybe sensitivity analysis, decide on your main figures, spend some time to make these look nice.

533
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:26,250
So the first figure you generate is probably not going to be the last the figure that ends up in your report.

534
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:32,129
And then I don't know how many people take this advice, but I think it's good advice.

535
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:37,290
And I'm going to encourage you to take it, plan to finish your report a few days before it's due.

536
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:41,010
Give yourself time to read through it again.

537
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,560
Revise it. I'm going to encourage you read all the way through it twice.

538
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:52,050
So that might you might do it in one big sit down where you print it out and read through it.

539
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:56,490
You might read through it in chunks, but read through all of it at least twice.

540
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:06,300
Revise as you go. Put yourself in the shoes of someone who's going to read it and think about how are they going to understand this report?

541
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:10,980
Could someone who doesn't know this project understand what I did, why I did it?

542
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:14,490
Could they replicate what I did? And would they have any questions?

543
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,900
Are there any questions about this little overview from here?

544
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,849
I just want to mention that there are two forms of reporting.

545
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:28,170
Two of them are structured, so maybe just distinguishing.

546
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:33,970
Yeah. So we'll get into the structure a little bit more next week.

547
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,480
The general report is the same, right?

548
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:44,560
So if you go to canvas, there's this outline of introduction, methods, results, discussion.

549
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:49,120
That structure is the same for all of the projects.

550
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,220
Project one instead of writing.

551
00:56:54,670 --> 00:57:02,170
A report just on your own. We have a guide that guides you through each of the sections, but you're writing the same sections,

552
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:10,000
and I would actually encourage you to just use the same structure for project one, Project two and Project four, Project three, as I would say.

553
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,020
90% similar in structure to the other two,

554
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:21,340
but will be a little bit different because it's in pairs and because it's a slightly different project that we'll talk about when we get to it.

555
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:26,270
I would say functionally think of Project one as a report.

556
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:32,350
The only thing that's different about it is that you have a little bit of a guide to write the report instead of us just saying,

557
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:36,640
okay, go write it there.

558
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:42,640
Any other questions? Okay.

559
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:50,890
So I think our investigator is here, right? Uh, do you have time for us to have, like, a little four or five minute break?

560
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,490
Okay, so we'll have a short break.

561
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:55,300
Let's say it's 157. Let's say come back at 202 to or two.

562
00:57:57,413 --> 00:58:02,183
And Tom is an assistant professor in the division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine.

563
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:10,282
Tom actually did his undergraduate in history and chemistry from Emory and then went to several places for his medical training,

564
00:58:10,283 --> 00:58:16,553
including Miami and Texas. And then he came to the wonderfully cold state of Michigan in 2013.

565
00:58:17,783 --> 00:58:24,443
Tom's research interests are mostly about ICU patients, about decision making around ICU patients,

566
00:58:25,163 --> 00:58:31,733
research around family members of patients who spend a long time in ICU in Michigan.

567
00:58:31,913 --> 00:58:41,063
Tom has been quite a proponent of compassionate care, also talking about racism and racial biases in pulmonary care.

568
00:58:41,873 --> 00:58:50,663
I met Tom during the very dark days of the pandemic in 2020, and we will have meetings in about actually COVID modeling.

569
00:58:50,963 --> 00:58:57,202
And Tom was living in his basement and taking care of COVID patients all day, all night.

570
00:58:57,203 --> 00:59:02,993
And sometimes he will be in his white good falling asleep. Statistics does that do to people.

571
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:09,532
But but. But it was quite an inspiring time for all of us working behind the scenes,

572
00:59:09,533 --> 00:59:15,683
trying to look at clues about COVID, but also frontline health workers who are taking care of patients.

573
00:59:15,683 --> 00:59:19,833
And so, Tom, was the reality for me what health care workers were going through.

574
00:59:19,853 --> 00:59:23,093
So since then, we have worked on a lot of projects together.

575
00:59:23,453 --> 00:59:30,803
And this project particularly I looked at this note that they published in the New England Journal of Medicine,

576
00:59:30,803 --> 00:59:39,983
and you get to hear about the story and about the data was particularly powerful as a narrative for what data can do in making a social commentary,

577
00:59:39,983 --> 00:59:44,783
but also really influencing policy. So let us welcome Professor Tom Vallely.

578
00:59:48,993 --> 01:00:00,273
Thank you so much. You know, I'm excited to be here because I think it's a really nice opportunity to meld together clinical work,

579
01:00:00,273 --> 01:00:03,813
taking care of patients in the hospital and in your expertise.

580
01:00:04,743 --> 01:00:09,783
I think that really highlights the power of what happened during COVID.

581
01:00:10,953 --> 01:00:12,843
You know, early in COVID,

582
01:00:12,843 --> 01:00:22,143
we had a lot going on taking care of patients and very quickly we realized we needed to take advantage of all the expertise we had here at Michigan.

583
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:25,423
And so we had those calls where, you know,

584
01:00:25,473 --> 01:00:34,202
we were fortunate to be able to work with experts who could help us change the way that we took care of patients very quickly,

585
01:00:34,203 --> 01:00:39,513
things that, you know, before COVID would take years, you know, to get everybody into a room,

586
01:00:39,513 --> 01:00:42,542
to be able to talk about things, to talk about how should we do this?

587
01:00:42,543 --> 01:00:48,393
How should we do that? All of a sudden, all those barriers were taken away and we could make these changes very quickly.

588
01:00:49,793 --> 01:00:56,423
What I'm going to talk about today is another example of of how COVID changed the way we think about how we take care of patients.

589
01:00:57,383 --> 01:01:04,323
And that's specific to a specific way that we monitor patients oxygen levels in the ICU.

590
01:01:04,343 --> 01:01:08,783
So I'm a doctor in the intensive care unit, also a researcher.

591
01:01:09,803 --> 01:01:17,483
When we're taking care of patients in the intensive care unit, you know, these are patients who are incredibly sick, very close to dying.

592
01:01:17,993 --> 01:01:25,103
And so we have all these different tools that we're using that are monitoring these patients second to second, minute to minute.

593
01:01:25,613 --> 01:01:29,543
And one of the most important of these tools is a pulse oximeter.

594
01:01:30,413 --> 01:01:32,843
Many of you in this room may have used a pulse oximeter at some time.

595
01:01:32,843 --> 01:01:38,333
Many of you in this room might have an Apple Watch that's monitoring your oxygen levels right now.

596
01:01:39,683 --> 01:01:45,773
As a as a doctor. We use pulse oximeters all the time, every day, multiple times a day.

597
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:53,813
Many people have called Pulse oximeters the most important invention of medical device, invention of the 21st century.

598
01:01:54,893 --> 01:02:02,122
They're incredibly useful. We use them all the time. And yet when they since they were developed in the 1970s,

599
01:02:02,123 --> 01:02:08,873
we never really critically evaluated whether they might work differently for certain groups of people compared to others.

600
01:02:09,293 --> 01:02:14,483
Despite, in retrospect, pretty obvious things that should have made us ask some questions.

601
01:02:15,743 --> 01:02:18,803
So I want to start by maybe painting.

602
01:02:18,863 --> 01:02:24,683
You know, Brimah did a really nice job of painting, kind of the chaos of what was going on during early COVID.

603
01:02:25,613 --> 01:02:30,743
You know, many of you may have been here in Michigan during that time. Many of you may have been in other places during that time.

604
01:02:31,193 --> 01:02:36,203
But here in Michigan, we were some of the earliest groups to really get hit hard by COVID.

605
01:02:36,803 --> 01:02:42,532
And it was a really chaotic, frightening time period where we had no idea what was really going on.

606
01:02:42,533 --> 01:02:46,883
We were scared. We were scared to be infected. We were scared for the people.

607
01:02:46,883 --> 01:02:50,483
We were taking care of people. We were incredibly sick. You know,

608
01:02:50,483 --> 01:03:00,653
we were talking about converting these dorms right next to us into field hospitals because our hospitals were being overrun with patients with COVID.

609
01:03:01,923 --> 01:03:04,832
A baseline before COVID even.

610
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:14,053
Right now, we have about 20 ICU beds that we use for for critically ill patients with things like COVID pneumonia and things like that.

611
01:03:14,073 --> 01:03:27,013
We have 20 ICU beds. Very quickly, we realize that those 20 ICU beds were insufficient in April of 2020 when we were having those meetings.

612
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:36,463
We had made 80 makeshift ICU rooms in the pediatric hospital right across the street,

613
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:41,652
and we were double boarding each of those rooms, which is something we don't do baseline.

614
01:03:41,653 --> 01:03:52,243
So we had 160 brand new ICU beds for patients with COVID, and we were converting beds all throughout the hospital to be ICU beds.

615
01:03:52,243 --> 01:03:59,923
So, you know, we had about probably about 400 or 500 ICU patients with COVID during that time.

616
01:04:00,523 --> 01:04:08,952
And at baseline, both before and after COVID, we had about 80 critically ill patients, ICU patients that we took care of in the hospital.

617
01:04:08,953 --> 01:04:15,093
So we had, what, five fold that number of patients very quickly in a matter of weeks.

618
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:24,393
It was incredibly chaotic. And one of the most disturbing one of the most traumatic parts of that experience was

619
01:04:24,633 --> 01:04:29,223
the types of patients we were taking care of at baseline at the University of Michigan.

620
01:04:29,853 --> 01:04:35,733
We take care of probably about 80% white patients, probably about 10 to 50% black patients.

621
01:04:36,243 --> 01:04:40,383
That's just kind of the demographics of Ann Arbor and the population that we take care.

622
01:04:42,183 --> 01:04:48,243
Immediately during COVID those demographics flipped where we were taking care of probably about.

623
01:04:49,403 --> 01:05:00,653
80% black patients, probably about 10% Hispanic or brown patients and very few white patients.

624
01:05:01,343 --> 01:05:05,453
And this was at the snap your fingers how this flipped.

625
01:05:06,023 --> 01:05:09,773
And so all of a sudden, one day we were taking care of about 80% white patients.

626
01:05:10,103 --> 01:05:13,433
The next day, we were taking care of 80% black patients.

627
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:18,962
And very and this has been well documented. Well documented since.

628
01:05:18,963 --> 01:05:22,863
But the mortality, particularly early in COVID was dramatic.

629
01:05:24,143 --> 01:05:29,893
Most of the time when patients come to the ICU and they need to be on a breathing machine, mortality is quite high.

630
01:05:29,903 --> 01:05:34,793
But what we're talking about is probably about one in five patients dying about 20% mortality.

631
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:39,313
Early in COVID, we were talking probably 50%.

632
01:05:39,733 --> 01:05:48,013
50% might have been good early in COVID upwards to maybe 60, 70% mortality if you were on a ventilator early in COVID.

633
01:05:48,493 --> 01:05:56,683
And as we talked about, that's predominantly a black patient population dying at dramatically high rates early in COVID.

634
01:05:57,283 --> 01:06:02,323
And we didn't really recognize why that was happening. Was it something about COVID?

635
01:06:02,323 --> 01:06:07,573
Was it something about how, you know, we didn't really understand what was going on?

636
01:06:08,323 --> 01:06:13,362
And in retrospect, one of the things that might have been contributing to this was the fact that Pulse

637
01:06:13,363 --> 01:06:17,773
Oximeters weren't working as well for black patients as they were for white patients.

638
01:06:19,093 --> 01:06:24,603
So today what we'll talk about for, you know, probably the next 20 minutes or so,

639
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:31,273
I think what we'll envision is like 30 minutes of me talking and then 30 minutes of any questions that I can answer for the group.

640
01:06:31,873 --> 01:06:36,613
We'll talk briefly about a pulse oximeter, how it was developed, how it works.

641
01:06:37,363 --> 01:06:42,883
Then we'll talk about the work that we were fortunate to put forth in in late 2020.

642
01:06:43,183 --> 01:06:52,452
That helped to, I think, convince the world that racial bias does exist in Pulse Oximeters And then we'll talk about some unanswered questions.

643
01:06:52,453 --> 01:07:02,663
And I'm hoping that you might be able to help help us work on. So knowing what someone's oxygen levels are in their blood is incredibly important.

644
01:07:03,143 --> 01:07:09,653
Auction is key to how we live in our our vital organs throughout our body require oxygen.

645
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:18,173
And yet, for a very long time, we weren't able to actually measure how much action was in someone's blood.

646
01:07:19,313 --> 01:07:28,403
It wasn't until the 1860s that we actually recognized how important oxygen was in the body and that we could actually measure that.

647
01:07:28,883 --> 01:07:33,743
And then in the 1930s, we started to develop technologies to actually measure that.

648
01:07:34,073 --> 01:07:37,763
But it was really tough to put into place because there were difficulties in calibrating it.

649
01:07:38,483 --> 01:07:49,463
But in the 1970s, some Japanese engineers were able to develop a way to to non-invasively measure someone's oxygen levels.

650
01:07:49,973 --> 01:07:54,113
And here's a picture of one of those early devices that strapped on to one someone's ear.

651
01:07:54,713 --> 01:08:05,633
And what it did was try to take advantage of the fact that as our heart beats, we have both oxygenated and deoxygenated blood that goes into the body.

652
01:08:06,653 --> 01:08:14,123
And so modern pulse oximeters. What you might be more used to seeing are the things that clip onto your finger.

653
01:08:14,813 --> 01:08:21,923
So what we do is we clip this device onto your finger, and what it's doing is sending a light through your finger.

654
01:08:22,843 --> 01:08:29,383
And what we know is that oxygenated blood in deoxygenated blood absorb light differently.

655
01:08:29,863 --> 01:08:34,663
And so on one end, we have a device that sending light through your finger.

656
01:08:34,873 --> 01:08:42,283
And on the other end, we have a device that's detecting what type of light is coming through your finger.

657
01:08:42,913 --> 01:08:53,173
So basically, this pulse oximeter is measuring what what type of light is transmitted through one's finger and then through a bunch of formulas,

658
01:08:53,173 --> 01:08:58,603
through how it's how the device are calibrated. It detects how much of this blood is oxygenated.

659
01:09:01,073 --> 01:09:07,313
And that's because, as I mentioned, deoxygenated blood and oxygenated blood absorb different spectra of light.

660
01:09:10,863 --> 01:09:23,883
And it takes advantage of the pulse or arterial and and venous blood to do this because it it detects kind of differences in blood volume to say,

661
01:09:23,883 --> 01:09:28,593
okay, this much of this spectrum of light was absorbed.

662
01:09:28,863 --> 01:09:34,443
This much of this spectrum of light was absorbed. This is what comes through and through its calibration formulas.

663
01:09:34,683 --> 01:09:37,563
This is how much of the blood is oxygenated.

664
01:09:37,983 --> 01:09:46,923
And so you would think, looking at this figure, that things that are static, like, you know, whether you have nail polish,

665
01:09:47,133 --> 01:09:55,173
how big your finger is, how thick your fingernail is, the color of one's skin should be taken into account here because it's static.

666
01:09:56,193 --> 01:10:00,333
But I think in retrospect, we recognize that that that's not the case,

667
01:10:00,633 --> 01:10:09,723
that those formulas that were created kind of proprietary to to calibrate how much oxygen is in one's blood.

668
01:10:10,143 --> 01:10:15,183
Well, it matters who those formulas were calibrated, developed on and calibrated for.

669
01:10:15,693 --> 01:10:26,463
And so if those individuals who who were used to develop and calibrate those formulas were of a sort of kind of homogenous skin tone,

670
01:10:26,883 --> 01:10:33,213
then it doesn't take into account all the different variables that could be in this kind of static area.

671
01:10:36,753 --> 01:10:41,643
So what we noticed early in COVID was it something was weird.

672
01:10:44,833 --> 01:10:48,223
What's key to remember is we use pulse oximeters all the time.

673
01:10:48,463 --> 01:10:52,692
Right? Whether you go to see your doctor in clinic, whether you go to the emergency room,

674
01:10:52,693 --> 01:10:58,243
whether you're in the ICU when you're in the ICU, we continuously measure someone's oxygen levels by a pulse oximeter.

675
01:10:59,503 --> 01:11:04,063
But that's not the gold standard for how we measure someone's auction.

676
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:09,552
Right. That's kind of our noninvasive way of detecting what your auction level is because it's so easy.

677
01:11:09,553 --> 01:11:14,533
Right. Clip it on your finger very quickly. We know we know what someone's auction levels are.

678
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:18,463
But the gold standard is to check your arterial blood.

679
01:11:19,063 --> 01:11:24,043
That's actually how much auction is in your blood is your arterial blood.

680
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:29,323
But it's not easy to do. It's not like when you go to the lab and you get some blood drawn from your arm.

681
01:11:29,323 --> 01:11:32,863
This is blood that you specifically have to get out of your artery.

682
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:36,463
Most of the time when you go to the lab, it's your venous blood that's being drawn.

683
01:11:36,913 --> 01:11:44,893
So here to get the gold standard, you have to get your arterial blood, which is a little bit more technically difficult, it's a bit more painful.

684
01:11:45,223 --> 01:11:53,713
And so we don't do that all the time. And so when you're in the ICU, usually we are intentional about the times that we.

685
01:11:55,133 --> 01:12:00,683
Draw someone's arterial blood, check someone's gold standard, and maybe that might be once a day.

686
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:04,793
Maybe that might be never during your ICU stay. But it's not all the time.

687
01:12:05,243 --> 01:12:13,103
But what was unique about COVID was, remember, we were all scared about getting COVID ourselves, as have health care clinicians.

688
01:12:13,523 --> 01:12:20,213
And so we tried to limit the amount of time that health care clinician nurses or therapist physicians spent in the room.

689
01:12:20,683 --> 01:12:24,053
What that meant was anybody who came to the ICU with COVID,

690
01:12:24,353 --> 01:12:30,503
we actually put a special device into their artery so that we could very quickly collect their arterial blood.

691
01:12:30,953 --> 01:12:37,373
Normally, we stick someone with a needle and have to kind of we might not get it on the first try and we have to kind of stick them a couple of times.

692
01:12:37,373 --> 01:12:40,703
And then finally we get some arterial blood and we're happy. We get the sample, we send it off.

693
01:12:41,153 --> 01:12:43,613
But for everybody with COVID, during this early period,

694
01:12:43,973 --> 01:12:49,282
we would put this special catheter in into their artery so that we could draw that blood very quickly so

695
01:12:49,283 --> 01:12:53,663
that people didn't have to spend a lot of time poking and prodding and trying to get that arterial blood.

696
01:12:54,173 --> 01:12:59,303
And so everybody who came into the ICU with COVID during that early COVID period got this special catheter.

697
01:12:59,783 --> 01:13:08,453
And so everybody was getting our arterial blood draws and we were having continuous pulse oximeter values, as we always did.

698
01:13:08,463 --> 01:13:14,273
But what was unique during that early COVID time was that we were also getting frequent arterial blood gas drops,

699
01:13:14,993 --> 01:13:17,573
and during that time we were seeing something really weird.

700
01:13:18,053 --> 01:13:26,093
We were seeing this mismatch between what the oxygen level was in arterial blood and what the oxygen level was on your pulse oximeter.

701
01:13:26,093 --> 01:13:32,683
The noninvasive way of measuring it. And during that early COVID period, you know, we talked about how chaotic everything was.

702
01:13:33,103 --> 01:13:35,503
We didn't we didn't understand why that was the case.

703
01:13:35,773 --> 01:13:42,793
And in fact, during that early spring, you know, April, May, we had a lot of conversations about what was going on.

704
01:13:43,213 --> 01:13:48,073
And we thought maybe it was just a COVID thing. You know, like, maybe there's something about COVID that's, like, weird.

705
01:13:48,073 --> 01:13:51,223
It's causing something about the body to have this mismatch.

706
01:13:52,093 --> 01:13:55,273
And, and we didn't recognize what was going on.

707
01:13:55,273 --> 01:13:58,572
And so we actually talked to folks around the country about what we were seeing.

708
01:13:58,573 --> 01:14:04,812
And they were like, Yeah, that's really weird. Maybe it's something about COVID, but we didn't really read anything else about it.

709
01:14:04,813 --> 01:14:06,493
We didn't really know how to follow it up,

710
01:14:07,003 --> 01:14:17,472
and we kind of put it on the back burner until until one of us read this paper by a medical anthropologist from MIT, Professor Amy Moran.

711
01:14:17,473 --> 01:14:25,093
Thomas And and this was actually in the fall of 2020 that she published this paper in the Boston Review.

712
01:14:25,633 --> 01:14:34,333
And and she talked about her experiences, her personal experiences when her family contracted COVID.

713
01:14:34,993 --> 01:14:38,653
She is a white woman and her husband as a black man.

714
01:14:39,193 --> 01:14:44,563
And they bought a pulse oximeter, like a lot of people who got COVID during that time were recommended to do,

715
01:14:45,193 --> 01:14:52,563
and they bought a pulse oximeter and they were counseled, Hey, if your pulse oximeter reads low, you should call your docs and and let them know.

716
01:14:52,573 --> 01:14:53,983
And you might need to come in to the hospital.

717
01:14:54,553 --> 01:15:02,443
And they were getting very different numbers between her values as a white woman and her husband's values as a black man,

718
01:15:03,133 --> 01:15:07,963
and it made her as a medical anthropologist. Question What was this device doing?

719
01:15:08,533 --> 01:15:12,643
What was it? What was it detecting? What was it measuring?

720
01:15:12,793 --> 01:15:19,333
And could there be differences based on the color of one skin? And it led her down this rabbit hole of historical data.

721
01:15:20,113 --> 01:15:29,743
Going back to how the pulse oximeter was developed in the 1970s, identifying some very small studies from the 1990 and early 2000, from Lac Frappe,

722
01:15:29,743 --> 01:15:32,863
from laboratories that actually documented that, Hey,

723
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:39,042
Pulse Oximeters don't work as well for black patients as they do for white patients, but they'd kind of been buried.

724
01:15:39,043 --> 01:15:42,373
They were very small studies and no one really recognized it.

725
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:50,253
And we read this paper and we had this kind of aha moment like, hey, what we saw early in COVID,

726
01:15:50,253 --> 01:15:55,263
maybe it wasn't a COVID thing, maybe it was a color of one skin thing.

727
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,872
And then it kind of very quickly clicked, right?

728
01:15:57,873 --> 01:16:04,233
We were used to seeing, you know, 80% white patients and all of a sudden we were taking care of 80% black patients.

729
01:16:04,233 --> 01:16:11,253
And it wasn't COVID. It was the fact that all of our patients at that time were black and and we were seeing

730
01:16:11,253 --> 01:16:17,073
a mismatch between the gold standard arterial oxygen and your pulse oximeter values,

731
01:16:17,463 --> 01:16:20,853
because we were all of a sudden taking care of so many black patients.

732
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:26,643
And that led us to recognize that, hey, this could be a huge problem.

733
01:16:26,943 --> 01:16:33,993
And it also helped us to recognize that we have the data available to us here at the University of Michigan to very quickly look at this.

734
01:16:35,013 --> 01:16:41,043
And then we also recognize that like there would be a lot of questions if we just released this as a single center study

735
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:47,673
because people would ask questions about how they perhaps would question whether it's just a one pulse oximeter problem.

736
01:16:48,633 --> 01:16:54,213
And so we very quickly recognized the importance of having multicenter data to answer this question.

737
01:16:55,663 --> 01:16:59,263
So what we did was we used data from the University of Michigan,

738
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:07,903
which we had at our fingertips very quickly to to look to look quickly at whether this problem actually exists or not.

739
01:17:09,263 --> 01:17:17,963
So we use data that we have available to us at the University of Michigan among about 1300 white patients and more than 200 black patients.

740
01:17:18,803 --> 01:17:23,573
And we found that, yeah, we did see this problem in our University of Michigan data.

741
01:17:24,533 --> 01:17:31,103
And so then we wanted to look at a larger cohort of patients and we use this public publicly available

742
01:17:31,103 --> 01:17:38,693
data set for mimic a multicenter cohort of about 178 hospitals from around the country of ICU patients,

743
01:17:39,263 --> 01:17:44,063
where it had about 7000 white patients and more to more than 1000 black patients.

744
01:17:45,323 --> 01:17:50,632
And we wanted to look at all individuals who received oxygen, who had a pulse oximeter,

745
01:17:50,633 --> 01:17:56,393
value and in arterial blood gas or arterial blood draw within 10 minutes of each other.

746
01:17:57,593 --> 01:18:06,563
And we adjust our analysis for age, for patients sex and for basically cardiovascular organ failure.

747
01:18:08,563 --> 01:18:12,163
And we created this variable called a cult hypoxemia.

748
01:18:12,523 --> 01:18:14,893
And this is a unique variable that we created.

749
01:18:15,883 --> 01:18:26,823
You know, prior studies had basically looked at comparing one's oxygen levels for of essentially looking at kind of statistical values of bias.

750
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:33,183
Right. How close was someone's arterial blood from their noninvasive pulse oximeter value?

751
01:18:33,703 --> 01:18:38,353
But that's not particularly important to a clinician. Yeah, to some extent it is important, right?

752
01:18:38,353 --> 01:18:46,182
If someone's pulse oximetry value is 95% in your heart, on average, arterial value is 94%.

753
01:18:46,183 --> 01:18:53,023
Yeah, that's important. But I think to a clinician, what we really want to know is how will this change our clinical practice?

754
01:18:53,533 --> 01:18:59,983
And so we created this variable that basically said, what if someone's pulse oximeter value is in a normal range,

755
01:19:00,313 --> 01:19:05,893
but your arterial oxygen level within a range where we would typically be making a clinical change.

756
01:19:06,523 --> 01:19:15,792
So what we wanted to know was if your pulse oximeter value was 92 to 96% and we chose this range because it's

757
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:20,803
a normal range and it's also a range where we typically wouldn't make any changes to someone's oxygen level.

758
01:19:21,463 --> 01:19:24,643
If your oxygen levels on the pulse oximeter are above 96%,

759
01:19:24,913 --> 01:19:32,532
you could conceivably envision a situation where a clinician might go to the bedside and drop someone's oxygen level auction that we were providing.

760
01:19:32,533 --> 01:19:38,803
Right. If it's so high and you're on for leader for liters of oxygen, we might drop you down to two.

761
01:19:39,253 --> 01:19:42,972
Or if it's really high, it's 100% and you're on two liters of oxygen.

762
01:19:42,973 --> 01:19:48,733
Maybe we take you off oxygen altogether. But generally, if you're at 92 to 96%, we wouldn't make any change.

763
01:19:48,733 --> 01:19:54,343
We kind of leave you where you are or if it were less than 92%, maybe we bump up your oxygen levels.

764
01:19:54,343 --> 01:19:59,203
Right? So we wanted to pick a value that wouldn't have a lot of change,

765
01:19:59,623 --> 01:20:08,143
mainly because we were using retrospective data and we weren't having kind of exactly paired arterial and pulse oximeter values.

766
01:20:08,143 --> 01:20:16,513
And so we wanted to kind of take out differences that might exist if someone was changing oxygen levels throughout time.

767
01:20:17,383 --> 01:20:22,363
But then we also wanted to know, well, if you have a normal pulse oximeter, oxygen level.

768
01:20:23,363 --> 01:20:30,833
How often do you have a low arterial oxygen level and arterial oxygen level that typically a clinician would be making a change,

769
01:20:31,073 --> 01:20:34,462
either starting someone in oxygen or increasing their action abilities?

770
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:41,843
Right. That to us as clinicians is most valuable. How many times if we miss a situation where someone had a dangerously low oxygen

771
01:20:41,843 --> 01:20:47,003
level simply because a pulse oximeter was providing us an inaccurate value?

772
01:20:50,003 --> 01:20:54,113
And this is the main figure of our study. We'll walk you through it.

773
01:20:56,103 --> 01:21:02,012
In this in this box and whisker plot. Red represents black patients.

774
01:21:02,013 --> 01:21:14,373
Blue represents white patients. And and we can see arterial oxygen values on the y axis and pulse oximeter values on the x axis.

775
01:21:14,673 --> 01:21:21,093
I'll go into a bit more detail on this in another slide coming up, but we can see that on average.

776
01:21:24,173 --> 01:21:29,183
What white patients tended to have higher levels on average.

777
01:21:29,543 --> 01:21:37,253
Pulse oximeter of oxygen levels and that on average black patients,

778
01:21:37,703 --> 01:21:43,313
their true oxygen levels tend to be about 2% lower on average compared to white patients.

779
01:21:46,273 --> 01:21:56,353
So what are the takeaways from that figure? The first is that one in six black patients had what we call the cold hypoxemia.

780
01:21:57,933 --> 01:22:04,173
Inaccurate oxygen levels by pulse oximeters that missed dangerously low oxygen levels.

781
01:22:04,383 --> 01:22:13,173
So about 16% of black patients had seemingly normal values on their pulse oximeters but actually

782
01:22:13,173 --> 01:22:18,033
in their blood had low oxygen levels that should have resulted in change in the amount,

783
01:22:18,043 --> 01:22:20,493
changes in the amount of action that we were providing to them.

784
01:22:24,023 --> 01:22:30,142
Three black patients are three times more likely than white patients to have dangerously

785
01:22:30,143 --> 01:22:34,853
low oxygen levels in their arterial blood compared to what was being seen on their pulse.

786
01:22:34,853 --> 01:22:37,553
Oximeters. So black patients were much.

787
01:22:38,573 --> 01:22:47,153
One in six black patients had missed low oxygen levels, and black patients were three times more likely than white patients to have this problem.

788
01:22:48,953 --> 01:22:57,363
And then going back to this figure, I think one of the key questions is, well, how much of this is a problem clinically?

789
01:22:57,393 --> 01:23:04,813
Well, what we can see is that typically we make changes when someone's oxygen level is below 88%.

790
01:23:04,823 --> 01:23:10,373
That's kind of a hard and fast rule. But we might start to make changes when someone's oxygen level is around 92%.

791
01:23:11,093 --> 01:23:19,853
But what we can see, this dotted line, distorted horizontal line represents 88% on someone's true blood values, arterial blood values.

792
01:23:20,183 --> 01:23:26,693
So in that shaded gray area, our situations where someone has a dangerously low oxygen level by their arterial value,

793
01:23:27,293 --> 01:23:41,813
we can see that when black patients pulse oximeter is at 90, at 92%, when someone's pulse oximeter, a black patient's pulse oximeter, values at 92%.

794
01:23:42,233 --> 01:23:46,823
About a third of their true arterial blood values are dangerously low.

795
01:23:47,453 --> 01:23:55,223
When you get to 91%, more than half of black patients actually have low arterial blood values.

796
01:23:55,553 --> 01:24:02,363
Right. So this is this is a big deal. Right. We're missing a lot of these patients who have otherwise borderline values.

797
01:24:02,513 --> 01:24:06,623
In actuality, their blood value values are dangerously low.

798
01:24:11,103 --> 01:24:13,173
Since we published this paper in 2020,

799
01:24:13,413 --> 01:24:22,323
we've had a number of studies come out that have shown essentially the exact same thing that we showed in a bunch of different patient populations,

800
01:24:22,593 --> 01:24:30,752
whether it was super sick patients who needed to be on this thing called M0 or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,

801
01:24:30,753 --> 01:24:34,742
basically where this is beyond even being on a breathing machine where they have to have

802
01:24:34,743 --> 01:24:39,003
their blood essentially go through an auction filter because their oxygen levels are so low.

803
01:24:39,243 --> 01:24:47,343
We saw the same problem. We've seen the same problem in a cohort of patients from the University of Pennsylvania and Kaiser Health Systems,

804
01:24:47,613 --> 01:24:56,463
from the United Kingdom, from a bunch of different places around the country, from the veterans, from from the VA.

805
01:24:56,823 --> 01:25:03,452
So that have basically shown the exact same thing. But then we've also had a number of study studies that I never actually thought we

806
01:25:03,453 --> 01:25:08,673
would get to that have actually shown patient harm that has resulted from this problem.

807
01:25:09,723 --> 01:25:18,693
On the top there. We have a study that showed that patients who experienced a cold hypoxemia

808
01:25:18,993 --> 01:25:26,583
who had inaccurate pulse oximeter values were less likely to receive oxygen.

809
01:25:26,823 --> 01:25:31,863
They received lower levels of supplemental oxygen. They had delayed treatments for COVID.

810
01:25:32,283 --> 01:25:36,693
Many of the treatments that we provided for COVID were linked to someone's oxygen levels.

811
01:25:37,083 --> 01:25:44,583
So you can envision if your pulse oximeter was wrong and it was showing higher values than your actual blood values, well,

812
01:25:45,213 --> 01:25:48,933
you're going to have a delay in when you actually get these life saving treatments for

813
01:25:48,933 --> 01:25:52,863
COVID because these pulse oximeters are showing a higher value than they should be.

814
01:25:53,643 --> 01:25:59,222
So that study showed we were providing less action that we should have been providing to black patients,

815
01:25:59,223 --> 01:26:08,133
and black patients received their lifesaving COVID treatments later than they should have because Pulse Oximeters didn't work well for them.

816
01:26:09,643 --> 01:26:16,093
That study over there showed that black patients had a higher rate of death when they had they

817
01:26:16,093 --> 01:26:20,563
experienced a cold hypoxemia when these pulse oximeters didn't work for a while for them.

818
01:26:20,953 --> 01:26:26,803
And this study showed that black patients were more likely to have failing organs as a result of pulse oximeters.

819
01:26:26,803 --> 01:26:32,993
That didn't work well for them. And it's not surprising, right?

820
01:26:33,023 --> 01:26:38,752
Think of all the different places that we use. Pulse Oximeters right home.

821
01:26:38,753 --> 01:26:44,903
Pulse Oximeters which is a whole separate situation that these devices aren't even regulated by the FDA

822
01:26:45,263 --> 01:26:52,043
because they're not considered they're considered recreational devices and not considered medical devices.

823
01:26:52,403 --> 01:26:57,593
So they're not they're probably the worst of the worst. And yet think of how often we use them.

824
01:26:58,073 --> 01:27:04,433
And even more frighteningly, early in COVID, we were telling we were actively telling people to go out and buy home pulse

825
01:27:04,433 --> 01:27:09,082
oximeters and we were screening patients to come into the hospital and telling them,

826
01:27:09,083 --> 01:27:13,673
Don't come in because we're so busy until your pulse oximeter levels were low.

827
01:27:14,393 --> 01:27:20,503
Geez. I mean, how many patients do we potentially harm because of that? Think about emergency medical services, right?

828
01:27:21,283 --> 01:27:25,753
Ambulances to go out and check someone's pulse oximeter values and say, oh, hey, no worries.

829
01:27:25,963 --> 01:27:30,073
Your pulse ox is normal. You can stay at home even if you might feel short of breath.

830
01:27:31,133 --> 01:27:34,192
If you go in and see a doctor in clinic, right. They check your pulse ox.

831
01:27:34,193 --> 01:27:37,493
You might say you feel short of breath, but it's normal. They say, don't worry about it.

832
01:27:37,703 --> 01:27:45,473
All the other places in the hospital where we're making critical decisions, whether you get admitted into the hospital or get sent home,

833
01:27:45,773 --> 01:27:52,103
whether you get or whether you stay on a regular bat or go to an ICU, whether you get discharged from the hospital,

834
01:27:52,703 --> 01:27:58,373
whether you actually get oxygen or not, whether you get diagnosed with things like obstructive sleep apnea,

835
01:27:58,583 --> 01:28:05,183
whether you get a lung transplant, all these decisions are linked to someone's pulse oximeter value.

836
01:28:08,593 --> 01:28:14,253
And so. Here are some questions that remain unanswered.

837
01:28:15,453 --> 01:28:20,273
And and and so. I think.

838
01:28:22,873 --> 01:28:29,553
Why don't we go through each of these? So I think the first question is, do you see the same things we saw, right?

839
01:28:30,523 --> 01:28:34,542
The data set that we have available to you guys is the same dataset we used.

840
01:28:34,543 --> 01:28:42,103
It's the mimic dataset of 178 hospitals. And I think the first key question is, do you see the same differences?

841
01:28:43,903 --> 01:28:54,463
I think a there have been a whenever I've talked about this to clinicians, what a clinician really wants to know is like, what the heck do I do now?

842
01:28:54,563 --> 01:29:02,323
Right? Like we use Pulse Oximeters all the time and until we develop a pulse oximeter that actually works well regardless of the color of one skin.

843
01:29:02,533 --> 01:29:07,333
People want to know, Well, what do I do now? And unfortunately, I don't have an answer for that.

844
01:29:07,723 --> 01:29:13,803
Perhaps one potential way to answer that is to create some sort of threshold, right?

845
01:29:13,813 --> 01:29:21,493
Like I showed you that figure that showed, you know, where a third of black patients,

846
01:29:21,493 --> 01:29:26,833
when their oxygen level values said 91% by pulse oximeter, they actually had dangerously low levels.

847
01:29:27,823 --> 01:29:33,883
Well, you know, maybe we use a threshold of 92%, 93%, something like that.

848
01:29:34,063 --> 01:29:42,703
We don't know what the right threshold is for black patients or for white patients, and I think that would be incredibly valuable for clinicians.

849
01:29:43,213 --> 01:29:52,513
Although there has been some question about the linearity of that threshold that perhaps when someone's oxygen levels are on the lower end,

850
01:29:53,113 --> 01:29:57,093
there might be greater discrepancy than when someone's oxygen levels are on the higher end.

851
01:29:57,103 --> 01:30:04,723
And so there are some statistical nuances that might be required there that have prevented us from just putting out a blanket.

852
01:30:05,053 --> 01:30:12,423
Hey, if a black patient has a pulse oximeter value of 93%, we should be treating that as if it were 88% in the olden days.

853
01:30:12,433 --> 01:30:16,333
So that would be an incredibly valuable piece of information.

854
01:30:17,603 --> 01:30:27,172
One of the drawbacks to our study is that it is it is a retrospective analysis of observational data,

855
01:30:27,173 --> 01:30:29,753
data that was routinely collected for other purposes.

856
01:30:30,263 --> 01:30:35,722
And as a result, when we've had conversation with pulse oximeter companies, their first go to line is, hey,

857
01:30:35,723 --> 01:30:43,223
like that's not how we do things when we test our pulse oximeters we do instantaneous measurements between an arterial,

858
01:30:43,253 --> 01:30:51,803
your arterial blood and your pulse oximeter. And since your measurements used a time lag of up to 10 minutes, it's essentially worthless to us.

859
01:30:52,633 --> 01:30:56,593
Even though on average the time between our values is about 4 minutes.

860
01:30:56,953 --> 01:31:05,323
And we've had many, many studies that have come out that have shown the exact same things, pulse oximeter, companies have been quick to dismiss it.

861
01:31:06,283 --> 01:31:12,763
And so perhaps one contribution could be to evaluate how the time lag between

862
01:31:12,943 --> 01:31:17,443
arterial and pulse oximetry measurements might affect potential inaccuracies.

863
01:31:19,003 --> 01:31:25,223
And then a really important question is, you know. We have been unable to.

864
01:31:26,463 --> 01:31:34,383
We we use the term race in our papers, even though the hypothesized mechanism is the color of one's skin, your skin tone.

865
01:31:34,683 --> 01:31:40,863
And we have consistently used the term race because our data don't provide a skin tone.

866
01:31:41,403 --> 01:31:43,593
They only provide us self-identified race.

867
01:31:44,223 --> 01:31:53,853
And and as such, we've looked primarily a black and white patients because those those were the patient populations where we had the most numbers.

868
01:31:54,243 --> 01:32:02,163
But it would be useful to know whether these inaccuracies might exist for other patient populations besides black patients.

869
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:12,032
The UK data that I mentioned was able to look at ethnicities and showed similar findings to ours, but they're outside of the UK data.

870
01:32:12,033 --> 01:32:19,503
There haven't been any other studies that have looked at non-black patient populations in this situation.

871
01:32:21,913 --> 01:32:30,293
So I just wanted to briefly talk about the data that we have available available to you and kind of the data structure and the variables available.

872
01:32:31,493 --> 01:32:36,743
The data are at the patient level.

873
01:32:37,183 --> 01:32:40,273
At the patient level. And.

874
01:32:42,383 --> 01:32:51,862
And per patient, there are multiple measurements. Because as I discussed, when you're in the ICU, you're getting continuous pulse oximeter,

875
01:32:51,863 --> 01:32:57,323
values, and many times you get multiple arterial blood measurements.

876
01:32:57,803 --> 01:33:01,793
And so at a patient level, we have multiple measurements per patient.

877
01:33:02,813 --> 01:33:10,073
Those measurements are such that there is a time between a pulse oximeter value in our arterial blood

878
01:33:10,073 --> 01:33:15,923
value and we've generally restricted that to 10 minutes between those two to be counted as a pair.

879
01:33:17,243 --> 01:33:28,853
We also have characteristics about these patients, such as their age, their biologic sex, their race, ethnicity, variables that.

880
01:33:31,233 --> 01:33:35,973
Some might argue might be related to two someone's pulse oximeter value.

881
01:33:43,753 --> 01:33:47,023
So. Those? Yes.

882
01:33:47,193 --> 01:33:50,323
Just 10 minutes. Oh, yeah.

883
01:33:51,233 --> 01:34:02,233
Okay. Yeah, well, that's perfect because. Because I am all done. So I'd love to hear any questions that you guys have about.

884
01:34:03,103 --> 01:34:07,123
About this problem. About the data. Whatever I can help with.

885
01:34:09,333 --> 01:34:13,583
Yes. Yes.

886
01:34:16,973 --> 01:34:27,123
7007. Let me double check.

887
01:34:29,283 --> 01:34:32,373
Yeah, we know we have restricted to.

888
01:34:34,193 --> 01:34:37,493
Values that are within 10 minutes.

889
01:34:40,393 --> 01:34:44,623
I think it would be useful just to go through those numbers are.

890
01:34:45,133 --> 01:34:49,483
Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, let me just.

891
01:34:50,723 --> 01:34:57,073
And he's out. That better?

892
01:34:58,163 --> 01:35:06,473
Okay. So we have a unique patient I.D. We have their hospitalization ID, the hospital.

893
01:35:06,513 --> 01:35:14,033
They were at their age, their biologic sex, their race, ethnicity, their pulse oximeter value,

894
01:35:14,603 --> 01:35:22,343
their arterial blood value, the time of their arterial blood draw and the time of the pulse oximeter value.

895
01:35:22,913 --> 01:35:34,183
Yes. Is the difference in value between them.

896
01:35:34,933 --> 01:35:39,343
I think this is basically that probably starts at their hospitalization.

897
01:35:39,673 --> 01:35:44,862
You know what I mean? So like this pulse oximeter value comes from 21 minutes after they were the hospitalization

898
01:35:44,863 --> 01:35:49,453
starts and this arterial blood value comes from 24 minutes after the hospitalization starts.

899
01:35:50,023 --> 01:35:55,393
So the the numbers themselves, the absolute values are not important here.

900
01:35:56,993 --> 01:36:01,643
Yes. Yeah.

901
01:36:01,763 --> 01:36:06,633
I'll repeat it to. We did not.

902
01:36:06,643 --> 01:36:13,513
So the question is about how did we handle other unknown patients?

903
01:36:13,813 --> 01:36:18,583
We did not include those patients in our analysis. Yes.

904
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:27,283
It's not the question of the time. So your underlying hypothesis is, is it also plausible that differences in.

905
01:36:28,883 --> 01:36:34,573
Play a role in sickle cell patients for. Sickle cell mutations are.

906
01:36:35,703 --> 01:36:45,713
Yeah. So the question is our hypothesis is skin tone, but could other problems like sickle cell clotting problems contribute here?

907
01:36:45,723 --> 01:36:57,423
Absolutely. However, the proportion of patients with kind of sickle cell is fairly low, but it could be contributing.

908
01:37:00,113 --> 01:37:04,013
Yeah. It could be contributed. Yes. What do you decide?

909
01:37:10,573 --> 01:37:13,943
Oh, I see. Yeah.

910
01:37:14,213 --> 01:37:19,643
So the question is like, how how do we decide when they were recorded?

911
01:37:19,643 --> 01:37:25,043
I think. Yeah. Yeah. So so these, all these values come from the electronic medical record.

912
01:37:25,553 --> 01:37:36,442
And so the pulse oximeter values are recorded there by a clinician, typically a nurse who, uh, you know, has to chart every so often.

913
01:37:36,443 --> 01:37:46,823
And so typically they will look at a monitor and say, okay, at this time, the oxygen value on their pulse oximeter is 94%.

914
01:37:46,853 --> 01:37:51,113
Put it into the chart. Arterial blood value is a is a lab value.

915
01:37:51,533 --> 01:37:55,103
And so it is charted based on when the lab was collected.

916
01:37:59,243 --> 01:38:06,692
Yes. Yes, each entry is per measurement.

917
01:38:06,693 --> 01:38:12,873
I had previously said it was per patient in this dataset is it is a per measurement.

918
01:38:13,263 --> 01:38:18,823
So individual patients here might have multiple measurements of.

919
01:38:25,703 --> 01:38:30,193
Question is, does each patient have the same number of measurements?

920
01:38:30,203 --> 01:38:36,203
And the answer is no. As someone mentioned before, someone's got a 30 day hospitalization.

921
01:38:36,443 --> 01:38:41,153
They might have way more than someone who has a 30 minute hospitalization or a.

922
01:38:47,733 --> 01:38:56,773
Sorry. Could you repeat that one more time? It's up here.

923
01:38:56,933 --> 01:39:03,943
These are. Oh, they're always paired. Yes. An individual patient might have one or they might have 50, but they're always paired.

924
01:39:07,483 --> 01:39:12,833
Yes. As you.

925
01:39:17,413 --> 01:39:22,423
We. So the University of Michigan data includes non ICU patients.

926
01:39:22,693 --> 01:39:28,393
Anybody who required action came into our dataset. The mimic dataset only includes ICU patients.

927
01:39:29,793 --> 01:39:36,653
And does not take him to. Does not provide. Data about before or after their ICU stay.

928
01:39:45,683 --> 01:39:53,033
I can't say that for a fact, but I feel pretty strongly that most patients in the ICU are receiving some action.

929
01:39:55,093 --> 01:40:01,732
Yes. How did your. Yeah.

930
01:40:01,733 --> 01:40:11,303
So we we did a multilevel analysis where we accounted for individual patients perhaps having more similar values.

931
01:40:14,323 --> 01:40:24,643
We talk? We can talk about that next time.

932
01:40:32,903 --> 01:40:43,613
My point is. So our goal would be to make sure that no patient has a value less than 88%.

933
01:40:44,543 --> 01:40:48,443
And so at what value on a pulse oximeter should we be taking action?

934
01:40:50,293 --> 01:41:03,173
Yes. Yeah.

935
01:41:03,173 --> 01:41:12,343
I mean. We have hypothesized that there could be a relationship there because skin,

936
01:41:13,133 --> 01:41:20,303
our sorry finger size is one of the variables that could affect the pulse oximeter value.

937
01:41:21,803 --> 01:41:31,253
And at least historically, my sense is that, uh, at least early calibration was unlikely to take into account women.

938
01:41:31,673 --> 01:41:36,193
More recent calibrations are probably. Much more equitable.

939
01:41:39,673 --> 01:41:42,072
I think that'd be cool and we haven't dug into it.

940
01:41:42,073 --> 01:41:49,543
I think we did some kind of back of the envelope stuff that suggested there may be a signal there, but we weren't entirely convinced.

941
01:41:52,003 --> 01:41:55,993
I'd be intrigued. But I don't know if they want you to go down that rabbit hole.

942
01:41:57,433 --> 01:42:00,993
Okay. Yes, that's true.

943
01:42:01,263 --> 01:42:14,663
But you define the like for like. Do you like using their race ethnicity to define that area for others and also to not let.

944
01:42:15,313 --> 01:42:24,613
She's that kind of. Could you repeat one more time? So the first question, you want to know the accuracy or downplay or not.

945
01:42:25,873 --> 01:42:29,703
Like you want to define that life as, like, all art?

946
01:42:30,853 --> 01:42:37,573
Yeah. I don't remember. You know, it does look like there is some granularity beyond just other unknown.

947
01:42:38,583 --> 01:42:44,343
I think it probably. It would be useful to have subgroups other than other I'm your own, right?

948
01:42:44,343 --> 01:42:54,572
That's not particularly helpful, I don't think. But I don't have a sense off the top of my head of kind of what the answer for the individual groups

949
01:42:54,573 --> 01:42:59,253
like my sense is there's prob there's definitely Asian because I see that and there's Hispanic as well.

950
01:42:59,253 --> 01:43:04,862
So I don't know like how many are there and kind of what the distribution is within groups.

951
01:43:04,863 --> 01:43:10,353
So I don't know. I don't know how valuable that or how.

952
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:18,273
I don't know how well it can be done. You know what I mean? Like in just in terms of the numbers of individuals.

953
01:43:18,483 --> 01:43:24,813
I think there would clearly be value to be able to say for Asians and inaccuracy exists

954
01:43:25,113 --> 01:43:29,943
for Hispanics and inaccuracy exists for this group and inaccuracy doesn't exist.

955
01:43:32,013 --> 01:43:37,323
But it may depend on the numbers involved there. Yes.

956
01:43:38,073 --> 01:43:46,263
So this. Yeah, it's a great question.

957
01:43:46,273 --> 01:43:52,213
So the question is, are the pulse oximeters all the same brand in this data set they ever calibrated afterwards?

958
01:43:53,383 --> 01:44:02,023
We don't know the pulse oximeter brands in this data. We imagine that since it's 178 hospitals, it's a bunch of different pulse oximeter brands.

959
01:44:03,433 --> 01:44:08,303
Are they ever calibrated? Not?

960
01:44:08,783 --> 01:44:16,673
Not really. That's all pretty proprietary by the company and that's been some of our discussions with

961
01:44:16,673 --> 01:44:23,453
kind of the FDA and with pulse oximeter companies is to try to reduce some of this stuff.

962
01:44:24,153 --> 01:44:28,583
Um, but no, generally, like there may be updates.

963
01:44:29,213 --> 01:44:31,283
There may be new models that come out, but it's not like,

964
01:44:32,063 --> 01:44:35,573
it's not like a patch that they put out like every year or something like that, you know what I mean?

965
01:44:37,603 --> 01:44:50,883
Yes to the. As in, like I.

966
01:44:54,843 --> 01:44:58,683
I don't know. I don't know if that's true or not. Um.

967
01:45:00,493 --> 01:45:03,523
I would imagine that there is variability in both sexes.

968
01:45:04,873 --> 01:45:10,633
But, you know, if the algorithm takes into account the sex of a patient, they have proprietary algorithms.

969
01:45:12,373 --> 01:45:19,213
I don't think so. I mean, because that that would require us to input into a pulse oximeter that value.

970
01:45:19,453 --> 01:45:20,653
And we don't input anything.
