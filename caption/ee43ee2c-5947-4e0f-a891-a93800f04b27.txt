00:00:06,218 --> 00:00:10,930
Hello, todays lecture will cover
the concepts of data visualization in

2
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,354
biostatistics.

3
00:00:14,354 --> 00:00:18,302
Now data visualization is important,
because it is impossible for

4
00:00:18,302 --> 00:00:22,890
the human brain to absorb the vast
amounts of data that we collect.

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,950
So we try to find pictorial
representations of the data to convey to

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,110
concepts that are important.

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,030
So I show you this figure here that
is drawn from the internet and

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,580
the world happiness survey,
is a series of plots.

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,150
The x-axis of which have
the numbers going from zero to ten.

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,130
And the heights of the bars representing
the number of people with that value.

11
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,552
What I would ask you to do is pause
this video, look at these figures for

12
00:00:46,552 --> 00:00:47,599
a couple of minutes.

13
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:51,080
Draw two conclusions from these figures.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,295
And when you are done,
restart this video and

15
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:58,800
I will present two conclusions
that I have reached.

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,000
Alright, so from looking at this figure,
the first conclusion that I have drawn.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,092
Is that a majority of the world reports
moderate overall satisfaction based on

18
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:10,401
a score of 5 out of 10.

19
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:15,920
I reached that conclusion by looking
at the upper-left hand of plot here.

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,770
Again this plot represents the number of
people who have responded to a survey with

21
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,570
numbers 0 through 10.

22
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:27,790
0 representing poor satisfaction,
10 representing excellent satisfaction.

23
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,584
I can see that the majority of people in
the world have responded with the number

24
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:34,410
five, is represented by the highest bar.

25
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,610
There are also a number of people
who responded for 6, 7 and 8.

26
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,700
And so I have chosen to groups this values
into a level of moderate satisfaction.

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,990
The second conclusion that I
reached was a comparative one

28
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,760
looking at sub-Saharan Africa and
Western Europe.

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,290
And concluding that overall
satisfaction was reported to be lower

30
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,630
in sub-Saharan Africa
than in Western Europe.

31
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,020
I reached this conclusion by
looking at these two plots.

32
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,479
And seeing that the western Europe plot
has a preponderance of values at 7 and

33
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:07,751
8, whereas in sub-Saharan Africa.

34
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:13,740
Although the peak is at 5, there is also
a great number of responses at 4 and 3.

35
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,370
So we can see that on average the values
in the sub-Saharan Africa plot

36
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,010
are generally lower than
those in western Europe.

37
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,780
So I might conclude that's there
are issues between these two countries

38
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,490
that are affecting the overall
satisfaction of its population.

39
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,060
These two figures that I've just
discussed and all of them in this plot,

40
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,910
are known as histograms.

41
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:39,470
Now histograms are used to summarize
a single variable in your dataset.

42
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,410
It's used to display the frequency
distribution of all the possible

43
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,690
values in the dataset.

44
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,815
Every subject in the data should be
represented in only one of the bars.

45
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:52,179
And the number of subjects in each bar
should certainly sum to the total number

46
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:54,700
of subjects in your data.

47
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,250
A histogram is simply a bar plot
of the number of observations

48
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,950
in each of the bins or these categories.

49
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,680
Now, each of the histograms in the figure
is missing a numeric label on the y-axis.

50
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,285
And typically in plot we like
to see labels on the y-axis.

51
00:03:10,285 --> 00:03:13,083
This not a limitation
on this figure however.

52
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,638
Because the creators of this
figure did not want us to have

53
00:03:16,638 --> 00:03:19,170
absolute numbers to reason from.

54
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,880
They wanted us to simply to look
at the height of the bars and

55
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,910
do a relative comparison of
those heights to each other.

56
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,223
If they had wanted us to make more
numerical conclusions from the plots.

57
00:03:29,223 --> 00:03:34,716
They could have one, put the values
of the bar heights above the bars.

58
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:38,000
They did not do this because
the figure has so many bars and

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,038
it is a relatively dense figure.

60
00:03:40,038 --> 00:03:43,930
That putting all these numbers on the plot
probably would have made them illegible.

61
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,854
They could've of also done a tabular
survey where they could have put all

62
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:50,314
the heights of the bars in a plot,
in a table.

63
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:54,558
Unfortunately, a table like this also
would be difficult to convey good

64
00:03:54,558 --> 00:03:56,097
information to a viewer.

65
00:03:56,097 --> 00:04:01,954
Because the vast number of numbers
that would appear in the table.

66
00:04:01,954 --> 00:04:04,760
Here's a second plot that I
would like you to look at.

67
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,210
It has four bars, the x-axis
demonstrates different age groups.

68
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:13,630
And the y-axis is a summary of
the percentage of smokeless tobacco use

69
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,930
in those groups.

70
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,600
So again,
I would like you to look at this figure.

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,524
Pause the video and

72
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:21,935
once you have reached to conclusions
from what you see in this figure.

73
00:04:21,935 --> 00:04:28,182
Restart the video and we can discuss
the conclusions that I have reached.

74
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:31,175
So, the first conclusion that
I have seen in this figure.

75
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:34,190
Is that among people age 12 years and
older,

76
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:40,090
smoke less tobacco use is greatest
in those age 18 to 25 years old.

77
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,290
Again I see this in the figure by
looking at the yellow bar which is for

78
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,330
the 18 to 25 year olds.

79
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,070
The bar is the highest among the red,
the yellow, and the blue bar.

80
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,860
The grey bar is simply a summary
of all the age groups.

81
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,960
And I've reached a conclusion for
one of the specific age groups.

82
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,548
I can also reach that conclusion simply by
looking at the numbers above the bars and

83
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:00,486
seeing that 5.2.

84
00:05:00,486 --> 00:05:05,367
Which corresponds to the percentage
represented by the yellow bar is larger

85
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:06,910
than 1.4 or 3.1.

86
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,500
But even if those numbers had
not been given in this figure.

87
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,680
Visually, I still could have
determined that tobacco use,

88
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,590
smokeless tobacco use was greatest
in the 18 to 25 year olds.

89
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,240
The second conclusion I
reached is a numeric one.

90
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,950
And I said that 3.3% of
people aged 12 years and

91
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,510
older report using smokeless tobacco.

92
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,444
Again, I can see that this gray bar here,

93
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:30,665
summarizing all of
the subjects in this study.

94
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:36,870
And they gave me the number of
3.3 to confer from this plot.

95
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,730
If they had not given me
the numbers again and

96
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,880
had just shown the heights of the bars.

97
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,480
I still could have concluded that the
percentage of smokeless tobacco use was

98
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,373
a little more than 3%.

99
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:51,310
Not exactly 3.3%, but
a very good approximation.

100
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,370
Here is another plot that
is from the same study.

101
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,406
Again, the x-axis demonstrates
different age groups and

102
00:05:57,406 --> 00:06:00,040
the y-axis is the percentage.

103
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,710
Here the percentage is summarizing two
other factors in these age groups.

104
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,948
The first is the amount of binge drinking
and represented by the yellow bars.

105
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:12,450
And the percentage of heavy alcohol
use represented by the red bars.

106
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,310
So this is a similar plot except now that
they have summarized two variables for

107
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,610
different age groups
instead of a single one.

108
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,510
This way we can compare
the rates of binge drinking and

109
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,810
heavy alcohol use directly
within the age groups.

110
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,078
We can also compare among
the age groups binge drinking.

111
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:33,167
And compare among the age groups
the amount of heavy alcohol use.

112
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:37,390
The last two figures that we have
discussed are both known as bar plots.

113
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:41,120
I think the name is obvious from
the fact that we have bars.

114
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,610
These are often used to compare values for
different groups of people or subjects.

115
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,134
Again, a bar plot is used to summarize
how one variable varies among values of

116
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:52,329
another variable.

117
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:56,940
The heights of the bars do not
necessarily have to add up to 100%.

118
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,958
Sometimes they will, but

119
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,561
it depends upon what information
is being conveyed in the figure.

120
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:05,229
You will see in the bar plots that there
is a whisker at the top of each bar.

121
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:08,010
And this represents the amount
of sampling variability,

122
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,480
which we discussed in an earlier lecture.

123
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,660
Again, these bars represent a margin
of error from survey to survey.

124
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,400
So that the height of the bar was
what's observed in this study.

125
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,534
But the height of the bar plus the whisker
is also a reasonable value that we would

126
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:25,794
expect in a reputed study.

127
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:29,090
Now that we've talked about histograms and
bar plots,

128
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,620
I show you this figure and I ask you.

129
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:37,280
Do you think that this is a histogram or
do you think that this is a bar plot?

130
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,720
And the answer is that this is a bar plot.

131
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,660
The x-axis shows different
categories of age and

132
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,800
the y-axis demonstrates something
about each of those categories.

133
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,573
In this case the rate of fatal crashes,

134
00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:56,135
if instead the y-axis had shown me the
percentage of people in that age group.

135
00:07:56,135 --> 00:08:01,290
That would be a histogram, and that would
be summarizing a single variable h.

136
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,593
In this case we are summarizing
two variables and

137
00:08:03,593 --> 00:08:09,604
their relationship to each other,
h and the rate of fatal crashes.

138
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:11,680
I show you another figure.

139
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,181
This is a series of bars,

140
00:08:13,181 --> 00:08:17,770
taken from a survey giving to children
about their education experiences.

141
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,259
Again each of the bar represent
a question giving to the children and

142
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,920
summaries their answers.

143
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,650
So I ask you again to stop the video, look
at this figure, come up with 2 conclusion.

144
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,554
And when you have completed,
please restart the video so

145
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:38,876
that we can discuss two of
the conclusions that I reached.

146
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:43,140
So the first conclusion that I
have reached from this figure.

147
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,010
Is that the level of agreement from
responders in question number 10 is much

148
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,220
greater than the level of agreement
than they reported with question 6.

149
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,940
I have reached this conclusion
by comparing the top bar,

150
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,900
which corresponds to question 10.

151
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,290
And the bottom bar, which corresponds
to question 6 in the survey.

152
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,330
The colors and
the bars represent the percentage of

153
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,890
children that responded
either strongly disagreeing.

154
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:10,140
Disagreeing, agreeing or
strongly agreeing to the statement given.

155
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,011
We can see that the sum of the two
light green bars in question 10 is

156
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,695
larger than the sum of the two
light green bars for question 6.

157
00:09:17,695 --> 00:09:22,009
The creators of this spot actually
gave us the sum of those two bars,

158
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:25,805
it's 59% for question 10 and
17% for question 6.

159
00:09:25,805 --> 00:09:29,684
So we can see that the level agreement
is certainly larger in question 10 than

160
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:31,080
question 6.

161
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,310
Again, if the creators of this figure
had not given me the actual numbers.

162
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,110
I still could have
reached this conclusion,

163
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:41,570
by simply looking at the size of the bars
and comparing them to each other.

164
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,700
The second conclusion that I've reached,

165
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:50,180
is that the level of agreement among
the questions varies from 17% to 59%.

166
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,710
Again, I have reached that conclusion by
looking at the numbers that they have

167
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,530
given in the right hand
side of this figure.

168
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,710
If they had not given me these numbers,
it would have been much more difficult for

169
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,350
me to summarize the amount of
variability across the questions.

170
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,550
I could have come up with
a rough approximation, but

171
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,572
certainly not as specific
a statement as I just made.

172
00:10:10,572 --> 00:10:15,780
This is an example of a different kind of
bar plot, called the stacked bar plot.

173
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,152
In each question, instead of taking
the percentage of strongly disagree,

174
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,555
disagree, agree, and strongly agree.

175
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,131
And putting those heights
next to each other,

176
00:10:25,131 --> 00:10:28,310
they chose to stack them
on top of each other.

177
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,758
By doing so,
we can do cumulative assessments,

178
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:34,777
we could quickly add up the percentage
of agree and strongly agree for example.

179
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:36,724
Without having it take two bars and

180
00:10:36,724 --> 00:10:41,118
then mentally trying to stack
them on top of each other.

181
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:44,940
The other inpoint in this figure
is to notice that the y-axis

182
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,200
indicates which part
corresponds to which question.

183
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,690
And their creators of this figure
chose not to order the bars

184
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,150
from the first question
to the last question.

185
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:58,360
Instead, they chose to order them from
the most agreement to the least agreement.

186
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,760
Again, we could have created
this figure instead.

187
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,960
It is the same data except
now I have ordered the y-axis

188
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,880
from the bottom as the first question
up to the top, the 11th question.

189
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,340
If we then try to discern the level
of the variability in agreement.

190
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,060
Or which question had
the most agreement and

191
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,880
which question had the least agreement.

192
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,930
We could figure that out, but

193
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,380
it would take more time because
the ordering was not given to us upfront.

194
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,957
That is why,
if we try to convey information.

195
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:26,094
We have to think about the best way
of ordering the information for

196
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:29,872
the reader to quickly make a conclusion.

197
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:33,097
Now, I have shown you histograms and
bar plots again,

198
00:11:33,097 --> 00:11:35,740
I ask you to look at this figure.

199
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,020
And would you conclude that this
figure is more like a histogram or

200
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,540
is it more like a bar plot?

201
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,040
Even though there are bars,

202
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,220
this is actually more like
a histogram than it is a bar plot.

203
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,020
And in fact each of these bars
in this figure is a box plot,

204
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,170
which is a figure that we
discussed in an earlier lecture.

205
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,720
Again, the y axis demonstrates various
areas of that students could receive

206
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,424
a diploma.

207
00:11:58,424 --> 00:12:03,081
And the x-axis demonstrates the cumulative
earnings that were observed for

208
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:05,620
graduates with that degree.

209
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,230
So, the very first bar on top is for
students who got a degree in education.

210
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,170
This is a distribution of all
the possible cumulative career earnings

211
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,960
amongst students with education.

212
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,530
The median is around two million dollars,
and there are other values for

213
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,350
the 75th percentile and
the 25th percentile.

214
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,680
And we see the tenth percentile which
is the value at which 10% or lower.

215
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,860
Of people of a educational degree receive
their earnings around 1.5 million.

216
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,750
The lowest bar on the bottom is for
chemical engineering.

217
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,320
Which demonstrates that their medium,
cumulative earnings is around $4 million.

218
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,860
So again, each of these bars is
simply a histogram view from the top.

219
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,540
Is a distribution of all the earnings for
people in that category.

220
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,360
Here is another figure,
I would ask you to look at it.

221
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,077
It is hopefully what you have seen before,

222
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:55,183
it looks like a pie with
a number of pieces of the pie.

223
00:12:55,183 --> 00:13:00,863
I would ask you to again pause the video,
glean two conclusions from this figure.

224
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,719
And when you have finished,
please restart the video so

225
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:09,594
we can discuss the two
conclusions that I have reached.

226
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:12,304
So the first conclusion that I
reached from this figure is that.

227
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:15,153
Among the five categories
presented in this figure,

228
00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:20,610
the leading contribution to premature
death is a person's behavioral patterns.

229
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,060
Now, I reached this by simply
looking at the percentages

230
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,300
corresponding to each piece of the pie.

231
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,927
So again, there are five categories,
these peecentages all add up to 100%.

232
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:35,790
And we see the behavioral patterns at 40%
is the largest of these five numbers.

233
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,445
Again, the creators of this figures did
not necessarily have to give me these

234
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:41,860
percentages, they could
have left those off.

235
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,810
I still could have figured out that
behavioral patterns was the leading

236
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,510
contributor to premature death.

237
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,810
Because the size of the piece of
pie was largest for that category.

238
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,540
The second conclusion I reached,

239
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,410
is that premature death due
to social circumstances.

240
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:00,410
Is three times more likely than premature
death due to environmental exposure.

241
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,520
Again, that conclusion comes from looking
at the percentages corresponding to

242
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,010
those two categories.

243
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,015
And I simply took the ratio
of 15 to 5 which is three.

244
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:12,653
Now, if the creators of this figure
had not given me these percentages.

245
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:14,870
I could not have made this conclusion.

246
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,347
I could certainly have concluded that
social circumstances was a greater

247
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:21,384
contributor to premature death
than environmental exposure.

248
00:14:21,384 --> 00:14:25,596
But the exact ratio of three would
have been impossible to discern.

249
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:28,294
As I stated this is what
is called a pie chart,

250
00:14:28,294 --> 00:14:30,500
because it exactly looks like a pie.

251
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,330
With slices of the pie corresponding to
categories in the variable year wishing to

252
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,880
summarize.

253
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,760
Now pie charts are actually rarely
used in scientific research.

254
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,810
The reason for this, is that the human eye
can discriminate differences in lengths

255
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,160
better than differences in volumes.

256
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,290
And that is why a bar plot
is a much more effective way

257
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,760
of comparing groups
rather than a pie chart.

258
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,100
It is also hard to directly compare
multiple pie charts to each other.

259
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,120
Unlike the bar plots we saw earlier,
we can compare multiple bar plots to

260
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,240
each other and still make
inclusions quickly and visually.

261
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,590
Pie charts, it is much more difficult to
compare sizes of pie slices to each other.

262
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:16,360
It is also impossible to convey concepts
of sampling variability with pie charts.

263
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,240
As I said in the bar plots,
we were able to put a whisker on top.

264
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,600
That showed the sampling variability or
the margin of error.

265
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,115
These sorts of concepts cannot
be shown in pie charts.

266
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:29,219
Now, some people will actually put
a hole in the middle of the pie and

267
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,241
that is known as a doughnut plot.

268
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:35,420
But I want to emphasize, that even though
the two plots have different names.

269
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,850
The information conveyed by both is the
same, there is no difference except for

270
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,060
the hole in the middle.

271
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,941
Now we can certainly combine
different plots into one figure to

272
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:46,145
convey the information.

273
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:50,023
Here's an example of
a pie chart that actually

274
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:54,404
a majority of people responded
no to this question.

275
00:15:54,404 --> 00:16:00,540
And in fact it was 97.7% reported no
misuse of their psychotherapeutic drug.

276
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,540
There were 2.3% of people who responded
that they did misuse their drugs.

277
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,660
Now the creators of this figure
then took that slice of the pie and

278
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,760
exploded it into a series
of bars in a bar plot.

279
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,120
What they could have done instead
is had different slices of pie for

280
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,550
pain relievers, tranquilizers,
stimulants and sedatives.

281
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,640
The size of those slices
would have been so

282
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,750
small that it would have been impossible
to gather information from them.

283
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,720
So this is why they combined
all four of those drugs

284
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,450
into one category in the pie chart.

285
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,830
And then exploded them into a bar plot so

286
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:38,720
that we could directly compare the misuse
rates within these four kinds of drugs.

287
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,412
So today's lecture hopefully
is demonstrated to you.

288
00:16:40,412 --> 00:16:43,967
That the concepts that you
wish to convey from your data

289
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:47,440
are determined by the kind
of data you collect.

290
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,250
And it is important to think about the
digital representation you will use for

291
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,145
your audience.
