1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:11,840
As I was saying. So I will try to record these Tuesday lectures so that we can see things that you missed the material.

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,710
But this is essentially the way I have the course structured.

3
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,830
Any questions or comments or concerns about this part of it?

4
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:26,350
If it's things like the reading that you really want to try to get ahead or you think you're going have some busy weeks,

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,700
I can probably post those little earlier,

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:36,540
but usually with the video lectures and stuff like that, they'll probably come out like parties that are trying my best to do it this year.

7
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,959
Quick. Of course.

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,060
Materials. We don't have a textbook. That's nice. We have a virtual textbook.

9
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,680
There's a professor over in England, and I found his textbook and I thought it was great.

10
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,750
I said, Hey, can I use your textbook or where we're going to get your textbook? And he said, I tell you what, I'll send you a PDF of it.

11
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,380
I said, Yes, we'll take that PDF. And so he gave us the PDF.

12
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,900
It's How to Work in R. I think his examples are great.

13
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,150
I think his writing is clear, so I think it's more supplementary.

14
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:21,580
We also, to many students chagrin, continue to use a textbook that has been around for at least 30 years.

15
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,360
It's growing, kind of hidden in West. That book is yes, it is dense.

16
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:34,810
It's got all kinds of good information. And you really, really want to know this stuff better from the inside out, almost formulaic.

17
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:40,660
They say it's not mathematical. Basically, it's pretty mathematical. If you really, really want to know this stuff, very verbose.

18
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,980
Great way to get an alternative explanation of some of this content.

19
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,330
So also have PDFs of that textbook that are going to be available for folks.

20
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:58,810
So it's a kind of a written books and then it's a lot of say it's a substantive book and then also an are kind of based coding book.

21
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:07,540
Both of them will be posted on canvas. I'll supplement with readings here and there are other other resources that I find the hour package that we're

22
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,729
going to use wonderful freely available for folks who want you're welcome to keep using these machines.

23
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:18,340
It's always going to be there. It's always going to be up to date. But think about like storage and packages and stuff like that that might change.

24
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,390
And we'll talk a little bit about this.

25
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,930
If you have a laptop and you want to download the software and do this on your own computer, go for it, actually encourage it.

26
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:34,749
Because then when you leave in summer, when you leave and when you come back in winter, you will have your computer with all of your files,

27
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,910
all your packages, all everything that you need to do to keep going about your business there and institutions twice a month.

28
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,470
And then the data sets I will provide. I am happy to try to find some different examples.

29
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,120
If you have data that you want to try to use in class and or you want other people, make sure you can pass that on to me.

30
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,070
We can poke around, see if there's a way that we can make an example out of or something that could be more interesting verb by now.

31
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,460
Uh, OC readings fill it out.

32
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,890
There's a lot of information I try to overload so that at least you have access to it.

33
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:13,630
So if if you do feel like you're falling behind, or if you do feel like something's not jelling between my presentation and what you're understanding,

34
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,690
so you have different ways to try to understand this material.

35
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,640
By and large, I think you can get away with a lot of the video content or just kind of working through the examples,

36
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:30,590
but just know that they're going to be there for you. I have found just a few of these types of books.

37
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,590
So this is the physics for people who think they statistics usually are.

38
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,190
What I really like about this book is it's using our studio, which is an interface for R.

39
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,300
If you've never used our before, the base R is very, very plain.

40
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,430
There's a higher learning curve.

41
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:55,470
This in our studio is kind of a solution of the graphic user interface that is a little bit closer to kind of a point in place,

42
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:02,830
still very script based, but it's a lot more accessible. We're actually using our studio in class now.

43
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,090
Our textbooks in general, there are fewer and farther between.

44
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:12,399
There's just not a lot of great textbooks and really accessible textbooks that say, here's how to run,

45
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,959
use statistics using our there's a few of them out there, but none that I've really got to say.

46
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:24,160
If I say I want to use this for my class, this one is the only one that I know of right now that specifically uses our studio.

47
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,649
Now the content is not where you need to be. This is fine with three kind of content, right?

48
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,250
This is means and standard deviations. And how do you use our studio?

49
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:40,060
Might be a nice supplement to this course. It's probably a little pricey, but I'll leave it here for folks to take a peek.

50
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,239
All my books are at home. You know, I have said we're 20 minutes away, so I don't want to load them all in here,

51
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,459
but I'll bring one every week and I'll talk to you about some of the ones that are actually a little more specific.

52
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:59,430
So it's like multilevel models using or minimizes using are so kind of very specific types of analysis and you got a little of book for how to do it.

53
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,890
And so those are kind of nice resources that you can find if you know you're going to be doing one set of analysis or something,

54
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:15,790
it could be a good way to do this. I said, It's fairly self-explanatory.

55
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:22,420
I'm going to provide all this stuff. You're not making videos, you will be working with syntax files, so get used to doing some of that.

56
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,590
But the goal is to give you enough scaffolding so that you can begin to manipulate my syntax files,

57
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,620
for example, and move forward with doing some of your own coding.

58
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:40,990
When I was learning this stuff and in graduate school, I've often ended up feeling like I was just taking my faculty member syntax,

59
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,100
running it and trying to spit out or to to comprehend.

60
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:52,770
The output. I don't want you to do that. I want you to do the coding part of it so that when you leave, not next winter,

61
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:58,049
but in the summer or whenever and somebody gives you something new, you know how to do that.

62
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,490
And you don't have to look back at my code and say, Well, you know, all I ever did was just press run.

63
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,730
And then I saw it's an output. No, we don't want that. We want you to be able to to really manipulate and think through.

64
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,700
And what's great about art is not only can you do that, but then you can also build on it in new ways.

65
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,170
It is entirely customizable. So if you are really, really into this stuff,

66
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,809
you can make your own programs and we can even talk about how to write functions and some of the other stuff so that if you have,

67
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,400
for example, many tasks that you have to replicate, you don't have to just sit there.

68
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:38,660
The, the book, the book, you know, we can run loops. We can do some things that will allow us to do things more systematically, expediently a.

69
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:52,020
Yeah. What about it? So the video is again supposed to be to introduce you to the content, hopefully distill some of the readings down.

70
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,710
I will run through examples. So each week I post kind of an ah, instant replay.

71
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,080
So what we'll do on Tuesday is we'll walk through examples, for example, and then I will post that.

72
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,840
I mean like an in-depth version of me going through just ah, so it's like a screencast and you just working through ah,

73
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,700
so that if you want to do it on your own time and you're like, okay, nice to have the whole class here,

74
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,050
but I'm just going to go right to the R stuff and I can even get a little bit more depth, that kind of line by line.

75
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,910
This is what the syntax is telling us. This is how we're kind of doing things so that you get really comfortable with that.

76
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,439
And I make all kinds of mistakes. I'm going to ask people, I'm going to call on you.

77
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,900
I'm going to ask you to to answer questions. And it's okay if you give up, because I absolutely will give up.

78
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,330
But when I do, I will often make like a video. Or if I imagine something, people say, Whoa, whoa, what is that?

79
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:47,940
Sometimes I'll pause it instead of like post a five minute video about, I don't know, sampling distributions or something like that.

80
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,470
So something that maybe isn't so pertinent to the main class but could be of interest to folks.

81
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,530
More. Ah. Right. So ah.

82
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,100
You can download for free. It's going to be on all these computers.

83
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:08,700
Packages are additional functionality and ah, so there are little programs that we can download from the web or rent ourselves.

84
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:16,950
And when they are uploaded into our our library we can access them just like pulling a book off a shelf and use them in ah,

85
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:21,990
to do different things that are hard to do on its own. So you can think about HA as having the base functionality.

86
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:30,780
Packages will have more and better things that you can do and we'll use a lot of them if you had your own machine.

87
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,440
When you download these packages that are a stay in your your computer's memory

88
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,040
and you can access them repeatedly if you are using one of these machines,

89
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:45,210
we're going to have to download them each day. But don't worry, that takes, you know, 5 seconds, 10 seconds and like that it's very fast.

90
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,940
AH is available in servers throughout the world.

91
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:55,590
I think there's even one at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, now in the loop and I'll teach folks how to interface this one.

92
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,880
That's kind of an important one. I would really like folks to kind of work with that,

93
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,589
but I guess there is a learning curve and it can be fairly steep at the beginning if you know without a doubt that your field or your

94
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:12,510
own personal preference means that you're going to be working with SPSS for the rest of your life or state over the rest of your life.

95
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:21,120
Why spend 16 weeks learning R and mastering R? Just to go back to SPSS, I can help you through most any one of these packages.

96
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,120
I'm very little rusty with SAS, but I can probably help you through the others pretty easily too.

97
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,910
Is it fine if you find that you're liking the content but the R piece is just not clicking?

98
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,370
You want to start doing some of this work in a different software we can probably better have talk to me about it,

99
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,959
just let me know and we can figure out for folks coming from public policy,

100
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:50,220
for example, or economy or economics, HAARP, they just don't use not everybody.

101
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,670
It's broad, it's not fair, but a lot of people use different forms of software.

102
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,990
So if that's really where your field is, let's talk about and see if maybe that makes more sense,

103
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,470
particularly for those who are going to be doing a lot of this in the future. All right.

104
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,700
Now I will do my ourself job. There's a steep learning curve.

105
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,050
I'm not gonna lie. If you've never done some syntactical programing, it's going to be a little bit of a pain.

106
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,950
You're going to get a lot of error messages and R doesn't tell you why you're going the error messages.

107
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,070
It just says you're you're wrong. Sorry. Try again.

108
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:26,400
We're going to turn this to we're going to do our best to kind of workshops on those error messages and get folks to a place where,

109
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,800
you know, you're kind of flying through.

110
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,720
But oftentimes it's something as simple as a period or a colon or something like that that's missing everything up.

111
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,740
And there's nothing. Although our studio is getting even better at doing some of that troubleshooting for you.

112
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:44,730
We do have to we do have to deal with that. But if for the if you're a student,

113
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:50,910
you finish this semester knowing a lot about our you will no longer needs data or sass or

114
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,870
hierarchical linear modeling programs or implicit structural equation modeling program.

115
00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:00,960
You probably might still wanna learn this or SPSS. It can all be done in this freely available.

116
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:09,270
My goodness, doesn't that have implications for our practice partners and folks that are working on smaller budgets, highly customizable?

117
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:15,299
Build your own programs, do the most advanced smart trials, machine learning,

118
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:24,750
whatever else you want to try to do right now within a handy piece of software that you can download anywhere in the world for the price of zero.

119
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,580
So I do think it's worth making a good attempt to try and run the software.

120
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,559
Our studio has made it so much easier, also free.

121
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,560
Although they are figuring out ways to license their professional and office packages, use the free version.

122
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:45,180
I've never run into trouble with it. I work with hundreds of thousands of observations and it's just fine.

123
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,040
That might change in the future.

124
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:56,280
But for now, there's the base package that underlies our studio as well as add ons to data, probably SAS and certainly SPSS too.

125
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:02,520
So you can run or in the background with your SPSS, for example, to have some additional functionality that way too.

126
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,429
So kind of having an understanding again prior to needed.

127
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:12,300
It is big sell job because people are excited about it, but some last pieces, it's faster.

128
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:19,260
Data does, it's new releases once every year, once every couple of years and all sorts of new different kind of packages or programs are.

129
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,000
It's as soon as somebody up in biostatistics, you know what? I have a great idea for a package, right?

130
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,819
And they throw it up on the web and then if you start to use it, right.

131
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:38,550
So there are lots of different ways that we can use R and faster as people learn how to program course stuff,

132
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:43,950
how folks do it, where I figure over time I seven to about half million folks.

133
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:53,640
Right. And of course stuff. So what I care about more than anything in this course is right here track just.

134
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,999
Just try. When I call your name, give a shout. It might.

135
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,570
You might even. You might be wrong. All right. And ask a joke. Okay? Right.

136
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,180
Somebody else might know the answer. Don't feel bad, right?

137
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:08,050
I'm trying to get you to a place where you're feeling comfortable not just doing this stuff, but also conversing.

138
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,020
Right. So that you can explain this stuff to folks who just do not know what an odds ratio is

139
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,950
and it's not worth trying to learn how to noise ratio is for that one conversation.

140
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:22,740
But you can talk through it. You can explain why it's important. You can explain the differences in effect sizes, whatever it's going to be.

141
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,950
And that starts here. We can be conversational about statistics and quantitative methods, and that's a good thing.

142
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,820
But then we can also be a little bit more formal in our writing too, so we can balance those two.

143
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,540
The second one I think is the most important is the homework.

144
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:45,330
So rather than trying to, you know, help folks with these big old exams each week starting Friday, next week, I want to get the homework assignment.

145
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:49,680
And all it is is just demonstrating your your ability to do some of this stuff.

146
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:57,030
Right. It's basically taking the example that we do in class and just tweaking it a little bit so that you learn to work with the software.

147
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:03,030
You learn to write it up. That's all it is. Now, it seems pretty easy to attend these things, but again,

148
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:11,730
this class does start to move and the content and the content starts to come very a lot of content in a short amount of time.

149
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,749
So keep me abreast of how things are going. If you feel like folks are falling behind a little bit, let me know.

150
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,650
And we can kind of move forward. In a way, it's working.

151
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:32,340
Here we go. What I am going to ask folks is that you give me more than just the output and an interpretation.

152
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,170
I want to see your research question. Right. I want you to tell me why you're doing this.

153
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,549
I mean, you know how to do a whole background like an AP review.

154
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:47,400
But I try to explain why you think there the relationship might be in a given direction.

155
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,090
Give me a hypothesis. Tell me a little bit about the methods that you're going to run.

156
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,970
You're going to run a T test. You're going to run an over. You're going to run a regression.

157
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,990
You're going to control for this better or the other variable and why that's kind of important.

158
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:03,450
But then, yes, the results section. Tell me a little bit about the data that you're seeing.

159
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:09,960
Tell me any sort of sensitivity analysis that you tried maybe two or three different things you decided to go with number two because of X, Y or Z.

160
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,930
Tell me about that. And then ultimately, the discussion part is going to be knowing what you saw in the results.

161
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:22,830
What is your conclusion? Was your hypothesis supported? Right now, there's some flexibility here that can look different for different people.

162
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,350
But really it's just more than here's my R output in here and you have it right.

163
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:34,080
I want some of your kind of thoughts and interpretation in there as well, and I can provide examples for folks if you want.

164
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:38,970
I also had no bones about sending back paper and saying, Hey, can you give me a little bit more information here?

165
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:45,150
So don't be surprised if that happens. But I think generally speaking, these are more for your benefit.

166
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,630
Making sure that you don't end up missing big chunks of the class.

167
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:53,969
They're all building on each other. So paying a lot of attention to these early assignments and making sure you're

168
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,390
feeling good about those and then moving forward to more complex things.

169
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,340
And again, if you want to use your own data, please, if you're going to remember it better,

170
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,180
you're going to be you can see the syntax file so that you're going to keep working on top of it.

171
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,490
The midterm. I do have one large assignment that I have folks do.

172
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:19,020
This is more of an employee assignment. This is Wesley Hall, and Albion College is my very first job out of grad school as a hall director.

173
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,980
Best job I ever had in my life. I love that job. It was so much fun.

174
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:26,820
All 601st year students and I was in charge of all of them.

175
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,950
It's like just trying to keep them alive for a year.

176
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:37,400
And I got the job because I told my boss that they're the person who's hired me and I knew how to work with data.

177
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:43,230
So of course, I'm like Google Day seven. She dumped a big whole bunch of data on me, said, Hey, can you run some of these analysis for me?

178
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:50,579
I'm trying to answer a few questions. Five questions from the Dean students that were given to the Rose Hall or whatever,

179
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,960
and her job as a director of all the rest halls, which then I got to because I knew how to work with the data.

180
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:03,360
I'm gonna do the same thing to you. I'm going to give you five questions and some data, and then I want you to tell me how to go from A to E, right.

181
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,330
What are the steps that you're taking to answer some of these questions?

182
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:13,710
How are you going to make decisions about measurement, about the kinds of analysis that you might run?

183
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,070
It's really more of an applied assignment to figure out,

184
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:23,339
can you take some broad guidelines and then actually do it in a way that you can write up and say,

185
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:29,250
these are my recommendations based on answering these five questions that you've given me, so that the questions are quite broad.

186
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,420
There are different answers, so there's not going to be a one answer key for this assignment,

187
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,440
which I think is, you know, in some ways intimidating, but in some ways it's a good opportunity.

188
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,070
Show me how you would work with data. Show me how you could present to a stakeholder.

189
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:48,059
And that's what this exams although it's kind of a yeah I mean it's real life is I can give you in this class without

190
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,710
using data from an actual result but it's going to be around like mental health and substance use and that type of thing.

191
00:17:53,560 --> 00:18:01,300
I will. I was looking at the calendar yesterday. There's a little bit of overlap with fall break.

192
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:08,890
So what I want to do is the week before or fall break is going to be kind of our midterm week on Tuesday and we'll do kind of a review.

193
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,689
On Thursday, you will have the midterm and we'll spend the whole Thursday, if you want,

194
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,309
working in this classroom, you can ask questions which will have an entire week to do it.

195
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:21,010
So I'm not trying to record fall breaks. It's just where the kind of class lined up.

196
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,100
And by and large, you can probably get it done before the break actually hits.

197
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,430
Or certainly once the vote comes back, you can get it done by Thursday.

198
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,000
If time is going to be really sheer force of our schedule things, let me know.

199
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:40,960
But we can. Generally speaking, it's been it's been doable in a reasonable amount of time.

200
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:50,110
Questions about assignments. Yes.

201
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,430
Do you have any final 4 seconds or. Good question.

202
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:59,709
Good question. No. And so here you have in the past.

203
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:06,910
Yes, I have. It's evolved. The most recent one that I've done was having folks do some sort of visualization.

204
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:11,530
So if you were more research inclined, it was doing like a poster for a conference session.

205
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:15,760
If you were more application oriented, it would be like a data visualization.

206
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,050
Here's the thing.

207
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:26,380
I'm just anticipating that we are still in the middle of a pandemic and that people might be missing classes, people might have other things going on.

208
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:35,080
And so I think the homeworks will allow you to get to where you want to be and practice this stuff enough.

209
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,190
If folks really want to do the assignment, I'm happy to make it available.

210
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,730
I'm happy to grade it or even just take a look at and give you some feedback on it.

211
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,710
It's a good way to demonstrate your skill set.

212
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:54,400
But my thinking is, at this point, I don't want this class to be additional stress during what I feel is still a stressful learning environment.

213
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,440
So focusing on the homeworks, focusing on application assignments.

214
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,640
But the final, I think for this year, still I'm going to hold off.

215
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,750
But again, if that's a good or if anybody is like expecting like I said,

216
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,810
I heard things from at least one person excited about the visualization piece.

217
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,910
We can build that into either an assignment like a homework assignment,

218
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,780
or we can build it into something else to make it even to vote on the midterm for 20.

219
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,000
But no, seriously, if there are things that you're preparing for, like a conference,

220
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,420
like you're reading up a recent paper and you want to build some results. I figured it's just as good as working on a homework assignment.

221
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,499
Hey, Justin, I'm reading a paper. It's going to have some, I don't know, multilevel models in there.

222
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,220
Can I use some of that for my week seven homework or something?

223
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:50,830
Yeah. Yes. I'm happy to be very creative about how we facilitate your learning here.

224
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,580
Okay. Any other questions?

225
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:12,950
Right? Right. So one game, I said, okay, what are the homework assignments do every week?

226
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,810
And I.

227
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,160
I give them to you on Thursday.

228
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:27,870
Do next Thursday. Yeah. You got a week? Right.

229
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:33,770
And that's part of what the lab can be to lay folks and work on their homework assignments the Thursday before that there.

230
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:40,770
Yeah. And we have to submit our files and to be able to do a tutorial type we want to do.

231
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:46,920
Sure. Yeah, absolutely.

232
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:54,980
If you want to download because someone as impressive as that one are the R files and we are marked on file or something like that.

233
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,170
Yeah. Yeah. And that part's fairly flexible.

234
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:05,070
But yeah, I can give you my favorite way to do it is to actually kind of embed some of the the code within the.

235
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,240
And I guess it's been worked out for others. Um, let's see here.

236
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:15,150
If I, if I can give some, some guidance on how people should do it,

237
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:21,610
but generally they're the only reason why I want the R file is just if there is a mistake I can look to see the code word for a they might be.

238
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:30,090
So where do you want to address the assignment or whether it's just more of a there's an auxiliary file that has some that I don't know.

239
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:42,180
So I just have our markdown is a functionality of our studio that allows you to kind of create PDFs more or less that have just a little more tearing.

240
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,510
So you can make a pretty nice looking document using markdown if that's an area that you plan to use.

241
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:54,510
And if you're developing like resource guides or something like this, which.

242
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:14,340
This is what you can kind of do, whatever. Well.

243
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:22,520
Whenever that happens. So it's kind of a logic.

244
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:28,459
Ed So you can set formatting and you can embed some of your code and stuff like that.

245
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:34,430
So it looks a lot like our studio. Okay.

246
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,840
Last name for this is the class readiness.

247
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:49,309
So it is up on canvas and week one, if you go to your canvas and please let me know before you leave.

248
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,370
If you don't have access, you have to figure out I make this bigger.

249
00:23:52,820 --> 00:24:02,090
I don't know if you go to week one and if you go all the way down to here.

250
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,380
And you can send this to me via email. You can slide it under my door.

251
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,980
You can put it in your mailbox upstairs on the third floor.

252
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:52,490
And there are this at home. But I'm saying it's just a sheer shindig, more than a half an hour.

253
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:58,820
And all I'm trying to figure out is whether this stuff is brand new for folks or if it's,

254
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,110
you know, like entirely redundant with some other questions that you dig in.

255
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,850
So don't need to open up your old textbooks.

256
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:14,450
Don't need to call a friend, just, you know, kind of your best effort at some of this.

257
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:29,390
So that's not too bad. Maybe you kind of fun questions about this or where to find this or where you were supposed to submit this when you're done.

258
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,559
Okay. All right. Um, so let's see.

259
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:47,200
Here's where, I guess why we're on this page. For my learning objectives.

260
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,679
This is where you're going to find lecture slides is we're going to find videos down here is very critical.

261
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,480
This is where you're going to find the data and stuff that we're going to use for the class.

262
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:03,880
So each week I'll post like the script file that we're going to use in data we're going to use.

263
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,079
This is might be helpful for folks for the first assignment.

264
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:18,909
So these are going to be some basic resources for how to upload data or import data, how to manipulate a data file in an hour.

265
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:23,800
So some of those kind of those basic pieces, my readings will always be down here.

266
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:27,400
Colin Kroenig in Can West, that's the really dense one.

267
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:32,950
Give it a shot read through. If it's just you know, I'm not retaining any of this information, don't do it.

268
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,740
But it's really it does its own.

269
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:46,030
And then the nel chapters are the ones from the professor in England and I think are just very helpful for some of the kind of basic arguing.

270
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:54,130
Now I think most of the way he's doing it is in base, are edited in our studio for the purposes of like a syntax file or running analysis.

271
00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:02,710
There's no difference. It really is just the interface. So you can use the syntax file you create in Bazaar versus our studio and vice versa.

272
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:06,760
There's just going to be a little bit of and it's just going to look a little bit different.

273
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,350
And but we can I can show you how to do that.

274
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:15,070
And then optional readings, assignments here, you're going to be you be able to access them for this week.

275
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:20,800
All I need you to do, if you're going to do this on your own computer at home now, are in our studio.

276
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,830
In theory, you don't have to use our studio. You can complete this entire class in regular R,

277
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:31,480
but I'm going to be using most of the examples in our studio, so I'd probably just consider doing that.

278
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:37,180
And then these are just kind of for, you know, Friday nights and other times hanging out with your friends.

279
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,760
That was, you know, a lot of things notes. Yeah.

280
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:47,230
So are these readings of videos for next Tuesday or for Thursday?

281
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:51,040
So this week I just Thursday, I mean, this is actually an optional one.

282
00:27:51,730 --> 00:28:02,170
I might throw a couple up there. There now a little michael I dated but there how to how to use our in our studio and it's very much a you know

283
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,710
how to use our as a calculator how to act how to download a package so that that piece of it is still relevant.

284
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:13,809
And I can put them up there for folks to take a look if you want to before Thursday.

285
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:16,000
But this Thursday, that's what we're going to do as a class.

286
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:22,630
We're going to go through are we're going to learn how to import data, download packages, run a few descriptive analysis, that's everything.

287
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:27,040
But then on other weeks you're probably going to see two or three videos.

288
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:31,180
I will try to make them optional. Like I said, I do provide kind of a guide each week.

289
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,890
Watch the first 15 minutes of the video, but if there's ten more minutes that you don't have,

290
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:40,080
just try to skip that part and then focus your efforts here or there.

291
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:50,200
So this is yeah, this is very general, kind of just an overview of research methods and some kind of intrastat stuff.

292
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,980
It's not getting into like the the numbers behind it all.

293
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,350
But if you if it's been a few years and you might take a look, you're welcome to.

294
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:03,460
All right. Well, we had about, you know, about 15 minutes or so.

295
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:11,520
You folks need a break or it's not okay. I simply mean desperate.

296
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:17,790
All right, well, I would take whatever it was that I'm feeling good.

297
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:21,160
Oh, yeah? Yeah. Hello? Let me do 5 minutes getting underway.

298
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,700
I'll be right back. Anybody want to check out this, our studio book?

299
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:33,990
It's nice because it's not like. Thank you.

300
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:49,700
Yes. To do that.

301
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:55,310
You. 33.

302
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:21,150
I know exactly what I was saying before today about what exactly happened, because I feel that these are the things that, you know.

303
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:47,850
This. Nowhere in like a place like between two and something that you have a lot of friends.

304
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:54,690
Oh, my God. I forget. I think of calling Davis friend.

305
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:00,090
But then also many Princeton computer universities employees.

306
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,340
Yeah, he is. I wouldn't say yeah.

307
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:19,040
But after all, we go and see what happened that night and I think he's doing the escape room for each other.

308
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:28,850
And so he's been in the garden and she was like, I know he's getting hurt.

309
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,560
I think this encapsulates we're not going to solve it. I think it's going to have to open.

310
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,460
So I.

311
00:31:41,520 --> 00:32:46,130
But that's okay. We'll see. The class only find its own.

312
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:50,000
I have the class. Okay. Yeah.

313
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:55,770
So anyways. So can we start the class by. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

314
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:03,250
I tend to go just to keep in line. But you will not be offended if ever, you know.

315
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:44,600
For those of you using a laptop or a microSD, do it in the next few minutes.

316
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:50,189
But if you want to go to do you just open up Google and take our kids.

317
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:57,510
Are you going to go right to the R program website if.

318
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:05,120
If you are using one of the university machines. I'm sorry.

319
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:11,650
I need you not to. But my buddy is going to marry you.

320
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:17,270
But in Texas, I'm leaving Wednesday night. Hot damn, man.

321
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,630
Yeah, and I think it flooded the other day, too.

322
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,010
But I'm leaving Wednesday night, so I won't be here on Thursday.

323
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,189
Okay. Yeah, no problem. Yeah, we'll be doing more of this, but I will record that one because it is more of like this is how we do it.

324
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:37,790
And so. Yeah. Okay, cool. But is it like a zoom recording or an Panopto?

325
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:42,229
So it'll be posted on campus. Okay. All right.

326
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:46,990
So just for the last few minutes that we have here and maybe just, you know,

327
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:52,459
what you have to take for Thursday, we're going to just go through some of what our looks like.

328
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,240
So if you do are working on a university computer,

329
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:02,719
you should be aware of the start menu and type in R and one of these menus is going

330
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,390
to pop up either the 64 version or the three to get to figure out how to work this.

331
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:26,230
All right. Well, well, then it's better than Thursday. But so this is essentially your your base are windows.

332
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:29,920
So as soon as you download air, you're going to get something like this.

333
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:36,910
We will probably spend very little time working in base.

334
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:42,460
Ah, but just know, just sort of, you know, this is what's going to be undergirding all the things that we do in our studio.

335
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,820
So this is there, it's operating behind the scenes.

336
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:52,960
It gets no glory, but it is the, the engine that's driving everything you contrast and the numbers because they're.

337
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:01,160
Before I go there. This is our studio.

338
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:10,020
In our studio, just as a again in terms of accessibility to me is just a lot easier to work with women.

339
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,740
Our folks can see how easily you can see.

340
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:28,460
How is that for the folks in the back there to see that the kind of the base console is going to look very similar to the console right here.

341
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:36,410
Right in there, again, they're going to be synonymous. This is just a way to work with that same base, ah, function of a console.

342
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:42,200
What we are going to do is spend a lot of time manipulating our studio,

343
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:51,230
including opening up script files and using our plots window where use the packages we can download.

344
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:58,040
This is all going to be coming on Thursday, but just this is going to be our new best friend and it can go with you.

345
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,389
Yeah. Nice and free of charge. But there it is.

346
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:08,510
So basic features of our the console is this one.

347
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:17,830
Here. This is our base console. We have the analogous console here in our.

348
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,350
This is where the action happens. So anything that we take and do has to run through the console.

349
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,460
All right. So a script file by itself can't do anything. It's actually just a text file.

350
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:33,850
You can send it around. You can print it out. But you can actually run the analysis for you that for that, you need to have your console.

351
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,910
So when we run things in our console, like simple calculation.

352
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:54,790
The returns answer. Right. So at its most basic level is a big old fancy calculator.

353
00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:00,000
But we're going to do we're going to use a lot more of our than just calculator.

354
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,300
I guess the thing is that on Thursday, since they can see the window,

355
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:12,460
one of our favorite things to do with in R is to use a command by C script or new program.

356
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:18,590
I can't see. Your file.

357
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:27,190
Shh. All right. Our script and I will finish that for Thursday.

358
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,060
This is the beginning, but. All right, here is our script window.

359
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:37,100
So, again, this is just a text file that we are going to do most of our coding.

360
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,400
So the reason why we don't want to use our console for all of our coding is it's ephemeral.

361
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:45,410
It will be gone when we close our studio.

362
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:52,940
If we don't save that window, that information that we've programed through the console is not going to be exist anymore.

363
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:56,240
We're not going to have a record of all the different things that we've done,

364
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:02,660
whereas a script file allows us to run the exact same operations, for example.

365
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:15,220
Right. And run that same command down to our council.

366
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:20,590
The difference is here. I can totally tell you what I did. Line one down here.

367
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:25,900
I cannot tell. Right. This will go away. This stays into perpetuity.

368
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:34,960
And believe me, if you plan to come back to analysis that you know, you're going to remember in a week, in a month and a year you will not remember.

369
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:38,260
Right? You won't remember why you did these kind of funky things.

370
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,730
Having a record of it is just good science.

371
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:47,350
It's good for replication. It's good for anyone else who wants to try to work with that file.

372
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,570
And it's a great for your own memory too.

373
00:39:50,080 --> 00:40:01,480
So they are if you've done any sort of syntax editing in SPSS or if you do files or SAS files, it's the exact same thing.

374
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:07,990
So these are kind of our I will use the R programing language within our script files to run our information, save it.

375
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,870
And then the last one is going to be this curve graphics window,

376
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:19,350
which for our studio is going to be down here in plots for the base window is or third base are it would pop up as a new window.

377
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:28,550
So if you were using this and you ran a something that has graphics, it would pop up as a new window, same functionality.

378
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:31,690
Right. This is just going to be a little plainer.

379
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,319
I don't care what you use and the syntax file will be the same.

380
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,920
I can take my syntax file from studio and run it through R and vice versa.

381
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:43,240
Okay. So depending on what you what you feel is going to be more appropriate for you.

382
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,669
But I think more often than not,

383
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:53,170
students are pretty comfortable working here just because there's some ingenuity there that you don't see from the base package.

384
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:01,190
All right. So there are some basic things that we're going to start to go through in if you've never seen them before.

385
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:04,990
So commands are basically are all the actions that we're going to ask our to do.

386
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:09,280
We're going to use them from either the console or from the script files.

387
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:15,220
We're going to prefer the latter again for keeping a record of them. We're going to have to think about two different things.

388
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:25,810
Objects and functions in R. Now, this terminology is important because all of the different packages and the coding around

389
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:32,410
are is going to use things like creating an object or designing or writing a function.

390
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:36,160
Right. So trying to understand when we're saving things,

391
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,640
we're saving things as an object when we are actually asking it to do things like calculate a mean or run a regression analysis.

392
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:49,720
We are using a function, right? And so our does or will return different more often than not errors.

393
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:54,250
When you ask, for example, an object to do something that a function should,

394
00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:00,459
or when you're trying to use a function when in fact you're really trying to call an object or when you're saving things,

395
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:03,520
you have to be careful that you're not saving over data set.

396
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,700
But objects are going to be super important for what we do.

397
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:14,980
It's anything that we kind of create an R, whether from a just a number all the way up through a whole data set,

398
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,930
variable scales, all that kind of stuff will be done by creating objects.

399
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,100
It's super easy to do. It's also super easy to mess up.

400
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:29,409
So we're going to have to balance those two things as we're as we're kind of creating.

401
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:33,460
And the best way to make sure that when we do make a mistake, we can go back and correct it,

402
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:41,020
is to see in our script file to continue to file how we're doing all this as this creation and having a nice record for it.

403
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:47,560
Functions are what we can do or to or to create objects.

404
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:53,140
So I'm just giving you an example, two of them, and this is just the creation of them.

405
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,040
These two are equivalent in our language. The preference is to use this kind of arrow.

406
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:11,010
You can think of it as this object will be, and everything that you have pointed at the arrows pointing out will be your object name arbitrary.

407
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,329
You can choose anything that you want, anything to.

408
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:20,530
The right of it is going to be some form of either syntax or command language that will ultimately represent that object.

409
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:31,290
Again, you can use equal if you want to create an object, but there are some more advanced coding situations where you can have some duplicative of.

410
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:38,230
If you have, you're using equal sides within the function perhaps, but then also trying to create objects.

411
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,120
So just to to disambiguate,

412
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:45,760
I'm going to recommend that when we are creating objects in order to all of a sudden there's that we're using something like this.

413
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:50,540
But. See here.

414
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,459
The nice thing about Bazaar before we ever get into creating packages is that there's

415
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:04,140
going to be a lot of stuff that art can do for us without any additional functionality.

416
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:09,720
So within Bazaar, for example, we can use built in functions.

417
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,260
Make this for me. Calculate this for me.

418
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:20,700
Run this correlation. Right. So it's memorizing the function name, and every function is going to have arguments.

419
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:27,210
And so one of the arguments for a function are going to be what we're going to use to execute a given command.

420
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:32,940
Right. Our has a whole bunch of those built in. But as I mentioned a little bit earlier,

421
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:37,290
one of the strongest and one of the best parts about our studio excuse me about

422
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:42,930
our in general is that people can build off of the base different functionality,

423
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,430
often nicer ways of doing some of the base things.

424
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:56,090
So I love using what's called the site package. It's a little program that you can you can download from the AR interface.

425
00:44:56,090 --> 00:45:02,580
So if you go to, for example, packages here or if you go to packages up here,

426
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:10,560
there are ways for you to download different packages that have additional functionality that are studio or that are can't do on its own.

427
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:21,090
In the case of this example, just this site package insert for the psychology has a described function.

428
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,680
It's a different function that's going to do all of these things for you simultaneously.

429
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:31,259
So rather than having to say, give it to me, show me the standard deviation, what's the what's the range,

430
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:36,150
what's the whatever the described function by itself is going to give me everything.

431
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:41,459
So when we are looking at different packages and when we're thinking about different sorts of analysis,

432
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,650
we might find or you might find that you like the information provided by some more than others.

433
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:56,340
And so then you'll be using those in the future. And we'll talk about some of the common packages that I use if folks are familiar with some of them.

434
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:02,070
There are many other there are hundreds of thousands that you can potentially choose from.

435
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,220
And so part of our challenge of our is just trying to winnow that down.

436
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:12,030
Plan histogram commands are examples of ways that you can use graphic interface.

437
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:15,420
I know I'm going through this very quickly because Thursday is going to be devoted to all of this,

438
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:22,740
but it's also going to show you how complex even base functions can be in R.

439
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:27,810
So plot is like, you know, creating scatter plots, histograms, creating histograms.

440
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:33,540
There are so many different arguments that accompany each one of these commands.

441
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:41,669
It can become almost overwhelming to you have to learn almost like a whole new language just for a basic thing.

442
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:48,430
Like, give me a histogram, please. All of the tailoring that you might do, the color, the lines, the boxes, the, the,

443
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:53,670
the buckets, the scale, all of those pieces are customizable and you can use those.

444
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:59,130
So it's great to have all of that at your fingertips, but it also requires some learning.

445
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,500
And so a lot of times what we're going to do with our script files is we're going to find some level that we're happy with,

446
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,140
and that's what we're going to just stick with and go.

447
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:11,550
If there might be situations in the future where you need something different and you can build off of that.

448
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:18,540
But for the most part, I'm trying to find that homeostasis where I have my basic sets of commands that work in most situations.

449
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:24,449
I'm going to run those in almost every situation, and then when I need to do some tailoring, I can do so, right?

450
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:29,250
So I'm going to hope that folks will start to create a script of library when I get a brand new dataset,

451
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,700
these are the things I'm going to do when I'm going to run my first analysis.

452
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,690
These are the things that I'm going to do, have lot of language built in and ready to go,

453
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:41,220
and then you can do a little bit of additional work when you're done. All right.

454
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:44,810
So let's see here.

455
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:54,059
This was maybe from a bygone era, but if you don't want to just use base, are there are some additional interfaces that you can use?

456
00:47:54,060 --> 00:48:01,110
This is just become the Amazon relative to some of the sort of at home delivery, whatever.

457
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:06,360
Right. So our studio has more or less taken over almost any classes that I see,

458
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:11,250
almost any folks that I see working in are if you're not using base, chances are you're using this.

459
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:15,270
That said, our commander and there are a couple of other interfaces that are out there.

460
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:22,740
Our commander is a little more plain click. So if you really like on the SPSS feel of things, I think that was the intention.

461
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:26,370
And there's one or two more in the last slide before I let you all go.

462
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:30,390
I know that. Know I'm going to try to give you as much as I can,

463
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:38,160
but the Internet is going to be a great resource for you to learn more and more about our and all the things that are available.

464
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:44,850
This is where you get to utilize this great university of ours.

465
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,510
This car is over in Rackham. They will help you with your archive.

466
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:53,880
I will also help you with your according to this car will to use them your students here go for it.

467
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:58,320
They will. Then they can help you try to solve things that maybe we don't even know if they're.

468
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:01,860
The examples differ a little bit from what we do in class or something.

469
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:06,120
They're there to help you. All right, UCLA, I love this site.

470
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,870
This is not just for our resources, but stash resources in general.

471
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:18,990
They have tutorials. They have step by step guides for how to run certain analyzes and data that are on SPSS.

472
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:23,580
So take a look at it quick. R is a nice one that's available on the web.

473
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:29,610
It's kind of like I just need to I mean, how do I do it? I just need to calculate some the variance, how do I do it?

474
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:34,770
And it's available. Another one is the R Cookbook and I can probably give you a PDF of that.

475
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:41,730
It's also just kind of an encyclopedia of all the different kind of R functions that people are using, and you can pop it open and take a look.

476
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:44,880
How do I create a scatterplot? And it's going to have an example for you.

477
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:54,179
So now that those are out there, I am happy to take any other questions, but I will call this a day on Thursday, please.

478
00:49:54,180 --> 00:50:01,140
If you're going to use your laptop, try to download for an hour studio so it's ready to go and we are going to spend some time code.

479
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,070
Thank you everyone. I hope you have a great day. I'm looking forward to working with this semester.
