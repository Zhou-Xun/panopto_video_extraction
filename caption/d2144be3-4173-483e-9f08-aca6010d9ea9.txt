1
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,340
In this video, we will

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,920
continue learning how
to clean out data set.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,455
In particular, after
watching this video,

4
00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:19,395
you will be able to
use two SAS PROCs,

5
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:23,935
PROC FREQ, and PROC PRINT
to identify duplicate IDs.

6
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:26,820
Unless you specifically
know that you have

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,430
repeated observations
for the participants,

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,760
you should not have duplicate
IDs in your data set,

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,320
and this should be
identified as a mistake.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,770
You can run a PROC FREQ on

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,765
the identification
number variable

12
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:42,195
called ID in this example.

13
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:46,185
In theory, every ID should
have account of one.

14
00:00:46,185 --> 00:00:47,660
If there are duplicates,

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,780
some IDs will have
account greater than one.

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,285
Since you're not
expected to look at

17
00:00:53,285 --> 00:00:55,670
that table and identify
them visually,

18
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,580
remember, you're supposed
to have thousands of IDs.

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,670
What we're going to do
is that we will use

20
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,495
the No Print option in the
PROC FREQ, and instead,

21
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:08,210
we will keep the IDs
and the accounts in

22
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,195
a data set that we're
calling here, repid no.

23
00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:15,860
If you do a proc contents
of the data set,

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,010
you can see that we just
created a data set that has

25
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,960
the ID numbers and
account for ID numbers.

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,230
Now, you can use up PROC
PRINT to identify if

27
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,955
there are any ID numbers with
account greater than one.

28
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:32,700
If there are no duplicates,

29
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,230
all accounts should be one,

30
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,925
and then PROC PRINT will
not print any observation.

31
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:41,405
But in this example,

32
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:43,865
we've got ID 87

33
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:47,240
that shows more than
once in the data set.

34
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,000
Before going into deleting one of

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,830
those IDs from the data set,

36
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,349
you have to make sure that
it is a real duplicate,

37
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:55,940
because it could
be another error.

38
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,460
It's important to make
sure that you are really

39
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,605
cleaning the data and not
getting rid of valid data.

40
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:05,930
We're going to list a few
variables from the data set,

41
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,910
like BMI, over weight,

42
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:13,835
sex, and age for ID 87 to
see if they are the same.

43
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:16,269
In this particular example,

44
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,675
they look like two
different people,

45
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:19,830
who clearly by mistake,

46
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,750
they were assigned the same ID.

47
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,860
You will need to change

48
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,715
your data collection
forms to correct this.

49
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:30,679
In summary, we learn
how to identify

50
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:33,740
duplicate IDs using
PROC FREQ and we

51
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,410
learned to be cautious
and use PROC PRINT to

52
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,775
check that they are
real duplicate IDs.

53
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:42,725
This is everything for
identifying duplicate IDs.

54
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:43,865
In the next video,

55
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:46,700
we will continue
cleaning our data set by

56
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,290
checking for inappropriate or

57
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,499
unusual values in your data set.
