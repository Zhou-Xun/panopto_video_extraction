00:00:01,497 --> 00:00:03,145
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:08,433
This is my first quick review video where I'll be going over

3
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:13,419
the PowerPoint presentation that we covered in class.

4
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:16,706
So you'll see me skimming through the PowerPoint very quickly.

5
00:00:16,706 --> 00:00:21,367
Just capture major ideas that could be useful for you to know for

6
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:23,841
future reference and in general.

7
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:29,523
So I'm gonna start with lecture one, sensuality, energy and efficiency.

8
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:35,371
And so energy expenditure when expenditure exceeds intake,

9
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:42,231
you might be losing energy and this will lead to potential weight loss and

10
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:47,976
vice versa when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure.

11
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:51,106
And that might lead to putting on some weight and

12
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:56,677
potentially obesity in a nutshell.

13
00:00:56,677 --> 00:01:01,083
So our brains and our bodies are wired to eat.

14
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:07,141
There's a drive to consume food and this is like an adaptive mechanism just so

15
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:11,627
that we do not starve and that we just survive basically.

16
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:16,563
So think of it as survival of the fittest you need to eat to prevent starvation.

17
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:19,977
So if you look at some of the neurons, we have the NPY/POMC neurons.

18
00:01:19,977 --> 00:01:24,897
So on the left side of this graph over here the NPY and HRP neurons,

19
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:29,203
they are the neurons that signal you to eat for instance.

20
00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:33,457
On the other hand the POMC neurons are the neurons that's what signal you to stop

21
00:01:33,457 --> 00:01:33,974
eating.

22
00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:38,700
So you can see that the HRP neurons if they are up regulated that would mean

23
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,438
that there's eating behavior that's being promoted.

24
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:47,289
Whereas on the other hand if there's POMC neurons being up regulated and

25
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:50,239
active then this would suppress appetite.

26
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,149
And there are some hormones that play into this.

27
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:55,916
So insulin would suppress appetite.

28
00:01:55,916 --> 00:02:00,421
Normally think of it as insulin being up regulated postprandial just because you

29
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,551
just ate a meal that has glucose in it.

30
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:06,805
And this would mean that you would need to eventually stop eating because you

31
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:07,412
just ate.

32
00:02:07,412 --> 00:02:10,844
Ghrelin, on the other hand, it up regulates NPY.

33
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:13,152
And it's the hormone released by the stomach.

34
00:02:13,152 --> 00:02:17,608
Any post issues really leptin and leptin would promote decrease and

35
00:02:17,608 --> 00:02:21,296
feeding behaviour because it's released by episite.

36
00:02:21,296 --> 00:02:25,241
And so as you episite are increasing in size.

37
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:29,091
It means that there is enough food storage in the form of fat.

38
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:33,312
So that would lead to decreasing appetite.

39
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:37,334
So basically stress would promote AgRP neurons and

40
00:02:37,334 --> 00:02:42,944
would would make you want to eat more think of it as someone has an exam and

41
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:47,918
they're under stress and they just start eating more food.

42
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,588
Sometimes it might not always be the case for everyone.

43
00:02:50,588 --> 00:03:01,783
But this is like an example that might be helpful to keep in mind.

44
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:04,364
You'll see me skipping a few things.

45
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:06,287
There's also vagal nerve signaling.

46
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:09,907
So the vagal nerve after you eat will be covering this and

47
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:14,157
card lecture about absorption and digestion as you're eating.

48
00:03:14,157 --> 00:03:18,334
Your brain receives the message that you've eaten and

49
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:23,610
this will promote the pumps the neurons to stop the eating behavior.

50
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,232
So glucose, those are some of the metabolic signals like glucose is directly

51
00:03:28,232 --> 00:03:29,522
sensed by the brain.

52
00:03:29,522 --> 00:03:34,543
And so in a sense that the hypothalamus like stop to encourage

53
00:03:34,543 --> 00:03:40,162
you to stop eating proteins and lipids are also potentially sense.

54
00:03:40,162 --> 00:03:45,028
That the hypothalamus and leptin is also sensed and

55
00:03:45,028 --> 00:03:48,544
it's released by the I post issues.

56
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:53,040
So those are the, this is the summary and

57
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,067
basically all of those the signals are trying

58
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:01,914
to inhibit the feeding behavior.

59
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:05,125
And they're being released from different places except for grilling.

60
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,283
So keep in mind grilling released from the stomach.

61
00:04:08,283 --> 00:04:12,011
It's activated when you haven't eaten for a while and

62
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:17,133
this is why your stomach sends that signal to your brain to promote eating.

63
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:22,088
So mindful eating is potentially trying to eat when you feel like

64
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:25,772
you need to eat and not just when you want to eat.

65
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:30,846
So it's really being mindful about your environment and when to eat in

66
00:04:30,846 --> 00:04:38,853
your body cues that will tell you when to eat and when to stop eating.

67
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:43,380
So other hormones that we will also be covering in the digestive tract lecture.

68
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,540
So gastric and the stomach releases acid,

69
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,063
secretin has released in the small intestine.

70
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:51,263
CCK, motilin and

71
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:56,548
the parasympathetic nervous system versus the sympathetic nervous system.

72
00:04:56,548 --> 00:05:00,821
Which will also be talking more about the parasympathetic nervous system is the rest

73
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:01,490
and digest.

74
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,314
So it allows you to like digest the food that you've eaten.

75
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:10,049
And it's like kind of it's slow and everything is going smoothly.

76
00:05:10,049 --> 00:05:14,556
Whereas sympathetic nervous system if it's being activated that's the fight or

77
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:15,610
flight reaction.

78
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,862
So you are not digesting as much but

79
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:27,789
you're trying to run or survive more so.

80
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:33,969
So their basal metabolic rate is the part and black.

81
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:38,943
So how much energy you stand on a daily basis is the combination of all of

82
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,334
those your energy expenditure from exercise.

83
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:47,249
Your non energy non exercise activity thermogenesis.

84
00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:51,733
So basically if you walk five minutes to go to a restaurant or

85
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:57,849
something that's not really physical activity is just non exercise activity.

86
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:00,881
And then the thermic effect of food, how much food you eat and

87
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:02,383
it's increased by protein.

88
00:06:02,383 --> 00:06:04,124
So if you eat more protein or

89
00:06:04,124 --> 00:06:08,907
your meal is really big then it's gonna take more energy to just that meal.

90
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:13,509
And then your basal metabolic rate is really determined by your age and

91
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:15,308
your sex and the lean mass.

92
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:22,362
And it does have a set point which will be talking about and,

93
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:27,730
So why does the 500 calorie rule not work it, so this rule is basically

94
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:33,720
telling you that if you restrict your dietary intake by 500 calories per day.

95
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,166
You can lose you can lose up to like one I guess or

96
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:41,931
two kg per per week as far as I remember.

97
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:45,962
But this doesn't work because when you're reducing your energy and

98
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:48,962
take your basal metabolic rate also gets reduced.

99
00:06:48,962 --> 00:06:54,347
Which isn't like great news for people who are trying to lose weight.

100
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:59,823
But it's a fact your basal metabolic rate just goes down

101
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:06,357
because it's trying to prevent the new shift and energy and take.

102
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:09,193
So it's trying to maintain hamostasis and

103
00:07:09,193 --> 00:07:13,378
it does that by combating the change that you are introducing.

104
00:07:13,378 --> 00:07:18,059
So any shift in calorie intake will be

105
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:22,592
like slightly counterintuitive.

106
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:27,424
But any change in your caloric intake will become that that kind of by your body who

107
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:29,994
is always trying to maintain hamostasis.

108
00:07:29,994 --> 00:07:33,546
So think of it as someone who just is gaining weight or

109
00:07:33,546 --> 00:07:38,728
basal metabolic rate will increase as their caloric intake is increasing.

110
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:42,605
But then it becomes if you keep on eating more and more and more,

111
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:45,620
your basic metabolic rate by default will go up.

112
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,591
And it will remain at that higher set point then when you initially started.

113
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:54,452
And the same thing applies to someone who wants to lose weight and

114
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:59,117
is restricting the circular can take your body first, tries to combat that.

115
00:07:59,117 --> 00:08:05,289
But eventually your BMR will go down based on your own you caloric

116
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:11,342
intake And this is the biggest

117
00:08:11,342 --> 00:08:16,023
loser follow up that shows how people who lost weight eventually gained it back.

118
00:08:16,023 --> 00:08:21,825
So to keep that weight off, you either need to exercise more or

119
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:26,178
restrict your dietary and take more depending

120
00:08:26,178 --> 00:08:30,772
on like how your caloric intake is at the moment.

121
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:35,014
So you do not want to be restricting too much to an extent that you're starving, so

122
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,728
maybe you want to increase your physical activity.

123
00:08:37,728 --> 00:08:41,644
So really thinking about what works for your body and

124
00:08:41,644 --> 00:08:59,398
what doesn't would be definitely a value.

125
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:00,761
And I think that was it.

126
00:09:00,761 --> 00:09:04,554
Then, [LAUGH] if you have any questions, let me know.
