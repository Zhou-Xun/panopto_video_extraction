1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:09,970
Okay. So let me resume. Lives look great.

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:18,190
All right. We're going to get started. Thank you, everybody.

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:26,890
I'm trying not to steal your water. Thank you very much. So it is my pleasure to introduce Dr. Natasha back to Syria.

4
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:33,280
Dr. Bassiouni has been the chief medical executive for the State of Michigan since 2021.

5
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,860
In this role, she provides overall medical guidance for the state of Michigan as a cabinet member for the governor.

6
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:44,799
She is board certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine in Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases,

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,530
and she is a fellow of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

8
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,960
She has worked in Michigan and internationally in Singapore, Bangladesh and for the World Health Organization.

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,610
She has over 50 publications on topics in infectious diseases and public health.

10
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:08,260
Of great relevance to today. Dr. Vegetarian completed medical school at Wayne State University and Internal

11
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,160
Medicine Residency and Infectious Disease Fellowship at the University of Michigan.

12
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:19,600
And she received a master's in public health degree from the Jimmy Program from the University of Michigan in 2001.

13
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:25,330
We suspect that actually I took a class together at one point, but we don't remember it.

14
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:32,649
So without further ado, I'm going to turn it over to Natasha and Dr. Big Serious to talk.

15
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:38,470
She's going to give kind of a career talk in terms of her experience, the different experiences she's had in her career.

16
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,160
But, you know, she has this isn't in your bio. I'm just going to add stuff.

17
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:48,160
Yes. She's done a lot of work in hospital epidemiology and infection prevention spaces,

18
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:55,930
both from a very hospital based practice perspective, but then also from a policymaking perspective at W.H.O. and then at the state.

19
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,319
And so this is kind of a thread that she's had throughout.

20
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,840
And so I think she'd be a great person to ask her questions about it in terms of careers and.

21
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,990
With that. Thank you so much.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,720
Can everyone hear me okay? Okay. I'm going to try to make this quick and painless for you all.

23
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,320
I was asked to start out with some slides and I really wasn't sure how to make slides about my career.

24
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:33,690
So I thought that I could just share some publications because the publication sort of tell a story of what I've worked on through my career.

25
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:42,540
Dr. Martin told you a little bit about my early career, so my training, my infectious disease, internal medicine and HIV training.

26
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:51,270
But I'll just take you through my post-graduate career and what I did after I finished all of that training.

27
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:59,250
So I finished my infectious disease fellowship in 2010, and I after fellowship,

28
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,430
I really wanted to work in hospital and molecular epidemiology as a hospital epidemiologist.

29
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:14,940
And so I really worked on things that were interesting to me at the time, and I was really interested in device associated infections.

30
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,070
I was interested in C diff and so I thought I was going to go on to have a career in C deaf.

31
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,110
And so you can see the publications that I worked on right after I finished my

32
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,639
training were all sort of what was happening in hospital epidemiology at that time.

33
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:38,310
So device infections and we were just seeing c diff cases really spike across the country and people were dying from sea diff.

34
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,700
And so hospital epidemiologist had a whole lot of attention, which was something brand new and was very exciting.

35
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:58,230
And I didn't think that epidemiology would ever gain that kind of attention again, which, as you know, is is not what happened from 2015 onwards.

36
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:06,959
So from 2010 to 2015, I was working in the state and I was working as a hospital epidemiologist at a few different hospitals in the state,

37
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:14,520
including U of M and the Ann Arbor VA. And just sort of writing what I thought was interesting and working on hospital policies at those places.

38
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:24,720
And then in 2015, I decided that I had really had enough with clinical medicine here and the types of jobs that I was getting here.

39
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:29,340
It was very hard to find a job as an ID physician solely.

40
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,300
You were being sort of stretched and pulled in a lot of different directions.

41
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,270
You were being asked to see more and more patients.

42
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:42,300
You were being given very little time to do other things outside of patient care, such as infection control.

43
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:49,530
And I ended up moving to Singapore. And the way that it happened was my husband was offered a job in Singapore.

44
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,260
And I thought once I moved, I would never be able to work again.

45
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,470
And I thought this was the end of my career and I was just sort of heading out into the unknown and we're going to see what happened.

46
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,190
It's also very hard for physicians who trained in the U.S. to work in countries like Singapore.

47
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:14,129
They do not, by and large, recognize our training. So I moved to Singapore in in 2015, and I stayed at home.

48
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,180
I had a I had a newborn. I stayed at home for about six months.

49
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,169
And I thought, gosh, this is really hard. I really don't like staying at home.

50
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,010
I need a job.

51
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:33,329
And I ended up finding and this is just through talking to people and going out and sort of cold calling and interviewing with random people.

52
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:40,140
I ended up finding my dream job in Singapore. So I found a hospital called the National University of Singapore.

53
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:49,830
The main hospital is about 2000 beds, so about double the size of U of M and they also had a number of other affiliated hospitals.

54
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:55,649
So altogether, this is a massive hospital system and they did really great care.

55
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,330
They provided really, really state of the art care for very low costs.

56
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:06,840
They also weren't seeing the same types of hospital associated infections that we were seeing here in the US.

57
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:14,670
They really did not have a problem with see death. Patients don't really get seated there and if they do, they're not incredibly sick from it.

58
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,290
And some of this has to do with maybe different circulating strains in different parts of the world.

59
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:31,200
But I got involved. So in this job, they were really looking for someone with infection control training and antimicrobial stewardship,

60
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:38,190
which is all I had ever wanted to do. So they found a way to get my training recognized, and I worked at this amazing hospital for five years.

61
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:46,140
And so you can see from the publications during these five years I worked on, I worked on projects related to antimicrobial stewardship.

62
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,459
I worked on outbreaks.

63
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:55,260
So I managed big outbreaks of disease. Big exposures.

64
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:01,600
One of the one of the. Or two of these publications are on.

65
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:12,799
TB exposure. We had a massive TB exposure where a pediatric nurse had TB and walked around

66
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,620
coughing on neonates and babies for about three months with active pulmonary TB.

67
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,380
And so I did a lot of work on TB and got quite a few publications out of that.

68
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,280
But really, again, just working on things that I thought was interesting.

69
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:35,040
And then of course, in 2019, COVID hit.

70
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:41,060
So right around New Year's Eve on 2019, I was on a lot of listservs.

71
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:48,800
And on New Year's Eve, we heard that there was there were some atypical pneumonias in Wuhan, China, and that we should be aware of this.

72
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,399
Now,

73
00:07:49,400 --> 00:08:00,470
I think a lot of my colleagues in the U.S. weren't quite as attuned to the way we were attuned in Singapore because Singapore had seen SAR as one.

74
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:07,910
So Singapore had not only dealt with the first stars, but people had died from SA's in the hospital where I worked.

75
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:16,040
And so they had this institutional knowledge. And not only was it this sort of abstract concept, they knew people who had died.

76
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,500
And so they took this really seriously, I think, a little bit differently than some of my colleagues here did.

77
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,569
I was staying in touch at this time,

78
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:31,700
and I was calling some of my friends back in the U.S. who work in infection prevention and saying there is this new disease coming, are you ready?

79
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,330
And they were like, Oh, yeah, we're totally ready. And they were not.

80
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:43,820
So in January of 2020, the part I left out, by the way, was in 20.

81
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:51,230
18. My husband took a job in Dubai and that meant leaving Singapore.

82
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,350
I really did not want to give up my job in Singapore.

83
00:08:54,350 --> 00:09:03,710
And so I created a work plan and an offer on how they could continue to keep me and how they could have me work for them,

84
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,729
even though I lived in Dubai. And so we worked out this arrangement where I worked remotely from Dubai for three

85
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,639
weeks out of the month and then for one week out of the month I would fly back

86
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,230
to Singapore and do clinical work and do as much as I could there in person and

87
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,030
then go back and work three weeks remotely only because I loved this job so much.

88
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:30,200
But in January of 2020, we were really gearing up to face COVID in Singapore.

89
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,690
And so at that point they asked me to fly back for a month.

90
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:40,730
My boss in Singapore was he is a bigwig at W.H.O.

91
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,860
And so they were sending him on that first fact finding mission, mission to Wuhan.

92
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:53,960
And so while he was deployed to Wuhan, they asked me to fly back to Singapore and just be the coordinator of our COVID response.

93
00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:04,969
And so that's what I did. I flew back to Singapore for a month, which was hard because, you know, we were on the brink of this pandemic.

94
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,110
And, you know, I had to leave my family behind and.

95
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:16,629
We got ready and we got ready in ways that I think the U.S. didn't get ready until much, much later.

96
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:22,660
So we did things like we set up emergency department tents outside.

97
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,880
And these were not high tech medical grade tents the way that we used in the U.S.

98
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:33,670
These weren't things where we had to wait for federal funding or wait for someone to give us a bunch of money.

99
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:40,299
We actually just went and spoke to catering companies and in Singapore they have

100
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,540
a lot of outdoor funerals and so they're very used to doing funeral tents.

101
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,260
So these were funeral tents and they erected these large structures.

102
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:53,170
There was no HEPA filtration. These were just naturally ventilated tents.

103
00:10:54,010 --> 00:11:01,510
And we were able to see patients with natural ventilation and really, really good infection control protocols.

104
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:07,960
And there was zero transmission of COVID, even though we were seeing a very, very large number of patients a day.

105
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:15,790
So we we got ready with these tents. There's a picture in the top left corner of what a ward looks like in Singapore.

106
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,500
And having private rooms is a is a very big luxury.

107
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,520
So you were only given a private room if you have paid extra money.

108
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,679
Otherwise the wards are open air wards.

109
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,719
So there are, you know, 30 people, 40 people in a ward with natural ventilation.

110
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,360
You're just opening the windows and with natural ventilation and really good infection control policies,

111
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:47,500
again, we had zero transmission of COVID, really just a flawless, flawless protocols.

112
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,720
And Singapore got a lot of really great press.

113
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:59,020
Singapore was heralded too. Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong were like the poster children of COVID that how can you do everything right?

114
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,700
These are these are the examples. And of course, they're very different settings than we have here in the U.S. And you can't replicate them because,

115
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,380
you know, it's just a completely different setting over here and much bigger country.

116
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:24,240
So we were feeling pretty good about how things had gone in Singapore and we got to publish lots and lots of articles really early on.

117
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,500
So you can see some of these are dated in February, January.

118
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,320
Publish lots of articles on the COVID response in the early days in Singapore.

119
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:44,250
And at the same time, when all of this was happening, I was approached by the World Health Organization to help them write some guidance.

120
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:49,290
And so in addition to managing COVID in this massive hospital system in Singapore,

121
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:57,780
I started working for the World Health Organization and I was the lead author in the Bottom Left one.

122
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:04,800
So Framework and Toolkit for Infection Prevention and Control in Outbreak Preparedness, Readiness and Response.

123
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,019
So this is the most this is the biggest,

124
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:13,290
most comprehensive thing that the World Health Organization has issued on outbreak preparedness and the different phases.

125
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:23,670
And this is something that I worked on. I can't even tell you how many hours I put into this document because the W.H.O. is really poorly funded.

126
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:31,290
And so you think you look at a document like this and you think that there's a team of 20 people, 30 people writing it, but it was a single person.

127
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:37,620
It was me. And so through 2020, I worked on this document in the bottom left.

128
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:46,140
And then later on this year, I adapted it for the for the health care setting, for the health care facility level.

129
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:55,470
And then in July of 2020. So as things were just really heating up here in the U.S. and other places in the world,

130
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:01,350
my husband's job said it's time to go back to the U.S. and we really wanted to

131
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:07,079
go back to the U.S. because at this time we were living in Dubai under very,

132
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,700
very strict lockdown.

133
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:17,100
So people here talk about lockdowns, and I don't think you understand what a lockdown is until you've experienced it in some other countries.

134
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:28,740
So in Dubai, we could leave the house for one hour every three days if we had a police permit and only one person at a time.

135
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:35,610
And we we had to make all kinds of adjustments because you were just we were confined to an apartment.

136
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,350
We taught my dog to to use the bathroom on the balcony because there was no walking your dog.

137
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:49,050
There was no going out in public. And groceries were just, you know, once every three days, if you ran out of stuff, it was too bad.

138
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:58,829
So we moved back in July and it was a really interesting time to be back because in Singapore we we had been living

139
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:06,090
in this environment where it was very much a sense of community and there was no arguing about mask mandates,

140
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,330
there was no pushing back about rules, about gathering limits.

141
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,399
Everyone just sort of did what they were told. And the same for hospitals.

142
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,920
We were given a set of our marching instructions from our Ministry of Health, and then we implemented them.

143
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:28,889
And I came back to this and it was just absolute culture shock because as an infectious disease physician,

144
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:36,960
it was really hard to understand why people were pushing back against things that were lifesaving and that were clearly life saving.

145
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:45,480
So this was a little bit of culture shock for me and I thought, you know, why don't I try to get a seat at the table?

146
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,290
There were a lot of bad decisions that I saw being made in Dubai,

147
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,020
and I wanted to have a seat at the table and have some input into our COVID response here.

148
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:04,400
And so I ended up applying for a job at the State Health Department over LinkedIn, and I applied over LinkedIn.

149
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,389
They interviewed me over Zoom.

150
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:16,230
I was in a hotel in Dubai in the middle of my move and had this interview and got hired as the senior public health physician for the state.

151
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,010
And it was a really interesting time to enter into public health.

152
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,829
So I had always been involved in public health, but little public health, right?

153
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,060
So I was working in hospitals and looking at outbreaks, little outbreaks,

154
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:42,080
and now all of a sudden we are in the biggest pandemic of our lifetime and there's a lot of attention on big public health and none of it is good.

155
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,540
Everyone has criticisms. Nobody likes what we're recommending.

156
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:53,600
And we were also hearing from our local health department partners that they were being harassed,

157
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,280
they were being threatened, they were being stalked online.

158
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,080
And these are people that I was getting to know as my colleagues and friends and

159
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,640
I was hearing from local health department health officers that they were being.

160
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:15,590
One of them was a car trying to push him off the highway, off the road after a school board meeting.

161
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:21,190
And people were being fired. They were being removed from their jobs after decades of hard work.

162
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,530
So it was a really interesting time to be in public health.

163
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,330
But this is why this graph is why I stuck it out.

164
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,550
And it is the disparities that we saw early on in the pandemic.

165
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,610
So this is our mortality rate by race and ethnicity.

166
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:48,750
And you can see these are the different COVID waves and you can see that first wave, that blue line is mortality among African-Americans.

167
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:57,030
And I never want to see that happen again. There is no reason why one community should ever be left behind and should ever be disproportionately,

168
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:03,240
disproportionately affected by an outbreak or a pandemic, the way that African-Americans were early on.

169
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:09,299
And it illustrated for me all the ways that we had to improve public health and all the ways that

170
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:15,090
we had to reduce health disparities and all of the different complex issues that fed into this.

171
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,390
This was not COVID alone. This was underlying health status.

172
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:23,490
This was access to health care, this was transportation. This was folks living under the poverty line.

173
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:28,140
This was diabetes, this was heart disease. This was everything. So this is why I stuck it out.

174
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:35,560
And and since then, I have been very interested in how we move forward from our COVID response,

175
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,450
how we don't remain in the same phase that we were in in 2020.

176
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:48,880
So how we think about the future and how we scale things down when we need to and how we scale things back up again when it's time to scale up.

177
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:56,790
And one of the biggest things that I am interested in now is where do we go from here

178
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:03,370
and how do we take the lessons learned from COVID and use them to build a better,

179
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:12,459
stronger public health system? And so one of the things that I'm working on is I chair a lot of commissions for the governor.

180
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,550
And one of the commissions I chair is called the Public Health Advisory Commission.

181
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:22,450
And we are working on interviewing people who have been critics of public health.

182
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,940
We're working on talking to people who really did not like what public health did or who don't

183
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:33,700
know what public health is or who just couldn't care less about the advice we gave and say,

184
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,700
how can we do things better? How can we reengage?

185
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:42,400
And we all know that we will. We all should know that we've got a broken public health infrastructure.

186
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:52,090
This is an infrastructure that is not well financed. We have data systems that are broken, and we have a workforce that is demoralized and has PTSD.

187
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:58,250
Especially in Michigan. So they have PTSD, not only from COVID, but from Flint.

188
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,870
Right. There were people who worked in public health who were.

189
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,350
They were trying to do their jobs. How well they were doing their jobs is a different matter, but they were trying to do their jobs.

190
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:17,680
And there are people who are working in public health who are currently being indicted for charges like manslaughter.

191
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:28,600
So this is a system that is really traumatized. And then in addition, the part that I'm really interested in exploring is how do we regain our trust?

192
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:35,080
How do we regain the trust of the public? And how do we rebuild our relationships with communities?

193
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,980
How do we build that relationship before the next public health crisis?

194
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,870
And how do we make sure that the messaging is really targeted and unified and cohesive?

195
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:53,290
And some of the lessons that I learned in places like Singapore and working for the W.H.O., I've tried to bring here in my role in Michigan.

196
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:58,120
So that's all I have in terms of slides and happy to have discussion.

197
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,510
I am going to.
