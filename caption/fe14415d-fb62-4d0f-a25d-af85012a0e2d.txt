1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,299
Okay. So apologies to those who are watching this recording.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:16,310
We started just briefly and we're going through the class syllabus and we're on, but figuring out how to sign up for one of these groups.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,920
So to sign up for one of these groups, you go to the people tab here.

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,870
There is a conveniently structured groups tab already and there are three interview days in which you can sign up for.

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,110
These are capped at six students each.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:40,320
So if you want to try to sign up with students who are in the same discipline as you or subclan, that's fine with me.

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,889
I don't really care. But just do it.

8
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,990
Because if you run out of time or you don't do it fast enough, then obviously you get filled up.

9
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:57,090
So if you run out of time, I will just place you in one.

10
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,370
So please do that. And this will participation thing will count extra for your participation point.

11
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,420
So back on our homepage.

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,120
After we do our group interviews, we will have a session on networking, social media,

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:23,990
etc. and then we'll go into more detail about finalizing our learning plans, internship, registration and impact products.

14
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:29,059
And I'm going to click on this one specifically because all the resources that you need

15
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,980
for this lecture and the assignments associated with the lecture are already on canvas.

16
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,040
I put the slides up there so you can see what we're going to talk about.

17
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:44,120
You might change a little bit, but at least like those of you who have an internship already can really start thinking about this.

18
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:56,239
So it's the same learning plan from last year. See if competency is a speech of details on what Apex is are our internship handbook,

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:04,080
which should be like seriously your guidebook for all of this stuff and then how to register for an internship.

20
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:12,500
I don't think this link is active yet. This is in speech career services link and I know they're making edits and edited.

21
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:19,569
Whatever to it. So I clicked on it last week and they were still working on it.

22
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:24,260
So I'm not sure when it's going to open up, but just know if it's not working for you, that's why.

23
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,670
And then I was able to get Apex's from last year.

24
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,889
So if you're confused with what an internship is, what a competency is,

25
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:41,830
what an apex is, what you're learning plan will do to relate to all of these things.

26
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:50,020
I highly recommend checking out some of these apex's from last year and then we'll have our final learning plan due April 10th.

27
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,260
So that's just something to keep an eye out for in the future.

28
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:01,870
Back home after that, we'll have a lecture on professionalism, ethics, communication and interpersonal dynamics.

29
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:12,520
I will not be here for that lecture. I will be at a conference in Nashville presenting and Dr. Simmons Pearls will be coming in.

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,830
And I think we'll have a guest lecture for that as well.

31
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:22,360
And then finally, the last session that we'll meet together, we'll talk about how you can make the most out of your summer experiences.

32
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:34,030
So there are more details if you go to Syllabus. On the course description, our objectives and the competencies that we're hoping to fill.

33
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:44,490
Grading. It's the same as last quarter 20% attendance and percent participation and 80% assignments, 80% or more.

34
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,950
We'll get you to the gold standard of passing.

35
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:55,570
So that's all you need to really worry about. The assignments consist of several assignments here.

36
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:06,820
The elevator pitch of some sort of social media profile, either LinkedIn or Public Health Connect, and then the final learning plans.

37
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:14,830
And then there are more details on all your assignments here. And then, just so you know, your interview will also count.

38
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,990
So that was a super, super brief.

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,730
But you all are experts on kind of how this class works, what I care about, hopefully what you care about in terms of getting out of this class.

40
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,850
So I just wanted to go over this, see if there are any questions.

41
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:40,870
I invite you to read more. I can post a word version or a PDF version of the syllabus as well, and I will do that after class today.

42
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:52,020
But any questions so far? Okay.

43
00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:00,640
If you have any, please feel free to reach out to me. I am pretty and responsive via email.

44
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,280
So. Please don't hesitate.

45
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,659
Now I want to hear I think about your break. Okay.

46
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:16,060
So please go around the room. I think everyone knows each other, so I guess there's no new faces.

47
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,160
And tell me one of these things. You don't have to choose all of them, but if you want to, you can.

48
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:30,060
Um, we can start over here. Um.

49
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,550
I didn't see much of a price, but I saw the new Avatar movies.

50
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:48,910
I mean, those are very cool. For Q thing, my son, we got a John Deere tractor with an electric one for Christmas,

51
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:55,840
and he's just been ripping that thing around so those things can get speedy.

52
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,720
My nephew is the to keep.

53
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,930
Was this whole thing that they don't want to jump on some books.

54
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:15,920
It's very nice, but what's the best stuff? Oh, I like tomorrow the better.

55
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,350
Who is that? That's how I am. What's her name?

56
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,910
Troy. Is it okay?

57
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:32,860
It's good. I would say the most memorable thing is we went and watched the cherry drops in a and Traverse City.

58
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,940
I didn't know that was the thing that everyone kind of just answered her.

59
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,690
It was kind of funny. Oh, that's so funny. All right.

60
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:49,540
There's something new every day. Well, I guess the most exciting thing is Western walking.

61
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,770
That's very exciting. Yes. That's the highlight.

62
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,200
That's great. I to would our.

63
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,480
I spend a lot of time in high school.

64
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,540
Oh, gosh. Wow. That's very exciting.

65
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,700
Um, I didn't do much stuff, but I would like to California to visit my friends.

66
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,980
When I was in undergrad and then I was. I went to my aunt's house to spend the Christmas pretty rough.

67
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:26,489
Well, that's good. Was number one thing was probably driving home was like 16 hours.

68
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,820
So that was a lot but it was good because spend like a little over a week at home visiting a lot of families.

69
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,940
So I was home. Oh yeah, that would make sense.

70
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:45,420
Most cute thing was I also spent time with my nephew, six months old, and he was just crying for the first time.

71
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:50,400
And it's really funny to watch babies cry because they don't know how to get.

72
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,100
And the most memorable thing is probably having to take my pets.

73
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,940
I know it's harder. Oh, that doesn't sound fun.

74
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,330
I drove my cat and dog across country, and it was a whole.

75
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:21,740
And we are perhaps hoping this kind of fun reignites the whole thing.

76
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:26,180
I was having a few moments with and he's nine months old,

77
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:33,980
so we decided to give him a moment to try and sort of like making a face really like the way.

78
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:39,970
Yeah, my my little middle nephew loved lemon for years.

79
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,220
It was the weirdest thing. We thought he was a freak of nature.

80
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:50,990
He does not like power. It's so funny how fast they ask, like the preferences, of course, have.

81
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,990
One of the most. That's what I was like.

82
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:06,600
Oh, that's so nice. My most memorable thing was probably walking my brother's dog during the quarter pre situation.

83
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:14,279
I know how this goes and we got to make a lot of snow.

84
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,390
So it was really just kind of. Where are you?

85
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,870
Just like on the west side of the state. Oh, this is so annoying.

86
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:29,630
I have an uncle who lives in Hamburg, New York. So he's been through, like this seven feet of snow.

87
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,020
Then the ice storm is just not my place to be.

88
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:40,190
Thanks for sharing, all. I'm going to dive now into our first topic, which is the elevator pitch.

89
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:47,390
So I just wanted to start off with, generally speaking, what do you think of when you think of elevator pitch?

90
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:53,300
Some people call it an elevator speech. I'm using those terms as a gateway in this present class.

91
00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:02,340
I guess, out there. It's basically just a very short thing of why you should hire and why you should have done this

92
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:08,260
idea or a short thing of convincing and arguments that you want to convince something else.

93
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:15,900
Okay. Sometimes your goals for your goals are so just like sharing information.

94
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,100
What is it? Not at all. Rambling.

95
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,540
Rambling longer than an elevator ride.

96
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:38,610
Right? So it's really important because the elevator pitch actually changes depending on who you want to convey and what you want to convey.

97
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,190
So in this course, we're going to be talking about elevator pitches for a number of different purposes.

98
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:50,760
First of all, an elevator pitch as we're going to design it for this assignment is going to help you with several things.

99
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:57,540
First, it's going to help you prepare for that first interview question what are you about or who are you?

100
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,620
Tell me about yourself, etc. That's the worst question.

101
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:07,710
But having an elevator pitch prepared is a really good starting place to go from for that question.

102
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:15,659
The second thing that the elevator pitch assignment is going to prepare you for is really thinking about your story and

103
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:24,149
your narrative and how you're using this internship experience to fulfill not only the specific seafront competencies,

104
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:32,870
but your goals in this degree program. So like I said, it could answer the question about tell me yourself.

105
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:41,240
It might. So the specific person be more of a summary of your cover letter resume if you're maybe using it to craft your interview responses.

106
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,840
If you go to a conference and you're presenting at a conference,

107
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:52,310
it could be more about just connecting with new people and finding someone who can share and learn and grow in the future.

108
00:11:52,850 --> 00:12:02,150
Or, as was mentioned, it can be expressed expressing what you're looking for in your career, what are your goals, etc.

109
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:11,169
So I think the elevator pitches are really key because and this whole thing that we're going to be diving into,

110
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,030
especially when we're talking about networking,

111
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:21,560
are really important because it kind of gives the basics of like what you want and what you are as a professional.

112
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:27,730
And so it gives you a really good opportunity to grow your network and make a good impression on someone.

113
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,720
Although times elevator pitches at the end of the pitch, you can also like if you're not in a job interview,

114
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,360
but instead just like meeting someone at a conference or something your elevator pitch might be with like.

115
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:47,410
Hi, I'm Rebecca. I'm a postdoc at UMass, and I'm looking for an opportunity in x, y, z things.

116
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:59,080
So there could be room there. In fact, I will tell you from personal experience that I have used my elevator pitch to get me my present job.

117
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,730
So they do work and they are effective and they are annoying too, right?

118
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:13,270
Which is what I'm going to be writing them together here. So they should really cover up key specific areas.

119
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,870
And I kind of think of elevator pitches as being two different things.

120
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:24,760
One is this like really short 32nd pitch, like you only have just like a really brief introduction to who you are.

121
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:33,489
And the other version of that elevator pitch is like a two minute long pitch where you go into a little bit more detail about who you are,

122
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,580
where you're coming from, and where you want to go.

123
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,950
You're going to be writing both of those versions for this class.

124
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,130
Don't worry. That's like, seriously, I think less than 300 words total.

125
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,780
So it's not a big lift.

126
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:57,090
But it is important for thinking about your experience, your goals, why you want to go where you are and how you're looking to go there.

127
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:06,270
From Ross. The questions that they suggest thinking about before you go into your elevator pitch.

128
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,430
Start with what you want to be when you grow up. Why do you want to be in this field?

129
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,570
Why should we hire you or why are you a compelling candidate?

130
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,190
Why do I want to get to know you more? Why do I want you in my network?

131
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:30,330
How are you qualified for the position? And then you can think about your skills versus your experience and how all those tie in together.

132
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:37,290
And then finally, in the end, you want to bring it all together and tell your audience why you're the perfect fit for this job,

133
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,540
or why you would be a great asset to a similar position in the future.

134
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,070
All of these things, right? So an example.

135
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:54,050
This is me. I am a current postdoc at the University of Michigan Talks and Avid,

136
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:59,840
and I'm excited about difficult problems and actionable solutions in environmental health.

137
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,270
I'm interested in a fellowship at Trueplay that allows me to expand my skills in a

138
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:09,590
program manager and science education for dispersed groups of children and adults.

139
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,790
Folks. This is all real. I'll be interviewing alongside of you this semester.

140
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,570
I have a strong background in science, communication skills.

141
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,510
Love teaching things that get students excited.

142
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm also an excellent writer and have great research skills with multitasking experience for switching between multiple projects.

143
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:39,060
I think I would make a great fit at this triplet fellowship because of my all of these things put together, etc. So.

144
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:48,670
You're going to try it briefly with each other. And I'm going to give you an exercise called Half-Life that.

145
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:58,490
Has anyone heard of Half-Life as an exercise? We all in the health community know they stole once again.

146
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,460
Yeah. Oh, okay. Did you do it for your elevator pitches?

147
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,449
Okay, we're we're doing have four elevator pitches.

148
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:15,390
So for anyone who's not familiar with Half-Life, I'm going to give each person one minute to deliver their elevator pitch to their partner.

149
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:21,830
We'll switch. Each person gets one minute. Then we're going to have live it.

150
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,540
And each person will get 30 seconds. So you have to choose your main message.

151
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:34,090
This is important because like I was saying in your interview, elevator pitch, you're going to have more time to have more detail.

152
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,150
You're going to go on.

153
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:41,990
You're going to show maybe a little bit more attention to the certain skills that are relevant to that interview elevator pitch.

154
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,780
But if you're just networking and running into someone, maybe even a colleague at your internship over the summer,

155
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,050
you're going to have this 32nd elevator pitch or maybe even less.

156
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:57,989
So we'll go back and forth for 30 seconds. And then we'll have left it again and go to 15 seconds and then we're going

157
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,740
to just talk about how all of those things went and why they went that way.

158
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:09,540
So everyone grab a partner. I'm going to grab a timer and leave.

159
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,760
Oh. So what happened?

160
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:22,280
That was. That was a landmark. Thank you.

161
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,900
Okay, so everyone's going to start with one minute, so pick which partner is going first.

162
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:37,170
Do you need a partner? Yes, I will be. You can go first.

163
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,620
Okay. Okay. So, ready, set.

164
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:58,580
Go. I know, I know.

165
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:16,160
I just tried to turn that by the end of my opening stages, and I was just talking about this.

166
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:27,520
I'm sorry.

167
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,170
In this story.

168
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:46,470
And congratulations on that.

169
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:54,990
I will turn that down and we will sit this.

170
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:05,000
I know you're the type of. So, partner B, you're ready to do your elevator pitch.

171
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,960
Turn and go. Hello?

172
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:16,680
I am. I am training at the university in Turtle Island.

173
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,250
My research policy.

174
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:27,620
And that's really, really.

175
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,870
Mostly, I think that's really interesting. Large data sets.

176
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:47,060
But I guess they shouldn't really about exactly what they're really interested in.

177
00:19:48,590 --> 00:20:08,250
Right. So that same question I'm trying to say that I'm really interested in this idea that she tried it.

178
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,060
All right. That's our timer. I was a little to find that time.

179
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:24,380
I hear you. What? You're about to reset.

180
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:35,360
Okay. We're going back to the first partner. And the first partner is now going to have not one minute, but 30 seconds to go.

181
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,810
So mentally prepare yourself for a second.

182
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:46,640
Think about how long you were saying what you need to maybe focus on to get to that 30 seconds sweet spot of an elevator pitch and go from there.

183
00:20:47,180 --> 00:21:08,290
Ready, set, go. And I walked into my room and I had a tremendous concern to inspire.

184
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,900
And that's why I love the fact that it didn't work.

185
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:20,640
It was extremely violent.

186
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,849
All right, Turner, be get ready. And.

187
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:41,059
Yeah, hi. I'm not concerned about the environmental hazards that really you know,

188
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:56,600
I was working on all those things that I've had with my neighbors to interject more science in more than just North America as well.

189
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,510
So I think it's great.

190
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:14,150
All right. I'm such an out of that for you and every sense of yourself.

191
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:20,690
Potentially the hardest one or maybe the easiest one, depending on your your speaking style.

192
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:26,770
15 seconds. So, back to partner. Hey. Ready, set, go.

193
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:39,390
I answers here. I mean, I still have nightmares.

194
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,490
I think he's like, Oh, okay.

195
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:52,370
Partner B. And go.

196
00:22:53,420 --> 00:23:00,970
Hi. I'm afraid I really felt ashamed.

197
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:11,000
There was a background in public health research as well as environmental health.

198
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,940
Okay. Great job, everyone. Thanks for participating.

199
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:22,170
So just in general. What did you all feel about that exercise?

200
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,630
How was it? Did it get easier? Harder. Give me some give me some words that are floating around.

201
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:38,950
What would be got easier over time? Okay. Well, because it wasn't set in a couple of hours, I figure, like I wanted to say.

202
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,350
That's great. So practice does make it easier.

203
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,060
That's great. We're going to be doing practice interviews for this particular reason.

204
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:57,650
Any other thoughts? What was the best time?

205
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,640
30/32 sees nods.

206
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:09,400
Anyone say a minute or 15? I'm super worried.

207
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,720
I think the minute was my best one. It's about I need to practice my 32nd one.

208
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:22,730
I feel like if you were actually having a confrontation, you might be able to get all the information 60 seconds after they ask more questions or.

209
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:33,650
That's kind of like 70 seconds away from where you are.

210
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:41,690
Did you all feel like you were able to put enough of yourself in the 30 seconds to get a good concept of who you are to that other person?

211
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:52,580
So I don't care if anyone actually answers that question, but that's something that you should really,

212
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:57,290
really think about as your craft, your 32nd written elevator pitch.

213
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:05,120
Because what you really want to deliver to that person is the essence of what is most important to you.

214
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:18,890
So I'm going to go into some just the basics of your assignment first, and then we'll go back to that.

215
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:27,019
So this class, like I said, we're going to be writing a two minute elevator pitch and a 32nd elevator pitch.

216
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,179
So this will be on the same assignment submission. So please just write them in one document.

217
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,750
That's fine.

218
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:44,600
So there are differences in these two different pitches that you have to carefully think about when you're structuring these and writing these.

219
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,400
The 32nd pitch is going to be 80 to 90 words. So super short.

220
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:59,120
Was it Twitter? Any words? No. These characters at first, and it'll cover your identity.

221
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:07,970
Just a very brief background of who you are and what you're interested in or your career.

222
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:15,710
Is that specific to someone who you run into and you're just going to start networking with me?

223
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,530
Maybe you're talking to them at a conference.

224
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:25,190
Maybe you attend one of these faculty talks that are coming up in our department and you're like, Oh my gosh, this research so cool.

225
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:36,440
I have to go talk to this person right now. And you're trying to establish grounds to potentially ask for an interim enter informational interview.

226
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,720
There we go in the future.

227
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:47,200
All of that should be like in your 80 to 90 words so you can see how brief that would get with the 32nd ones you just delivered.

228
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,749
And you may or may not want to include some of the same details that you will have in your two minute version.

229
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:58,270
Right. So your two minute version is 250 to 300 words.

230
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:08,200
It covers your identity background, why you were there and what your career goals are and how that internship relates.

231
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,940
So this is the thing that you're really structuring for your answer.

232
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:20,230
Tell me about yourself. So this all is going to link together.

233
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,000
Just going back to our syllabus here because.

234
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,079
On our syllabus.

235
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:36,980
Like I said, next week or next time we meet, which is in two weeks, we will be talking about interviews and how to answer the questions.

236
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:41,670
So you guys are going to be a step ahead because you all are already thinking about that.

237
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:51,219
Tell me about yourself. Question. Then when you come in and do your practice interviews, you maybe have already written your elevator pitch.

238
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:58,690
Tell me about yourself. So then you can use it in your practice interview and hopefully you get some trial runs

239
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:04,030
with how that goes before you have to actually interview for your internship later on.

240
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:09,310
Again, when we're talking about networking, that's when our 32nd elevator pitch is going to come back.

241
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:18,370
View So that is all there. The elevator pitches are not due until February 13th, so you do have some time.

242
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:25,629
You don't have to do it. Before your interview, I wanted to give you guys enough time where it's not like a stressor for you to do this,

243
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:31,150
but at the same time, it would maybe really help you to start to address that both for your practice interview.

244
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:42,310
So. When you're thinking about your specific elevator pitch,

245
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:49,120
there's a couple of different questions you can continue to ask yourself that will help elevate it even more.

246
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:55,040
First of all. What is your hook and why should your listener care?

247
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,030
Now I know me and my partner.

248
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:04,850
We started off by just saying like, Hi, I'm Rebecca Petroff and I'm a postdoc with the University of Michigan.

249
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:13,430
That's fine. It tells the audience who I know, but it doesn't really tell them why they should care.

250
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,510
So maybe if I were to be writing my elevator pitch alongside you all,

251
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:26,000
I would be thinking about how I can better help my audience and be like, Ooh, I want to hear what this person has to say.

252
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:32,240
And not just like, oh, Greg, another post up. Yeah. No one cares about them anyway.

253
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:44,200
No. What? And this will really, really help you dive to the core of what you're interested in passing to your audience.

254
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:57,460
The other question that you want to be thinking about are what is the problem or goals that you're looking to address with your elevator pitch?

255
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:02,170
So like I said, for the 32nd one, it could be more related to networking.

256
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,339
Whereas the two minute one is going to be trying to get an internship.

257
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:15,910
Right? So those are going to look very different as far as the information you're including and what you're seeking from that interaction.

258
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:26,200
You want to also think about what is your unique contribution and what makes you specifically exciting?

259
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:32,890
You all have a unique background and a variety of different layers that go into who you are as a person.

260
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:42,090
I saw all your resumes. You have really cool experiences that will all come together to create your unique perspective, right?

261
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,780
As a professional, as a person in the world, etc. That's important.

262
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:54,009
And you can think about how you are special and put it into your own elevator pitch to

263
00:30:54,010 --> 00:31:00,850
make you more enticing as a candidate or as just getting to know someone professionally.

264
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:07,210
Right? Finally think about your closing very carefully.

265
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:12,399
You don't necessarily always want to close with an ask, but you might be.

266
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:18,880
Oh, can you tell me more about this thing that you just talked about or I want to hear about your position.

267
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:23,080
It doesn't necessarily have to be like, I am looking for a job.

268
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:32,559
I am seeking something specific. It could just be more general and more wayfinding to each of that really matters as you're talking about

269
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:38,020
your elevator pitch and delivering it to a number of different people throughout the professional world.

270
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:48,200
So I think. Uh.

271
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:56,550
Oh, yes. The last thing that I wanted to share with you is.

272
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:02,860
We go to canvas and.

273
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,500
Oh, this looks so funny.

274
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:15,010
It really changed this influx from, like, a student assignment through this.

275
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:30,780
I have an Excel Google worksheet somewhere that I will just pull up on my Google of all of your.

276
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:37,350
Internships that you were proposing from last year.

277
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:52,110
And so what I want everyone to do is to go into the those and make sure that this

278
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:57,360
is still I'll make sure that this link is very visible and I'll post it for you.

279
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:03,510
These were your ideal internships. I think this person dropped a glass because they were not here last year.

280
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,540
That you submitted. I know some of you have already gotten internships.

281
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:17,120
So you can feel free to either change your ideal internship if you think you have a different idea.

282
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:25,160
Now that you've had a little bit exposure to different coursework or update your final internship and have the final internship link,

283
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:31,190
that'll help me better guide you when I'm giving you feedback on that elevator pitch.

284
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:38,690
Right. So if you really want to try to interview for this one internship and it's really specific,

285
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,800
I can try to help craft your elevator pitch as strongly as possible.

286
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:49,580
If you already have an internship, I can try to help craft your elevator pitch so you're able to quickly connect

287
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:55,280
with new people at your workplace over the summer so you don't have to do this.

288
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:03,710
It's just there for you. And like I said, I'll put it somewhere very obvious and tell you where it is.

289
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:10,100
As soon as I do that, because I apparently haven't done that before the end of the day today.

290
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:21,200
The last thing that I wanted to show you is I put a lot of speech resources on our course this year.

291
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:33,140
So the speech career services has a huge Google drive that you all should have access to or students with like tons of historical documents,

292
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,309
webinars, things that they put on over the over the years.

293
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:42,860
And I've pulled some of the most relevant to the topics that we're talking about and put it on here.

294
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:50,180
So we do have this resource as well to help you hone in on the elevator pitch.

295
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,710
So there's some ways of framing them. Yeah.

296
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:59,000
So I used to work at a building hope neighborhood leadership development.

297
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:05,210
Amazing. I have work sheets that I can share with everyone from the muse.

298
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:10,670
Is it from them? You know, it's my background. Oh, that's great.

299
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,509
Sure. Yeah. Feel free. If you send it to me.

300
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:23,920
I can put it on the actual courses, send it to me today because I, my alumni remember how they used to in informational interviews or in person.

301
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:28,290
Oh, that's great. Looking at all the stuff earlier today.

302
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,800
That's amazing. Timely as well.

303
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:37,920
Okay. Oh, wow. Okay. I will put that on there and everyone can review at the time.

304
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:44,630
There are other resources online. Sometimes if you Google elevator pitch, you get more like super business.

305
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,230
You wonder like pitching you their business ideas, which is obviously not what this is.

306
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:54,630
So just fair warning, if you're Googling things, it could look a little funky.

307
00:35:54,660 --> 00:36:01,410
So that's why I'm trying to put things that are more directly related to like an elevator speech they call it sometimes.

308
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:09,210
So. That is all I have for today.

309
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,960
We're going to keep it nice and short and sweet. I want to remind people to just like review the canvass website.

310
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:22,530
I went over the course syllabus super fast, but you all are graduate students, so you know what the syllabus is.

311
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,389
I trust that you can review it and come to me with any questions you have.

312
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:31,020
Please contact me and I'm happy to clarify anything.

313
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:40,710
But in the meantime, does anyone have any questions on writing the elevator pitches or any of the course content that we covered today?

314
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:50,180
But I just noticed that the hyperlinked for your e-mail address on the site goes to Tim Robbins book.

315
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,640
Oh, that's a fun one we're trying to like.

316
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:59,630
Thank you. That is that is a weird hang up.

317
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,120
Hang over from last last year. All right.

318
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:09,800
That's I'm here for you. Okay.

319
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:15,060
Well, no one has any questions. I invite you to have a wonderful two weeks.

320
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,530
Go to some of the Martin Luther King events next week. They're awesome.

321
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:23,880
And then I'll see you in two weeks for informational interviews.

322
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:27,690
Betty, thank you.

323
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,970
Take the call or.
