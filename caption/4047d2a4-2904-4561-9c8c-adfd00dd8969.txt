1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,184
Are all closed-ended questions bad?

2
00:00:11,184 --> 00:00:15,188
Is there ever a time when you wanna ask you closed-ended question?

3
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:18,419
Well, that's what we're gonna talk about today.

4
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:22,759
We're gonna define for you three types of closed-ended questions nasty,

5
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:24,940
preferred, and benign.

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,731
And we'll give you some probes you can use when your initial response might be yes,

7
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:34,640
no from a patient, how to elicit additional information.

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,980
So let's start with this closed-ended typology.

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,540
There are three types of closed-ended questions, nasty, preferred and benign.

10
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,440
Let's start with the nasty type.

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:53,340
Take a look at some of these, read them on your own.

12
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,740
I hope you can see how these can be offensive off putting judgmental.

13
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,222
It's pretty clear these are the types of questions we're not gonna wanna

14
00:01:01,222 --> 00:01:03,240
ask very much.

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,569
Are you finally ready to quit?

16
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,267
I hope you can feel the pressure behind that question

17
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:11,340
that's actually almost advice or judgment than a question.

18
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,311
Do you watch your salt intake carefully?

19
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:17,940
Again, you can feel the sort of creepy nature to that type of question.

20
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,940
However, there's a time and place where some closed-ended questions.

21
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,269
All of these questions on the screen are not just closed-ended but

22
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:28,940
they're closed and it preferred.

23
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,740
What we mean is, you really can't improve on them by making them open ended.

24
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,940
Let's look at one example.

25
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,740
Did you take out the garbage this morning?

26
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,740
Try and make that open ended, it's really hard to do.

27
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,062
Do you have a driver's license with you?

28
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:48,090
Now, you can know Billy try to make those open ended.

29
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,240
What if anything did you do with the green garbage men this morning?

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,333
What is the location of that license that allows you to drive in the state of

31
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,001
Michigan?

32
00:01:57,001 --> 00:02:01,540
Sure, you could technically make them open ended but you're not improving it.

33
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,837
These types of closed, preferred are for

34
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:06,801
a very narrow sliver of behavior change counseling.

35
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:11,169
It's for past binary events, something that's already happened, and

36
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:13,840
we're only asking about one event.

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,270
So we wouldn't ask, do you always take out the garbage?

38
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,840
That's not a binary phenomenon, that's much more gray.

39
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,540
But did you take out the garbage this morning is a binary event.

40
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,640
Same with did you vote in last year's election?

41
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,940
That's different than saying, do you vote?

42
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,337
Do you vote is not binary because you might vote some years maybe only in

43
00:02:35,337 --> 00:02:37,370
presidential elections, it's great.

44
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,593
But did you vote in last year's presidential election is a single

45
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,040
binary event.

46
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:49,032
So close preferred is defined as enquiring about a single binary event,

47
00:02:49,032 --> 00:02:55,040
closed actually preferred in these situations.

48
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,440
Now let's talk about the third category, but not closed-ended.

49
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:05,540
Take a look at these, they're technically closed-ended.

50
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:11,016
However, they function as open ended, as long as you ask in an empathetic way,

51
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:16,200
these questions although technically closed will not need to be changed.

52
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,660
For example, are things still difficult at home?

53
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,040
Are you still having problems with?

54
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,440
Did that help at all?

55
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,461
Yes, these are structured to get a yes, no answer, but

56
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:30,540
in our experience they don't do that, they get the full story.

57
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,381
So yes, you can make these open ended.

58
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:35,540
How if at all have things changed in the past week?

59
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,860
How if at all did this help?

60
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,572
Sure, absolutely.

61
00:03:37,572 --> 00:03:40,298
If you wanna ask an open ended, that's great, but you don't have to,

62
00:03:40,298 --> 00:03:42,264
these closed-ended versions will get you there.

63
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:45,762
Now finally, let's say you ask a question,

64
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:49,536
be it a closed question or even an open question,

65
00:03:49,536 --> 00:03:54,540
and all you get from the patient is yeah, or no ,yes or no.

66
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,574
These eight probes on the screen can help you drill down and

67
00:03:58,574 --> 00:04:00,570
pull out more information.

68
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,601
Why do you say that?

69
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:02,211
In what ways?

70
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:06,148
Tell me more about that, and this will help expand the story from yes,

71
00:04:06,148 --> 00:04:09,440
no into the full narrative.

72
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,596
So today, we have defined for you the three types of closed-ended questions, and

73
00:04:14,596 --> 00:04:19,458
provided a series of probes you can use when the initial response might be yes or

74
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:23,430
no, but you want more information.
