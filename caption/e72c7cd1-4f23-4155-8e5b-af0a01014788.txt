1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,860
20 minutes will do the critical reflection circle.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,100
So it'll it'll vary sometimes either 20 or 30 minutes a figure for the first time we'll do 20.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,650
That way, if you're incredibly uncomfortable, it'll be over with at 20 minutes.

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,020
But I don't think we will probably just throw that out there.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:45,360
So we were just about finished with the concert and we're talking about the health problem analysis, which we now want to put together.

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,510
All right. So this is where we ended. We just went through this example.

7
00:00:51,510 --> 00:01:03,090
I should just like power through the last slide, but this is another one to just give you an example of how this can be useful.

8
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,420
So with this example, it's looking at the health problem. Our health issue is diabetes.

9
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,320
So again, like risk factors. So some things like genetics, you can't do a lot.

10
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,150
Now there are some genetic counseling that's going on and things like that.

11
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:29,370
I get a little freaked out by that. It's just not genetic counseling, but potential genetic engineering and genetic manipulation.

12
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:42,510
I'm not reducing anyone's for a study that was trying to find the genetic component component related to risk behavior for HIV,

13
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,810
which I think we'll do hopefully know a little bit about.

14
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:54,580
It's like it's so complex, you can't really tie down to a genetic thing and you're worried sometimes that you're talking about that.

15
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:02,700
They're talking about, you know, lots of ways to further racism and xenophobia and lots of isms anyway.

16
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,040
So with things like that, you typically in an analysis like that, you stop that because you're not really going to do much.

17
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,510
But here it has things like stress and then leads to some of the indirect contributing

18
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,460
factors or things that can lead to stress and then that indirect injury pattern.

19
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:30,120
One thing you'll see in this is that some items can be both a direct and indirect cause of poverty can be both a direct factor,

20
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,690
a direct injury, but then also an indirect factor.

21
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:43,680
And some of those you know, some of the again, the isms could probably be an indirect contributing factor for most of these.

22
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:51,000
So when you're creating this framework and looking at doing the Health Problem Analysis worksheet,

23
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:59,570
it's always good to think about what it is that can be addressed.

24
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,220
So in this example, in green, they have things that says green if addressable, bold and key.

25
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:16,880
So with this, they determine from this analysis that the things that they can do are related to providing support,

26
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,900
access to fresh fruits and vegetables, education and social support.

27
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,730
So then when you're designing your program, you would then focus on those.

28
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,170
Now, this is a process that I do a lot with communities,

29
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,360
as opposed to just the people in public health sitting around a table and thinking, you know, what do people need?

30
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:43,530
So I said, I sit down with communities and we usually do it through a much more interactive process,

31
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:52,679
like Post-it notes and poster paper and things like that. But it is a really nice way to get community input into what they see the issues are and

32
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,940
what they see are the direct and indirect contributing factors and also protective factors.

33
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,770
So does this look like it could be useful? No.

34
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,799
Easy to say no or. I don't really know. I really don't. But yeah.

35
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,270
But if you if you're someone who you think you might do public health practice in the future, you know,

36
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:26,290
consider thinking about this also when when you write your letter on the final project discusses a proposal to a health department to design,

37
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:32,290
develop and implement a health promotion program or campaign.

38
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,480
And so this is something you might want to portray in that.

39
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,210
And I think it's just a useful tool to be thinking about when you're looking at public health approaches.

40
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,710
Right. I just want to remind folks know laptops.

41
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,980
I know some people talk about tablets that they need to take notes.

42
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,000
That's totally cool. But it's also a reminder out.

43
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:03,550
All right. So today we're going to talk a little bit into more depth on power and privilege.

44
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:18,290
I can figure out how to make this thing work. And I would like to have at the beginning of the slides different quote.

45
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:25,810
So this one is the ultimate tragedy, is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people, but the silence over that by the good people.

46
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,300
And it's compromising. Look, Martin Luther King Jr.

47
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:39,370
And I think the thing I like about that is that, you know, a big part of what we do in public health should be taking action,

48
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,710
not just observing and noticing, but actually doing something about it.

49
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,110
And I think in different parts of public health,

50
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:58,030
there's much more of a focus on just understanding and relationships are looking for health inequities and not so much the action.

51
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:06,040
But I think if you're coming from more of a social justice lens, the action is something that is really needed.

52
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:13,360
And even if you're doing an epidemiological analysis of something and you find that health inequities exist,

53
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:20,109
you can still do something with that by publicizing that and not just in peer reviewed journals,

54
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:29,890
but potentially going to the media or creating informational campaigns so that people are aware of the differences that do exist.

55
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,680
Power. So what is power? Big question.

56
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,870
What is power? What do you think? With the right stuff and you start.

57
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,020
Yeah. Isabella, is it? You know, you're good.

58
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:55,440
I know in our readings, I've talked a lot about, like, the difference between power over someone or a group of people in power to do something.

59
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,750
Mm hmm. Do you want to talk about the difference? The main difference from what I remember.

60
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,040
Yeah. No. And give it a shot. If someone wants to jump in and say you, that's fine.

61
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,649
Yeah. Yeah, I know there was a lot of theory about it.

62
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:14,910
And, like, the power over thing, I think had a lot to do with, like, kind of a patriarchal idea of like using power, like, to kind of, like,

63
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:20,430
dominate over a group of people and like, we're like power to was kind of like a power,

64
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,260
you know, to do an action or maybe power to make change, stuff like that. So part of the job.

65
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:31,500
What else? What else is power? Because you hear this word a lot in public health, I think in other areas too.

66
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,720
But we often don't really take the time to really critique it and think about it really.

67
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,390
Which is is so much easier with your name on the day.

68
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:45,060
Yeah, I'm taking a sociology class. We talk a lot about power in like being the person who can make the rules.

69
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,280
So any power has to do a lot with, like, control and, like, being in charge of creating norms.

70
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:58,840
Right. And so, you know, we've got some already anxiety about how we talk about privilege.

71
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:05,940
You're talking a lot about power. Right. And that and so the people that set the norms and then create who deviate from the norms,

72
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,530
that's a lot of power if you think about it, you know, because norms dictates so much.

73
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,950
So if you're the one that gets to say, well, this is what's normal, this was not normal.

74
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,400
Like, for instance, in the mental health community,

75
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:23,729
we have the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the ICD nine

76
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:29,010
or ICD ten that determines what the criteria are for mental health conditions.

77
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:35,730
That is something that dictates what is normal and what is not normal.

78
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,370
What is the norm, what is not the norm in terms of mental health issues?

79
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:47,370
And if you look across the years, certain disorders have are no longer disorders and other things that weren't disorders are now disorders.

80
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:56,069
So that's a really clear example about the people that are in leadership positions can determine what a whole culture,

81
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,160
community society thinks is normal in terms of mental health. Yeah.

82
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:03,780
So I just want to go off a little bit of what is you said about power to I

83
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,080
also think about the power to make your own decisions and how about yourself?

84
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,950
Okay. Excellent. Oh, yeah.

85
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,180
Because I honestly think you're, like dictatorship. Mm hmm.

86
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:23,910
I think of, like, you know, political powers that weren't necessarily good for our world and just had the ability to do such.

87
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,340
Like, so much damage. So.

88
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:33,760
Yeah, that's right. Okay. Yeah. That connects, too, to what Amelia was saying in terms of, like, leadership.

89
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,590
Right. And I think that, you know, dictators are an extreme form of that.

90
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,950
But if you look at the power that dictators have.

91
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,830
That's a really good point. You know, look at what's happening with, you know, Ukraine and Russia right now.

92
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:58,239
I mean, that is I just heard on NPR this morning they're talking about the I think the U.N. had done an analysis to look at the

93
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:07,480
past five years and that the world as a whole is actually going backwards and forwards in terms of like life expectancy,

94
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,560
income, mental health, I mean, a whole range of different factors.

95
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:17,349
And, you know, the war in Ukraine was one of the factors I talked about, you know,

96
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:24,370
and if you think about the power that that one well, it's one person, but there's other people obviously involved.

97
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:31,360
But I do think that dictators do wield a lot of power and that can impact health in so many different ways.

98
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,100
What else do you think about when you think about power? Yeah, really?

99
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:43,510
I think it's pretty much like having an influence or change the way people think.

100
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,870
Think that's good. Yeah.

101
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,250
And you know, if you think about like teachers, teachers are going can have a lot of power in that respect, right?

102
00:10:51,280 --> 00:11:00,340
I mean, you know, and I felt like always kills me in this country that we pay so little attention and money for primary school teachers.

103
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,440
Those are the most formative years.

104
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:09,820
You know, we have professional teachers that are like, you know, really napping with people's brains and minds and ideas that could be catastrophic.

105
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:19,149
So, yeah, I think that made me think of like knowledge and what people know give them power.

106
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:23,060
But also, like, I've had dictators, like, controlling how much people know.

107
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:31,470
Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's, you know, and and if some of you have gotten into prayer and again, I know it's it's challenging at times.

108
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,560
Some may have not.

109
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:40,870
But I mean, that was a big part of, you know, what was happening in Brazil, where the people and the formula is, is that they couldn't read.

110
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,790
And so the access to knowledge was was not there.

111
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:51,190
And that's why, you know, people often use the phrase knowledge is power.

112
00:11:51,970 --> 00:12:01,330
And you can totally see that, you know, if you were restricting what people learn, then you are in power and you're controlling that.

113
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,360
So and you know, this is happening in the US today.

114
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:15,430
Look at what's happening in Florida with restrictions around talking about sexuality, gender restrictions on critical race theory.

115
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:23,860
You know, all of that is actions taken by people in power to control other people.

116
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:30,610
And I because if we're not talking, we talk about this a lot, since we're not talking about race early on then,

117
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:37,990
especially people on privileged positions may be doing things that are oppressive and not really

118
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,880
have full insight into what they're doing because they haven't learned anything other than that,

119
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:50,200
you know? So if you take a kid and you tell them certain things and they always, always, always, like when I showed you the,

120
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:59,219
you know, the book that was read and you all like paused for a minute, you didn't have to really process that.

121
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:07,600
That's just, you know, a color because you're taught that when we restrict knowledge,

122
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:14,200
people only learn a certain way of looking at things, you know, even I mean, the U.S. is horrible at this.

123
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,799
I mean, we're not the only country. But, you know, look at history books.

124
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,160
I mean, I think back to like when I was in school and it's really scary.

125
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,110
I, you know, we didn't talk about anything other than white folks like they did everything.

126
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,569
You know, they invented everything. They ran everything.

127
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:36,129
And, you know, you. Yeah. Because back then we didn't even have Black History Month.

128
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:42,130
We didn't have cultural awareness. I mean, this is in the sixties and the early seventies.

129
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:53,710
So, you know, things were written in a way and knowledge was produced in a way to erase the lives of many people.

130
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:05,860
And also, like gay folks, we didn't hear about, you know, anything about any LGBT people in history or people with disabilities or anything else.

131
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:12,120
What else? Yeah. Yeah. I was going to add on to your point, because I remember last question.

132
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:18,310
We talk about like what things can we do to change or like implement change so that people don't grow up with this sort of like ignorance.

133
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,420
So I think like maybe in our history classes that we take,

134
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:26,170
like whether it be in middle school or high school, sort of understanding history from like other.

135
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:32,920
Kind of implementing more of a diverse array of historical context that we get.

136
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,290
Like I think at least from what I would consider like in my high school, for example,

137
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,909
I was lucky enough to be able to get that different perspective, but I also went to an Ivy school.

138
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:49,270
So that's different, right? Exactly. Yeah. My middle school, on the other hand, like it it's just like, you know, the traditional history.

139
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,060
But I think it'd be cool to branch out and learn other perspectives.

140
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,030
Like maybe for example, I think one thing like the first university that was ever made was by a muslim woman.

141
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,359
You know, people say that like Muslim women are oppressed. Right.

142
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,610
Exactly. Speaking that and just kind of broadening our historical context.

143
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:16,420
Yeah. Yeah. No, I totally agree. And you know, if you think back to think back, it was only a couple of days ago.

144
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,790
But the health problem analysis, you know, doing things like that can be a public health intervention.

145
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:33,190
So educating people about accurate historical knowledge can then lead to more diverse perspectives, more open perspectives,

146
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,620
which then can lead to less oppression and racism, which can lead to easier access to,

147
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,650
you know, all those things could go down to actually impacting health.

148
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,270
So I really encourage you to think more broadly about public health.

149
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,840
And public health interventions are not just teaching people about their health,

150
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:56,890
but sometimes it's about looking at the precursors and then trying to change those.

151
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,590
Now, it may take a long time before you see that change.

152
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:07,090
So this may be five, ten years down the line or even more, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try and do that.

153
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:12,910
What else about power? Anyone else have any definitions about what power is?

154
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,660
I mean, people have talked about power and their public health policies before.

155
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,290
Right. What did you talk about?

156
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:29,280
So everyone's always, like, afraid to raise their hand because then they figure, I'm going to have but I'm not going to call anyone.

157
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,610
But if you've talked about it in other public health, like what have you talked about?

158
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,780
Yeah. Like the institutions that hold power.

159
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:47,430
So a lot of these people that we're talking about that have power, they often work for institutions that kind of hold power over them.

160
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,710
So, for example, like health care systems, education system that we were talking about,

161
00:16:53,340 --> 00:17:00,030
based on your identity, if you go into a setting like that, you are bound to have a different experience.

162
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,500
Mm hmm. Yeah, definitely.

163
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:09,540
And to, you know, in again, in the U.S., we often like to think we're so aware and all this stuff, which, you know, that's partially true.

164
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:17,970
But if you look at some of our public health structures and systems like the CDC, the National Institutes of Health,

165
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:25,110
things like that, well, especially the CDC, you know that the person that runs out is a government appointee.

166
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,740
So when a new government comes in, a new person occupies that position.

167
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:37,050
And that can totally shift what that system does.

168
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,010
And think about government. I mean, that's that's power.

169
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:48,300
So if you think about like when Trump was in power, unfortunately, he was putting people in positions that no business being in.

170
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,900
You know, you should not have like an insurance salesman running the CDC or whatever his background was.

171
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:02,190
But having people in those powerful positions can really impact public health.

172
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:09,660
So, for instance, as soon as Trump came into office, within 24 hours,

173
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:18,280
the website for the Office of the National AIDS Policy for the US government was defunct.

174
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:27,660
It was shut down within 24 hours. And that's because it was a it's a very progressive office and deals with a lot of

175
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,520
issues that Trump didn't want to talk about or that he thought were were negative.

176
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:43,260
When George Bush came into office the second George Bush within 24 hours, all mention of condoms were erased from the CDC website.

177
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:53,940
Like every mention of condom was scrubbed within 24 hours, and that's when he implemented abstinence until marriage.

178
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:01,980
Because talking about condoms is talking about premarital sex, which he thought was not appropriate.

179
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,630
And it was also talking about same gender sexuality, which he also thought was not appropriate.

180
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:15,870
So, you know, even though I think sometimes we think our public health structures are looking out for the best in us,

181
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:22,740
they are dictated by the people that are put in those positions of power to run those.

182
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:29,130
And that can shift a lot. I have a good friend who she just retired from the CDC a while ago.

183
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:34,350
She was one of the first black women in her unit to have a leadership position in the CDC.

184
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:44,670
And she used to talk about how election night for her is always the worst night, because depending on who gets into power,

185
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:54,239
she may have to totally change what she does because she did work around HIV or early adolescents and children.

186
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:02,219
So her area is she actually developed the whole area called pre sexual behavior and pre sexual HIV prevention.

187
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:11,310
So getting kids before they started having sex. Her portfolio of work would be shifted.

188
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,840
What she can and can't do what she can and can't say by whoever is put in power.

189
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:23,190
And so during her 30 years of being in the CDC, she talked about, you know, it was like hills and valleys.

190
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,870
Like, sometimes you have really great people in power and she can do amazing work.

191
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,800
And then other times there's not. And it would shut down whole projects had to be suspended or terminated.

192
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,049
What else have we talked about in power in other public health classes? Yeah, and more money.

193
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:47,550
We focus a lot on our, like, historical context, like of policies and laws that were put in place, like redlining or like the Hill.

194
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:55,560
Right. And the ways in which those like kind of reinforced like position wise positions of power in different subgroups of the population.

195
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,970
Yeah, great. So what class was at Public Health 320.

196
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:06,330
History of racism. Oh, cool. Okay. Excellent. That's a good class or anything else.

197
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,270
So aggressive part. What does it feel like when you don't have power?

198
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,820
And this isn't intellectual, this is just human. So what does it feel like when you don't have power?

199
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:26,470
Brianna first and then you ask you don't like you don't have a voice, okay?

200
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:32,909
You feel helpless because you can't really change anything, right? No, not what's what else I can say.

201
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,390
A lack of autonomy. Okay. Tell me about that. What is that like?

202
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,440
I mean, obviously, you're still somewhat free to do your own thing,

203
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:48,839
but a lot of the time with a lack of power becomes you because you can become oppressed by either the like,

204
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,020
the mindsets or the views of those in power. Right.

205
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:57,719
And that can obviously lead to decision making and regulations that kind of

206
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,530
limit your ability to make your own decisions and control your own livelihood.

207
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:06,150
Great. Thanks. Yeah. Asia is our East Asia.

208
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,950
Like I'm saying, like, to the point where you almost feel invisible, too.

209
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,600
Can you talk a little bit more on that?

210
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:20,760
I just think like kind of when you feel like either the cover is taken away from you or someone has a lot more power than you,

211
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:26,700
it feels like any action or words you say just can't seen by those who are purposely ignored.

212
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,720
Right? So that can kind of just lead to feelings of being invisible.

213
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:37,200
Yeah. Yeah. And I like to do that, too, about the the two different elements about being invisible,

214
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,849
but then also being ignored because being ignored can be a little bit different.

215
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:49,500
Like you can be seen, but then you're just this kind of group, you know, and, and different people have different reactions to that.

216
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:56,129
Right. It's like sometimes you just feel like, well, they don't even see me. Other times they may see me, but they don't recognize me.

217
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:01,470
Affirm, acknowledge. And for some people, that can even be more devastating, you know.

218
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,820
But sometimes if you're not seen, you might be like, oh, well, they just have it, you know?

219
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:09,480
But when they see you and then they shut you down, that can be remarkable.

220
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,260
All right. What else? That's anger.

221
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah. So I like to add on to you just ones like you're unseen or ignored.

222
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,470
Then you find, like, either interest often by other people that are the same exact things.

223
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,800
And then it's like your emotions take over. Mm hmm. Yeah.

224
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:32,580
And I. I like what you said about. I think you were saying this about how it can not only be individual, but can be collective, too.

225
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,839
Right. So then if you start to talk to other people, then you start to get really pissed off.

226
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,000
Right? And that that can build which can be really good sometimes though,

227
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:52,770
because if you can get enough people that are angry and still have enough vision insight to changes that can, can be positive in some ways.

228
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:57,299
Sarah Then, well, it can kind of create this sense of jealousy or power.

229
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:03,930
Is this like aspirational goal and kind of put on a pedestal that it doesn't necessarily need to be or need need to be on, right?

230
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,420
Yeah.

231
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:11,880
We were talking I know in this class we're talking about like the messaging and like social media and kind of like what's seen as like cool or what.

232
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:16,530
You know, I that's a really good point. It could be like that sense of jealousy if you don't have it.

233
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:23,850
And and even then, having that power isn't all it's meant, all it's cut out to be, but it's portrayed as such.

234
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:29,819
You can be really jealous of something. And then when you get in a position like, Oh, this isn't so, you know, that's exciting.

235
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:36,280
But, but with power, I think does come for some admiration and things like that feeling.

236
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,450
Oh wow. So yeah, so jealousy is stuff for them. Yeah.

237
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,560
Joseph Fear. Fear in just general,

238
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:50,730
like not being able to stop anything that could happen to you and just kind of being at the whim of either an institution or another person.

239
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:57,929
Right. Okay, good. Yeah. So and it's kind of connected to like some of the comments to like with I learn about like lack of autonomy and,

240
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,950
you know, being able to do what you want if someone's pulling all the strings.

241
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,120
Definitely lot of fear, especially if you don't know what the [INAUDIBLE] I going to do. Right. Yeah.

242
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:10,440
I think what you just said about someone else pulling the strings has to do with what my thoughts about.

243
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:17,760
Like, it's frustrating and dehumanizing when you're no longer, like, in control of your own actions if it gets to a certain extreme.

244
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:27,150
Right. Good. Yeah. And I think that dehumanizing is very, very, very critical because that, you know, when your your basic humanity is is stripped.

245
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:32,910
You know, that's that's a powerful emotion to experience.

246
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:40,020
And I also think that in some situations, it can become comfortable and then you can become complacent.

247
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,450
So, for example, if like someone that you mostly agree with is in charge, but they're not doing a great job,

248
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:52,620
but they're still in power, maybe you wouldn't want anything to change because you still sort of agree with them on those things.

249
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,070
Oh, that's a good point. And I think too, with different forms of oppression, if you're not aware of the oppression,

250
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:04,730
you know, you may think, oh, yeah, that's that sounds good. Yeah, I'm not really happy, but I'm not upset.

251
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:11,740
So, you know, people could feel comfort and not having to just drive.

252
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,960
Yeah. Sophia and Abigail.

253
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:19,380
Okay. I mean, I think over time, you get used to it like it could still be oppression.

254
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:24,419
So we all feel terrible. But if that's what you've lived with for so long, then you don't know that there's an option to fight back.

255
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:29,069
Or you don't want to fight back because you don't think it's going to do anything. Yeah, I think that's an excellent, excellent point.

256
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:38,370
And that's something that's the way that that oppression can be perpetuated, you know, because like to, if you don't think it can be any different,

257
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:49,910
um, like in, in the work that I do in Kenya, you know, almost all my work is with LGBT folks and there's a lot of oppression.

258
00:26:49,920 --> 00:27:01,049
Same sex behavior is illegal and people are constantly being tormented, abused in different ways.

259
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:09,130
And, you know, some of the things. Some of the groups that I work with are like well we're we're the term that uses were used.

260
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,240
So I'm used to it but it's used to us and so we're used.

261
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,740
So it's just like, okay, well, I know this is going to happen, but we're used to it.

262
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:28,080
So you just kind of keep going on because there is no not even a twinkling of like, you know, the folks can see a good point.

263
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,390
Abigail Yeah, similar to what if I were just me?

264
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,719
And I feel like sometimes it can be anger and fear and really strong emotions,

265
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,130
but sometimes it's just as simple as, like, hesitation or uneasiness in a room.

266
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,900
You know, if you're in a room like all men and you're a woman, or if you're,

267
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:47,610
you know, a lot of people that are older than you can be centuries ability.

268
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:55,989
Yeah, I think that's a good point too, because then what happens sometimes is that people in power will use that reaction as a way to say,

269
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:00,040
See, I gave them the opportunity, but they didn't say anything.

270
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:09,400
Okay. In another concrete example in Kenya, with working with some kind of high level researchers and government officials.

271
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,940
For a while I was part of this group that I resigned because I didn't like the way they're

272
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:18,730
doing things about health issues for gay and bisexual men and other men have sex with men.

273
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,270
And all of our meetings were mostly with like high level officials.

274
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:30,760
I'm not from Kenya, so I was like some Kenyan folks and then a lot of other folks from different countries and,

275
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:37,839
you know, in person say, well, we need the community here. And to on top of it, I was the only openly gay person in the room.

276
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:45,640
So you have a bunch of straight CIS folks from other countries telling gay folks in Kenya how to live their life basically,

277
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:55,510
and being responsible for their health issues. So after making enough noise, they're like, okay, we're going to invite community members in.

278
00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:01,750
And so they invited leaders of some of the LGBT organizations.

279
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:11,060
And I looked at how they arranged the room because physical environments show power to right.

280
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,440
Like this setup is a power dynamic set up.

281
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:24,729
So the way they had it is they had all the community members sitting at the corner of the table and then everyone else was like the two hands.

282
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:29,770
And they are so and so their positions starting awkward, an awkward position.

283
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:36,540
And then they were showing slides and the slides rolling here and their seat was like here and everyone else was driving.

284
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,020
So then it started off like that.

285
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:44,110
Then during the meeting they would say things and they would kind of say, Well, well, what do people think about that?

286
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:51,090
And the community members didn't say anything because a lot of them were terrified to say anything.

287
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:55,270
And especially when you have government officials and you're running an organization for a

288
00:29:55,270 --> 00:30:00,490
community that suffers a lot of oppression or marginalization and even potential legal backlash,

289
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:09,400
they weren't say anything. And so the meeting went on and know at one point someone made a comment about,

290
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:16,300
it's so good to have the community here so that you can really, you know, be be part of this discussion.

291
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,800
And I kind of have a big mouth sometimes and not a big filter.

292
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,810
So I just stopped the meeting at that point because I'm not part of the group anymore.

293
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:32,350
I was kind of well, I was only kicked out, but I just didn't get the emails anymore.

294
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:42,070
But I said, Well, I'd like to challenge that statement because this is not engaging the community.

295
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,750
The language that we're using is very academic, it's very research,

296
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:58,209
but position ality of how we are sitting is not bringing them in and we're not running meetings like community agencies run meetings.

297
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,150
There's a big difference between how you run a government meeting and a

298
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:05,470
community agency meeting in terms of like formality and other things like that.

299
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:19,000
And so, you know, I said I'd like to give some time and space to our community partners to have them talk and all of us need to shut up.

300
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:28,030
I probably shouldn't have shut up because there's not one person like this. But so that when the community folks talked, they then shared.

301
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:33,700
It's like, yeah, we don't feel comfortable here. You know, this is not a place where we feel safe, things like that.

302
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:40,719
And then it's kind of like what we see oftentimes with people who are trying to like do good.

303
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,190
They're like, oh, how can we, you know, you know, why do you feel like that?

304
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:52,450
We're not scary. Why? You know, and it was like questioning their feelings, you know, it wasn't like an affirmation.

305
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,140
Like, you're absolutely right. This must be really challenging for you.

306
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,120
What can we do to make it better? They were challenging them about their emotions.

307
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:02,950
And that was.

308
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:09,950
Is even more of a power play, you know, because when you put people on the spot and you're saying, oh, don't be don't be upset, don't be worried.

309
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,759
So I know they are going to be they're going to be worried.

310
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,010
And they have really, you know, reason to be because it's it's not a safe option.

311
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:24,410
Did I was there another hand? All right. How does it feel when you have power?

312
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,790
Yeah. Name. Sometimes you don't notice that you do. Okay.

313
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:36,010
Can you tell me a little bit more about that? So I guess, um.

314
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:49,890
Like. The way I'm thinking about it is like, I guess sometimes you have a situation where you're like in a position of power,

315
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:54,480
but you don't necessarily know what all that comes with.

316
00:32:55,290 --> 00:33:04,830
So you rarely say something or hurt somebody feelings or do something that you weren't necessarily thinking about.

317
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,740
Like, I can't really give a copy. Well, that's kind of what I was.

318
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,760
I was always I mean, it's kind of like the power that comes with privilege sometimes.

319
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:19,410
Is that kind of what you get? Yeah. Like sometimes if you have privilege, then you're not aware of privilege and you have it,

320
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:24,690
you know, kind of challenge yourself to critique that you may do things that are positive.

321
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:30,540
What are some other ways it feels really? Power. Yeah, power can be empowering.

322
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,890
Okay. For a lot of, like for women.

323
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:48,150
Mm hmm. Sometimes. Or in the past, when women were more, you know, housewives or things like that nature then or, for example, the MeToo movement.

324
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:53,879
And a lot of people started talking about their power and how you can obtain power.

325
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:01,260
And it empowers other people to join and show that they feel power in other ways and inspiring others.

326
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:05,480
Mm hmm. So in some ways, it sounds like you be contagious, in a way.

327
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:16,500
Yeah. And I will talk about this whole, like, kind of process we're going through and Kenya working with lesbian buying queer women about what?

328
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,980
What is empowerment? Can we talk about empowerment a lot?

329
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:28,920
And oftentimes it's used in a lot of global settings as something that people with money and access give to people who don't have money and access.

330
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,850
So it's often used in a very impressive way.

331
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:36,120
But I like the way you talk about it. After the bill.

332
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,870
Yeah. Myrna They're not scary because sometimes.

333
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,760
But you just like the fact a lot of people.

334
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,400
But also, like, if you're a spokesperson for, like, a community,

335
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:59,790
like what you're saying will be taken as what the community wants or what you feel is not exactly what the community thinks.

336
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,630
Right. Yeah. So it's scary.

337
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,400
And one thing was I heard your response is that with power comes responsibility,

338
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:13,980
because like you said, you're often asked to speak for an entire community.

339
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,770
You know, again, that's why, you know, at all my classes, I really stay away from people.

340
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,010
Being the spokesperson for a particular identity group because, you know, you don't all have,

341
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:33,000
you know, a phone line that connects you to every person with that shared identity to find out.

342
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,959
And because of our other sexual identities, your experiences may be very,

343
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,520
very different than someone who has one shared identity, but all your other ideas may not.

344
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:47,190
What else? How is this having power feel? Yeah. Tonight it's going to add on to that.

345
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:54,750
Um, you do have a lot of accountability, and I think there's a lot of eyes on, you know, because of that,

346
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:59,340
you kind of limit the things you say or even do because you're scared of, like, the repercussions.

347
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:09,090
Right. Yeah, that's a good point. And you also have to be careful about people misconstruing what you say, you know, and that's why I don't know,

348
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:15,200
we have some one or more people work for the Michigan Daily and student newspaper.

349
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,409
I like that, like timidly kind of like for and you know,

350
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:26,310
that's one thing that when you are interviewed for something and you're in a position of power,

351
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:31,680
you do have to be careful and make sure that if you're talking to someone from a newspaper or television,

352
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,309
that you have shared meaning and understanding what you're saying.

353
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:41,820
Because sometimes you may think you're saying something, ah, your intention is one thing, but the person may hear something else.

354
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:46,379
And so that is that it is a lot of it can be a lot of pressure, you know that.

355
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:54,360
Oh [INAUDIBLE], did I say that? And I've done that a lot of times where, you know, I always ask, can I please read it before it comes forward?

356
00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:03,689
And recently was quoted in a New York Times article, and the guy hadn't totally fact checked with me,

357
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:09,809
but when I read it, I was like, Okay, that sounds like something to say. But Zilliox, I didn't even know it came out.

358
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:16,230
So I got this like it was in one of the emails that, you know, I was quoted in the New York Times and like,

359
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:20,880
Oh, it was to me because I talked to this guy, like, you know, six months ago.

360
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:30,450
But yeah, but there is a lot of anxiety. And like you said, sometimes you may be leery about doing something because you don't know how to turn out.

361
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:36,490
How does it feel to have power? So I have a go ahead.

362
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:42,959
I have an observation day out where it's not really a feeling, but I know a lot of people,

363
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,640
they become like reading and then they realize like, how much of it.

364
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,590
I have other people, they kind of, like, take it into day.

365
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,239
Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

366
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:03,180
I mean, power can be intoxicating for some people, and power can lead to people being very greedy and wanting more and more and more.

367
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,330
Like once you get a taste for it, you want more and more and more.

368
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:16,200
Yeah, I think also just kind of like on the flip side, people in power, ability to bypass more rules and regulations that are sometimes set in place.

369
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,570
Mm hmm. I think, like, the thing that comes to mind for me is like sexual assault allegations.

370
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:28,830
Yep. Like that. If you're in a position of power, you're likely to have either the victim, like, not come forward.

371
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:35,520
Yeah. Or have the means to, like, have a good lawyer and get your case.

372
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,979
No, no, that's an excellent point.

373
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:47,190
I think, you know, and I think the commission has tried to do a better job, but the way the system is set up right now,

374
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:55,229
it totally privileges predators because survivors have to go through so much and have

375
00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:00,780
to have their stories and their experiences questioned and interrogated and waves.

376
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:06,569
And the people with power, like you said, can often hire fancy lawyers, all this other kind of stuff.

377
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:12,750
And then if you are in a powerless position, all you have is your word, and they do everything they can to rip that apart.

378
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:22,030
I think it's horrible. Yeah, I was going to say guilt, like white guilt that's been around, I think for the last five years presently.

379
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,629
From what I understand from that, like people feeling guilty for like either the power,

380
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:32,910
the privilege hold and not really knowing how to, like, be settled with that.

381
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,059
Right. Mm hmm. Yeah, definitely.

382
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:40,320
And I think that with that, we'll talk some, too, about the concept of, like, white fragility,

383
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:48,660
which is a concept that's been introduced about for some white folks when they get an awareness are well,

384
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:52,140
first, when they we even talk about race issues, they get uncomfortable.

385
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:59,840
And then all the energy goes to talk about their discomfort and not talking about the discomfort that they may have perpetuated.

386
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:07,100
So yeah, so I think there's a lot of that. So one thing that I noticed in all your responses, I shouldn't say all I do, you know,

387
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:13,250
use black and white I to have some great and then most of your responses when I ask you what it feels like to have power,

388
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:16,770
the things that you brought up were more negative.

389
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:23,549
Right. So it was like responsibility, you know, being careful not to say something wrong.

390
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:27,570
I mean, all these other kind of things. Why do you think that is? Isn't power something you want?

391
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:32,820
I mean, there was like, no, no one said it feels good, it feels great. It feels amazing.

392
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:39,780
Why do you think that is? Still just because we've seen throughout our history, most individuals are power of using.

393
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,340
Okay. The negative. Right. Okay.

394
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:51,749
Yeah. I think part of it is kind of like what you said with great power comes great responsibility.

395
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,600
So that responsibility comes a lot of stress,

396
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:03,270
a lot of other issues that might take away from the enjoyment that one has from having power, like the opportunity that one has.

397
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:07,890
Yeah. If you have a conscience. Right. So if you don't have a conscience, it could feel really bad.

398
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:10,410
I mean, it's like, yeah, okay. Yeah.

399
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:18,930
You can say, like, I feel like from our shared experiences, there's been more cases where we've not been in power than we've been in power.

400
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,650
So it's like a matter of perception.

401
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:27,570
Like just what we've experienced based on what we've seen.

402
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,300
Right? Yeah. Yeah.

403
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:36,300
When you have the power, your. The consequences of your actions are amplified.

404
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:39,899
Mm hmm. And so you have to be even small things.

405
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,930
You have to be more aware and in general, overwhelming.

406
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,340
A lot of stress from that. Yeah. Yeah.

407
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:54,300
Right now, I think maybe at least when I think of power, I tend to think more of power over that power to do okay.

408
00:41:54,810 --> 00:42:00,120
So power over tends to have a lot more negative consequences that power to do.

409
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,860
Right. Excellent. Excellent. So, yeah, because I've been keeping it broad as just power.

410
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:11,520
But when we start to then break it down into like different forms of power, it is very different.

411
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:18,569
So power over people is typically, I think what we think about a lot, but the power too, and that's kind of like the empowerment conversation I think.

412
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:24,660
Sara you brought that up because like that kind of power is something that we want to celebrate and we want to have.

413
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,920
But the other power can be uncomfortable that sort of Peyton and that. I know there are a couple of hands.

414
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:34,380
Yeah, I'm just going off. What in the end, like, interesting about, like, the differences in power and how I just feel like.

415
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:41,030
Historically, the only power type power we have seen now and certainly which is now, is power over people.

416
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:46,690
We see lots of examples just in our society of power of empowering others.

417
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:51,620
So I feel like there is always a negative connotation of power because historically

418
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,370
that's how power has been used to describe and use in a positive way.

419
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:58,909
Yeah. Good. Good explanation. Becky.

420
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,239
Sara? Sara, I wonder one more. Yeah.

421
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:09,260
Sorry. Yeah, I feel like it goes, like, a lot back to our history, even with the founding fathers.

422
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:17,510
Like being very individualist, having fears of the central government, or just, like, the idea of people having control over each other.

423
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,840
Mm hmm. It just really felt deeply into our society.

424
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,680
So there was a lot of hesitation when we think about it, just because, like,

425
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,389
hundreds of years in in that way and even that term that we use founding fathers is like,

426
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:34,910
well, where were the mothers, the brothers, the sisters, the nieces and nephews, you know, the grandmothers.

427
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:40,190
But we only focus on primarily white cis men.

428
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:46,120
Right. I would assume they were cis and most likely straight identified.

429
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:54,140
And there were many queer dudes around there who had been out and proud and signing on to some of the laws.

430
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:58,610
So it was a. Sarah that I. Sarah. Right. Is that right?

431
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,740
Probably, yeah.

432
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:08,840
But so Oliver, I mean, about kind of just the messages that like especially media are giving out in regards to like movies and television themes.

433
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:13,969
Like it's, I don't want to say always, but many times it is like an exertion of power over people,

434
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:21,049
more so than people obtaining power themselves to do things. And it's like a common villain theme to the negativity of it.

435
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:29,830
It's a very, very streamlined storyline that like, like weaves through a lot of the media that's given out to audiences these days.

436
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:38,570
Right. Yeah. Sarah. Yeah. I think then to go off of that too is that there's like this relationship that we see with power and

437
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:45,410
exploitation where those people that have seen see themselves as having or holding the most power.

438
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:51,379
When they see people that are empowering others, they want to control these other people's power.

439
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:55,490
So if you think back to like empowering movement,

440
00:44:55,490 --> 00:45:02,420
a lot of times these people suddenly become the forefront of media and people want to control those stories,

441
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:06,560
like you were saying about how you were published in The New York Times, but you didn't even know.

442
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:16,170
Right. Because. It's people want to hold that power to make sure that people are consuming their perception of what that power should look like.

443
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:22,390
Right. Yeah, it's interesting because even when, you know, having me quoted in there,

444
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:26,960
they made sure that like a professor at University of Michigan, so that's power, right?

445
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:35,890
So it gives his statement validity because he had he's used my power to gain power in his article to show that.

446
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:39,610
Yeah. My I was just going to say, like,

447
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:46,810
I think part of the reason why we're all bringing up like the negative aspects of power is because when you look around the room,

448
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,770
it's like a lot of women, a lot of people, an otherwise marginalized body.

449
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:59,500
And we're not used to taking up space and to say positive things about power, empowering and can make use of that space.

450
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:11,770
Yeah, I agree 100%. I think if this were an advanced finance class and was when all white straight says, dude,

451
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:18,730
I think I'd get a very different response there in that you know dog on Ross but is is a different

452
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,160
mind frame than mine I mean I don't think about how do I make as much money as possible.

453
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:30,430
You know, if I did, I would not be here. I would have taken that job with Oprah.

454
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:33,880
Yeah, for me, that's a good. Really? Yeah.

455
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,690
I work on her radio show, but that's as far as I go.

456
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:45,790
I think another reason that we're saying more negative things is something that feel like it's kind of like in everyone's comments

457
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:55,689
is that we want to associate power with like an individual know like through others rather than power with like a community.

458
00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:02,209
And that permeates through. Like I feel like if you're not associated with like power through like communities are collected and things like that,

459
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:05,830
they may be more non to first like say the positive reinforces,

460
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:12,670
but once like we think of power as one individual and they can like control other people and collect like power that way.

461
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,300
Right. We're going to think about that next. Yeah, that's a great point.

462
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:27,760
Lauren, did you have your hand up or was it Kara? Yeah. And then, yeah, I also think that we're more prone to recognize power in a negative light.

463
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,170
Yeah, we all have powers to do things like all the time,

464
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:37,420
but we don't really pay attention to it because we live in like Westernized culture where we just kind of take advantage of it.

465
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:44,469
So like, I like the power to by a god, like, for example, certainly it's debatable, but like we all have that power,

466
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:50,650
but we don't recognize that, oh, we have the freedom to do this thing that other people don't necessarily have the freedom to do.

467
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:54,549
And we've more recognized like we don't have the power to do this.

468
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:55,820
Right? Yeah. Yeah.

469
00:47:56,050 --> 00:48:06,760
If you think about I guess you just like and if you think about academic institutions, academic institutions purposely take all your power away.

470
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:13,240
If you again, if you think about it in a classroom, often physical structures.

471
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:23,430
Right. And the all knowing standing at the podium, you know, all this knowledge and you're all sitting there attentively listening.

472
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:27,430
In most cases, you don't even get to call me by my name.

473
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,900
You have to call me professor or doctor. You know, that's another powerless thing.

474
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:40,090
You're given strict deadlines. If you don't turn something in right on time and you get those points, Doctor, you have no power over that.

475
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:47,020
Some places take, you know, really strict attendance, even using clickers to collect that you're there.

476
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:54,250
I mean, all of these are mechanisms and structures to take away your power and to really kind of beat you into submission.

477
00:48:55,390 --> 00:49:03,040
And even if you think about it, a lot of classes where you have a multiple choice test, a multiple choice test is saying,

478
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:13,419
I know what's right and you have to think like me and you have to pick the right box that I've selected based on my view of some things.

479
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,420
I mean, if you're like talking about organic chemistry,

480
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:22,480
which I hate in and of other people can share, I did say Muslim, you're having a similar reaction.

481
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:31,180
Yeah, there's certain chemical reaction type things are more, you know, biological things that there's not a lot of gray area,

482
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:36,580
but in a lot of social behavioral sciences and other areas, there's a lot of gray.

483
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:42,430
So giving you a multiple choice test, I guess even taking more of your freedom away because you can't explain your answer,

484
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:45,790
you know, and that's why I never use multiple choice tests.

485
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:52,890
And I even like thrown out tests because it's it's really putting you, again, in this powerless decision.

486
00:49:52,900 --> 00:50:01,060
Can I pick the right box? And I've written a lot of multiple choice tests over my years and even years ago,

487
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:08,220
and for an abnormal psychology course, wrote a test bank, which is one of the most boring thing.

488
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:11,870
In the world. They did it as a young professor because I was like, Oh, I want to get a public agent.

489
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:19,610
But that is such a restrictive way because there there's too much gray.

490
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:24,739
But again, all these mechanism structures are put in place to take away your power and to not give

491
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:30,710
you any power so it doesn't make sense that you would feel like you don't have it. Yes, I think I have strong feeling.

492
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:38,520
That point was said that I was just thinking about like class and stuff like that.

493
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:46,040
Like every time I had to. Mm hmm. But a point that I kind of wanted to make was that like when you brought up, like, the Ross thing?

494
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:52,850
I actually spoke to somebody who was, like, in the nonprofit sector, and so they told me that it's,

495
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:58,549
like, very difficult to remember the intention of the purpose of working in the nonprofit sector,

496
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:07,240
especially now that like everything, like he had said that it's like sort of like a business now until it becomes very difficult to remember.

497
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:18,480
Like the reason you're put in this powerful position because of the other people that are in power that sort of, I guess, make it difficult to.

498
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:24,360
Remember who you are because then they manipulate your purpose.

499
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:28,089
And so actually, this is Michael Myers. He's the CEO of UNICEF.

500
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:33,069
And so he was saying that it just becomes so difficult to remember.

501
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:36,150
And that's why you always have, like, his mission statement, right? Yeah. Mm hmm.

502
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:41,470
But again, he said it's essentially like a business, and so it becomes very difficult.

503
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:48,860
And so I think the more power you have, the harder it is to maintain that power in a positive.

504
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:53,919
Yeah. Yeah. So that's a really good point that I could spend.

505
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,810
And I well, there was a class talking about nonprofits because I spent a lot of time in that world.

506
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:05,049
And I sit on the boards of directors of a lot of nonprofits and and often I'm I'm the content expert.

507
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:12,280
So I'm brought into the board to keep people focused on the mission, because a lot of times they the board members are like CEOs of,

508
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:16,870
you know, this and that, United Airlines and Kraft and all this stuff.

509
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:23,349
And then I'm the person supposed to call them all to the table. And I was like, Remember, we're supposed to be doing this, not the jobs.

510
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:29,610
And I want to get back and then we're going to do the groups and. Well, I think I'm not this probably isn't like what you're going for.

511
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:33,550
But I also think just from a purely psychological perspective,

512
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:41,139
like we started the conversation with talking about how it feels to be without power, which like res negative connotation of power.

513
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:44,140
And then we transitioned to talk about what it feels to be like with power.

514
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,520
Yeah. So you're already sort of in the negative space, right? Yeah.

515
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:52,959
So what kind of pride I'm interested to see, like if you talked about like how it feels to be with power,

516
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,080
if we if we would have gotten different responses. Yeah.

517
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:02,590
No, that's a great and great observation. And, and I do think, yeah, maybe I'll do that next year and then compare the two years.

518
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:09,309
But I do think that like a lot of the points that both brought up about power and the positions that

519
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:17,920
you hold in society and in the space and communities are such that you don't have a lot of power,

520
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,330
you don't feel like you have a lot of power.

521
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:26,830
And when we obviously we're not going to get to any of those lines today, but I'm going to do what we got to do.

522
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:32,290
I'm in charge. So, you know, I can just throw caution to the wind. But this was a good conversation.

523
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:34,150
This is like I want this class to go.

524
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:43,180
But but one of the things I want you to think about and to take away from this is to really start to think more critically about power.

525
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:47,559
Because I think that we often I forgot who brought it up.

526
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:55,600
Someone over here. I think maybe Hannah about difference between power over and power within our power to do something.

527
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:02,650
We often think about the power over, and we often think about the individuals, the dictators, the power mongers, stuff like that.

528
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:14,220
All of you have a lot of power, and part of what we need to do to be active is to be people who take action.

529
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:17,290
Social justice is to find that power and harness it,

530
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:23,890
and then also to be collective like you were talking about something about like connecting with people,

531
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:31,810
thinking about ways that you can do that because as an individual you may feel like you don't have a lot of power.

532
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:35,140
But that collective power, which I think, Camille,

533
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:42,130
you brought that someone brought up about collective power in this arena, that that can be really powerful.

534
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:50,260
And so we're going to next class, we will look at the different theoretical conceptualizations of power.

535
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:56,710
And I don't want you to lose this conversation because I really do want you to think about this in a more complex and nuanced way.

536
00:54:57,490 --> 00:55:03,240
I So a. Q Are the assignments online?

537
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:13,150
Yes, on campus. I know that I may need help finding this.

538
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:23,380
You know, I'm going to like, can you just disappear? I remember that.

539
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:34,870
I remember when I was like, Oh, can you tell me how you doing it?

540
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:45,249
Only available online. New York Times. So what we're going to do is we're going to break into these groups of four, go anywhere you want in this room.

541
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:49,030
There's some nice couches back there. You can talk over. There you are here.

542
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:52,360
You can talk to the kitchen, you know, crack open your refrigerator.

543
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:58,689
There's there's a really nice area over there, too, that has like a little table.

544
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:06,160
And you can stay out the window as you're talking. But this is going to be the hard part and finding your other people.

545
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:09,900
How about this? How many rooms are there? 15.

546
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:16,060
All right. So what I'm going to say is like group one meet here for two.

547
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:30,330
Three, this is going to work. Four five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13 over there, 14 over there and 15 down there.

548
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:36,050
You'll find it. And then then you can find the space and make sure you tell your name tag.

549
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:42,870
I think someone was appointed. You can find your people for all these years.

550
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:48,179
We only agreed with the protesters. I promise all of that. A liberal Instagram where like in the front row.

551
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:51,659
But I know. Yeah, I know.

552
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:55,330
And they just had no idea what you look like.

553
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:58,740
I'm going to go on through with it.

554
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:07,530
So most of it, yeah. So thank you.

555
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:13,799
I think I'm going to call that one right here.

556
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:21,210
Amber, you all? Yeah, I was going to ask you 30th matter.

557
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:33,299
Yeah, I was going to get my first lesson to be less like the resident player,

558
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:40,830
and that's why I wanted to give them all that you're just doing and all that.

559
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:49,720
I just I don't even like I don't forgot.

560
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:57,090
I know that there is actually phenomenal.

561
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:07,680
Yeah. And let's see how do you go by the spelling so that they decided to bring that to around the outside of the.

562
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:16,110
I got to go with the idea is there anyone who doesn't have a group.

563
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:28,380
Yeah. Any anyone without a group on the nutrition and health is all the same.

564
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:45,300
But if you want to live here, it's always like very affordable and you start looking for every single time.

565
00:58:49,980 --> 00:59:04,020
So I just got off in an executive so straightforward, but I saw you like everybody laughed and I was nervous.

566
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:33,150
But like I said, I feel like I was like, yeah, that's yeah, you're on, you know, you're like, oh three, you know, like, I know, yeah.

567
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:51,300
That's all for the marching band. Like, I don't know 5 minutes because very I just a them because I was like I want to do that I know what

568
00:59:52,450 --> 01:00:13,080
it more than we like your pets so you guys like yeah yeah like are you doing in the article,

569
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:25,950
you know.

570
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:41,820
But I was like, oh.

571
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:44,170
Oh, I.
