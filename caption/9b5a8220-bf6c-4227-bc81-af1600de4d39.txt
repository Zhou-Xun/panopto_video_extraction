1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:12,670
I know. But also so we've actually been able to make a very nice.

2
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:22,860
I do. And then I said, I'm also like, I grew up a and I want to go to school.

3
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,800
That's what I was. Passwords.

4
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,730
So I've got a new one and did not know. What if I go home?

5
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,560
How are you feeling about that before? I think it's like being away from it just so long.

6
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,670
I try to get rid of them.

7
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:46,030
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like, I love your friends, but.

8
00:00:46,030 --> 00:01:05,390
Yeah, they definitely get. So far, just like the trader Dan who our news article presenter is today.

9
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:35,480
Well, not. Yeah.

10
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,020
He's, um. Okay. Hi, I'm Brianna.

11
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:50,690
I'm Mimi. I'm so. The article that we chose to look at was about an 18 time or 18 time Grand Slam tennis champion named Chris Evert.

12
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:57,440
And this article focuses on kind of her journey dealing with ovarian cancer and the message that she's trying to get across.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,840
So to start basically her journey started when her sister Jean was diagnosed and then shortly died in February 2020 of ovarian cancer.

14
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:15,020
And they first noticed that something was wrong when they were running through an airport in, I believe it was Singapore.

15
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:20,120
And her sister was really out of breath. So she urged her sister to go to the doctor.

16
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,489
And shortly after that she was diagnosed and she was told that she was stage four.

17
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,940
So that was the worst, worst stage of cancer.

18
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,290
So after her sister died in February of 2020,

19
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:43,519
Chris got a call from the doctor letting her know that her sister had a harmful variant of the Racoon gene.

20
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,059
So that kind of increased her risk of breast and ovarian cancer.

21
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:54,500
So the doctor told Chris to go get tested as well, and it revealed that she also carried this gene or the gene mutation.

22
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,729
So because of that, she went on to go get a hysterectomy.

23
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,790
And when those cells were cultured, it revealed cancerous cells.

24
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,110
But luckily it was only she was determined to be in stage one.

25
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,010
So that was better than stage four, I guess.

26
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,820
So if she had not gone genetic testing, though,

27
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:19,520
the doctors did tell her that she could have been at stage four within four months, which was shocking to her.

28
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,749
So because of that,

29
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:29,750
she had the hysterectomy and then went underwent six months of chemotherapy and within cycles of she'd go in for five days and then

30
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:36,290
she would work for the United States Tennis Association Foundation for three weeks and then that cycle repeat for six months.

31
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:45,140
So back in May, she did announce that she was cancer free and that there was a small chance of recurrence of the ovarian cancer.

32
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,390
And despite this, though, it does show how much like surgery and chemo,

33
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,200
chemotherapy and radiation does take a toll on your body because she still feels that she's not at 100%.

34
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,300
She only feels like her energy and her body is only at 85% of what it used to be.

35
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:15,160
Okay. So Brianna briefly covered this, but Chris won a record U.S. or six U.S. Open singles titles, which is tied by Serena Williams in 2014.

36
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:22,870
And she was ranked either number one or number two in the world between 1975 and 1986 for a total of 260 weeks.

37
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,509
She's 67 right now. And I wasn't really around tennis world, so I didn't really know who she was.

38
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:35,800
But she's super high profile. In 1976, she became the first female player to reach $1 million in career prize money.

39
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,919
So again, she's very well known, has a big reach. Again, like Brianna was saying,

40
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:52,300
she works at the USTA Foundation that fosters connections with kind of wealthy donors to focus on charity and making sure that kids like underserved,

41
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,590
underprivileged kids can learn how to play tennis and have that good outlet.

42
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:05,470
So she's a chairperson. And so she helps run tennis centers for 160,000 underserved children.

43
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:13,150
She's helped facilitate $30 million in grants and donation donations to all the to teach the kids tennis.

44
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,540
And she's really passionate about this foundation and charity work.

45
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:25,119
That's kind of what this little part of the article was about was that she was doing all this good community service things and once she recovers,

46
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,910
she plans to continue this chair role, which is like the first time I had done this for like two terms back to back.

47
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,500
But then she wants to kind of pivot into raising more awareness and money for

48
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,430
cancer research and wants to share the message of early detection with the world.

49
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:48,440
Yeah. So as mentioned before, Chris had a sister, Jean, who did die of cancer.

50
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,910
And again, it was mentioned that she didn't know.

51
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:58,000
And when her sister urged her to get tested, she had stage four and like two years and a little.

52
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,550
She passed away. Eventually.

53
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:11,610
Oh. So I thought it made people wonder, like, does this run in the family or like ovarian cancer, like her sister?

54
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:18,420
Getting ovarian cancer is a risk factor because of age. And so that really like culture and get go screen.

55
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:25,559
And so the importance of screening is really just to try to capture your disease before look really good,

56
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:32,190
stop bad and try to change your life or try to get rid of it before it really changes your life.

57
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,340
And it's really hard and it spreads everywhere. So.

58
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,380
And when you know that cancer like runs in your family, that your sister just died of cancer.

59
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,820
Like, it really makes you wonder, like, you should probably go get screening, but also, when you don't know your family history,

60
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:55,469
you should probably be aware of your body and see if your body is telling you something like something's wrong.

61
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:01,620
You should probably also get screened. I also wanted to talk a little bit about privilege.

62
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:07,570
I mean, she is very famous in the tennis world and she has a lot of money.

63
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:14,680
And so getting a doctor to recommend her to get genetic testing is something that maybe not every doctor would do,

64
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,219
especially in the lower socioeconomic areas.

65
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,240
And it was really lucky that the doctors had a blood sample of her sisters.

66
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,600
Because that's what they knew that she had the sample brought the one.

67
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:35,510
And so. So she also uses her privilege for good.

68
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,389
I mean, she she wants to donate for cancer awareness and research.

69
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,800
And she also, like they said.

70
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:52,020
Have the charitable organizations that help underprivileged children, and she gives them all this advice and trying to give against their lives.

71
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,860
But I also wanted to talk about the privilege of genetic testing. I looked it up and I was like, I wonder how much it is?

72
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:08,250
And it said that it could be from 300 to $5000 or even more because it's like your copay, insurance and stuff like that.

73
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,829
So I was wondering, like, she's really privileged to have gotten the test because like not everybody has

74
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,640
that much money lying around and that's not even treatments covered in the money.

75
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:29,520
So that's a lot of money. I just wanted to end with a quote that she gave and I thought really tight and everything it said, she says Zero advocate.

76
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,560
So your family's history how to awareness of your body, follow your gut and be aware of changes.

77
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:40,640
Don't try to be a crusader and think this will pass. Job.

78
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:49,399
So I want to clarify just a couple a few things. This is a perfect segue way because we're going to be talking about cancer and the turnaround.

79
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:57,530
So that's going on here. We're going to talk about cancer biology and genetics today and then we're going to talk about hereditary cancers next time.

80
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:03,409
So what she's taught. What would Chris Everett sister had was a hereditary BRCA1 mutation.

81
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,780
Right. So this is really rare. So did did Christopher go get screened for ovarian cancer?

82
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,510
No. Yeah, that's right. She did not.

83
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:21,620
There is actually no screening test for ovarian cancer. We don't screen progress in cancer, which is why the vast majority are caught at stage four.

84
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,199
Right. So when her sister started feeling symptoms, they were rushed to the doctor and get this checked out.

85
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,400
You know, she and her sister kind of followed her own advice, like, if something feels wrong, go get it checked out.

86
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,650
Unfortunately, if something feels wrong with cancer, it's often already quite advanced.

87
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,030
Right. Which is why we want to screen people. Screening means looking in apparently healthy people for disease.

88
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,430
Okay. So she didn't get screened for ovarian cancer.

89
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:51,889
What happened was and I think it probably wasn't a blood test, but what they did is when they took the tumor out,

90
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:56,300
usually even if people are stage four for ovarian cancer, they'll do something called debulking surgery.

91
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,059
Often the tumor will kind of attach to a bunch of like the perineum, the other organs.

92
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:07,610
And it's extremely painful. It can actually even attach to like the, I think the.

93
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,650
To me, things that are not intestines. Oh, my God. Wow.

94
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,910
Wow. It is a Tuesday morning, guys.

95
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,200
I'm like, you know, all the things that are in your stomach, they go round around the intestines and it can be very, very painful.

96
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,229
So they'll do a debulking surgery where they actually go in.

97
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:32,680
And even if they're not trying to cure with surgery, they'll often do surgery to remove a lot of that tumor and ease the pain.

98
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,310
It's a palliative thing, but then they can look at the genetics of the tumor,

99
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,450
and that's when they knew that she had a BRCA1 mutation and the her relatives should be tested.

100
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,589
So when she went in and got tested for was the mutation, and when she had it,

101
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:51,600
she had a prophylactic hysterectomy, maybe like just take it out because it's probably going to give me cancer.

102
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,280
And they checked it. She already had a very low stage cancer. So that's that's what that was.

103
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:02,279
You were correct that she has a lot of privilege. But I would also say that genetic testing, we're going to learn what the genetic counselor comes,

104
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,629
that genetic testing has come way down in price, used to be tens of thousands.

105
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:12,520
And you'd have to go through all of these hoops to get insurance to approve it, even if insurance doesn't approve it now.

106
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,390
Like direct to consumer genetic testing for cancer, it's like 100 bucks for like a multi gene chip.

107
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,959
It's 100 or 200, which, you know, certainly some people might have trouble with.

108
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,830
It's not five or ten grand. So. Right. So it's super, super better than it was.

109
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,490
So that those are my clarifications.

110
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:37,049
Also, as a kid who grew up in the eighties, I would say Chris Everett was like famous to the point of non tennis people knowing her.

111
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,830
She was like household names like Serena, right? She's like, you're Serena.

112
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,670
Not quite as flamboyant is not the right word.

113
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:52,079
What's the right word for Serena like? She's very I don't know, Chris, I it was kind of like strictly's percent, you know what I mean?

114
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,580
Like, she didn't kind of have this off court cousins and do other outfits and cool stuff like that.

115
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,520
But everybody in this was like she was just a superstar.

116
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,190
She was one of those sports people that like, even if you weren't a sports people in the eighties, you were like, I don't know, that is so anyway.

117
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,400
Pretty cool. Great art, great choice. Good job.

118
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,970
How are you guys doing this that you're like picking the right article that like leads into the next next topic.

119
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:20,090
It's like you're reading my mind. Okay.

120
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,270
So today we're going to start with cancer biology and genetics.

121
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,830
And next time we're going to talk about hereditary cancers and they kind of flow one into the other.

122
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,380
I did start the recording, so I get like, we'll start today.

123
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:41,770
So I know several of you have said that you talk like a cancer, like a cancer biology whole class.

124
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:48,070
Those of you who've done that are going to be like, this is super basic and I feel like I already know all of this.

125
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:56,990
Those of you who are in the program and may not have had a super strong biology background might be like, Oh, God, what's happening right now?

126
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,999
We're going to try to kind of go down the middle so that everybody can get the basics because

127
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,110
it's really important to understand some cancer biology stuff in order to understand cancer.

128
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,160
We've already encountered that when we start talking about stage and all that kind of stuff, right?

129
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:14,049
So there's definitely pieces you need to know for cancer epidemiology.

130
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,740
But those of you who have a stronger background in cancer biology might feel like This is amazing,

131
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,870
so just hang with us so we can all kind of get on the same page.

132
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:31,640
Okay. All right. So this is a nature medicine thing that came out, and it's a little old at this point.

133
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,090
But the revolution in cancer research can be summed up in a single sentence.

134
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:42,469
Cancer is, in essence, a genetic disease. Okay. And this was written by, among other people, Bert VOGELSTEIN.

135
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:48,330
Anybody know who Bert VOGELSTEIN is? He's a real big deal.

136
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,820
And he had his lab discovered p53, which you're going to find out pretty soon.

137
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:59,790
It's really, really important. It's a very major cancer gene and you know, with a post-doc was on a lot of those papers.

138
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:06,600
Eric Ferran. Anybody know who Eric Ferret is? He's the head of our cancer center.

139
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:14,130
He's our cancer center director. So Director Ferran was a post-doc on a lot of these papers, so he's also a big.

140
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,580
And we're lucky to have him. He's also a super nice guy. We're very lucky to have him.

141
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,559
He's he's amazing, too, because, like, he's the director of the whole cancer center.

142
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,310
But like, [INAUDIBLE] meet with me and be like, Oh, I saw your paper on such and such great job.

143
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,420
But he knows my work. He knows everybody's work.

144
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:38,690
He's the point, like he knows everything, but he's very good at actually knowing what all is going on, which I think is kind of amazing.

145
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:44,720
I don't know that I could do that. So anyway, cool guy, very smart, very good cancer center director.

146
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,760
All right. So the term cancer refers to a group of diseases in which cells grow and spread unrestrained throughout the body.

147
00:14:53,330 --> 00:15:00,140
It's growth by multiplication, meaning an increase in some number rather than just an increase in cell size.

148
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:09,850
And in order to understand how cancer is abnormal, we need to review a little bit about normal growth.

149
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:16,300
So normal growth refers to an increase in size, so it can be applicable to individual cells,

150
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:21,100
groups of cells and tissues, whole organs, parts of organisms or whole organisms.

151
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,250
So it can occur by multiplication, which is an increase in cell number, which is what goes awry in cancer.

152
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:34,390
It can also be an increase in the size of cellular components, an increase in intracellular material or some combination of the above.

153
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,800
So in normal growth and development, there are three requirements.

154
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:44,130
You have a carefully regulated increase in cell number differentiation of appropriate cell types.

155
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:50,980
Do you know what I mean by that? So if you have a whole organ, you're going to have, you know, epithelial cells, you're going to have stroma,

156
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:57,100
you're going to have all kinds of different pieces that come together, like different cell types that come together to make a liver.

157
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,990
Right. And so differentiation of all of those appropriate cell types is really important,

158
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:07,030
careful spacial arrangement of the correct number of the correct cell types.

159
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,969
Right? So in order to make a liver, everything has to be in the right place.

160
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:17,270
You got to have the right kind of cells and they all have to be in the right place. So some definitions.

161
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:21,080
A lot of us you probably already know. DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid.

162
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,760
I said it correctly. It's DNA forever carries the unit.

163
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:32,000
Genetic information in the cells of a gene is a portion of a cell's DNA.

164
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,930
Genes are coded instructions for making things the body needs.

165
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:45,500
Basically, proteins and genes are packaged in chromosomes, and the human genome is a complete copy of the entire set of human gene instructions.

166
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,950
So this is a picture of what I just said. Right.

167
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:55,159
So the DNA is here. It has these little base pairs, sections of it.

168
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,479
Our genes, like a region of the DNA, is genes. There's a gene excuse me.

169
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,900
And then it's packaged in a chromosome. So it's all kind of wound up into a chromosome.

170
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,940
And then the chromosomes are in the nucleus of the cell. All right.

171
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:14,240
So chromosomes are made of DNA. Like we said, it contains only four chemical bases or building blocks.

172
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,530
Those are and g for short adenine thymine cytosine.

173
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:23,090
And there are roughly 3.2 billion chemical bases in the human genome.

174
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,610
Each DNA molecule is made up of two long complementary strands which are intertwined like a rope.

175
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:33,409
And that's the famous double helix, since it always pairs with T and C with G,

176
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,850
the order on one DNA strand dictates the order on the other, and that's called base pairing.

177
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,880
And that's what enables the genome to make copies of itself.

178
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:47,419
Basically, it kind of opens up the chromosome and then you can make a copy based on the one half that you have,

179
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:57,660
and then you end up with two different. So mutations occur because the order of the pairs is extremely important in the DNA.

180
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,660
If the pairs are switched, dropped or repeated,

181
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,980
you get changes in the coatings due to changes in the proteins that are made, and that is a genetic mutation.

182
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:15,930
These can be disease causing or harmless. So neutral mutations, errors in the chromosomes can also happen where parts of a chromosome break off.

183
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,750
That's called a deletion. They might switch with another or they get swapped within the same chromosome.

184
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,960
Those are called translocations and those are actually doing that. Right.

185
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:29,430
That's not just a couple of things. They're so different. That's like a huge a huge mistake.

186
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,120
Right? You're losing an entire part of a chromosome. You're losing probably multiple genes.

187
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:42,629
So that's that's very bad. And that happens quite a bit, particularly in the later later stages of later in the natural history of cancer.

188
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:50,690
You see a lot of that kind of mass. So just as an illustration, this is an old, ugly slide, but I like it.

189
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:58,189
If this is the normal DNA, says cat, cat, cat, the protein, the coating is always in these threes, right?

190
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:05,929
That's the frame that it reads from. So a set of three base pairs tells you what amino acid to use.

191
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,550
And amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.

192
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:15,590
Okay, so this is cat cat cat. If you get a change in one base, you have cat cat.

193
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,129
Okay. So you still have the right frame. These two cats still read correctly.

194
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:26,930
This one is just messed up. Here. If you added two g's, now you've got cat.

195
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,899
CAG, get the act. Right.

196
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:38,120
So now if you if you shifted your frame, that's called a frame shift mutation because you've only added two pairs and it reads it in threes.

197
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,210
And so now you've got a bigger problem downstream of that addition.

198
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:48,310
If you now said, let's say we deleted two, same kind of problem, right?

199
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,670
This is another kind of friendship mutation because you've got cat, cat, right?

200
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,890
So now it's reading the threes and correctly after that. That makes sense.

201
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,420
Okay. So let's talk briefly about the cell cycle. These are the critical steps in cell division excuse me.

202
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,800
The critical steps in cell division include ensuring accurate doubling of a cell's genetic information.

203
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,700
So the genetic information is segregated and separated into the two daughter cells.

204
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,600
This is where things can go wrong. Right. And often do.

205
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:24,400
So resting cells are said to be in G0. After that, there's interphase.

206
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,900
So after appropriate stimulation, including from growth,

207
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:36,410
including from growth factors which we will talk about ag0 cell moves into G1, which is a phase of preparation for cell division.

208
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:42,410
Then you get a s phase, which refers to the period when there are semi conservative replication of the nuclear DNA.

209
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,800
And at the end of space cell enters a second gap period.

210
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:52,850
And then you get mitosis phase where the duplicated DNA separates into the daughter chromosomes and to nuclear.

211
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,590
I'm not going to ask you to remember this in detail or memorize this.

212
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:03,020
Okay. It's to understand. So this is just a picture of the same thing.

213
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,450
Right. You're in. Where do we start?

214
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,050
Here's the beginning. Cell enlarges and makes new proteins in g one.

215
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,990
This is a restriction point where the cell decides whether it's to commit itself to the complete cycle or not.

216
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,309
It can decide not to if it recognizes things are wrong. The cell replicates.

217
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,520
DNA prepares to divide and then divides.

218
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:35,550
Entertain themselves. So now we need to talk about apoptosis, which is a physiological process that results in the deletion of individual cells.

219
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,620
This is a normal process.

220
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:46,340
It's an important process and it's a mechanism of growth control.

221
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:53,840
Right. So reduced AFM Ptosis contributes to cell accumulation, which is part of neoplasia.

222
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,970
Or neoplasia is the development of cancer. Right.

223
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:04,380
If you have too much apoptosis, it can contribute to cell loss, which is atrophy, which is not the focus of this class.

224
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:12,580
Right. But everything has to be in balance. Right. If any, if it's too far in either direction, you have something abnormal going on right now.

225
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:19,600
If ptosis has to be distinguished from necrosis, which is an abnormal process, this is pathological.

226
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:25,420
Okay? This is where cells and tissues die in a living organism with failure of membrane integrity.

227
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:31,540
So in able ptosis cell death results from energy dependent, metabolically active,

228
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:38,920
endogenous cellular processes were membrane integrity is maintained and the dying cells don't elicit an inflammatory reaction.

229
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,189
Okay, so apoptosis is normal. We want that.

230
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:48,280
It's really important. Necrosis is not normal. And then you get a lot of inflammation, bad stuff.

231
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:55,770
All right. So all of this is maintained by control systems.

232
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,110
All right. So these are the processes of differentiation and growth, including the cell cycle and apoptosis.

233
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,190
They're all regulated by many different levels of control mechanisms,

234
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:09,540
both by positive factors that stimulate a process and negative factors that inhibit it.

235
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,580
Biochemical pathways are the regulators. They are the control system.

236
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,180
They can act as the accelerator or as the brake to ensure correct functions.

237
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:24,270
We're going to start a car metaphor here. It's going to be great. We're going to love Tuesday morning, car metaphor, good stuff.

238
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:30,270
So those biochemical pathways are themselves controlled by positive and negative factors.

239
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:37,380
All of the components of these pathways are the protein products of genes that are also controlled by positive and negative factors.

240
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:41,670
So all of this, like every level, has things that influence that either way.

241
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,790
So this is like a picture of what I just said. So let's say you have a growth factor.

242
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,260
This growth factor binds to a receptor on the surface of the cell.

243
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,600
When that binding happens,

244
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:05,190
signaling enzymes are created that tell the cell that activate transcription factors and tell the cell to go ahead and divide.

245
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,270
Right. So if you have too much growth factor.

246
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,840
You could have too much cell replication, right?

247
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:21,940
The growth factor is controlled by genes. It is a protein product of genes, right?

248
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,810
The receptor is a protein product of genes. What if you have too much receptor?

249
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,230
What if your receptor is faulty and it doesn't?

250
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:35,800
You know, the growth factor can't bind with it appropriately, then you might not have enough cell replication.

251
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,370
Right. What if these signaling enzymes are also the protein products of genes?

252
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:45,950
So what if they don't? They're wrong. Somehow they don't cause transcription there.

253
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:53,999
There are too many of them. There's too much, right? And you get too much transcription so you can see how like changes in the genes

254
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,280
all along this pathway could increase risk of cancer or decrease risk of cancer.

255
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,000
Right. Growth factors can be endogenous.

256
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,750
They are endogenous things that you need. Right. Estrogen as a growth factor.

257
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,190
Thyroid hormone is a growth factor. All of these things increase cell proliferation.

258
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:17,580
We know that you need them, obviously, but having more of them could increase risk of cancer.

259
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:24,220
Does that make sense? Okay.

260
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:32,640
Hypoplasia. Now we're going to talk about kind of the steps along the pathway from normal cells to cancer.

261
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,640
It's not just like a run off switch, right? It's a very continuous gradient.

262
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:50,610
We tend to put it in boxes representing normal hyperplasia, dysplasia, carcinoma in situ cancer stage one, cancer stage two.

263
00:25:50,610 --> 00:26:00,809
But it's not discrete, it's actually continuous. And we have created these bins, right, that we put them in.

264
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:06,300
But we're taking a continuous process and putting it into kind of this discrete, these discrete categories.

265
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:15,740
So keep that in mind as we go through this hypoplasia detected through a microscopic examination of a biopsy specimen.

266
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:21,930
That's the other thing. All of these cellular changes are detected through microscopic examination of a biopsy specimen.

267
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:29,219
So you take a biopsy or you do surgery because you think someone actually has cancer and you take the organ out like they did with Chris Everett.

268
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,670
Right. And took out her whole uterus and ovaries.

269
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:41,390
And they looked at them under a microscope. Who looked at them? What kind of doctor does that?

270
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,510
All of you guys want to go to med school? Pathologist That's right.

271
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,310
So highly trained pathologists sit there, they look under a microscope and they say, Oh, this is normal.

272
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:57,560
Oh, this is hyperplasia. This is cancer stage two or stage one or stage three.

273
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:02,480
They decide. Right. So they're looking at something that is a continuous process and deciding what.

274
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:09,770
And then you could, in theory, get through different pathologists who would look at the same slide and put them in different bins.

275
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:18,440
If you have very well trained pathologists who have looked at things a million times, they probably will come up with the same answer.

276
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,750
Right? But not every pathologist is super well trained.

277
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,140
And so sometimes you'll get different. So just keep this in mind.

278
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:33,140
As an epidemiologist, as a cancer epidemiologist, I'm handed a data set that says, I've got 100 people.

279
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:37,550
I've got 25 stage one. 50, stage three.

280
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:41,960
Do you see them say now it looks like it's black and white.

281
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:49,819
Right. This is the answer. But that came from somebody sitting in a microscope and deciding from a

282
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,480
continuous process and just looking at it and deciding what they thought it was.

283
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:57,450
Yes, there are other means. Exactly right.

284
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:06,440
No apology. That's how we do.

285
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:12,850
That's how you do. That is how you diagnose cancer. You get a biopsy specimen and a pathologist looks at.

286
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,510
Sometimes. I think it was actually like.

287
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,870
I don't remember where I read this or in what context. So this is going to be a very bad story.

288
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:29,049
But there was some pathologist who was like who had a substance abuse problem and he

289
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:33,210
actually like misdiagnosed a bunch of people as not having cancer when they did.

290
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:38,350
And it was about right. So, I mean, so that is a problem, right?

291
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,610
I mean, it's a real thing.

292
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:47,200
When I write a paper in my method section, I say these slides were reviewed by highly trained genital urinary or a highly trained pattern pathologist.

293
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:55,960
Right. And, you know, so you have the fact that because people, pathologists can specialize in one particular area,

294
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,940
you can be a prostate pathologist, you could be a technologist at U of M Hospital.

295
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:09,309
They do specialize in that to that degree. Right. At a community hospital, they probably got a couple of pathologists who are reading everything.

296
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:12,160
Right, which is not to say that they aren't good at their job.

297
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:19,690
It's just that they may not be as good at one particular kind of cancer as the person who only looks at breast cancer day in and day out.

298
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:23,769
Right. All right. So we're talking about this process.

299
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,410
Hypoplasia is kind of the first step from normal.

300
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:32,500
It refers to tissue growth based on an excessive rate of cell division, leading to an increased number of cells.

301
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:41,079
So hyperplasia is just too many cells, right? The cell structure, the arrangement, all of that is still normal.

302
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,260
The cells are normal, their arrangement is horrible. There's just too many of them.

303
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:49,509
So it can be a normal tissue response to it irritating stimulus, hormonal stimulation,

304
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:55,090
chronic inflammation, or it can be the first step on the path to cancer and it could be worse, right?

305
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,180
Dysplasia is kind of the next step. This is a pretty malignant condition.

306
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:05,850
It can be a set of disorders that are kind of halfway between hyperplasia and neoplasia, which is cancer.

307
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:16,530
Dysplasia is associated with increased cell number, which could either be a consequence of too much cell proliferation or not enough cell death.

308
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:23,400
Right. So you can get too many you can get too many cells by having too much accelerator or not enough break.

309
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,950
Right. It's associated with you.

310
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,230
Now we're getting weird cells, right? Hypoplasia is just too many, but their normal dysplasia is.

311
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,200
Now you've got some nuclear abnormalities, some weird sizes and shapes of the nucleus.

312
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,970
This can be caused by lots of different insults. Physical, chemical, viral.

313
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:53,220
Could be reversible in its early stages. So this is what we mean when we say precancerous lesion.

314
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:58,290
This is what we're looking for in a lot of these screening tests where we're looking for a pre-cancerous lesion.

315
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,720
So lesions in the cervix, right?

316
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:07,200
So when you do a pap smear and they find a pre-cancerous lesion and they cut it out, it's a simple lesion that's a dysplastic lesion,

317
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,320
dysplasia in the middle, plastic, squamous epithelium, the bronchus and smoker's dysplasia, and Barrett's esophagus, polyps in the colon.

318
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:21,480
These are dysplastic precancerous lesions. Okay.

319
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,920
Carcinoma in situ. So this is like that.

320
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:33,730
Is it? Dysplasia is a cancer. We're going to we're just like one foot on either side of the line.

321
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,200
We're going to call it carcinoma in situ. So this is the most severe case of dysplasia.

322
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:42,040
So carcinoma in situ, in situ means in place.

323
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,030
So this refers to an uncontrolled growth of cells that remains in the original location.

324
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:51,309
Has it really invaded the basement membrane or stroma? But it may develop into an invasive cancer.

325
00:31:51,310 --> 00:32:01,690
So sometimes people have a stage zero cancer. I will tell you that some cancers this is counted as a cancer in the registry, some cancers it is not.

326
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:09,520
I can tell you, for example, prostate stage zero, you don't count that it's not in the registry of occurrence cancer stage one or excuse me,

327
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,270
bladder cancer carcinoma in certain is counted as a cancer.

328
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,439
And it's just about kind of the prognosis.

329
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,659
And, you know, so whether people count carcinoma as I do as cancer,

330
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:28,120
whereas pre cancer kind of depends on the cancer and its behavior in that particular site.

331
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:37,290
Does that make sense? OC neoplasia is cancer growth disorder characterized by genetic alterations that

332
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:40,709
lead to the loss of the normal control mechanisms that regulate cell growth,

333
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,480
morphogenesis and differentiation.

334
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:50,210
It's a multistep process involving the accumulation of genetic events in critical genes, including oncogene and tumor suppressor genes.

335
00:32:50,220 --> 00:33:00,550
And we're going to talk about those next. Okay. This is just a very ugly old picture that I still like of what we just talked about.

336
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,790
We've got normal cells there in a nice arrangement.

337
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:08,080
There's the correct number of them hypoplasia.

338
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:14,020
They all still look normal, but we have too many of them mild dysplasia.

339
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,580
Things are starting to look a little weird, sort of look a little funky.

340
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,700
Carcinoma in sight to severe dysplasia. Now the cells look extra funky, and there's still too many of them.

341
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:28,540
And then invasive cancers where they start to invade the basement membrane or the stroma.

342
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,250
Okay. Again, continuous process.

343
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:42,170
Somebody decides what box. These are the actual pictures the pathologists would look at, which is why I think that they're actually wizards.

344
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:50,130
You go to go to medical school, you tell me. I expect you to tell me if it's actually like Hogwarts, because this just looks purple.

345
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:58,080
And frankly, it's amazing. I mean, they can literally look at one of these HD slides and be like, Oh, that's this kind of tissue.

346
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,770
Oh, that's that kind of tissue. Oh, there's this kind of tissue. But it has cancer.

347
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:06,960
It's unbelievable, honestly. So this is.

348
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:15,300
This is the esophagus. Okay, so this is normal, but you can see that there's all different kinds of cells, right?

349
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:20,810
You can see that there's kind of this membranous structure with these like in evolutions.

350
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:27,540
This is like the epithelium you've got stroma in here. This is all very normal.

351
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:33,870
Right. There's goblet cells, which I would not have been able to tell you as a cell if there wasn't this lovely note.

352
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:38,810
But you see what I'm saying? And the dark purple is the cell nucleus.

353
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,150
So that's how you can start to see if they're weird when when you look at them.

354
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:48,060
This is Barrett's esophagus. So this is that dysplastic lesion.

355
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:54,180
It doesn't look so nice anymore, right? We've got a ton of inflammatory cells.

356
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,550
It's not arranged quite the same way anymore. Looks a little messy.

357
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:04,210
Yeah. You know, if there's any technology that.

358
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:11,770
Yeah, people are working on imaging technology that can do that kind of thing,

359
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:15,920
but it's also being compared against the gold standard, which is pathologists.

360
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:22,420
So I mean, yeah, there are certainly things where like people will send.

361
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:31,569
Now with the ease of sending images know you can get people in more developing kind of places

362
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:36,470
that don't have the same expertize will find pictures to be produced by pathologists elsewhere.

363
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:40,480
But it's not we're not quite to an automated place yet.

364
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:47,230
And then this is cancer. You can just see it's a mess, right? It's a mess.

365
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,800
There's like weird big nuclei that are funny shaped.

366
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,240
So this is the actual kind of pictures that pathologists are looking at.

367
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:00,530
But I think what this tells you is that it does take a trained eye to tell.

368
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,990
Right. You're like, okay, I guess you're telling me that's what that is.

369
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,870
I sounds good. I couldn't do that. Right. And so you can imagine that with different levels of training, you might get slightly different answers.

370
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:18,130
Does that make sense? So if you find a good pathologist, be very nice.

371
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,190
They're your best friend. Okay.

372
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:27,280
So just a quick comparison of normal and cancer cells.

373
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:33,530
So in cancer, you have a large number of dividing cells. In normal cells, they should not all be dividing at the same time.

374
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,549
Right. You're going to get large variable shaped nuclei with cancer,

375
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:44,300
whereas normal it should be kind of smallish and they should all be pretty uniform in size and cancer.

376
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,950
You're going to have a small cytoplasm volume relative to the nuclei.

377
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,000
This is sort of saying the same thing, right?

378
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:57,930
You're going to get a lot of variation in cell size and shape with cancer with it, whereas they should all be pretty uniform in normal tissue.

379
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,490
In cancer, you're going to see loss of specialized cell features, right?

380
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,840
So if if I don't know what this is supposed to be like a nerve cell or something, I'm not even sure.

381
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:11,430
But it's got these specialized features, right, that should look like this.

382
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:16,330
But they get all kind of sad and truncated and cancer, right?

383
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,550
Starting to lose those.

384
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:24,790
You get a like just a disorganized arrangement of the cells in cancer, whereas they should be organized in a particular way in non-cancer.

385
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,520
We saw that on that previous slide and you get a very poorly defined tumor boundary in cancer.

386
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:38,160
So starts like moving into areas that it shouldn't be in. Now we're just going to really briefly touch on benign tumors.

387
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:45,420
The nine tumors are not cancer. They can still cause problems like particularly benign brain tumors.

388
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,900
Right. Because they're just in your brain pressing on things causing trouble.

389
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:52,590
Right. But they're not going to spread and kill you that way.

390
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,700
Right. So kind of the difference is here.

391
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:01,200
So malignant is cancer. Benign is not so benign.

392
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,929
Tumors are slow growing. They have few. Mitosis, a few. They're not they don't have a ton of like cell divisions going on.

393
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:13,110
At the same time, they have normal nuclear morphology and they're generally well encapsulated, meaning they're not invading.

394
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,570
Malignant tumors are very rapidly growing.

395
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:26,280
They can have a lot of mitosis. They're going to have abnormal nuclear morphology and they're going to have an irregular border.

396
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:34,380
Okay. So we're not really going to talk too much about benign tumors, but just to briefly kind of compare them to each other.

397
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,810
Benign tumors are not cancer for these reasons. That's not to say that if a benign tumor doesn't.

398
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:44,820
You mean, like I said, if it grows large enough, it can kind of impinge on other things and they can be a problem.

399
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,390
Right. But they're not going to metastasize.

400
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:57,530
So they will never invade, never metastasize. Ulceration and necrosis are rare, whereas the opposite is true for cancer.

401
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:03,320
All right. We've heard some of these words already, right?

402
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:09,100
Carcinomas. These are the most common types of cancer.

403
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:14,799
They arise from. The cells that cover the external and internal body surfaces along the breast.

404
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,460
Colon are the most frequent cancers of this type in the US.

405
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:22,990
Almost all of the cancers on those top ten lists that we've been talking about are carcinomas.

406
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:27,790
With the exception of I think there might be a lymphoma or a leukemia on there, those are different, right?

407
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:31,659
Sarcomas are quite rare except in the kids.

408
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:36,010
Remember, in the pediatric and adolescent tumors, we said sarcomas are one of the more common ones.

409
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:42,910
Those are cancers arising from cells found in the supporting tissues like bone, cartilage, fat, connective tissue and muscle.

410
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:49,520
So you can tell that none of the major cancers in adults really are sarcomas.

411
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:57,990
They're pretty uncommon. Lymphomas arise in the lymph nodes and the tissues of the immune system, and leukemias are cancer.

412
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,650
The immature blood cells that grow in the bone marrow and tend to accumulate in large numbers in the blood.

413
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:08,800
We tend to call the lymphomas and leukemia leukemias, liquid tumors or hematopoietic tumors.

414
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:18,340
Carcinomas and sarcomas tend to be called solid tumors. So if you hear people talk about solid tumors or liquid tumors or come out of poetic tumors,

415
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:22,060
that's the distinction that they're making, if that makes sense.

416
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,130
So carcinomas are the most mostly what we're going to be talking about.

417
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:38,720
All right. So let's talk about grade and stage, because these are really important for prognosis.

418
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:44,989
Tumor grade is the term used to denote the degree of differentiation of a tumor.

419
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:54,050
So it's the degree to which tumor cells resemble its normal counterpart as assessed by its pathological, morphological appearances by a pathologist.

420
00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:02,419
In general, low grade or well differentiated tumors have a less aggressive course than a high grade or poorly differentiated tumor.

421
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:06,559
So in both stage and grade, high is bad, right?

422
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,040
High is bad prognosis. Low is better prognosis.

423
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:16,140
Okay. So here is a picture of.

424
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,860
Prostate. This is normal prostate tissue, nice glandular structure.

425
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:28,330
You've got epithelia, you've got stroma. Normal.

426
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:34,150
Okay. This is a low grade prostate. For some reason, prostate tumors make little circles.

427
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:38,200
It's like they're trying bless their hearts to make glands, but they just can't.

428
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:44,170
So you end up with circles. So this is a low grade prostate cancer.

429
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:48,520
This would have a pretty good prognosis. This is a high grade tumor. It's a mess.

430
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,340
It doesn't look like anything. It's just a sheet of cells.

431
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,930
Probably the only way you would know that was prostate is because it came out of the prostate.

432
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,920
Right. Okay.

433
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:05,920
The other thing to point out on here is that there is like a generalized grading system, one, two, three,

434
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,680
four, where one is the well differentiated and four is the least differentiated and has the worst prognosis.

435
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:18,660
Some cancers have their own grading and staging systems. Prostate is one of them and has a grading system called the Gleason.

436
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:23,090
Some goes from two through ten. Don't worry about that.

437
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,230
If you if you start working on a particular cancer, you will learn those specifics.

438
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:34,030
It's just important to know that sometimes, like if you see, oh, this is the greatest reason, some you're like, well, why is it go from 2 to 10?

439
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:40,009
That's where it doesn't matter. You can map it back to the kind of general grading system they do that at the registry.

440
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:45,080
Don't do that. We reason some of that. Also, the grade one higher is always worse.

441
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:52,100
There's no grading system I know of. It's flipped because that would be stupid. But, you know, higher numbers worse, lower numbers better.

442
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:56,629
Some cancers have their own special grading system. Just important to know about.

443
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:02,290
And as you get involved in studying, if you get involved in studying individual cancers, you report now I.

444
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:15,800
So we talked about great stage. Stage is different in whispers to how far, how big the tumor is and how far it is spread.

445
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:22,370
You can get stage four, you can get clinical stage or pathologic stage.

446
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:30,709
So imagine you've got someone with a very large breast tumor, like pretty big symptoms spread to the lymph nodes.

447
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:34,010
Maybe that person's not going to get a mastectomy.

448
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:39,900
So you're not going to have a surgical specimen to look at.

449
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:43,680
You're not going to take the whole organ out and look at it to determine stage.

450
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:51,090
So that would be you would get your clinical and radiological assessment to determine stage at that point.

451
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:58,830
So that would be called clinical stage, pathological stages where you actually have a surgical specimen to look out.

452
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:08,650
All right. So keep in mind, if you as an epidemiologist got a database and it says stage, you only have one stage variable.

453
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,989
That's probably the best staging they could do based on either clinical or pathological.

454
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:20,140
So it might be a mix of the two. Often you would get like a clinical stage variable and a pathological stage variable.

455
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:28,269
And then the best guess I would talk a logical kind of overrides clinically because what might happen say

456
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:35,290
you think you've got a stage one prostate cancer based on radiology and clinical exam and all of that.

457
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:47,020
You go in and you do the the prostatectomy and you section up the prostate and look at the like you've actually stage to that stage after surgery.

458
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:54,280
That happens a fair bit. Right. And so that then the correct the most correct stage would be to.

459
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,280
So just keep in mind, there's kind of one pathological.

460
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:01,740
Generally pathological is better.

461
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:08,010
But if you've got someone with metastatic cancer, clearly that's a stage for you're not going to do surgery on that person.

462
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:14,040
Right. Okay. So here's a picture of a prostate.

463
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,840
Well, it's a picture more than a prostate. This is like a cross-section of a man. Right?

464
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:25,620
So you've got the bladder. This is the prostate right here. Anyone who's ever described the prostate has described it as a voluntary plan.

465
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,240
There it is. One up to plan. The urethra passes through it.

466
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:35,309
Okay. And so this is kind of a zoom in.

467
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:37,090
And here's a tiny spot of cancer.

468
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:45,900
That's a stage one, very small, still in the organ to organ of origin, stage to bigger, but still in the organ of origin.

469
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:53,850
Stage three It has maybe moved outside the prostate to the bladder, to the some of the vessels.

470
00:45:55,770 --> 00:46:00,180
Stage four. It's in the lymph nodes and has spread distantly to other organs.

471
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:08,250
Stage four has a worse prognosis than stage one. Tell me this.

472
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:16,990
Can you have a stage one cancer that is high grade. Yeah.

473
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:20,930
I see you nodding like that. So. Yes. Right.

474
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:27,290
So great. It's just about how organized the cells are and how much they look like prostate cells.

475
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:30,830
You can have a very small tumor that is high grade.

476
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:35,459
Right. And you make a doctor my case to treat that differently.

477
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:41,300
You get a small tumor that's low grade. Right. Because it has a more aggressive potential, even though it's still very small.

478
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,240
So stage and grade are both prognostic indicators.

479
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:51,720
But they are they can be in the. Does that make sense?

480
00:46:53,400 --> 00:47:01,410
If you've got a tumor that was slow growing but was left there for a long time, you could have a low grade tumor that's in stage three or four, right?

481
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,110
And all of those decisions are part of how clinicians make treatment.

482
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,980
All of this information is part of how clinicians make treatment decisions, right.

483
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:18,780
These are prognostic indicators. They have others. Right. But these are kind of the tried and true prognostic indicators.

484
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,280
All right. So this is just explaining staging.

485
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,030
There are different staging systems, just like there's different grading systems.

486
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,800
You're going to hear like one through four. It's kind of like the summary stage that registers use.

487
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:37,420
You may also hear about TNM staging, which is a little bit more information.

488
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:42,220
So t tells you about the size of the tumor. So you get t0 t one, two, two, three.

489
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:49,540
Some will also have like t 181 B that kind of like even subdivide the ones and twos

490
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:55,510
and threes and will tell you if there is lymph node involvement and how many.

491
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:01,850
So. This is for her breast cancer.

492
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:06,560
One, two and three. Mean like particular lymph nodes.

493
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:11,819
And then that means if there is or is not, it's just zero one.

494
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:15,510
Is there or is there not metastasis to stop atrocities?

495
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:21,660
So you can have like at2 and one and zero cancer, right?

496
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:29,770
So it's just a little bit more information. So I'm not asking you to memorize this again.

497
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:33,070
I want you to just know that there are these different staging systems.

498
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:36,820
If you see like t something and something and something you're not going to like.

499
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,370
And then again, you can kind of map that back to just a general come through for that.

500
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:47,890
You can sort of compare across cancers. Does that make sense? Hyers always works.

501
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:58,610
All right. So these terms are important as they enable the clinician to make some prediction of the likely prognosis

502
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:03,020
of a patient and their frequently essential information for the logical planning of treatment.

503
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:07,880
So now let's talk briefly about the hallmarks of cancer.

504
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:13,470
This is sort of a seminal paper that came out in 2000. So it seems a little old at this point.

505
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:19,040
They've actually put out an update since then that I'm going to tell you about, too. But this was a big paper, Hanrahan and Lindberg.

506
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:24,049
And they came out with these things that they said are the kind of biological hallmarks of cancer.

507
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:31,550
So they are self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to anti growth signals, evasion of apoptosis,

508
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:38,360
unrestricted replication, sustained angiogenesis and tissue invasion and metastasis.

509
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:44,660
Do you guys know what angiogenesis means? Angiogenesis is the creation of new blood vessels.

510
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:50,000
So once a tumor gets large enough, it needs its own blood supply. Right.

511
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:59,480
And so in order to continue to grow and spread, it needs like blood vessels to be formed in order to supply it with the blood of these.

512
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:07,850
And it's the angiogenesis is kind of a big deal in that it's like a big piece of the metastasis process, right?

513
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,710
Without angiogenesis, the tumor doesn't actually spread. Okay.

514
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:18,440
This is just a kind of a picture of that same thing. So these are the biological hallmarks of cancer.

515
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:25,580
So when we start talking about oncogene and tumor suppressor genes, these like very key cancer related genes,

516
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:30,950
when, when you get mutations in those, that's how you kind of progress through the stages of cancer.

517
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:39,290
All of those genes do something in here. They're all related to these very key, important biological processes.

518
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:43,850
Right. P53 controls, able ptosis. Right.

519
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:53,170
Does that make sense? Okay. So Carcinogenesis is the process by which a normal cell is converted to a cancer cell?

520
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:58,540
A neoplastic cell carcinogen is an agent that can cause neoplasia.

521
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:07,330
So these can be genotoxic or non genotoxic. Genotoxic carcinogens directly affect the DNA they cause them.

522
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:16,330
The mutations in those important cancer causing genes right non DNA toxic are more common.

523
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,580
They promote the spread of existing mutations.

524
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:27,400
Most neoplasms occur as a consequence of environmental exposures and epidemiological and experimental studies provide insight into this.

525
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:31,230
Okay, so remember our little pathway here with growth factors.

526
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:38,250
If you have too much of this growth factor, is that a gene, a toxic or a non genotoxic carcinogen?

527
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:46,220
Do you think? Is it directly causing a mutation in an important cancer related gene in the DNA?

528
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:53,160
Or is it helping to promote the proliferation of existing limitations?

529
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:11,030
Yeah. I agree that is non genotoxic.

530
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:14,960
So it's a growth factor that's going to kind of push this cell to replicate more.

531
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:25,570
If there's already a mutation in here, it's going to get replicated more and more quickly because you have more growth factor.

532
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:30,570
Does that make sense? So. You can see how this happens.

533
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,630
Does anybody have an example that they know of? Of a genotoxic?

534
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:43,620
Carcinogen. Radiation exposure to radiation and toxic right.

535
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,740
Directly affects the DNA.

536
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:56,370
Aflatoxin is another one. Aflatoxin that is aflatoxin is a toxin that grows and grows in mold.

537
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:05,540
And a lot of liver cancer in developing parts of the world is caused by aflatoxin exposure because people will eat moldy grains, right?

538
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:10,979
Because food is scarce and they'll have this grain that they grew and they only have so much to eat.

539
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,890
And if it's not stored properly, making it moldy and people eat it anywhere,

540
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:21,090
you can think that will come out of cancer like it's a potent percentage and that actually causes a particular mutation.

541
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,950
You can actually like look at the cells in the liver and be like, Yeah, that mutation is there.

542
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:30,090
That's an aflatoxin related. Cigaret smoke. Right.

543
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:36,150
Direct carcinogen. All right.

544
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,969
So an agent is considered a carcinogen if it's evaluated.

545
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:46,140
But I ask our friends to put out our pretty global cam mapping system and found to be a carcinogen

546
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:51,660
or a potential carcinogen or it's listed by these other administrations as a carcinogen.

547
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:56,880
So let's talk briefly about fire classification. You've got group one through group four.

548
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:01,560
Group one is definitely carcinogenic. Group four is probably not.

549
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:05,040
And then the other stuff in there is like gradients, right?

550
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:09,660
I love how there's literally only one in there for not carcinogenic,

551
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:15,870
but it makes sense if you think about it because they're evaluating things that there's some reason to think they might be carcinogenic.

552
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:21,929
And you probably have to have a lot of evidence that something doesn't cause cancer to be like,

553
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:26,880
Actually, no, this is cool, just like running on yourself or whatever, so don't worry about it.

554
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:37,650
Yeah. I don't actually know. You can go. Look, I you know, you can go look at the list of carcinogens if you want, but there's stuff on there.

555
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:41,400
You're going to be like, oh, like estrogen is on there.

556
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:45,750
Right. Nothing we can do about that. Some of us just have that.

557
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:50,040
Stephanie, you just can't you can't change that. We just have it going on.

558
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:58,650
Yes. Group three like things like yeah,

559
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,280
group three is probably things where there was some hint that it might be like

560
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:07,200
maybe in cell culture it does something that seems like it could cause cancer,

561
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:11,610
but there's just not enough evidence to say for sure yes or no.

562
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:18,050
How did they get. I don't actually know all of the details.

563
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:19,870
You could probably go read on the IRS website.

564
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:25,480
I could tell you a lot about the process, but it's all like expert panels that are reviewing the literature.

565
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:30,879
And so it's some amount of, I would guess,

566
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:39,910
group three probably just has animal evidence and Group two has some human evidence, but it's not strong, is my guess.

567
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:51,080
But yeah, this is a little scare the pants off you and make you want to just wrap yourself in a little bubble and not touch anything anymore.

568
00:55:54,440 --> 00:56:04,440
But. Keep in mind, this is ranking these things according to the strength of the evidence, not the strength of the carcinogen.

569
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:08,880
Okay. So, for example, does anybody remember this from 2015,

570
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:16,980
this like hullabaloo that happens in the media about bacon and like all over social media, everyone's like, I'm still going to eat bacon.

571
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:20,520
I love bacon, blah, blah, blah, because this was like in the middle of the whole like CrossFit.

572
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:29,640
I don't know what is it not primal but like paleo thing where everyone is like bacon is great, you know?

573
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:40,769
So everyone was very excited or upset because I put processed meats like bacon in the same category of cancer risk as to build tobacco,

574
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:49,389
smoking and as substance. Right. So the strength of the evidence that components of processed meat can cause cancer

575
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:54,340
is the same as the strength of the evidence that tobacco and asbestos cause cancer.

576
00:56:54,670 --> 00:57:00,460
That does not mean that the strength of the association between baking and cancer is the same as tobacco.

577
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:06,790
Right. So the smoking among cancer relative risks are like 20 to 25.

578
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:11,180
If you smoke, your risk of lung cancer is 20 to 25 times that of someone who does not smoke.

579
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:21,980
If you eat a lot of a lot of bacon and processed meat, like a lot, your risk of colon cancer is 17% higher,

580
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:29,840
1.17 times that of a person who does not get that is clearly not the same thing.

581
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:34,460
Right? Like I don't smoke cigarets occasionally have some bacon.

582
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:42,320
Right. But they're in the same category according to I, because it's about the strength of the evidence that there's a biological association.

583
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:53,900
Does that make sense? So like when people get very confused and when the lay press reports on this, everybody gets very confused.

584
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:57,590
And it's like a bad it's a bad public health messaging. Right.

585
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:06,170
So you can now be that pedantic jerk on social media is like actually part of the media.

586
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:11,770
I expected of you. Now that you put it in my class, go forth.

587
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:17,620
And correct people who are around on the Internet. Full time job.

588
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:28,030
All right. Gene mutations in cancer. So mutations in genes that control normal cell proliferation can lead to cancer.

589
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:32,080
So that's what we've been talking about right now. The understand the normal way things go.

590
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,590
It's mutations in those very important processes that cause cancer.

591
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:42,640
Like we said, some mutations are caused by these DNA damaging carcinogens, but some are just spontaneous errors.

592
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:45,550
Right. It can't just be bad luck.

593
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:57,190
Mutations contributing to cancer in general affect three classes of genes oncogene, tumor suppressor genes, DNA repair genes and good genes.

594
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:02,770
I've just made them into a bullet list here. Same thing. So let's talk about tumor suppressor genes first.

595
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,400
These are we're doing our part. But for now, guys, super exciting.

596
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:14,110
These are the breaks. They're a family of normal genes that instruct cells to produce proteins that restrain cell division and growth.

597
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:19,520
The loss of these proteins allows itself to divide in an uncontrolled fashion.

598
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:26,030
You have to lose both copies of the gene to lose the function. Imagine like the ones a backup, right?

599
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:29,930
Right. If you have two copies, one of them is working. You still have the protein you need.

600
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:35,479
The loss of tumor suppressor gene function is like having a brake cut that does not function properly.

601
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:40,850
So the cell grows and divides continually. Oncogene is, on the other hand of the accelerator.

602
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:48,020
Their genes, whose presence in certain forms and or or overactivity can stimulate the development of cancer.

603
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:52,220
So when they arise in normal cells, they can cause the cells to become malignant.

604
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,700
They make these proteins that stimulate excessive cell growth and division.

605
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,520
So again, oncogenes are normal proteins.

606
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:06,380
So when they are behaving normally, they are called proton packages, proton, and when they mutate, then they are oncogenes.

607
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:14,059
Does that make sense? And then you've got the mechanics, the DNA repair genes.

608
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:19,250
So these code for proteins whose normal function is correct, errors that arise when cells duplicate their DNA.

609
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:29,030
So if you have mutations of DNA repair genes, if you get a mutation in a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, it will not be fixed appropriately.

610
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:33,810
And therefore, you're probably you're going to go out and get cancer.

611
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:37,579
Does that make sense? So DNA repair genes don't cause cancer themselves.

612
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:42,590
You have to have those oncogenes and tumor suppressor gene mutations, but these allow them to go unfixed.

613
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,400
Yeah. Okay.

614
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:53,020
So cancer involves multiple of these events. It's not just one mutation that causes cancer.

615
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:58,300
In fact, they think that it's 3 to 7 mutations for you to get metastatic cancer.

616
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:03,129
And this is called multi-stage carcinogenesis. Okay.

617
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:08,590
So creating a cancer cell requires that you have mutations in both tumor suppressor genes and omega genes.

618
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:14,380
You have to have the brakes released at the same time, the accelerator stuck down to actually get cancer.

619
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:18,640
And 3 to 7 of these changes leads to a malignant tumor.

620
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:24,340
So, for example, you've got normal cells. Oops, we have a mutation.

621
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:30,580
All of that cells, daughter cells will have that mutation if one of those cells acquires a second mutation.

622
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:34,959
All of the outer cells will have that second mutation and so on and so forth until

623
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,470
you end up with malignant cells that have between three and seven mutations.

624
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:46,080
Okay. Here is like a nicer example.

625
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:51,150
It's a little bit like a snowball rolling down a hill, right?

626
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:55,799
This process speeds up as you accumulate more mutations.

627
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:01,170
So say you've got a normal cell, but a mutation inactivates a tumor suppressor gene so the cells proliferate.

628
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:09,780
These are like normal cells, but you have too many of them. What's that called? Hyperplasia.

629
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:13,320
Exactly right. Oops. Well, you just.

630
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:17,170
It's kind of going fast now. Right. So. Got a lot of.

631
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:23,820
Every time a cell divides and replicates its DNA, there is the possibility of an error.

632
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:29,040
Right. And so you just. If it's going faster, you have more possibilities.

633
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:34,320
Right. Just more chances and. Oops, unit inactivated, DNA repair gene now.

634
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:40,890
So we're still going faster. More chances. And now we're not correcting mistakes appropriately.

635
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:45,960
And now you've got a mutation of a pro-democracy, creating an oncogene.

636
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:50,940
Now things are going even faster and you're not correcting mistakes.

637
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:57,090
And so you end up with several more tumor suppressor genes and activity and you get cancer.

638
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:04,470
Does that make sense? Either kind of accelerates the process and you end up with way more mutations like the further along you get.

639
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:12,940
Okay. And this is why age is the number one risk factor for these cancers.

640
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:21,519
Right. It takes a lifetime of exposures and DNA replication to accumulate the 3 to 7 hits.

641
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,800
You need to end up with cancer. Right.

642
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:36,960
That's why age is the number one risk factor. Here is an example of the natural history of colon cancer.

643
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:42,750
Remember who I told you worked in a science lab?

644
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:50,180
That's our fearless leader, Eric. Kieran. All right, so normal epithelium, you lose APC.

645
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:55,319
That's the tumor suppressor. Genes are in blue and allergies are not so APC.

646
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:58,620
Very well known tumor suppressor genes.

647
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:08,350
You lose that is kind of the first step toward. Colorectal Carcinogenesis This is colorectal tumorigenesis.

648
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:11,560
So then you've got hyper proliferative epithelium, you've got hyper.

649
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:16,600
Pleasure. Which can give you an early adenoma and adenoma.

650
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:19,910
Apollo so early polyps. Okay. Oops.

651
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:23,210
Now we've activated Crouse. You get an intermediate adenoma.

652
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:30,770
You delete 18 Q So this is one of those deletions. Q and P refer to which arm of the chromosome you're talking about.

653
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:35,790
And so on. Chromosome 18, like a whole arm just got like. Pulled up.

654
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,750
That's bad. So then you end up with the late adenoma. You lose p53.

655
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:46,120
Bad news, bears, carcinoma, other things. And then metastasis.

656
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:54,970
We know about this for colon cancer and can map it pretty well because we actually have the precancerous lesion, right?

657
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:02,620
Other things we can't map quite as clearly, at least in the very early stages, because often you only end up with like the stage four tumors.

658
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:09,269
Right. But these are kind of the canonical things that have these are the checkpoint mutations

659
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:13,890
that have to go wrong in order to kind of move to that next step of cancer from cancer.

660
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:21,160
So it's really rare for a carcinogen to act by itself to be both necessary and sufficient

661
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:26,830
genetic variability in a population and other host factors contribute to carcinogenesis.

662
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:29,229
So we showed you this picture in the introductory lecture.

663
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:37,150
Right next lecture, we're going to talk about these cancers, these hereditary syndromes, like the BRCA1 mutation that they mentioned at the beginning.

664
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:41,469
Right? These things are so such powerful mutations.

665
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:46,299
They are generally mutations in those that you're born with. And those aren't good genes in tumor suppressor genes.

666
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:52,240
Right. So you're basically born with a big hit already like that first step is done when you're born.

667
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:57,379
So that's why it happens so much more commonly in young people like cancer.

668
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:03,130
It occurs much younger in people with hereditary syndromes. And the role of the environment is kind of secondary, right?

669
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:07,750
If you're born with one of those mutations, it's already such a big hit that the lifetime risk is very, very high.

670
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:12,600
And then this is kind of like most of the population.

671
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:16,939
This is very rare. This is kind of most people. There's the general population.

672
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:22,310
There's some people who have mutations that make them a little more susceptible or a little more resistant to those environmental exposures.

673
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:26,510
Right. Here's a really good example of this.

674
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:35,990
And I will say that these hereditary mutations these are mutations, like we said, in those oncogene tumor suppressor genes,

675
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:40,130
DNA repair genes in those three classes of genes that are very canonically related to cancer.

676
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:53,060
These genetic susceptibility genes or resistance genes are in genes that alter how you respond to environmental or other carcinogens.

677
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:55,430
So that's what we're going to look at here.

678
01:06:55,460 --> 01:07:04,520
So this is a figure from a paper looking at the association between smoking intensity measured as cigarets per day and bladder cancer risk.

679
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:10,340
So this is the odds ratio of bladder cancer. So there are relevant there reference group here is never smokers, so their odds ratio is one.

680
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:16,670
And then as you go up in cigarets per day, the odds ratio for bladder cancer increases.

681
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,700
Okay. But they have stratified this by gnats to genotype.

682
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:25,140
So let me show you here. This is like a biological pathway over here.

683
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:29,110
Okay. So we know that erosion means cause bladder cancer.

684
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:32,860
One of the sources of that is tobacco smoke.

685
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:45,740
So if we're going to go down the path toward malignant transformation, toward cancer in the liver, the two gene activates and hydroxyl amines.

686
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:50,380
They get into circulation, they end up in the bladder and they get activated locally.

687
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:53,360
But there's not one gene, and then they cause DNA attacks.

688
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:59,950
So this is a direct carcinogen, and then you end up with mutations in important genes and malignant transformation.

689
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:09,670
Okay. But this is very common that like some sort of chemical will come into the body and it is either activated or detoxified by these enzymes.

690
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,559
Okay. This is totally this is how this is how you metabolize drugs.

691
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:17,980
It's how you metabolize cigaret smoke. It's how you metabolize vitamins.

692
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:21,250
Like, literally everything that comes into your body kind of goes through these processes.

693
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:28,360
Or the Arab women can be detoxified by Matt too.

694
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:33,050
And then you just pick it out and it doesn't do anything. All right.

695
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:39,670
So if you have an active 72 enzyme, you're more likely to go down this path if you have a very active net, too.

696
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:44,299
Based on your genotype, you're much more likely to go down this path and not get cancer.

697
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:51,890
And that is shown here. So people who are not to slow acetylation those people are more likely to go down this pathway.

698
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:59,479
And with increasing the dark blue, with increasing cigarets per day, their bladder cancer risk increases quite a lot.

699
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:07,610
And it is statistically significant because the bottom of this confidence interval does not reach the line of one right.

700
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:15,030
But the light blue are the rapid ascent later. So these are the people who go down this path and not get cancer.

701
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:17,909
And lo and behold, their risk is elevated a bit,

702
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:22,350
but it never really becomes statistically significant and definitely lower than the slow accelerators.

703
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:31,590
That's pretty cool, huh? That's a very clear gene environment interaction for cancer risk.

704
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:40,619
And so you can sort of label this with like these are maybe the intermediate oscillators might be kind of the general population,

705
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:44,099
rapid acetylation might be here and like slow as there might be a little bit more

706
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:52,340
susceptible if you never smoked or were never exposed to what was an error,

707
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:55,440
which means it doesn't matter what your natural phenotype does.

708
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,730
Does your nap phenotype influence your cancer risk if you never exposed to early means?

709
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:14,349
No right that that's to genotype is determining how you respond to that exposure.

710
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:17,860
So if you're never exposed, kind of doesn't matter. Does that make sense?

711
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:21,520
So that's why it's very different than these hereditary cancers.

712
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,610
It's about how your the role of exposure is very important.

713
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:29,140
Right? You still have to be exposed to the thing to the carcinogen,

714
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:38,620
whereas with the hereditary cancers like they've got that if the kid is already in the anchor gene, tumor suppressor beta gene or DNA repair gene.

715
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:43,060
So it kind of doesn't matter. That makes sense.

716
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:48,650
Okay. How do we know about all this? This is.

717
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:58,160
You know, we started off kind of in the 1980s with these very rudimentary genetic studies looking at linkage mapping.

718
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:04,940
In the 1980s, we started with candidate gene studies, right? So we we thought to ourselves, hey, I know what this gene does.

719
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:10,250
It does something that I think might be related to cancer risk. So I'm going to look at this gene in relation to cancer risk.

720
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,270
But of course, there's a lot we didn't know about the genome.

721
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:23,060
And so as we as the technology improved, then we were able to do genome wide approaches right where we can measure the whole genome.

722
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:28,460
This is called an agnostic approach, right? Genome wide association studies are an agnostic type of study.

723
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:32,630
How many people have heard about these or learned about them? A bit. Okay.

724
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,880
So like I said, the candidate gene studies know what the gene is and what it does.

725
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:44,060
So you're going to look at that variation in that gene and risk of cancer, but maybe you don't know as much as you thought you did.

726
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:51,499
So a genome wide approach means I'm just going to measure the whole genome, not necessarily every single base pair,

727
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:57,979
because there's a lot of linkage, disequilibrium, meaning like people who have red hair have green eyes, right?

728
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:01,540
So there's a lot of like if you have one gene, you are very likely to have the other.

729
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:04,700
So there's very clever ways that you can only measure a subset of the genes,

730
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:11,510
but still have all the information taking advantage of that over that that relatedness.

731
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:19,009
Does that make sense? So you essentially match the whole genome and then you look at all of the genes in relation to cancer risk,

732
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:23,329
and you use statistics to see kind of what floats up to the top and the most

733
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:26,360
statistically significant things or sometimes things you wouldn't have thought of.

734
01:12:27,230 --> 01:12:29,959
Right. And so that has actually helped.

735
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:35,660
Then what people do is they go back and try to figure out functionally what that gene is doing or what functional gene

736
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:42,010
is in linkage disequilibrium with to try to figure out exactly what the biological basis of this relationship is.

737
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:46,420
So we've actually had some success with that, learned quite a bit with that.

738
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:54,640
And then we're now we're doing next generation sequencing, looking at rare variants, whole exome sequencing, lots of crazy stuff.

739
01:12:56,650 --> 01:13:03,540
So. This graph is showing you the phenotypic effect size, right?

740
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:07,229
So if you have this gene, how likely are you to get cancer?

741
01:13:07,230 --> 01:13:10,469
But Punnett penetrance means the probability of getting the disease.

742
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:17,580
If you have the gene so high, penetrance means that you're almost 100% likely to get cancer if you have a mutation in this gene.

743
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:24,210
Whereas down here these are low penetrance. This is the population frequency, right?

744
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:26,490
Very rare in the population versus quite common.

745
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:35,220
And so what you have is that these are those genes that we're going to talk about next time that are these hereditary syndrome genes,

746
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:38,819
mutations in P53, APC, BRCA1 and two.

747
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:42,600
Right. We've heard of a lot of these before, but they're really uncommon.

748
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:48,420
And so they actually don't explain a lot of the cancer in the population because they're so rare.

749
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,620
Very few people's cancer are caused by these kinds of mutations.

750
01:13:54,120 --> 01:14:01,079
Then you have these common things out here, right? Moderate and low kind of trends are Meals on Wheels that are fairly common.

751
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:05,640
Actually, these are all very common. And these are more like those not two genes, right?

752
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:10,740
That change how you respond to environmental carcinogens and maybe make you more or less susceptible.

753
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,170
So the actual relative risk of cancer if you have these genes is not that high.

754
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:22,570
But they actually. Cause more cancer in the population just because they're so common.

755
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:27,130
Does that make sense? Okay. Did I see your hand?

756
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:32,650
Yeah. He has something. Yeah.

757
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:36,660
So we're going to get to that and we're going to get to it in the child testing.

758
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:45,480
Sure. Briefly. Testing for these kinds of genes is really what we've done in these writers, and it can be not that expensive.

759
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:52,350
Now, used to be very expensive now much less a couple hundred dollars for a chip that does like 30 to 60 kids.

760
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:58,860
The trouble is that now we're adding genes that might be more in here.

761
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:04,440
A lot of these genes, there's very clear clinical guidance about what to do.

762
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:14,150
If you have an APC mutation, they know you're supposed to like get tested and have prophylactic colectomy essentially

763
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:21,090
before you get colon cancer because you're like 100% likely if you start developing polyps,

764
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:29,280
you're going to get cancer. So if you start having polyposis colectomy, that's a similar for BRCA1 or two.

765
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:36,720
You know, there's like chemotherapy, you can do like Tamoxifen, things like that, or you can have a prophylactic mastectomy, right?

766
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:46,439
Just have your breast removed and your ovaries removed, you know, maybe, maybe think about planning to have children early and then have your ovaries.

767
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:52,980
And so there's clinical guidance about what to do because the risk is so high and they've been well studied.

768
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:59,709
Weeks now. Like we don't know what to tell you.

769
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:03,030
Like, the risk is moderate. Like, what do you tell them?

770
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:08,080
Are you going to tell someone to. I don't know exactly what cancer that was associated, but pretend it's breast.

771
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:13,030
Are you going to tell somebody to have their breast removed for a moderate risk?

772
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:17,650
I don't know. Maybe like we don't they haven't been well studied enough.

773
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:18,820
There's not clinical guidance.

774
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:24,940
And so there's kind of an ethical dilemma about should we be testing for them because what do you do with that information?

775
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:30,370
So that will be covered in a lot more detail in the genetic counseling lecture.

776
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:35,250
That's a lot of what genetic counselors do is like help people kind of pass through that information.

777
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:41,920
Do you want this many genes? Do you want that many genes? What should we test for?

778
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:49,629
The trouble now is we can cheaply test for so many that sometimes we're testing for things that we don't know what to tell people,

779
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:54,200
what to do if they have a mutation. When I sense.

780
01:16:57,290 --> 01:17:00,370
Okay. These are the ones we're finding. Would you?

781
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:04,100
US, right. These these were the ones we were finding in those earlier studies.

782
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:08,930
They were like the low hanging fruit. Right. It was really clear that they were a cancer related gene.

783
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:12,730
Super high and all the is kind of easy to find. And now we're down here.

784
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:19,490
The trouble is, the next thing is you need super high, big sample sizes to find these things.

785
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:27,770
So if something if your exposure is rare and your effect size is small, you need humongous sample sizes to find the thing.

786
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:33,100
Right. And so this is where we're struggling now to find these. Okay.

787
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:37,930
We have a couple more minutes. And I want to briefly go over cancer stem cell therapies that we've heard of this.

788
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,800
Okay. A couple of people. So stem cells.

789
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:47,870
Embryonic stem cells have the potential to develop into lots of different cell types in the body during development.

790
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:51,830
Adult stem cells are present in all your tissues.

791
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:56,180
They serve as an internal repair system, dividing without limit to replenish other cells.

792
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:03,680
So they're capable of renewing themselves through cell division, even after long periods of inactivity, under certain conditions,

793
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:08,600
conditions that can become tissue or organ specific cells, and their abundance differs by tissue type.

794
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:17,510
So conventional cancer theory states that any cell in the body can undergo these DNA changes, accumulate those three or seven hits and become cancer.

795
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:24,860
But a lot of researchers now think that because only normal stem cells reproduce themselves and are therefore around long enough

796
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:33,200
to accumulate those 3 to 7 mutations necessary that they are kind of the seeds that they are responsible for for some genesis.

797
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:37,219
So there's actually a lot of new research that's aimed at targeting stem cells

798
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:43,580
with cancer therapy because the idea is so this is traditional cancer therapy,

799
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:50,030
right? You're doing radiation or chemo or whatever and you're killing off all of the cancer cells.

800
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:57,980
But if you don't kill that cancer stem cell, the tumor may shrink, but it's going to come back because the the the seed is still there.

801
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:05,930
Right. But if you can kill the cancer stem cell, the tumor will lose its ability to generate new cells and the tumor will be generated.

802
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:13,100
So none of these are like, to my knowledge, in human trials yet, but this is an active area of research.

803
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:22,190
This idea, too, that the abundance differs by tissue type people have looked at like more common cancers,

804
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:28,010
tend to have more stem cells in those tissues. Less common cancers have very few.

805
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:37,010
So there is some correlation between kind of the the abundance of normal stem cells in a tissue and how common cancer is in that tissue.

806
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:39,350
So there's some evidence there as well.

807

So I say this is in theory, it's pretty accepted at this point that this is really what's going on in that cancer stem cells are very important.

808
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:55,010
