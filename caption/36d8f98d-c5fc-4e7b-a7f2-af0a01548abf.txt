1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,830
So that sounds like silly.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:13,020
But when I that put on the news and I said, well, so we're going to start.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,930
My name is Maria and one of Kelly's Ph.D. students. She has an NIH thing today, so she can't be here.

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,080
So she asked me to fill in. Today is going to be like a really easy day.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,819
So don't like don't worry, we're not really lecturing today,

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,030
but everyone is going to need their laptop or some version of our studio to do the exercises.

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,520
And these are going to be really helpful for your homework, your sample size calculation homework.

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,510
So if you're confused, hopefully after today you won't be as confused.

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,490
Okay, so the PowerPoint is posted on campus.

10
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:55,590
You can download it, but we'll also have it up here. Okay.

11
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,749
So we're going to do an exercise in randomization.

12
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,979
So I think it might have been a couple lectures ago that you guys learned about randomization,

13
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:12,840
but what Kelly wants you guys to practice today is this stratified, random, muted block randomization, and this is your study.

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,780
And so you're going to need to do it in our studio. You can work with the person next to you.

15
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:27,030
All information you need is on this slide. If you set these seeds, when you do the exercise, you'll get the same exact answer as Kelly and I.

16
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:34,469
So you know what? You did it right. You guys can raise your hands and ask questions out loud for everyone to hear.

17
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,650
If you want me to come up and help personally, I can also do that.

18
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,690
We will give you the answers.

19
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:47,190
Like after like maybe kind of 15 minutes of work and you can check what you've done or when everyone feels like they've completed it.

20
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,400
So feel free to, like, collaborate. Did she walk you through like any R code?

21
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,660
Like, do you have any do I need to give you the art package that you should use?

22
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,080
Do you guys have any idea, like, how to do this, or do you need more direction?

23
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,290
Probably a little bit more. Like we've done some, but not random permanent blocks.

24
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:13,800
Okay. Okay. So I'll tell you guys, the R package in the function that you guys are using with that would help you guys.

25
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:26,010
Yeah. Okay. So here you're going to want to use you're going to want to install the package called block brand,

26
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:33,660
all lowercase, no space and then obviously load that library into art.

27
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,290
And then the function that you're going to use is literally block grant.

28
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:52,620
So what I recommend doing is question mark, block Grant here and see what this function is taking,

29
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,010
what the arguments are required, because all the information you need to use this function is on this slide.

30
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:06,510
So once you install that package and look up what the function is doing, you should be able to do this exercise.

31
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,190
What your ultimate goal is, is to fill in this this table here.

32
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:20,640
So you're going to want to randomize ten patients. So you should get ten treatment assignments at the end of your randomization.

33
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,660
So you're going to need to run block ran four times, one with the center, one low risk strategy.

34
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:35,069
You're going to set a seed of one for that and then block grant for center one, high risk, etc., etc.

35
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:40,050
So there should be four function calls and you guys can talk.

36
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,370
Doesn't have to be silent.

37
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:53,170
I think also what you guys should note is like this last line of assumption is that you're going to allow for 200 treatment allocations within each.

38
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,020
So for this first bullet point, you should have 200 subjects.

39
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,290
For the second one, you should have 200 subjects, etc., etc.

40
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:09,190
Even though we're enrolling 200 subjects total. To make that bigger.

41
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:17,610
This the PowerPoint. Is this better?

42
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:37,940
You want me to zoom in? It's fine. In.

43
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:15,640
So I got this little package.

44
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,210
Everyone needs to look carefully at the blocksize this argument and the function.

45
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:38,180
That's my biggest piece of advice to you. What arguments do we need?

46
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,640
You need. You need em. You need the ID prefix.

47
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,290
You need the stratum. You need the number of levels.

48
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,090
You need what those levels are. And then you need your block sizes.

49
00:05:53,810 --> 00:06:14,780
I need. We're just doing exercises today to introduce.

50
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:29,250
It's so there's two there's two treatments that it is the freezing temperatures.

51
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:36,840
Nothing's significant with. Yeah.

52
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,230
Yeah. I don't think I've seen that here.

53
00:06:43,440 --> 00:07:03,780
Okay. So. So I think this shows that this is true.

54
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,300
Yeah. Yeah, that's true. It's just and I certainly in Texas the plumber.

55
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,950
Sorry. What the I.D. prefix of here.

56
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Does anyone have idea what they would put for the ID prefix.

57
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,070
Just name themselves. What would you put for stratum.

58
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,410
Because you have to put stratum.

59
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:37,550
What are you gonna put for stratum or so stratum would be like for for the first one for for for center one low risk stratum.

60
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,030
What, what do you put for the stratum argument. So low risk.

61
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:48,240
So the stratum is low risk. Okay, the ID prefix is center.

62
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,450
Soon the center what center you're in is your ID.

63
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,780
So center one center to center three, center four. That's your ID.

64
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,980
Your stratum is whether you're in low risk or high risk.

65
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,589
Right. This is why you have to make four function calls. You can't just do random lot commuting in one function call.

66
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:13,770
You're going to have to call block rand four times one for low risk, stratum low that's for center one, etc., etc., etc.

67
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:19,210
I guess the key. So you don't care.

68
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:24,130
So even if you're calling it four separate times, you still have to change that ID prefix.

69
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,470
Yeah, it would help you to change the I.D. otherwise you're going to be confused.

70
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,380
What you have to go back and say, well, what is patient one going to be assigned to?

71
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,290
Well, patient one was in center, one low risk.

72
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:41,170
So if you don't change your argument, names like all of your outputs are going to look exactly the same.

73
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,109
Okay, so that makes sense. So it doesn't matter.

74
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:50,110
Like if you want to call it one or center one, you just need some type of naming convention to help you.

75
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:56,190
Okay. Yeah. Blocksize blockers next week.

76
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:12,879
So there is a lot of weight in what size is chosen.

77
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,960
Three, four, six, eight.

78
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:35,200
I mean, maybe just choose one or something to, like, indicate that it's different, just like the other one is just really old school.

79
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:49,100
So if I chose you as a blogger, think of what it's like to have a different part of the spectrum.

80
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:56,280
If I do two sports makes it work, and I think it will provide an authentic prefix for my column.

81
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:04,270
But I think that should be to because it's the number of cheating. You see that show, how good you could be from both sides.

82
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,400
Are you one? Oh, sorry. I was split.

83
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:15,940
I was trying to. There need to be two years of just like, I don't know, you just like value or like even amounts in each player.

84
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,930
I just said my skill level here. Okay, so.

85
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,459
Okay, actually. Yeah. The final block sizes will be the crowd levels.

86
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:36,310
And because you do actually contingent on.

87
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:46,440
So it looks like there's going to be number of people, like sort of like.

88
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,540
Yeah. Because you're also here, you're going to want to read this documentation.

89
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,770
So this is specifying the size of the blocks to you.

90
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,099
So remember, like a block size would be like if you have a block size of ten,

91
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,919
it means that like if you had two treatments, it would could be like any combination of about ten times.

92
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,879
That's your block size, but you want your block size just to be random.

93
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:18,600
You don't want the block size to be ten each time, which is why you would want to randomly sample block sizes of four, six and eight, she said.

94
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:24,389
And so in order to do that, though, there's like this function is like a little specific.

95
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:30,720
So here you need to read down here about it is you don't need the block size, okay?

96
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:37,260
So the final block sizes will be the product of the number of levels and block sizes.

97
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,610
So you're going to have to do like what? You can't just input four, six and eight.

98
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:48,390
What is this? Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. If we have like these, like low rates.

99
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,880
Okay, turn out just like there's a lot of room for first to number 200.

100
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,120
What's happening? Controlling content. Yeah.

101
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:04,260
So someone enters and then you just get it first. Does anyone have results yet for one bullet point.

102
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:13,800
Yeah. Yeah, we were just talking about like conceptually once you get this output, like how what are we doing with it?

103
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:19,320
Yeah, I can, I can walk you through that. Once you have all four, what you're going to do.

104
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:52,540
Okay. So we can choose to use.

105
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:06,000
Are we going to change the be in the treatment center at one point.

106
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:19,310
I love the idea of having to say to the commission is you should be getting like a very long output, right?

107
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,889
Like a lot of our output is like 200 lines per block.

108
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:53,010
Brand call. Okay. That means that it's just one human two 3.62 level in July two divided by 12 to possibly treatment to all these seniors.

109
00:13:53,020 --> 00:14:03,660
So just to look through the term object and say the number levels, yeah, if you're setting time, you shouldn't need to worry about it.

110
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:14,600
I we just like to go back to the changing as the century the change the prefix as well.

111
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:20,990
I guess we had it all said to have been in the air that you shouldn't have it all set to one.

112
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,190
Yeah. Yeah, I think so too. Like the first one ends up to eight.

113
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:31,280
So. So the next one or two or nine, etc. As long as you know, that's all that matters.

114
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,240
I think that's interesting.

115
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:48,170
I think he said that and I was like, If you do, can I show you guys my our code and Kelly's our code?

116
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:55,579
Are you guys not ready yet? I'm going give the first page because the sample size stuff is actually a little more difficult.

117
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,130
So I want you guys to have time because that's what your homework is, so.

118
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:06,990
Okay. Okay.

119
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:16,820
Can you guys kind of see this? Slightly larger would be helpful.

120
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:27,140
Yeah. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let me just minimize this so your code doesn't have to look exactly like this, but.

121
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:35,120
So this is clearly the first call to have 200 sample size of 200 my d projects.

122
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,290
I made this at center one. So everything is going to be labeled center one.

123
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,650
My stratum is low risk. We have two treatment levels.

124
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,740
I named them surgery and sham surgery.

125
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:51,379
And our block sizes, you actually have to specify as two, three and four, even though we want four, six and eight.

126
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:58,330
And that's because this function multiplies your block sizes by the number of levels that you have for your your treatment.

127
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,560
So if we want four, six and eight, two times, she was four, three times two, six, four times two is eight.

128
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:15,590
And if you run this. I think you're going to get a really long list.

129
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:29,820
She? It's better this way.

130
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,190
Okay. Of potential patients.

131
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:41,960
Right. So you're going to do this four times. And what we have to do is we have to go back and look at this table.

132
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,710
So patient one is coming from center one risk group high.

133
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,240
So what you need to do is you need to go run, center run.

134
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,720
Risk group. High speed of 1000 here.

135
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:13,880
Sorry, I'm not used to puking. And then. You need to basically go to the first patient and say, okay, what was their treatment?

136
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,660
Sham surgery. Next one again.

137
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:24,890
Center one. Hi. So what is patient to surgery?

138
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:32,270
And then. You want center to low.

139
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,710
So you go run center to low. Pick the first patient from center to low.

140
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,870
That's their assignment. Because that makes sense.

141
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:46,620
So ultimately, what you should get is a. It's treatment assignments that look like this.

142
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,540
Mm hmm. So it matters in the code if you have the ordering of the levels.

143
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,570
I think, like, if you say, like, sham first, I mean, surgeries and the levels is their convention for that.

144
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:06,000
Now, usually, like I think most people put the placebo first, but it doesn't matter.

145
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,130
It shouldn't matter. What? What did we do? We put the treatment first.

146
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:17,670
Like, I wouldn't say there's a convention as long as, you know, you're aware of what you did.

147
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,060
That's all that matters. So if the ordering matters, then your instinct there might be different.

148
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:36,219
So maybe I should say so. Like here in the interview, which will be posted after like Kelly is highlighted in like pretty well.

149
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:45,700
So like the green will correspond to that call about center one high and the three patients she's looking at her highlighted in green.

150
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,780
And so when a patient comes from this particular center in this stratum,

151
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:56,590
she goes to that randomization call and it's like, okay, patient, this patient like is going to get sham.

152
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:02,790
And then an exclusion that comes consecutively. You just refer to your specific call.

153
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,880
Of any questions at this. Okay.

154
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:12,710
This answer will be posted later so you can check your code and and things like that.

155
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,520
But I think more important is to work on these sample size calculations.

156
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,690
Okay. There's a paper on canvas that she posted under today's lecture.

157
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:32,870
You don't need to read the paper. We've summarized the main findings, but this is where all of this is coming from.

158
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,000
So we're looking at this Fidelity trial,

159
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:42,560
and it's patients who had any symptoms consistent with a degenerative medial meniscus, tear or no knee osteoarthritis.

160
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,270
And randomized randomization is going to be 1 to 1.

161
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:51,530
So either they're going to get surgery, which is going to be called APM in this paper, or they're going to get some surgery.

162
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,010
And we want to evaluate whether the author sample size slash power calculations

163
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:03,440
that they wrote in the paper are are true based on our knowledge from this class.

164
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:09,649
So. The setting that we're in here.

165
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:18,320
So we're going to make power in sample size calculations for comparing this mean change in this this new score, which is over a 12 month period.

166
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:29,149
So they take the new score pre intervention and then post-operative so like post-surgery and they subtract them 12 months change.

167
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:34,639
So it's going to be this 12 month change score, just a number. It goes from 0 to 100.

168
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:45,890
So low is bad, high is good. And then you need to assume that the sham surgery group is going to have a mean zero 12 month change.

169
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:52,520
So if they didn't, they got a fake surgery. So there should be no improvement in their new score.

170
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,389
Okay. So the first thing you guys need to do is read this paragraph.

171
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,740
This is from the paper. So you don't need to download the paper and.

172
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:11,280
This is going to give you all the information you're going to need to do the calculations that are required the next couple of slides.

173
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:16,980
So I would recommend downloading the slide so I can put up the questions that we need you to answer.

174
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:24,970
So the first thing you're going to need to do is read that paragraph and you need to pull out what they're saying the effect size is.

175
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:31,740
So what's the assumed effect size that they used for their power calculation based on that paragraph that they gave?

176
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,660
I can put it back up. It's just one number. You.

177
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:56,220
There's a lot of like additional information in this paragraph that you don't need to use.

178
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:00,510
Remember, we're only focusing on this list for this only score.

179
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,660
Okay. So those are the only numbers you need to pay attention to.

180
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:13,590
And you want the effect size that they're using and their power in sample size calculations.

181
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:52,790
Is anyone based on reading? What what do you think the effect size is that we need?

182
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,479
Right, because you need several things to get at your sample size and power.

183
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,200
You need your effect size, which I believe Kelly is calling like Delta in your slides.

184
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,300
You need your standard deviation. You need what you want your power to be.

185
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,320
You need your type one error. All that information is here.

186
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,730
So what? What delta or what effect size are we using?

187
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,880
11.5. Exactly, because we only are focusing on this little tiny score.

188
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:29,780
Okay, so this is the first part. Okay. Then we need what standard deviations did the authors assume the calculation with according to

189
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,950
the paragraph and they're going to assume equals ten or eviation at each intervention group.

190
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,370
So Surgery and Sam are going to have the same standard deviation.

191
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,700
So what numbers should we use? 21. 21, yes.

192
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:46,580
Okay. So now assuming that the effect size, then standard deviation from parts and B,

193
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:52,100
what sample size per group is needed for 80% power type one error rate of 5%.

194
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,850
You're going to need R to do this. So this is exactly what you're going to need to do on your homework, right?

195
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:02,540
You're going to find a paper. You're going to need to pull up the effect size, pull out the standard deviations, pull out the receiving power,

196
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:07,850
and then you're hopefully going to be able to go to R and get a calculation and compare it to what they're saying.

197
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:14,150
They're sample sizes. So here, note that they're going to do a two sample t test, right?

198
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:22,910
Because we have continuous responses like this NE scores continuous and the sham and surgery group and we're assuming that it's the change score.

199
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:28,159
So this post-op minus pre-op is normally distributed within each intervention group.

200
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,870
So we're going to do this T test comparing the two groups.

201
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,030
So this is how you should get your sample size.

202
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:41,810
Did she give you functions like did she talk about what our go to use or do you guys need the package again.

203
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:48,710
I'm sorry what she talked about it to do you guys want the package that you should use?

204
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,659
I'll give you the name of the package just to be sure. Howard, it's power.

205
00:25:53,660 --> 00:26:01,100
Power .2. test is what you should be using and you have all the information that you need to use that function.

206
00:26:27,420 --> 00:27:08,680
Do I need to go back to the paragraph? Are you guys okay? You stated.

207
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,360
Instead, he should be getting something that looks like this.

208
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:33,870
With those numbers. Remember, this is an age group.

209
00:27:51,940 --> 00:28:07,380
Okay. So we should be getting about about an end of 54, assuming these numbers.

210
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:13,380
Should you also be accounting for dropout? So here we haven't accounted for dropout yet.

211
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:20,460
But you're right. Like in this cynic, like Kelly didn't ask you to account for the 20% dropout, but the paper did.

212
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:30,930
And so what's important to remember is that the paper said, according to this paragraph, that their end for the new score was 40.

213
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,690
Based on these numbers, our help relation says it's 54.

214
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:44,310
So something is happening here. And then here.

215
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,910
Now, Kelly wants you to say so will the sample size per group that you just calculated.

216
00:28:50,910 --> 00:29:02,430
Right? So like about an end equals of 54 be available be sufficient if 70% participants per group are randomized and there's a 20% dropout now.

217
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,900
So the study enrolled 70, 70 people because they anticipated a 20% dropout.

218
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:14,550
So is that sample size that you just calculated sufficient in this in this setting?

219
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:29,220
Yes. Yes. Right. Because if you have 20% drop off, you're basically saying that you're going to lose 14 people 17 times.

220
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,770
0.2, right? 70 -14 is 56.

221
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:40,390
That's still you still you have enough people with this this calculation.

222
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:52,480
Okay. Okay. The problem is, is that this paper isn't just doing one analysis.

223
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:59,060
They're doing three analysis. And when you do three types of analysis, you can't just use a significance level of 0.05.

224
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:02,530
You need to do a bonferroni correction, right?

225
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:05,570
Where we adjust, we basically reduce our type one error.

226
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,680
I think you guys talked about this in class. Probably so.

227
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,839
Or maybe you've learned about it previously in statistics. Otherwise you'll get like multiple testing error.

228
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,400
Things will be inflated, you'll be getting more significant results, things like that.

229
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:28,820
And so you basically, if you're going to do three analysis, you need to adjust your .05 significance level by 3.05 divided by three.

230
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:34,700
And so now Kelly wants you to compute a sample size per group for 90% power,

231
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:42,170
assuming a 20% dropout with the Bonferroni type one error corrected for three primary outcomes.

232
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,480
And you'll use the same effect size and standard deviations as before.

233
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:54,740
So 11.5 and 21.1. And you should get a new sample size.

234
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,790
And don't forget, you need to inflate this sample size, right.

235
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:28,810
Because of the 20% drop out there, because of the proper correction, we divided by 36 and that's what the month for any correction is like, $0.43.

236
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:41,950
And then she also wants us to change the power of the account for the drop out, which I think this is going to supply suspects like you had to.

237
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:49,360
Let me just put this in this.

238
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:07,030
Yes. I mean, I guess he ran a little bit more than seven frames of the whole.

239
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,180
The whole. So you just missed to just stay inside.

240
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:20,089
We're not doing this. I think it would be interesting to see if he's because this has been since it's been going on.

241
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:25,470
My God. What about the first time that was 16.

242
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,020
20, right? Is it still next year? I guess it should be. No, I'm throwing it out.

243
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:51,990
But that's want to one 1692 pre 72.40 on a personal note so it's kinda like.

244
00:32:55,420 --> 00:33:01,990
Well, if you're looking to see if you like to buy what I did.

245
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,480
Does anyone have an answer they want to share? This 1.16.

246
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:18,280
Yeah. Yeah. Good. So, like, before you count, you should be getting, like, 92.4 usually, you know, round up to 93.

247
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:28,290
Account for the attrition should be getting around like 116 117 year round like I always round up before and before attrition.

248
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:33,410
Yeah. Before accounting for dropout round off. Like you can't have someone that's like 92.4.

249
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,890
It's like you have a sample size of 93 for account for attrition.

250
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,600
So that's like, what? Oh, just kidding.

251
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:54,420
Yeah. Yeah. So I'm getting, like, 117 people.

252
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:00,190
Yeah. Okay. Now you go. Yeah. Good. Did anyone have any questions on this?

253
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:07,510
You just divide your significance level by three. And if we were doing two primary primary analysis, you divide it by two.

254
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:13,690
Like, it's pretty straightforward. But notice that you need more now.

255
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:19,660
Right. Like you need higher sample size because we're being more strict with our type one here.

256
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:26,920
So this might be a silly question, but should you be rounding up your end to decimal before you're accounting for dropout?

257
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:35,950
Mm hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

258
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:40,430
Are we all good to move on? Or is it. Are people still confused?

259
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:50,500
Everyone's okay. Okay. So the results of this actual study are going to be reported in that article we put on campus.

260
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:58,870
So the actual end that they received in each group, so that surgery group, they got 69 subjects and they were trying to enroll 70.

261
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,780
And then in the sham group, they got 76.

262
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:12,070
And then their actual standard deviation that they're reporting based on this like preoperative post-op score is 17,

263
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,070
much smaller than what they had assumed in their sample size calculations, which, if you remember, was 21.1.

264
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:26,350
So now Kelly wants you to basically now remember, we're going back to just assuming that overall type one error rate of 5%.

265
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:30,850
That accounts for three primary comparisons being a bonferroni correction, same as thing we just did.

266
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:36,759
But now your standard deviation is 17 and now you're not calculating the sample size, you're computing a power.

267
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,629
So with now, you know, you're right, you know what?

268
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:46,270
And they enrolled they enrolled 69 and 76. So we're basically doing the opposite calculation now.

269
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:53,740
It's like given this and what is my power, given the effect size and part one.

270
00:35:54,310 --> 00:36:00,370
But this new standard deviation of 17, not 21.1 in these ends, what is my powers?

271
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:03,680
You should be using a different function now, right?

272
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,700
But you're still like, actually, you need to use a different package to go learn about the power package.

273
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:15,279
P.W Ah, okay. Well, you need to install the power package.

274
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:24,639
P.W are all lowercase and remember we're doing t tests because we have continuous outcomes in two groups and so the function

275
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:33,940
is going to be called power dot t to an dot test just similar to like your sample size one are very intuitively named,

276
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:43,180
except now you're calculating the power. Instead of providing the power it you still do that would power that t test like normal for you.

277
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,440
I think you can. Yeah. Hello. Uses this function.

278
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,430
Can you do uneven group ends with the power.

279
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:58,900
Oh yeah. I don't know if you did that. That's a good point. I don't know if you can specify uneven group N.

280
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:05,260
Well it says per group in the documentation you can try try and see if you fit the same power calculation as I do.

281
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:13,660
Okay. And we'll see if that's true. There was supposed to be a post study tour.

282
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:17,890
Sorry. What? I know it's not useful to calculate a post-study.

283
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:24,910
It's. It's not worth just seeing whether their analysis is based on, like, whether it was accurate.

284
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:30,070
It accurately powered, basically. What's the name of that function again?

285
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,280
Power to ewr dot t to n dot test.

286
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:50,620
The whole point of this exercise is to like have you as biostatistician, like have like a fine eye when it comes to what's published in literature,

287
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:56,500
you know, and not just accept their power calculations for what it is because it could be wrong.

288
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:00,309
Like we already see that there are some sample size that they calculated.

289
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:03,490
40 is just not true. Like it's not a good estimate.

290
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:17,950
We'll discuss later why why this happened. You added that this was never pressuring multiple parents.

291
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:26,270
It's insulting the passive factor to it for the other.

292
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:51,310
Yeah. Its function is simply because it doesn't.

293
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:09,829
Recommendation to Indigenous communities.

294
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:24,200
17 So I look at this, it's like using parallel testing because I know of people questioning whether you need to put 17 in the call.

295
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:32,500
So remember in the first function, there's an operator like you put in your standard deviation separately than the 11.5, right?

296
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:38,660
But this function functions around something called DX, which is your effect size and effect size.

297
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:44,600
You need to divide by your standard deviation. So your effect size is that mean divided by your standard deviation.

298
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,360
Whereas the previous function was taking those things separately,

299
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:51,290
it was taking 11.5 as an argument that was taking the standard deviation as an argument.

300
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:56,000
Here you need to actually put in the effect size of your paper.

301
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:34,710
DX So you need to do the division. Anyone have a power they want to share with my size.

302
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:40,350
Yeah. If you round up. Should be like a really 1.9487882 is what I'm getting.

303
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:46,200
But that's using this power dot to to ten function.

304
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,430
So if someone did it a different way and are getting something similar.

305
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:03,850
Going to power? Is it is it not working in two companies?

306
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,230
Are any of them the same as 94?

307
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:12,900
You're getting, what, 94. 94. Yeah. 79 437.

308
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,440
Interesting. Say 937937.

309
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:22,710
Okay. It's interesting. Like what, where that difference is coming from.

310
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:30,009
I mean, I don't know. It must be the function is. It must be something differently.

311
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:33,340
I would have to put the tolerance argument in. Yeah, it could be.

312
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:38,049
Yeah, you're right. But, yeah. What have you set your tolerance to?

313
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:43,130
And I didn't set it. You didn't say you just let the default. Default. Generally, we're getting it like that.

314
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:47,830
You should be getting 94 and 2940.

315
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:57,240
Now, I'm trying for 24.91.

316
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,910
Right? Sometimes. Sometimes. So what's this all about?

317
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:18,740
What's what do you do? Do you want to see the art move? I mean, does it matter that the one dropped out in the treatment group is key?

318
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:26,560
Oh, I see. So this is what your art code, if we use this power function, should look like.

319
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:34,989
Does that affect size? So you need to, like, calculate your effect size and you're going to bonferroni.

320
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:41,559
Correct. Similar to the other function. You're not actually going to see the power argument because you want to get power out of the calculations.

321
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:51,850
You're just going to leave it as null. And then we're doing a two sided test here and you should get something like this.

322
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:13,040
This will be the answer will be posted to. Do you have to worry about copying things down too fast?

323
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:24,610
Okay, so now let's just see what you get from another country.

324
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,310
I don't even know myself from my function.

325
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:39,670
We get this. So you.

326
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,450
Okay. Okay.

327
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:53,980
It's. Okay.

328
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:59,210
So now that you've done all these calculations, we want to have a little discussion about.

329
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:07,260
Do you think that the authors did a good job in how they reported their what

330
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,399
they wanted their sample size to be and based on what their power was like?

331
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,940
Do you think that paragraph that they wrote where they said, remember,

332
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:24,900
they're reporting that they made 40 participants for an 80% power with 5% type one error, 20% attrition.

333
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:30,060
Like, was this good statistics based on the math that we just.

334
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:42,150
What do you guys think? I mean.

335
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,450
Well, they said that you knew they needed 40 people.

336
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:54,250
Is that true? No, no, no. Were they adequately powered for their analysis, though?

337
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,110
Yes, they were. But why were they okay?

338
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:06,400
They got lucky is basically what happened is that they accounted for 20% attrition, which ended up not happening.

339
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:13,420
So they inflated their end. And so because of dropout, not because they had the correct calculations, they were still powered.

340
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:18,360
Okay. And their estimate of standard deviation was much higher than it actually was.

341
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:20,170
They gave himself a little leeway there.

342
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:27,100
If they had set a lower standard deviation and not accounted for dropout and inflated their end to get 70 people.

343
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:31,299
This would not have been a good analysis and it would not have been adequately powered.

344
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:35,500
But they basically got really they got lucky. Is what happened here?

345
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:43,960
Is that common? I think it yeah, I think it is common. And this is the point of like this exercise and your homework is that as statisticians,

346
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:51,370
it's going to be your job to calculate sample size and power of study add accurately if you're a clinical trial test.

347
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:59,290
And so you need to like really like put some thought into your calculations and you know, this is a paper.

348
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:05,470
And so the fact that, you know, their sample size calculations were a little off,

349
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:10,690
you know, really impact the trial and there's nothing you can really do.

350
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:17,990
Post collecting. You know, you can't change your type one error and thing and change your power.

351
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,710
You know. Okay.

352
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:28,570
Does that make sense? Okay.

353
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:36,490
So here we have another example now. Same paper, but now we want.

354
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:42,320
To now look at the proportion of participants in each treatment group that

355
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:47,720
achieve at least 11 .5. increase in this new score over the 12 month period.

356
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:55,970
So now we're not looking at a continuous outcome anymore, basically looking at a proportion to the proportion of individuals and in each screen.

357
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:03,350
So we're still in the same setting where like the sham group has mean of zero surgery group has this 11.5 mean.

358
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:10,020
But now we're running different tests. So you have to do a little math.

359
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:18,650
You got to go back to your 601 class, and you need to calculate some probabilities before we can do a sample size calculation.

360
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:27,079
So based on the above assumptions here, so remember, we're assuming that this 12 months like this change score is normally distributed

361
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,820
with a zero mean in the sham surgery group and 11.5 mean in the surgery group,

362
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:37,850
and that the standard deviation for the 12 months change is going to be this 21.1.

363
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:47,240
Okay, back from our previous exercises and you now need to calculate.

364
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:59,720
The in the surgery group, what proportion of patients achieve at least 11.5 increase in this new score over the 12 month period?

365
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:04,309
Now you can do this and r there's also a normal table on canvas, right?

366
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:10,640
This is basic and probability. Again, we can do the math on the board together if we don't remember.

367
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:13,610
But you're gonna want to use this p norm function and R, right?

368
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:23,780
You need to basically calculate the z score, get this probability also like you could intuitively, intuitively think about it as well.

369
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:37,990
I'll give you guys a second to process this. I think like maybe I should give you a starting.

370
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:49,440
So if you let X be a random variable, right, and you let X be the 12 month change score in the surgery group, right.

371
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:54,110
What, how is extra attributed and how are you going to calculate the probability that

372
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:58,880
X is greater than or equal to 11.5 because that's ultimately what you want.

373
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:32,090
Scaroni said. 6:01 p.m. ist so it means it is 601.

374
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:36,980
But ultimately you look it up from the table. Z Score table or you can use Pina.

375
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:44,080
Hang on. Do you have an answer? Do you do you have the answer?

376
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:48,460
Yeah, it would be half the people. Yeah, exactly. 0.5.

377
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:52,629
The other group would be point two.

378
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:58,060
9 to 2. Yeah. Yeah. Did you guys want to do the math on the board?

379
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:01,450
Are you guys good? No. Good.

380
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:09,270
How? We're getting those numbers. Okay. Okay.

381
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:16,550
So now given that. So he gave you the number four for question two,

382
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:22,650
but you need to basically do the same calculation for the sham group, right, which has a different mean.

383
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:34,920
And you should be getting about 29% point nine if you round the our code you should

384
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:40,200
be using is like one minus p norm and then you put in what your Z score is,

385
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:48,030
right? And your Z score for the second one is 11.5 minus the mean of zero divided by your standard deviation,

386
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:51,570
which should give you 0.5, four, five, blah, blah, blah.

387
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:55,770
You can specify the mean and standard deviation, and even better you can.

388
00:50:55,770 --> 00:51:01,980
You can specify the mean. Great in p norm you don't even have to do the little z-score couple so you can set lower tailed to false.

389
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,149
So you don't you'll even have to subtract one. This is.

390
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:12,780
This is me in my qualifying exam. I'm doing everything by hand, but there's easier ways to use.

391
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:26,370
Okay, so now, given those numbers, right, you can now calculate just what sample size again, poor group is needed for this 90% power.

392
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:34,080
We're still assuming a 20% dropout. We're still bonferroni correcting for the three primary outcomes, but overall type one error of 5%.

393
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:39,629
But now remember, we're doing this. We have we don't have continuous outcomes.

394
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:46,030
We have proportions now. So it's a different, different function be.

395
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,390
So do you guys know what the what function you should use?

396
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:58,240
It's pretty intuitive. You use power not to test before.

397
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:02,170
We're not using a T test, now we're testing proportions.

398
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:08,110
So she powered up product tests and you have two proportions now.

399
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:15,310
We calculated them P one and P two. So you should have all the information you need for this function call.

400
00:52:24,880 --> 00:53:49,420
Some. Don't forget to inflate your own. Someone want to give out and that they're getting pre inflated.

401
00:53:53,500 --> 00:54:00,580
So yeah. 148 Yeah. And then if you inflate that you.

402
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:10,810
Yeah. So your homework.

403
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:13,960
When is it due? There's Thursday.

404
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:21,040
So you're going to have to basically do this on your homework. This is what Kelly's asking you to recreate some paper sample size calculation.

405
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:24,490
So my best advice to you is to find the right paper.

406
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:31,000
I remember when I did this homework assignment, the majority of the time was spent finding a paper that gave an effect size that gave a

407
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:37,180
standard deviation rate because you can't compute the sample sizes without that information.

408
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:42,070
So spend some time finding a good paperwork's actually possible for you to

409
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:46,420
replicate what the sample size would be if they don't give that information.

410
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:49,059
It's probably a poorly written paper.

411
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:53,620
Like if they're not giving you stuff how they're calculating their sample size, it should be like a little sketchy.

412
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:59,769
But you could go to office hours and maybe ask Kelly if you assume an effect size or assume a standard

413
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:06,340
deviation or something along those lines to help you get some type of sample size calculation out.

414
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:11,620
But that's why we did the exercises today, partly because this is what you would do.

415
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:15,910
And a lot of the time if you work on clinical trials and for your homework.

416
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:26,169
Okay, so the last thing is compared to the the to the continuous right versus the continuous outcome design

417
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:32,050
where we're calculating sample size using this T test versus this proportion design that we just did,

418
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:36,610
which one do you think is a better design to ultimately use in the trial?

419
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:43,069
Is it better to look at the proportion of individuals within each treatment group,

420
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:49,280
or is it better to look at the actual average change score in each treatment group?

421
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:57,520
What do you guys think? I mean, power wise?

422
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:02,800
Yeah. Yeah. What? What? Like, more powerful can mean many things, right?

423
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:07,630
In terms of power. In terms of sample size required.

424
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,770
Oh, yeah. In terms of like power in sample size. You'd want to look at the actual numbers.

425
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:17,650
But I mean, if, if the clinical interpretation is more so binary than maybe you can.

426
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:24,910
Yeah. Anyway, I think that just in terms of like actual numbers design, one is more powerful.

427
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:31,780
And what's also to keep in mind is like when you bind, make something binary, you're losing a lot of information.

428
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:39,970
So suddenly when you're only looking at the proportion of individuals in each group, you're losing like a lot of rich information about the outcome.

429
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:47,800
And so we what what Kelly has told me and it's written here is that you really want to like focus on continuous outcomes.

430
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:55,390
Like you don't want to make something binary that's continuous because you lose a lot of information in these trials.

431
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:03,850
So you lose a lot of power. But that that is also we get to end class early today by 20 minutes.

432
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:10,230
Okay. If you have questions like Kelly does have her office hours still.

433
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:18,129
So like if you find a paper and you like don't have all the information required, you can talk to her about what to do there.

434
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:30,160
And the answer should be posted. I don't know when, but all the R code and stuff as well I want you guys can have a great day at the tomorrow.

435
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:48,140
You know this is your time thank you for your comments I the kind of yeah I mean I'm like I'm like saying like if you want to start something.

436
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:53,020
Yeah I'm sorry.

437
00:57:53,490 --> 00:58:00,069
I do not mean since I have the meeting and I think it's to me just to you know you

438
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:04,870
could do I hear both ways I think I've done the lowest sample size in the group.

439
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:13,060
We can do for the scientists. The most entertaining is when you do like, um.

440
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:22,510
What do you think? Like, I don't. I don't. I guess I can take one.

441
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:25,720
You could not be like, just an average sample, so.

442
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:38,100
Yeah, it's because it's the way I read it would be like, oh, I, I don't like, like the statistic really long everything.

443
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:45,040
It's pretty close. So, and I average it. I get that you should have been whining about whether she wanted to be, I think.

444
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:50,469
I mean, that's like I think it's I think it would.

445
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:54,150
Yeah, that's probably pretty funny like that.

446
00:58:54,180 --> 00:59:00,580
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Like this has gone to.

447
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:13,839
So whether like that's the best time to do it or not, some people that I mean they're genius, my friends and I just.

448
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:21,370
You want to take a. But they are remembered in the New Testament.

449
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:31,030
The bidding that night smacks a little like, you know, like the big bad wolf with more than like a grandma.

450
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:35,400
And then we got all these pictures. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

451
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:44,049
We got, like, pictures of Your Majesty, you know, because I was like, when I was like,

452
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:50,230
has this guy, you know, it's like, I don't know, you know, nice and.

453
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:57,960
Yeah, yeah. Ron Is that like, it's very nice.

454
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:01,270
Yeah. He's still running at all like.

455
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:09,570
Like we're going to keep doing what you're doing as well.

456
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:13,210
That was in my mind.

457
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:18,160
And that's where the money is. Just not being.

458
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:30,530
Yes. You never know. I mean, I know it seems like we all kind of like we're in there.

459
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:35,049
It depends on whether you're kind of crazy.

460
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:44,710
Like if you're just like you're going to output, you just like I was like, you know, mean I'm actually going to take that here.

461
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:56,160
Yeah. She has a chair of pretty much everything.

462
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:08,919
Use the power use like a dual use because the whole point is that it so he's like, yeah, I mean, you know, this is on the table.

463
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:16,340
You're going to need to find those networks around because they have to go see these checkpoints online.

464
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:26,570
So if they're actually very closely followed that stuff but not required and this one is not, they're like, alright,

465
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:42,520
maybe because it's not like value added, it's cause like on Amazon similar, not in like clinical trial prospective randomized.

466
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:47,470
So I'm more into observational studies I guess.

467
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,979
I don't know. I don't, I don't know.

468
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:54,190
I don't know if you see me or a lot of stuff like that. Yeah.

469
01:01:55,540 --> 01:02:02,770
Like she knows about me from profit on zombie gravitas context.

470
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:11,800
I really, I don't know. I would have to actually I'm not like that, but it's not like I was hanging out laughing, so I don't sound like.

471
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:17,230
Well, you know, I mean, I would actually.

472
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:24,870
Yeah, I was like, yeah, right. Yeah, I, I like that.

473
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:31,629
And I think she's going to take a meeting if you're not around three.

474
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:38,260
I don't, I'm not sure that's right. But he's got two years ideas, so I'm like, I don't even know how to start.

475
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:44,170
I don't mind if she said, you know, two of my hands and I, I don't know.

476
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:49,090
I'm not really delusional and I don't want to say that.

477
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:54,370
But yeah, yeah. Yesterday, but I had severe codeine.

478
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:58,270
I mean, it's just you're not going to get exciting things happen.

479
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:04,120
Oh, that's the first thing you should find the paragraph where this talks about you want to work on it and then it's

480
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:09,160
not it's not clear that you can read the results and maybe make some assumptions about what the effect sizes.

481
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:15,489
Yeah, you don't do the homework assignment like try your best to recruit a sample size.

482
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:21,310
If that information isn't there, it's like, well, what sample size you are, I think.

483
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:28,020
I just don't know. Oh, you're welcome. Sam and Grant, that's very important.

484
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:32,649
Yeah, I don't really know. That was a good. Oh, you did not give me back.

485
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:35,709
My son is. I don't know.

486
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:39,100
I was just really busy right now.

487
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:44,050
I see. Like, it's mostly in order to do what? So we all got to go this day.

488
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:55,180
And so this is the one that's cool. Yeah. Just over the last year, Kellyanne told you that we should we should have walking the potential of.

489
01:03:55,180 --> 01:04:01,959
Yeah. Have you taken your policy message at this point in time?

490
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:15,940
And I mean, like you said, you know, I don't I don't think it would be.

491
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:27,329
Yeah. Yeah. But then I think that, you know, it's okay, but like, I've heard that, but they just like,

492
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:31,979
I mean, because the classes are so tough to that, it's like they help win the class.

493
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:35,280
I think they're like, you know. Yeah, it was.

494
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:44,910
And, and. Yeah. Well, I guess people like me, they find that I want to move back here or not.

495
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:52,660
So there's, I'm like, what if I can, you know, this is a nice art, you know?

496
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:56,630
Yeah. So they we have a group there called e3c.

497
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:00,930
It's like kind of science for dynamic intervention decision making.

498
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:05,220
Okay. We work on, like, adaptive interventions using smarts.

499
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:09,000
Oh, okay. So you like isolating smart stuff. Oh, really?

500
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:12,120
Yeah. Well, I'm doing patient preference.

501
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:16,310
Randomize, partially randomize. People preference. Smart trials, initiative methods.

502
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:20,570
Absolutely. Yeah, I know nothing about smart people right now.

503
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,440
Like very minimal. Smart.

504
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:28,720
I'm have like that's like when I've been I literally don't know do you like computers and [INAUDIBLE] or like what do you guys do?

505
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:34,360
Like, a lot of it makes it it's, you know, we're doing some cool stuff, so.

506
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:38,280
Okay. But I definitely have to remember, I don't know if. For some reason I have your number.

507
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:45,140
It's probably from like the days of, like, Lux and like, which is like, I'm so glad I'm out of there, but like, I went up.

508
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:50,520
Yeah, I can't believe I work too. I know, but whatever that.

509
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,910
Oh, my God. You know, like Kelley. I mean, I remember Karen.

510
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:58,770
Yes. Yeah. Okay. So Karen was she was in stat.

511
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:02,160
She was in a Ph.D. Yeah. She had finished and she was postdoc, right?

512
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:07,919
Yeah. Yeah. But I remember like when I like a switch was like, I can be your Ph.D. advisor,

513
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:14,670
like advisor, and you can find someone in the department that you work with. And I was like, Oh, well, I think I should be.

514
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:18,680
Yeah, exactly. And Karen literally pulled me aside. It's like, Mari, you'll be here for ten.

515
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:22,319
It's like you'll get your Ph.D., but you'll be here for ten years. And I was like, No, no, no.

516
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:27,780
Like, I got to get out as, like, 6303634214.

517
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:32,129
Okay, yeah. Let's like, let's meet up with those. Our stuff seems pretty simple.

518
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:35,880
Absolutely. I some the only reason I took this course, I'm like auditing.

519
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,880
I'm not even. Oh, you're not even like, oh yeah.

520
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:45,260
Because I like I really missed every Thursday of this class emergency type semester just like with complex and stuff like that.

521
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:48,959
You know, I got like the guy, guy comes by like,

522
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:53,340
what is your guy literally doing that other class to like just show up in like

523
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:58,059
I don't I really like excitement exams or I listen to lecture on myself.

524
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:01,830
Yeah. Like they're going to be like, I know some of them. We're doing a lot of smart.

525
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:05,430
Yeah, yeah. Or just like, like clinical trial language. Yeah.

526
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:08,490
It's like what we are doing is experimental design, right? Right.

527
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:11,720
It's like learning. Is it just like. Not really. Is it just not medical?

528
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:15,900
Yeah. It's not like drug trials. Yeah, it's more of like biobehavioral.

529
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:19,380
Um, things that are.

530
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,309
Less evidence based.

531
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:32,740
I'd say it's like something from like ADHD, medication, education policy or PTSD when you still put them through like some type of trial.

532
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,260
Exactly. To learn what the best like adaptive interventions are.

533
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:40,640
But it's like maybe a little bit hard to score, like clinical trials, like actual data.

534
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:43,690
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's quite a few.

535
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:51,589
We don't our like we always partner with other scientists and others that are like I'd say like domain experts,

536
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:56,300
both the ah like the methodologies and like behind helping them design the trials because they're like,

537
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:00,190
wow, you know, PTSD is like a lot of people drop out for any reason.

538
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:02,840
Like some stuff doesn't work, don't know the best treatment.

539
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:09,860
It sounds like, great, let's run a smart drill down the trial and try to figure out like where what year like are you like two years or three years?

540
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:13,790
And this is like sort of the third year I started. So I'm like done with pretty much all my coursework.

541
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:17,059
That's it's just like, I know it's like the best.

542
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:21,650
I'm having the best year ever. I was like, oh, you know, I'm like, I love you.

543
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:29,300
I always, I was like, Oh, I can really great. Even though like, no idea what I'm doing, but like, sometimes just every day.

544
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:34,030
Yeah. Like I have the best ideas. Yeah, I guess.

545
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:37,730
I think because. How long are you out between your own?

546
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:41,480
Did you say your masters when you thought you was rich? I know I didn't.

547
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:46,820
So I finished my Masters at Michigan two years ago, and then I did a year of extra classes.

548
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:50,030
That was last year. So technically, like, is this technically your first year?

549
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:54,950
This is my second year as like a Ph.D. Oh, well, it's my fourth year in the program.

550
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:59,040
I kind of just like continues, you know, like you were like, here's my role as a master.

551
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:03,500
Exactly. Enrolled the Masters. Enrolled as a B.S. biologist.

552
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:08,569
Yeah. Everything is like. It's weird how they do it. I know, but, like, I'm hoping, like, two years.

553
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:12,020
Like, two more. Two more. Like this year and next year.

554
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:19,260
I don't know. It might be like another. I don't know. Like the one project is going okay, but like there's going to be bond stuff, you know?

555
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:23,500
I'm like. Yeah. I thought I was going to this one paper.

556
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:29,820
Right. You know, it's like every little things like that. I mean, I just spent two months simulating data because we have.

557
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:32,900
There's no data. These trials don't exist. Yeah, and so.

558
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:36,230
But it's just like a nightmare. I'm like, Oh, this will be fine. I'll sit down, turn 80.

559
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:41,550
I'm like, Oh, [INAUDIBLE]. Yeah, I think it's much more complicated than I anticipated.

560
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:42,340
Yeah. Yeah.

561
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:51,630
I did some simulation to this first paper I'm working on for like we're using an illustrative example from something like a weight loss study,

562
01:09:51,900 --> 01:10:01,790
and that was a smart design. And we're trying to, like, formulate that new idea around like how to monitor smart using like event triggers.

563
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:09,389
Duolingo also interesting. So, like, so it doesn't like nothing really exists and like the fidelity.

564
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:13,290
Monzo Yeah, yeah. So yeah as well. Like it's, it's hard, yeah.

565
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:16,320
It's so hard. And like, I don't know, I never took a class on something like this.

566
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:23,440
It all feels like so like I'm like so like, let me just let me just, like, finish it so happy, so happy.

567
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,620
And I'm like, go to my advisor and like, it's okay. Yeah.

568
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:32,430
Like, I just what you do my thing, like, I'm using any method to generate the data that I'm using to analyze it.

569
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:36,179
I'm like, this one variable different about this whole amount.

570
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:39,180
This model is like quite similar kind of figure.

571
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:43,139
So yeah, it's, well, it's scary because like your advisor doesn't know anything either.

572
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:51,340
And so like I'm like, wow, I'm really the last line of defense between good scientific like practices and like bad scientific.

573
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:59,640
So tell me how like a big lab group for like so there's not tons like most people like you really

574
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:04,980
only have like two clinical trial people in our department like Tom and Kelly and so they co-vice.

575
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:11,420
And so all of those things are pretty much co advise, but I would say there's like about five plus.

576
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:18,180
Oh, that's pretty good size. Yeah, I guess so. Most people are obviously like or it makes one of them is amount varies the roster fee but

577
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:25,800
one who's about to graduate this year but it's like we all work for a lot of different.

578
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:47,280
We know the wrong person we got here.
