1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,800
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,600
This is the recording for the second protein lecture,

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,077
digestion absorption and transport of protein.

4
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:14,905
So sources of protein as previously mentioned there

5
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:19,194
exogenous and endogenous protein over here.

6
00:00:19,194 --> 00:00:25,576
And protein digestion is skipped in the mouth and

7
00:00:25,576 --> 00:00:30,869
esophagus because usually to break down

8
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,007
protein you need some acidity to be able

9
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:40,700
to start degrading the structure.

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,479
And that would be disadvantageous to the mouth or

11
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,904
else you would be breaking down yours salivary glands and

12
00:00:48,904 --> 00:00:52,421
your tongue and oil cavity which is not good.

13
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:56,440
And this is why we forego digesting protein in the mouth.

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,680
And the stomach basically I'm going to summarize all of those.

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,003
We have the mucous cells, so

16
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:07,450
we have gastric pits and the stomach.

17
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,342
So the mucous cells over here they released mucus to lubricate the E.coli and

18
00:01:12,342 --> 00:01:13,640
the stomach.

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,973
The parietal cells will release HCl and

20
00:01:16,973 --> 00:01:21,021
that would be signaled by the endocrine cells.

21
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:24,540
So first you have endocrine cells that release gastrin.

22
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,130
Remember the drawing that Jane drew on the board endocrine cells release gastrin and

23
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,711
anticipation of food.

24
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:35,299
Or as soon as you start chewing and food goes into your,

25
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:37,561
the bowel goes into the stomach and

26
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:42,190
then gastrin will promote the release of HCl from the parietal cells.

27
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,785
Then parietal cells will promote a pepsinogen and

28
00:01:44,785 --> 00:01:46,640
released from the chief cells.

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,191
And it will also activate pepsinogen because pepsinogen is as I mention into

30
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:53,191
its active form which is pepsin.

31
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:54,840
So HCL does two things.

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,840
It will promote pepsinogen release and then it will also activate it.

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,382
And HCL is capable of denaturing quaternary,

34
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:10,273
tertiary and secondary structures of protein but

35
00:02:10,273 --> 00:02:14,589
it cannot denature the primary structure.

36
00:02:14,589 --> 00:02:19,887
And Pepsinogen is an endopeptidase that works on cleaving

37
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:24,977
from the middle of the, I mean ascertain that protein.

38
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:31,195
So we have something called a cephalic phase which is when you see,

39
00:02:31,195 --> 00:02:36,990
smell and taste food and this activates the enteric neurons.

40
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,618
We have a gastric phase, so once food is present in the stomach that's

41
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:44,921
what stimulate stretching of the stomach walls.

42
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:48,848
Of course because there is a volume that's going in,

43
00:02:48,848 --> 00:02:54,274
more acid secretion and peptides will stimulate the release of gastrin.

44
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:58,561
And then the intestinal phase, so once the chyme enters the duodenum.

45
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:00,067
So the small intestine,

46
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:04,451
we have some negative feedback to slow down the function of the stomach.

47
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:08,413
So the intestine is being overloaded with food and

48
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:12,671
now it wants to slow down the activity of the stomach.

49
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:16,919
So in the stomach this is what we said, HCl denatures those except for

50
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,226
the primary structure and it activates pepsinogen.

51
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:24,293
And the optimal pH is definitely an acidic, low pH between 1.8 and 3.5.

52
00:03:24,293 --> 00:03:28,422
As I mentioned, is an enzyme that's released an active form and

53
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:32,140
then it needs an activator to become activated.

54
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,100
Be able to differentiate between those two, the endopeptidase and

55
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,287
the exopeptidase.

56
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:40,221
And endopeptidase think of it as being internal.

57
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:44,917
So it cleaves in the middle and this is why it's very unlikely that you will

58
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:48,721
get free amino acids under the action of an endopeptidase.

59
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:52,430
So usually the end products would be a week of peptides and polypeptides.

60
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,606
So there's still long chain amino acids.

61
00:03:56,606 --> 00:04:00,590
An exopeptidase, so everything exo is external.

62
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,129
So think of it as cleaving from the end.

63
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:07,929
Some exopeptidase are specific to the amino side of the protein and

64
00:04:07,929 --> 00:04:10,690
some are specific to the carbon side.

65
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,140
So, it depends and some are not specific.

66
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,520
So this will break the peptide bonds at the terminal ends.

67
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,445
And so if you're cleaving from the very last amino group then you will end up

68
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:25,030
with a free amino acid.

69
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:32,140
And the rest of the protein would be the oligopeptides or a polypeptide.

70
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,583
So we talked about pepsin, pepsin as an endopeptidase it's specific

71
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:41,240
to the C-terminal aromatic and hydrophobic amino acids.

72
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,080
[COUGH] So the end products and the stomach because pepsin

73
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,840
is an endopeptidase would be a polypeptides and the oligopeptides.

74
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,358
And we always keep changing our gastric pit cells because it's a very highly

75
00:04:54,358 --> 00:04:56,271
acidic medium and the stomach.

76
00:04:56,271 --> 00:05:04,340
And so they are always being damaged and we always need to recycle them.

77
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,355
So very high HCl would not be good because you'll be doing more

78
00:05:09,355 --> 00:05:16,340
damage to your gastric pit than what a normal HCl level is expected.

79
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,337
And antacids would block your proton pump,

80
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:24,460
so it will neutralize HCl.

81
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,703
And so if you're neutralizing HCl you will not get the benefits of

82
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,181
denaturing protein.

83
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:35,919
Because if you have less HCl then HCl cannot denature the protein structures all

84
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,680
of them, except for the primary structure which HCl cannot denature anyways.

85
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,221
And also HCl will not be able to promote the release of pepsinogen and

86
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:53,615
it will not be able to activate pepsinogen into pepsin,

87
00:05:53,615 --> 00:05:58,113
So you do not get the endopeptidase benefits.

88
00:05:58,113 --> 00:06:02,520
So the small intestine we have CCK that promotes

89
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,698
pancreatic juices to be secreted into the intestine and

90
00:06:07,698 --> 00:06:13,439
secretin that will neutralize the medium by, where is this?

91
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:20,040
Yes, by releasing bicarbonate over here.

92
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,591
So pancreatic juices.

93
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:24,034
They are trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen and

94
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:28,440
procarboxypeptidase those are all zymogens and they need to be activated.

95
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:36,240
So an enteropeptidase is as an enzyme that activates other enzymes.

96
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,847
So, just so that you do not confuse and entero with endo,

97
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:44,583
exopeptidase is entero think of it as being, I think of like enterosite and

98
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,840
this will remind you of the small intestine.

99
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,394
So this is in the small intestine and it activates trypsinogen into trypsin and

100
00:06:52,394 --> 00:06:56,465
then as soon as trypsin is activated it can keep on activating the other

101
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:58,900
trypsinogen that was not yet activated.

102
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,112
It also activates chymotrypsinogen and

103
00:07:01,112 --> 00:07:08,140
procarboxypeptidase into carboxypeptidase and chymotrypsin.

104
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,422
So both trypsin and

105
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:14,635
chymotripsin are endopeptidases the only exopeptidase we've mentioned so

106
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:23,140
far is this one the carboxypeptidase and it's specific to the C-terminal.

107
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,561
So under apical membrane.

108
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:30,425
So besides the previous enzymatic activity in the lumen,

109
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:34,495
we also have further enzymatic activity

110
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:39,180
that occurs on the apical membrane over here.

111
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,069
And those are the proteins available on the apical membrane,

112
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:46,521
the aminopeptidase so it cleaves at the N-terminal.

113
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:51,166
So it's more specific to the amino group side, and

114
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:55,501
it's non-specific for a certain amino acid.

115
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:56,840
That's what it means.

116
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,334
The end products are free amino acids and

117
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:03,819
then they can cross the basolateral membrane and go to the bloodstream.

118
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:06,647
A tripeptidase from the name is specific for tripeptides.

119
00:08:06,647 --> 00:08:10,433
It will cleave them into a free amino acid and dipeptide and

120
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:14,383
dipeptidylaminopeptidase which breaks down dipeptides.

121
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:19,535
And the end product would be a free amino acid and this is what we just

122
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:25,805
said goes to circulation and then di- and tripeptides and the apical membrane.

123
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,372
You need the PEPT1 system, so

124
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:33,902
that PEPT1 will take in a hydrogen and a peptide into the system and

125
00:08:33,902 --> 00:08:41,440
then the ATPAs over here we'll kick back the H+ into the lumen.

126
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,337
So the affinity of the carrier of course it depends on the side chain and

127
00:08:45,337 --> 00:08:49,340
the electric charge of the molecule.

128
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,151
And of course essential amino acids are absorbed more rapidly

129
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:58,058
than non-essential amino acids because the body is smart and it knows that if it

130
00:08:58,058 --> 00:09:02,698
can make the non-essential amino acids then it can forgo absorbing them.

131
00:09:02,698 --> 00:09:07,881
And it's what prioritize absorbing the essential amino acids that for

132
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,929
sure knows it cannot make by itself.

133
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:17,147
Okay, so then the enterocyte, we're still talking about the aminopeptidases,

134
00:09:17,147 --> 00:09:20,364
tripeptidases and the dipeptylaminopeptidase.

135
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:24,888
And then as we said, they get transported through the basolateral

136
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:28,543
membrane which is over here, and also the affinity.

137
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:33,708
And determining which ones will officially cross the basolateral membrane

138
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:38,306
into the blood will also depend on the side chain of the amino acid and

139
00:09:38,306 --> 00:09:42,220
the net charge.

140
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,188
Not all amino acids are absorbed into circulation.

141
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:50,812
Sometimes if your system is overloaded, kind of then your transporters

142
00:09:50,812 --> 00:09:56,258
because amino acids share transporters, they reach full capacity.

143
00:09:56,258 --> 00:10:00,940
And so anything excess might be excreted through the feces but

144
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,271
before it gets excreted through the feces,

145
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:09,507
the gut microbiome can utilize the nitrogen containing compounds.

146
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:13,440
So it can use, so I'll just move into here.

147
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,350
Everything that has not been absorbed.

148
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,647
It can be used by the bacteria cuz the bacteria can use nitrogen and

149
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:26,240
the protein has a nitrogen group on the side the amino group for growth.

150
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,239
And then everything else will be released into the feces if it had

151
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:32,830
not been absorbed.

152
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:37,027
And the sources of the 10 to 20 g per day,

153
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:43,511
that you excrete can be from the sloughing of the intestinal walls.

154
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:45,860
Because also we have proteins on those walls.

155
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,282
So that could be an indigenous source of protein that you are losing in the feces

156
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,230
and excreting.
