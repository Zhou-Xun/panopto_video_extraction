1
00:00:10,236 --> 00:00:12,963
Welcome back to Nutrition 590.

2
00:00:12,963 --> 00:00:16,208
I bet you never thought you'd
think about a possum or

3
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:20,210
a platypus in a public health
class on epigenetics and disease.

4
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,624
Well, today you will,

5
00:00:21,624 --> 00:00:27,058
as they are fundamental to
the evolution of genomic imprinting.

6
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:30,410
We all inherit two copies
of every autosomal gene,

7
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,450
one copy from our mother and
one copy from our father.

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,380
Both copies are functional for
the majority of our genes.

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,780
However, in a small subset,

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,690
one copy is turned off in
a parent-of-origin dependent manner.

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,110
These genes are called imprinted,
because one copy of the gene

12
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:55,948
was epigenetically marked or
silenced in either the egg or the sperm.

13
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:00,160
Thus, the allelic expression of
an imprinted gene depends upon

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,710
whether it resided in a male or
a female in the previous generation.

15
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,750
The first learning objective today
is to describe how the phenomenon

16
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,700
of genomic imprinting evolved in
a common ancestor to marsupials and

17
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,120
eutherian mammals over
150 million years ago.

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,560
Second, we will articulate why imprinted
genes are susceptibility targets for

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,660
numerous human pathologies.

20
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,640
The definition of genomic
imprinting is an epigenetic

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,270
chromosomal modification that results
in the preferential expression

22
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:43,070
of a gene in a mono-allelic
parent-of-origin dependent manner.

23
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:47,070
In other words,
a handful of autosomal genes in our genome

24
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,470
are inherited in a silent state
from one of the two parents and

25
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,570
in a fully active state from the other.

26
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,850
These genes are said to be
imprinted by their parents.

27
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,510
And the phenomenon has been
referred to as parental imprinting,

28
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:06,810
genomic imprinting, and
even gamedic imprinting.

29
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,097
At first, this seems like a major
violation of Gregor Mendel's laws of

30
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:15,741
inheritance, which state that allelic
behavior is independent of the sex of

31
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:18,114
the parent from whom it was inherited.

32
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:22,761
While imprinted gene expression in somatic
cells is independent of the sex of

33
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:23,833
the individual,

34
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:28,638
it is dependent upon the sex of the parent
from which the allele was originated.

35
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:31,840
And you can see that here in the diagram.

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,742
There are alleles that are inherited
from the egg, the mother, and

37
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:38,972
a second allele inherited from the sperm,
the father.

38
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:43,438
In a non-imprinted gene,
both of these alleles are expressed, but

39
00:02:43,438 --> 00:02:47,080
the opposite occurs in an imprinted gene.

40
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,990
And in this example on the bottom,

41
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,740
we're showing an imprinted gene that's
parentally or paternally imprinted.

42
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,380
So the copy from the sperm has
an epigenetically silencing mark, and

43
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,830
that means the gene is not
expressed from that allele.

44
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,410
One potentially detrimental
consequence of imprinting

45
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,530
is that the functionally haploid state
of these genes eliminates the protection

46
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:17,030
from recessive mutations that being
a diploid organism usually affords.

47
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,750
These genes are therefore at greater
risk of an activation by mutation,

48
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,980
which you see in the diagram.

49
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,370
For example, in the top example,
which is a not imprinted gene, if there is

50
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,830
a spontaneous mutation, and we're showing
this in the father's copy, there can

51
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,930
still be normal cell development because
there's a functional copy from the mother.

52
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,760
But in the case of an imprinted gene,
on the bottom, a spontaneous mutation

53
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,730
in the active allele means that
no alleles are expressed, and

54
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,820
this can lead to a cancer phenotype.

55
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,810
In fact, the imprinted silent state
has been equated to the first hit

56
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:01,080
in the proposed Knudson two-hit
step model for carcinogenesis.

57
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,510
We first begin to know about
imprinted genes back in the 1980s,

58
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,811
following the elegant nuclear transplation
studies that were pioneered by Surani and

59
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:11,930
colleagues.

60
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,240
These experiments demonstrated
that mammalian development

61
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,070
requires genetic information from
both the mother and the father.

62
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:25,030
And what these scientists did was
create diploid androgenetic embryos,

63
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,750
which were derived from two sperm,
or diploid gynogenetic embryos,

64
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,961
which were derived from
two female pronuclei.

65
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:38,300
And in both cases,
the developing embryos failed to thrive.

66
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,580
They reasoned that there must
be genes that are exclusively

67
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,210
expressed from one parental genome.

68
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,370
And the failure of uniparental
embryos to develop appropriately

69
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,990
was due to the loss of
the function of these genes.

70
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,580
It took another decade for the first
imprinted genes to be identified, and

71
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,462
these were IGF2 in IGF2R,

72
00:04:58,462 --> 00:05:05,060
this is insulin-like growth factor 2 and
it's a receptor.

73
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,580
Using mouse studies, we've learned
a lot about these two imprinted genes.

74
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,730
For example, in mice that lack
IGF2 expression, they're dwarfed.

75
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:20,740
While mice that have too much IGF2
expression are larger than normal.

76
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,060
In contrast,
mice that lack the receptor IGF2R

77
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,110
will accumulate abnormally high levels
of IGF2 and have strong overgrowth

78
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:37,030
phenotypes, together with skeletal,
heart, and lung abnormalities.

79
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,920
Imprinted gene regulation also plays an
important role in the etiology of several

80
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,330
pediatric disorders.

81
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,150
The first is Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.

82
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,360
This is a growth disorder that can
affect several parts of the body.

83
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,160
Babies and children are larger than
normal, usually until the age of about

84
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,780
eight, and then growth slows down,
resulting in average height.

85
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,420
The imprinted chromosome regions affected
by Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome include

86
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,160
that IGF2 H19 region
that we just discussed.

87
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,700
Angelman syndrome is a genetic order
that affects the nervous system.

88
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,520
Symptoms can include small head,

89
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,660
specific facial appearance, intellectual
and developmental disabilities,

90
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:27,600
speaking problems, moving problems,
seizures, and sleep problems.

91
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,390
Angelman syndrome occurs because
the loss of the maternal contribution

92
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,030
of one of these imprinted genes.

93
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,080
It turns out that the region on chromosome
15 that is involved in Angelman syndrome

94
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,360
also contains another important gene,
but it's imprinted in the opposite way.

95
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,934
In this case, when the parental or
the paternal contribution is lost,

96
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:53,988
this results in a condition
known as Prader–Willi syndrome.

97
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:58,167
Prader–Willi syndrome patients suffer
from extreme feeding problems,

98
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:03,150
including hyperphagia, insatiable
appetite, and obsession with food.

99
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,390
The region on a chromosome 15 that
is involved in Angelman syndrome

100
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,640
is also involved in Prader–Willi syndrome.

101
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,800
In addition to these developmental
disorders, imprinted genes are also

102
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,960
proposed to be involved in a number
of other neurobehavioral disorders.

103
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,020
Including autism,
bipolar disorder, epilepsy,

104
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:28,050
schizophrenia, and
several different types of cancers.

105
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,360
But the imprinted genes involved
in these disorders have not yet

106
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,140
been completely identified.

107
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,980
So why might we, when I say we, mammals,

108
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:45,420
have developed such a strange form of
gene regulation that can be detrimental?

109
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,490
The consequences of imprinting
are potentially dangerous because

110
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,340
we eliminate the protection of diploidy.

111
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,410
The major drawback of
imprinted genes has spawned

112
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,070
many philosophical debates
about why they have evolved.

113
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:06,430
One model postulates that imprinted genes
evolved to prevent parthenogenesis,

114
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,500
and that the imprinting of
a few genes is negligible

115
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,050
to the guaranteed functional
diploidy in all of our other genes.

116
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,380
Another theory proposes that imprinting
evolved as a consequence of host defense,

117
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,570
in which we want to protect ourselves
against parasitic, foreign DNA.

118
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:31,110
And that the presence of imprinted
genes represents a small side effect.

119
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,110
In contrast,

120
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:37,380
a third model of imprinting evolution
is termed the conflict hypothesis.

121
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,050
The conflict hypothesis views imprinting

122
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,510
not as a beneficial adaptation
of the species, but

123
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,530
rather as a consequence of
a reproductive battle between the sexes.

124
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,260
This involves polygamy, viviparity, and

125
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:55,020
skewed maternal versus paternal
investment in the offspring.

126
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,890
According to this theory,
imprinting arose because of a genetic

127
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,030
tug of war between the parents, that it's
meant to control the amount of nutrients

128
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,970
extracted from the mother
by her offspring.

129
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,190
The conflict theory predicts
that paternally expressed genes

130
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,480
promote prenatal growth to
benefit the offspring fitness.

131
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,530
While maternally expressed genes
suppress growth to maximize reproductive

132
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:25,530
performance and ensure that the mother has
enough resources for any future progeny.

133
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,920
It was originally thought that
genomic imprinting developed

134
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,580
with the evolution of placental mammals,
which are called eutherians.

135
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,730
Because this is where the extraction
of nutrients from the mother is

136
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:42,210
particularly great during that inner
uterine fetal stage of development.

137
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,658
To test this prediction,
the imprint status of those IGF2 and

138
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:51,413
IGF2R genes was determined in birds,
which are call aves, so

139
00:09:51,413 --> 00:09:54,230
these are egg-laying non-mammals,

140
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,860
monotremes, which are egg-laying mammals,
and marsupials.

141
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,737
What the scientists found by looking
at all of these animal species is that

142
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:10,402
imprinting evolved 150 million years ago
in a common ancestor of the marsupial and

143
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:13,334
the ungulates, which are hoofed mammals.

144
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:18,837
Such that egg-laying mammals, like
the platypus, do not have imprinted genes,

145
00:10:18,837 --> 00:10:23,370
but marsupials, like the possum,
do have imprinted genes.

146
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:29,860
Thus, imprinted genes arose with
species that contain a placenta.

147
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:35,260
Interestingly, some imprinted genes
were lost in primates, like humans,

148
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,400
and this includes IGF2R, which is
an anti-growth tumor suppressor gene.

149
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,600
We want this gene on an expressed.

150
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,520
And we hypothesize that this
is one reasons why rodents,

151
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:53,360
who have imprinted IGF2R, have a higher
incidence of cancer compared to humans.

152
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,540
The conflict hypothesis have a number
of evolutionary predictions.

153
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,170
First, paternally expressed genes,

154
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,160
which we call maternally imprinted,
will be pro-growth.

155
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,920
And in fact, insulin-like growth
factor 2 is a pro-growth gene.

156
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,910
Second, maternally expressed genes,
which we call paternally imprinted,

157
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,190
will be anti-growth, and
you see that in the receptor IGF2R.

158
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,700
This also predicts species-dependent
susceptibility to cancer

159
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,130
due to the evolution of certain
types of imprinted genes.

160
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,740
We also know that cloning introduces
what we call large offspring syndrome.

161
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,920
And this is due to the fact that imprinted
genes are not completely reprogrammed

162
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,610
during cloning.

163
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:45,000
And finally, biological responses due to
imprinting gene regulation are difficult

164
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,400
to extrapolate not only between species,
but also between tissues.

165
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,480
A gene could be imprinted in, say, the
brain, where only one copy is turned on,

166
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,173
but be normally expressed with two copies
in a different tissue, such as the liver.
