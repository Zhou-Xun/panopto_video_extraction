1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,810
amondul: Well, between us will get worked out someone will record it there, we go.

2
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:17,130
amondul: Okay, so we are going to now kind of dive into a section of the class where we're going to be talking about different kinds of studies and study designs.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:25,740
amondul: we're going to start you know there's sort of this pyramid of evidence right and everyone says the gold standard the best evidence is from a randomized control trial.

4
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,830
amondul: And then kind of below that as cohort studies and we're going to we're going to think about what that means.

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:42,870
amondul: As we integrate everything toward the end of the class when we after we learned about biases and sources of bias you'll understand why certain study designs have less biased than others.

6
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:54,540
amondul: But randomized control trials certainly minimize some of the biases that we care about, but they are perfect and we're going to hear about some of the pros and cons of them today we're also going to talk about cohort studies okay.

7
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:05,400
amondul: Alright, so let's talk about the basic study done in a randomized controlled trials, so what we're going to keep coming back to in this section is this idea that the objective of epidemiological studies.

8
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:13,650
amondul: is to look at some factor which we often call the exposure and we want to know if it is causing a health outcome.

9
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:26,070
amondul: You know, we often see associations between things in our studies, but we really want to know what we're trying to understand is whether this thing is causing our outcome right that's that's the goal of what we're doing.

10
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:34,200
amondul: When we say factor or exposure, it can be lots of different things, it can be a social factor, it could be behavioral like smoking.

11
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:47,040
amondul: diet alcohol drinking it can be a gene, it can be a drug, like a new treatment that we're testing and a randomized control trial, it can be a policy that was an active so exposures can be lots of different things.

12
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:56,490
amondul: Okay, and we want to know if they're causing health outcomes, so a health event disease occurrence death relapse Those are all possible outcomes okay.

13
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:10,500
amondul: So randomized control trials are called lots of different things you're going to see them referred to as lots of different things we have lots of words for them don't be confused, these are some of the things that you will see the called.

14
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:20,520
amondul: Experimental study and intervention study a randomized clinical trial a randomized controlled trial and then we're just gonna throw all the words in there at once and call them a randomized controlled clinical trial.

15
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:28,620
amondul: So often you'll see the observed as an rct and you can decide what you think the C stands for, in your own mind it's one of those two.

16
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,320
amondul: Okay.

17
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:49,770
amondul: All right, so we can classify randomized controlled trials, as in lots of different way, we can have an individual or Community trials, we can have prevention or treatment trials therapeutic trials clinical trials and field trials and we're going to go through some examples of these.

18
00:02:51,840 --> 00:03:06,060
amondul: The key characteristic of all randomized trials, is that the investigator is going to assign the explosion exposure at random to study participants, that is the key that makes something a try to control randomized control trial okay.

19
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:19,740
amondul: The investigator will then observed that there are differences in health outcomes between people who were and we're not exposed to the factor of interest and special care is taken, ensuring that the follow up is done in a in an identical way in those groups.

20
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,290
amondul: And this is kind of the gold standard for.

21
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,370
amondul: Establishing causality between a factor and an outcome.

22
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,390
amondul: So here are the steps that you would take to do one of these us form a hypothesis.

23
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:42,990
amondul: Then you have to recruit your study participants or participants or if you're going to use Community trials, you have to recruit communities, based on specific criteria.

24
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:50,220
amondul: You have to get their informed consent or get the local governments engaged in this in the case of a Community trial.

25
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:58,980
amondul: You have to get eligible and willing participants that are them randomly allocated to receive assignment to a particular study group so intervention group or a control group.

26
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:07,650
amondul: And then your study groups are going to be monitored for the outcome that you're interested in whatever it may be, and rates of the outcome in your groups are going to be compared.

27
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:18,330
amondul: So, here are some examples does tamoxifen lower the incidence of breast cancer in women with high risk profile compared to high risk women not given tamoxifen.

28
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:26,940
amondul: So this is something they actually did they took women who were at high risk of breast cancer, a randomized some of them to get tamoxifen, which is a drug that.

29
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,170
amondul: reduces the risk of your positive breast cancer, and then they give gave the other women.

30
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:44,970
amondul: placebo they compared them and it turned out that the women who about tamoxifen actually had a lower risk of breast cancer, so this is something that's often get into high risk women because the chemo preventive agent.

31
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:56,640
amondul: Does intensive one on one health counseling regarding risk behaviors help prevent cardiovascular disease and at risk subjects compared to usual care.

32
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:06,150
amondul: Okay, so this is a little bit more, I think this one The first one is is kind of the kind of thing that most people think of when you say randomized control trials, they think of a drug.

33
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,090
amondul: randomizing some people to get a drug and comparing it to not a drug for treating and preventing disease right.

34
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:21,960
amondul: But this is an example of one, two, in this case it's not a drug you're offering health counseling right to people, and so what you want to know is like did the people who got our particular educational.

35
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:29,340
amondul: Health counseling intervention do better in terms of their cardiovascular disease than people who didn't write.

36
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:37,710
amondul: Do combinations of two or three antiretroviral drugs prolong survival age AIDS patients, as well as regimens of single drugs.

37
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:50,040
amondul: So we're going to talk about this in a few slides, but you often cannot use a placebo if you're going to study, something that already has a treat that it is unethical to randomize people to receive a placebo right.

38
00:05:51,300 --> 00:06:01,260
amondul: You can't take like if you're going to study like this you're going to study survival and AIDS patients, there is a single drug that we have we want to know if this cocktail works better.

39
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:12,270
amondul: You can't give people nothing in your trial right because that's unethical, so you have to compare your new thing to what exists or current standard of care.

40
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:15,810
amondul: All right.

41
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:24,390
amondul: So this is a graph or a not a graph a picture schematic a flow chart that you're going to see a lot of times in this class.

42
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:34,770
amondul: We are always trying to sample a study population from some source population Okay, so you get some source population you sample your study population from that source.

43
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:43,500
amondul: And then, for a randomized control trial, we are randomizing them to either be exposed or not exposed to our exposure our factor of interest okay.

44
00:06:45,390 --> 00:07:01,050
amondul: This is just kind of continuing the flow chart then in those who are exposed and not exposed we're going to count up who does and doesn't have the event okay and we're going to then compare risk rates of the event in are exposed and unexposed people.

45
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:16,020
amondul: So why do we bother with randomization so the goal here is to achieve baseline comparability between the groups, the essence of a good comparison between treatments or exposures, is that the compared groups are the same, except for the treatment.

46
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:27,090
amondul: If people were to we're going to talk about this when we get to our lecture Essentially, this is what we call, confounding this this problem of them, not being the same except for the treatment so imagine.

47
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,930
amondul: If people were to choose their exposure.

48
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,180
amondul: Can somebody come up with an exposure maybe that you might use in a trial.

49
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:47,100
amondul: How about like a vitamin for for vitamin supplement for preventing cancer.

50
00:07:49,980 --> 00:08:01,590
amondul: If you didn't do a trial and you let people pick on their own you just went out and ask people are you a person who takes a vitamin or not, do you expect those people to be the same in every way, except for taking vitamin.

51
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:10,470
amondul: Know there's a lot of things that people like name some things that you think might be different about people who do and don't take vitamins.

52
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:14,730
Nolaundron Harris: A.

53
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,180
amondul: Ah sure absolutely.

54
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,200
Nolaundron Harris: present.

55
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:34,110
amondul: Pre existing conditions right sure, maybe people more health conscious says nice absolutely people could take vitamins may be really health conscious, which means maybe they have a better diet.

56
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,510
amondul: Maybe they don't smoke, maybe they.

57
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,710
exercise.

58
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,240
amondul: Right.

59
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,960
amondul: Maybe when you said pre existing conditions, maybe they actually do have other things and they're like oh crud.

60
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:52,380
amondul: I really need to do something about my diet, maybe I should take a supplement right, so I mean it can kind of go either way but.

61
00:08:52,860 --> 00:09:06,450
amondul: Generally, we imagine that people who are taking vitamins might be kind of more health conscious maybe socio economic status right like if you've got a bunch of money to spend it GMC invite every supplement, there is, you know and you're probably have money for other stuff right.

62
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:16,980
amondul: So when we want to do a trial, we are trying to we are randomizing people to that exposure we're saying you are going to take vitamin you're not.

63
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:26,640
amondul: Go to your corners here's your bottle of vitamins here you've modeled love not vitamins go go do your thing for a while and then come back and we're going to find out if you have a disease.

64
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:38,340
amondul: Okay, so we are now achieved and compatibility between the groups, because we are randomly assigning people to that exposure, so it should not be associated with anything else going on with them right.

65
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:56,880
amondul: So how can you know if you're randomization work well, we compare people according to what what group they were randomized to on all kinds of other things, and what you want to see is that there aren't big differences right so here, for example, this is a trial that have three arms.

66
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:05,100
amondul: Out of control diapers to vegetables diet and sensor combination diet right they had about equal numbers of people in each one.

67
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:19,050
amondul: And so you just look across yeah basically they're all around the same age right the mean age it's about the same it's like you know 4048 50% female that's about the same.

68
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:32,340
amondul: Now minority is about equal you know so you're looking at cross and you're not seeing like big differences in the percentage of these groups right the income distribution is about the same in each of these.

69
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:41,520
amondul: And it might even look more the same if we had this is only 150 or so people per group, but it really big trials, where you have thousands of people per group you end up with like.

70
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,570
amondul: You don't even see these little blips up and down across groups it's pretty even keel.

71
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:59,970
amondul: Okay, if you saw big differences, you would go oh something went really weird with our randomization, the more people you have in your study the less likely, you are to get kind of chance associations with other things, when you analyze.

72
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:10,410
amondul: So what this is getting back to kind of what I mentioned a few slides ago what are typical comparison or control groups and randomized control trials.

73
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:18,360
amondul: Well, number one is a placebo right, this is a biological intervention, which is used to elicit any nonspecific psychological effects of the test intervention.

74
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:32,940
amondul: is designed to resemble the test intervention as closely as possible, except for the presumably active component okay so it's just trying to give people something so they don't know essentially whether they've gotten the active pill or the active treatment or not.

75
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,990
amondul: um but you can't always do that right, you might be comparing vaccine at vaccine be.

76
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:57,000
amondul: So you can't do if there's already a vaccine for this disease, it is unethical to randomize people to not get the vaccine right in your trial, you cannot randomize people to not get something that might be beneficial to them.

77
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,060
amondul: And so.

78
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,700
amondul: If something already exists you're going to have to compare your new thing to the old thing.

79
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:19,380
amondul: which can be, on the one hand, like it's more difficult to see an effect of your new drug, on the other hand, why do we need a new drug field one works, just as well right is kind of the kind of answer.

80
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:33,780
amondul: But if you expect the difference to be not a huge improvement you're going to need a really big trial to try to see the difference right, so there can be some challenges with this, but it's very important that we conduct these kinds of things separately.

81
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,640
amondul: So.

82
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:47,040
amondul: there's also this idea of a usual care comparison group right, so this requires careful attention to what is actually provided to the control group so that your findings are attributable.

83
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,110
amondul: To tell you is a horror story about the usual care control group.

84
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,770
amondul: Has anybody heard of the PLC no trial.

85
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:18,390
amondul: No good, this is a new story for everybody very exciting okay PLC oh was a trial it's called the prostate long colorectal and ovarian cancer screening trial, so it was a big trial, where they were looking at screening tests for all of these different things.

86
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:30,060
amondul: For the prostate cancer one this was conducted in like 99 it was started in like 1992 or something so they were interested in looking at PSA screening, which had just come out to the public at that, at that time.

87
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:38,670
amondul: So they randomized all the men and their trial to either be in the treatment in the vaccine or excuse me, the screening arm of the trial.

88
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:47,400
amondul: Or the the non screening arm and the non screening are about standard of care usual standard good That means they went to their doctor and got, whatever their doctor one of them to do.

89
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:56,610
amondul: And the screening arm got PSA blood test screening from PLC unfortunately for PLC Oh, what happened.

90
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:13,260
amondul: Is that the usual standard of care very quickly became to give men a PSA tests, so what they ended up doing was spending millions and millions of dollars or and amazing people to compare men who got PSA from them to men who got PSA from their doctor.

91
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:23,040
amondul: Do you think that there was a big difference in prostate cancer mortality between these two groups, because they both ended up getting the same thing.

92
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:35,610
amondul: There was not, and so they had contamination right, so this usual care group got you know got PSA in the end, and they weren't comparing people about it to people who didn't get it, they just everybody got it, it was thickness.

93
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:46,710
amondul: So people are still fighting over this and publishing papers about it in the literature, but that's an example of where our usual care can go awry so you have to be very careful right, but you also can't tell them.

94
00:14:47,820 --> 00:15:01,740
amondul: there's no way to do that trial and tillman you can't get a PSA test from your doctor if you're in the study right because you cannot tell people not to get something that would be beneficial to them that's unethical, so it becomes kind of a sticky wicket if that makes sense.

95
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:15,540
amondul: Alright, so there's also all of these different phases of clinical trials that we've all probably heard about some of you physicians probably know more about this than I do, but it's phase one through four.

96
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:23,970
amondul: Phase three is kind of the big trials that we usually hear about these are the ones that kind of end up determining whether.

97
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:37,980
amondul: A drug or vaccine or whatever actually works right, so this is to evaluate effectiveness it's a randomized control trial they usually last several years you're going to have hundreds to thousands of people in a demographically diverse sample ideally.

98
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,790
amondul: And you're going to compare rob X to some sort of standard treatment.

99
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:53,730
amondul: Before you get to this phase, which requires a lot of money and effort to do you need some preliminary groundwork right, so you have to have results from phase one and phase two trials in order to get to phase three.

100
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:08,610
amondul: Phase one is where you're essentially it's in a small number of healthy volunteers you're kind of trying to figure out what the right dose is to get your effect without causing side effects so it's sort of a dose finding kind of a trial.

101
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,420
amondul: Phase two is.

102
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:21,600
amondul: Where you're comparing your drugs here placebo it's sort of like a pre phase three trial you're doing it just to a smaller number of people for a shorter time.

103
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:30,120
amondul: Just kind of proving to yourself that there's enough that they're there to go ahead and spend all the money on the on the random on both history does that make sense.

104
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,450
amondul: And then days for um.

105
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:45,390
amondul: You know it's basically if you're going to monitor ongoing safety and that's kind of an observational thing is that it's not a trial really you're just observing people taking this drug doing whatever it is, in the kind of real world.

106
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,520
amondul: Okay.

107
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,020
amondul: Any questions on that, before we start talking about internal and external validity.

108
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,260
amondul: So, as we said.

109
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:22,560
amondul: You have a source population from which you are sampling I studied population your then randomizing them to your new treatment or your current treatment internal validity is the ability to get the correct answer here, for your study population.

110
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,550
amondul: Okay, so internal validity is about whether you're getting the right answer in your study for your study population.

111
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:43,170
amondul: External validity, on the other hand, is also called generalize ability and that is about whether you can generalize your results to your source population right.

112
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:57,810
amondul: So let's talk about the source population is the population to whom the results of the intervention are thought to be applicable and from whom the study population is drawn your study population is meant to be kind of a random subset of that.

113
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:08,010
amondul: So, as we said internal validity of the ability to reach the correct conclusion in your study but generalize ability is being able to generalize it to your larger source population.

114
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:16,440
amondul: a really big problem in a lot of randomized trials, up to now, that that we're really trying to grapple with and deal with.

115
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:28,980
amondul: In biomedical research is a lack of generalized quality in terms of a lack of racial and ethnic diversity and a lot of randomized control trials right so up until recently.

116
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:39,060
amondul: When there's been a big push to try to include racial ethnic minorities in randomized controlled trials, they were largely white right and so.

117
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:49,680
amondul: If your goal is to generalize say to the whole US population and you're sampling, a group of people who are not really representative of that source population because they're large there right.

118
00:18:51,960 --> 00:19:01,020
amondul: You probably have you may have done a very good study, free from bias, such that you get the correct conclusion for white people.

119
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,830
amondul: But then you're, the question is, is that valid to generalize to everybody.

120
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,790
amondul: Sometimes, yes right.

121
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:26,310
amondul: Sometimes know there are good examples in pharmacology physiology for example of genetic differences in racial and ethnic groups, where a drug does not act, the same way.

122
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:37,140
amondul: there's A particular example, this is falling out of my head, right now, but I think it's like a cardiovascular drug that like does not work in Asian people right the way that it works in other racial groups, because of the genetic.

123
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:46,620
amondul: Difference so yeah I mean it may not actually be generalizable to everybody, so this is something that you always have to think about.

124
00:19:49,830 --> 00:20:04,890
amondul: So how can you end up with a lack of external validity well are there, different demographic differences between eligible and ineligible subgroups does your intervention mirror what will happen in the Community or source population so.

125
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:13,830
amondul: You can lose people from your source population of lots of different points right, so you can have people who are ineligible to participate in your trial.

126
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:21,150
amondul: Maybe, because they have to be a certain age group, or they have to be a certain kind of health status to be included in your trial right.

127
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:31,560
amondul: And then you have this group subgroup of people who are eligible, but a lot of people might decline participation right, and this is actually where a lot, I think.

128
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:40,740
amondul: More of the issue happens in terms of creating a lack of external validity right it's like who declines participation in your trial.

129
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:58,890
amondul: But you can also have that happen at the eligibility stage I just thought of a good example where in the cancer world, for example, like where are most big randomized controlled trials for cancer treatments happening, but they happening at like Community hospitals.

130
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,670
amondul: Mostly know right there, mostly happening at like big tertiary care centers like.

131
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:07,830
amondul: sega.

132
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,710
amondul: St jude for kids sure.

133
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:25,260
amondul: A lot of pediatric stuff happens there also for for adults, you know, maybe you like memorial sloan kettering or university Michigan a hospital or a phone in Texas md Anderson right and so.

134
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,850
who goes to and.

135
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:38,970
amondul: Maybe mass general sure like these big tertiary care centers right and people who go there to be treated or not always the people who live around there right.

136
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:49,980
amondul: I remember you know I did I did my my PhD at Johns Hopkins and the cancer patients are coming to Johns Hopkins did not live in baltimore right they were traveling from all over the world to be treated there.

137
00:21:51,030 --> 00:22:01,140
amondul: And so you probably get a lot of wealthy people right who have the means to travel and good health insurance to be treated at these very expensive places.

138
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:17,160
amondul: And so, if your eligibility is i'm a doctor at X hospital and so i'm going to do this trial in my patients or i'm going to do it at this facility, suddenly, you have an eligible population that may be as you're different from what you imagine your source population to be.

139
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,800
amondul: Does that make sense.

140
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:21,660
amondul: Okay.

141
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:29,130
amondul: So you have eligible people, some will decline to participate, some will consent to participate.

142
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:36,420
amondul: And you know part of why we get decline in participation among some racial ethnic groups is lack of.

143
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:43,740
amondul: You know, faith in the medical system, a lack of belief that their best interests are what we have in mind.

144
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:54,150
amondul: I gave examples on the first day of you know failures of public health tuskegee study being one of the big ones where black people in this country were not.

145
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,860
amondul: treated well we're not offered appropriate informed consent.

146
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:13,320
amondul: And that this was covered up and was done by the CDC right for a long time, and so there is a lot of distrust among some groups in this country of participating in medical studies right and so it's, it is a difficult thing to to.

147
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:19,440
amondul: To get around but certainly people are trying it's a big push and trials, is to try to recruit.

148
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,990
amondul: Diverse populations.

149
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:37,350
amondul: Okay, so, then you got the people who can send them and you allocate them to your treatments, you can also lose people here, and this can cause problems with your internal validity right getting the right answer last to follow up what if, like.

150
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:44,370
amondul: Treatment be is the usual standard of care it's fine but treatment, a it turns out, you get a lot of nausea if you take this drug.

151
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:55,950
amondul: People are going to drop out and they'll take it right, but only this one not both so you're going to have a problem here, where you may lose people and not be able to find out about their outcome in one of your groups.

152
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:09,300
amondul: And you know compliance, you might get people who just if one of your treatments is much more onerous than the other people might not comply right compliance is a huge problem and dietary trials.

153
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,970
amondul: Right, people are really bad at following like a very rigid diet, particularly for any length of time.

154
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:29,220
amondul: Which fair, I mean I like I like eating food too so that's really hard work to get people to get dietary trials done.

155
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:37,710
amondul: Alright, so when we're thinking about eligibility criteria, you know this has to be substantive what group or you're interested in right.

156
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:43,320
amondul: If you're interested in a in a in a breast cancer drug or not going to group them, for example, right.

157
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:51,390
amondul: If you're interested in something related to like fertility you're not going to recruit women who are outside of childbearing age, for example, right, so this is this is substantive.

158
00:24:52,050 --> 00:25:06,390
amondul: it's also logistical what group is accessible who's going to comply with their study protocol how feasible is complete and accurate follow up on the subjects, this is where we get into that i'm going to use people who come to my hospital right, because I can follow them more easily.

159
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,460
amondul: kind of a problem.

160
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:17,850
amondul: um you know characteristics of volunteers, how does your study population different from the total experimental population or your total source population right.

161
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,740
amondul: All right, and then, when we're talking about internal validity.

162
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:29,760
amondul: Threats to internal will be can be things like your ability of your subjects to provide valid and reliable data.

163
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,670
amondul: This could be mental and cognitive status, it could be language fluency right.

164
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:46,080
amondul: expected compliance with the regiments you know you have to, if you want people to take this medication every day, you have to have a population of people who are going to be able to do that.

165
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:53,280
amondul: And you want people who have a low probability of dropping out so this might be people who don't have co morbidity he's.

166
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,160
amondul: Right who aren't going to like get sick and not be able to.

167
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:05,820
amondul: Continue might be people who live in a certain area so that you're going to be so that maybe they maybe part of your protocol so they have to come back to the hospital for blood tests or something right.

168
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:14,910
amondul: So you're not going to recruit people who are going to be really far away from your hospital, because then they're not going to be able to come back and complete your protocol they're going to drop out right, so this is kind of.

169
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,950
amondul: Sometimes.

170
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:28,320
amondul: Sometimes, in order to get participants who we think are going to provide us with good internal validity we threaten our external validity.

171
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:44,760
amondul: Does that make sense, so it's kind of this balancing act of like I want the right people who are going to really fully participate in this trial, who are going to be easy for me to follow so then i'm going to have an internally valid study get the right answer.

172
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,230
amondul: But then you have to make sure you're not sure shooting yourself in the foot and.

173
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:57,450
amondul: Not having any external validity because you've got this weird subset of people that you've recruited into your study who aren't really representative of your source population.

174
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,570
amondul: it's not easy.

175
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:14,040
amondul: it's easy to point out the flaws it's easy to point out the ways that we can get to a poor internal validity or poor external validity, but Designing an actual study of the tries to maximize both is a challenge.

176
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,300
amondul: Alright, so.

177
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:30,600
amondul: In terms of compliance you want people sticking with the intervention of placebo non compliance makes the compared groups more alike and so strategies to enhance compliance exist at the design phase.

178
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:46,680
amondul: blending is one thing that helps with internal validity also can be called masking okay single blind, is where the participant does not know if they're getting what group they're in right, so they don't know if they're getting a placebo or the actual active pill.

179
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,510
amondul: This can be really helpful when your outcome is something.

180
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,640
amondul: kind of subjective like how much pain you're feeling.

181
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,790
amondul: Like rate you're paying for me on a scale of one to 10.

182
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:08,610
amondul: Someone who believes that they've received a drug can have kind of a placebo effect and feel like they're doing better right, and so, if they don't know which one they've gotten.

183
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,690
amondul: they're not going to be in their answers won't be influenced by that.

184
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:19,290
amondul: or there'll be equally influenced by the placebo effect, whether there, no matter what group there in.

185
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:27,120
amondul: Double blinding is where both the participant in the study team are blinded this is really useful.

186
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:44,760
amondul: When the study team is going to evaluate the outcome right so when the doctor is going to perform an evaluation where maybe the study team leader or the doctor or physician or whatever has some some subjective role in determining their outcome.

187
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:55,650
amondul: Right, so this can be really helpful there and triple blind lining is where even the data analyst does not know when they're analyzing the data what the answer is.

188
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:00,330
amondul: Right so then there's no no chance that the data analyst is.

189
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:06,600
amondul: massaging anything to try to get the the right answer right so.

190
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,580
amondul: I would say that.

191
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:20,760
amondul: All of this is less important, if you have a very hard outcome like death, for example, or something like that right there's not a lot of placebo effect and whether you die from something or not.

192
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,500
amondul: So.

193
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:29,190
amondul: You know, sometimes you don't do this because.

194
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,860
amondul: The the.

195
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:40,110
amondul: benefit is minimal compared to like the logistical difficulties or the cost associated with trying to implement this kind of thing.

196
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:55,560
amondul: But certainly when there's any kind of subjective response from the participant or subjective evaluation from the study team in terms of determining the outcome, not knowing what the people are getting in terms of treatment is really helpful.

197
00:29:59,370 --> 00:29:59,730
amondul: Okay.

198
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,320
amondul: Any questions about kind of designing trials.

199
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:17,610
amondul: Alright, so now we're going to talk about how we calculate measures, of association and effect in these studies.

200
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:22,830
amondul: So there's kind of two different types of measures of association that we can calculate what is the ratio.

201
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:32,280
amondul: measures and then the other, the difference measures so there's the risk reward ratio and the ratio, so I taught you how to calculate the risk.

202
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:47,730
amondul: Or the cumulative incidence and I taught you how to calculate it incidence rate and now all we're going to do is divide the brain in the exposed by the rate in the unexposed or the risk and the exposed by the rate in the unexposed to get the ratio.

203
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,440
amondul: Okay.

204
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:56,460
amondul: And then he would do the same thing with different measures, you can do the risk risk difference where you subtract.

205
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:06,900
amondul: The risk and the unexposed from the risk in the exposed and then there's a particular measure, a different measure in randomized clinical trials, called the efficacy, this is specific to trials.

206
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:17,880
amondul: Okay, I would say that, with the exception of efficacy in general in all of these studies that we're going to talk about you see the ratio measures much more frequently than the different measures.

207
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:36,030
amondul: Okay, so I just said this, the relative risk is the cumulative incidents in a exposed divided by the cumulative incidents in the unexposed so you get a ratio of risks or risk ratio, this is often called the relative risk as well.

208
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:43,830
amondul: The ratio is the incidence rate in the exposed divided by the incidence rate in the unexposed.

209
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:48,810
amondul: The.

210
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:58,920
amondul: efficacy, as I said, is the cumulative incidents in the placebo group group minus the cumulative incidence in the treatment group divided by the cumulative incidents and the placebo group.

211
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,660
amondul: So this is a very specific measure to trials.

212
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:18,240
amondul: Okay, so you've seen this before you have your source population from which you sample your study population.

213
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:34,020
amondul: You randomly allocate them to either be exposed or unexposed to your factor and then envies you kind of into the exposed and and the unexposed separately you look at who has your outcome Okay, so we can make from this a two by two table.

214
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:39,270
amondul: here's your treatment, this is your exposure, we have drug a versus placebo.

215
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:48,360
amondul: And then in drug a we have those who did and did not develop disease and those who did not develop disease in the placebo group.

216
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:56,850
amondul: So if I asked you to calculate the cumulative incidence of disease in those who received drug a.

217
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,750
amondul: I hope you would know that it is a over a plus B.

218
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,050
amondul: Those who got the disease divided by the total number of people at risk.

219
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:16,140
amondul: And if I asked you to calculate the cumulative incidents in the placebo group I hope you know it would be see oversee plus D.

220
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,970
amondul: So if you divide one by the other This gives you the risk ratio.

221
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,710
amondul: Is that confusing to anybody, do we need to go over any part of that.

222
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,100
Nolaundron Harris: One more.

223
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:32,850
Nolaundron Harris: Just again.

224
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:46,530
amondul: that's Okay, so if I asked you to calculate the cumulative incidence in the exposed exposed people are those who are getting the treatment, the drug so that's this row right here let's see if I have my special 10.

225
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,630
and two.

226
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,760
amondul: So this, no, no, we don't want to race I.

227
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,090
amondul: Know don't want the eraser.

228
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,380
amondul: that's not going to work today.

229
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,020
amondul: it's just not happening for me.

230
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:05,760
amondul: Okay.

231
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:18,870
amondul: Did it Okay, so this is the expose group right, those are taking drugs day, so the cumulative incidents in the expose is this it's the number of people who got the disease divided by the total number at risk.

232
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:28,830
amondul: So the total number of risk or all those taking drugs day and among all those taking drugs day a of them got disease so it's every policy.

233
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:35,910
amondul: Now i'm going to circle it differently that's our unexposed group okay.

234
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:46,530
amondul: And again, the total number of people at risk in the placebo group is C plus D that's the total number of people taking the placebo, and the total number who got disease for see.

235
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:58,140
amondul: So the risk ratio is the cumulative incidence among those taking drug a the exposed divided by the cumulative incidence in those who were unexposed or those who took the placebo.

236
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:00,930
amondul: Does that make sense.

237
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,870
Nolaundron Harris: Yes, thank you.

238
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:04,980
amondul: you're welcome.

239
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:19,590
amondul: All right, this is a specific example, so now we're kind of replacing drug a placebo and develop disease, yes, no specifics Okay, so we are looking at this, drugs, so all.

240
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,080
amondul: physicians can laugh at me if I said that wrong compared to compared to placebo.

241
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:36,720
amondul: And we're looking at confirmed reinfection so I assumed us as people who have all had already had a bio Cardio infarction or a heart attack and we were looking at whether taking this drug compared to not taking it.

242
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:41,880
amondul: reduces Ideally I assume we're hoping to reduce their risk of having a second heart attack.

243
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,530
amondul: Okay.

244
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:50,970
amondul: So we've got 873 people who took the drug 583 on placebo.

245
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:58,710
amondul: And so to calculate the risk ratio we calculate the number of people who had a reinfection who had our outcome.

246
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:16,050
amondul: divided by the total number of risks in the exposed groups of 29 number 873 and then we do the same for the unexposed we take 33 divided by 583 and we take the cumulative incidence in a exposed divided by the cumulative instance the unexposed which gives us this number.

247
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,510
amondul: Okay.

248
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,890
amondul: Now to interpret this.

249
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,040
amondul: Is this.

250
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:36,720
amondul: The no value is one right, because when you're dividing something if the two are the same if you divide something by itself you're going to get one right.

251
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:46,860
amondul: So a relative risk of one means that there's no difference between the groups okay if it's greater than one that means the risk of your disease is.

252
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:51,600
amondul: The relative risk times more likely to occur in group a and group B.

253
00:36:53,550 --> 00:37:14,790
amondul: If it's less than one, it means it's less likely to to occur in the exposed than in the unexposed all right, and you can express this either, you can calculate the word is a little bit confusing when it's smaller than one to say how much smaller it is you can either say um it's 100 minus.

254
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:24,990
amondul: The relative risk percent less likely or inverted Okay, so we can say with our relative risk of point 587.

255
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:37,800
amondul: If you express this as a percentage 58.7% you can do 100 minus 50 points that i'd say there's a 41.3% reduced risk and those taking a total all compared to placebo, of having a reinfection.

256
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,850
amondul: You could also take one one divided by that equals 1.7.

257
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:52,890
amondul: And then you could just say there's a 1.7 times the risk of reinfection is 1.7 times less likely.

258
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:57,180
amondul: In those taking the drug compared to those who got to see but.

259
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,290
amondul: Does that make sense, how you express this piece.

260
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:09,930
amondul: Interpreting relative is less than one is a little a little tricky at first.

261
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:14,880
Okay.

262
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:29,880
amondul: So we can say, those who are randomized this little all we're 1.7 times less likely to suffer from three infarction than those randomized placebo, or we can say there's a 41.3% reduction in risk of infection compared to placebo.

263
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:37,050
amondul: Alright, so let's talk about a real child has anybody heard of the character.

264
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,880
amondul: Was the beta carotene and Retinal efficacy trial.

265
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:46,080
amondul: going on, then publish this in 1996.

266
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:54,300
amondul: The J MCI general the national cancer institute go ominous now actually here at Michigan he used to be in Washington state.

267
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:04,020
amondul: So the goal is to examine the effect of vitamin A and beta carotene on lung cancer risk Okay, so there have been existing evidence from observational studies.

268
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:16,350
amondul: suggesting a protective effect of vitamin A beta carotene and lung cancer basically people who eat foods smokers who ate foods that were high in these vitamins were less likely to get lung cancer and observational studies.

269
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:26,100
amondul: Then people smokers who didn't eat foods high in these barriers so people were like oh cool well getting people to quit smoking is really hard.

270
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:32,790
amondul: and getting people need healthy is really hard So what if instead we gave them this till they have these vitamins in it let's see how that works.

271
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,960
amondul: It didn't work great so.

272
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,000
amondul: In this case.

273
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:52,020
amondul: There were a couple there were other trials looked at the same thing and found essentially the same finding, but basically these this trial had heavy smokers and as bestest workers, because those are populations of high risk of various kinds of lung cancer.

274
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:58,560
amondul: And each of these at risk population is a randomized people to either get beta carotene and vitamin A or placebo.

275
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:08,100
amondul: And then they can't calculate it up the number of lung cancers per person years, so what measure is this with person years in the denominator.

276
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:19,560
amondul: Yes.

277
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,140
amondul: incidence rate.

278
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:35,250
amondul: Because we have cumulative incidents, which is the number of people over the number of the number of events over the number of people at risk, and this is an incidence rate because you're using person time as the denominator exactly.

279
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:39,780
amondul: So we can now express this as an incidence rate times 1000.

280
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,800
amondul: And this is the competence know for that for that.

281
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:52,860
amondul: And I think in both the assessor's records and heavy smokers I think it's pretty clear the incidence rate of lung cancer is actually player.

282
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:59,490
amondul: In the treatment group compared to the placebo group, which is the opposite of what we had hoped would happen.

283
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:12,780
amondul: So in fact in this bestest workers, there is a 1.55 times greater rate of developing lung cancer in the intervention group compared to the placebo group and then heavy smoker in 1.14 times greater rate, and so they actually stopped the intervention early.

284
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:24,330
amondul: So if you know anybody who smokes they should not be taking any beta carotene vitamin A because that actually has been shown to cause lung cancer and smokers.

285
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,590
amondul: So whenever you're doing a trial, there are stopping rules.

286
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,410
amondul: So you always want to stop a trial, and it has become apparent that the treatment is toxic.

287
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:41,910
amondul: Like before in the carrot trial you're like whoa bad news bears stop stop.

288
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:55,470
amondul: Also, when it's become apparent that treatment is beneficial like there's no point in continuing a trial, if you know the answer right if you know the answer, and the answer is that this thing works, we should give it to people, we should stop studying it and give it to people right.

289
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:06,000
amondul: On the actual relative risks or ratios for stopping or decided upon before the trial starts, based on the power of the study, so this is part of like the protocol that you'd have to put together.

290
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:16,350
amondul: That has to be approved before you can do a trial, and let me tell you that is a big stack of paper if you're filling out a Protocol to do a trial it's it's daunting.

291
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:26,250
amondul: But one of the things that you have to decide on ahead of time or these stopping rules, and this is why you have a biostatistician on your team for exactly a trial because they will help figure all this out.

292
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:27,810
Okay.

293
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,680
amondul: All right.

294
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,090
Joshua Tucker: Dr Mandel.

295
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,860
amondul: Can I ask a question, absolutely.

296
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:57,330
Joshua Tucker: um about literally what you just said, so how, in your work that you've done and I know that you're not a trial list, but how how frequently do epidemiologists or like pharmacotherapy tried to be the bio statisticians or serve as the biostatistician for trials.

297
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,790
Joshua Tucker: I never, never okay.

298
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:00,690
amondul: You need.

299
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,620
Joshua Tucker: to know that.

300
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:09,690
amondul: They shouldn't in my experience, never in my experience, you always have a bonafide biostatistician on the team.

301
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:18,480
amondul: And that's why they have like a like at the epic cancer Center here there's a bias that's biostatistics poor and there are bio statisticians who serve.

302
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:29,400
amondul: On trials right like they won't put it you're not going to get anything through protocol review here at the cancer Center if you don't have a bona fide biostatistician on your on your team.

303
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,990
Joshua Tucker: it's really interesting and but that's not the same with like vaccines, though right.

304
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,150
amondul: I would think it is.

305
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,100
Joshua Tucker: Really okay all right i'm just wondering I.

306
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:39,720
amondul: mean I think anything.

307
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:52,350
amondul: You might get away with like a smaller trial, particularly if it's like a like a behavioral intervention or something like that, but anything where you're going to have FDA on your boss about anything.

308
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,980
amondul: I would think you have to have a real bona fide biostatistician on your team.

309
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:06,540
amondul: i've never calculated a stopping rule before in my life never once.

310
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:10,950
amondul: have not done, it would not want to go pro.

311
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,950
Joshua Tucker: This is just one reason why there's bio statisticians and not.

312
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:16,170
amondul: I mean one out of like millions.

313
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,490
Joshua Tucker: Right exactly right.

314
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:23,910
amondul: there's a lot of math that i'm not interested in doing where i'm like I want to do this thing I generally understand this, the thing that can be done.

315
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:40,350
amondul: Hello nap friends can you make this thing happen for me please write all of the letters and numbers down that make this happen, so that is the place that I would like to occupy, which is why I am an epidemiologist and not a biostatistician I will do some math not all math.

316
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:43,500
amondul: That makes sense.

317
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:45,600
Joshua Tucker: yeah Thank you.

318
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:47,160
Nolaundron Harris: For asking that question.

319
00:44:53,700 --> 00:45:08,370
amondul: Alright, so when what kind of situations favor a randomized trial, when do we do randomized trial, so when you want to learn about prevention and treatment of disease, when you need data with a very high degree of validity and when there's evidence that the intervention is promising.

320
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:19,590
amondul: So maybe use of aspirin diet exercise dietary supplements right the exposure of interest is a modifiable factor over which individuals are willing to relinquish some control.

321
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:32,460
amondul: Legitimate uncertainty exists regarding me effective interventions on the outcome but reasons exist to believe that the benefits of the intervention and question outweigh the risks.

322
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,440
amondul: Right, so all drugs must go through a set of rigorous clinical trials in order to be marketed in the US.

323
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:52,800
amondul: And the effective intervention on the outcome is of sufficient importance to justify a large study so studies determine that folic acid acid should be added to cereals and breads prevent neural tube defects I mentioned this example, a few lectures ago.

324
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:59,310
amondul: Alright, so let's think about this.

325
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:09,150
amondul: here's an example of a trial do women with Stage one breast cancer, give me a lumpectomy alone survive as long without recurrence and disease as women, given lumpectomy plus radiation.

326
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:18,210
amondul: So let's think about these three questions and kind of think about this randomized control trial and where we think this falls here so.

327
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:28,380
amondul: Do you think that women with Stage one breast cancer are willing to relinquish control, about which type of surgery they get are they willing to be randomized.

328
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:38,850
amondul: i'm seeing some faces in the room that look like I think that's probably true right like a lot of people, particularly cancer patients.

329
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:52,950
amondul: really want to like fight it right there's this kind of like I want to fight my disease, and I want to throw everything out of the can and convincing patients to to get less treatment, even if actually that's beneficial right, even if it provides the same.

330
00:46:54,030 --> 00:47:04,620
amondul: outcome in terms of their disease but fewer side effects it's actually kind of a hard sell and so it can be difficult to I think this would be more difficult to get people to relinquish control over.

331
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:15,030
amondul: His is there legitimate uncertainty about whether went back to me alone is as good as lumpectomy plus ready radiation.

332
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:32,670
amondul: I mean, I think you know, probably when yes that's probably reasonable to look into and I do think it's maybe a sufficient importance right because radiation is no joke it's not like if there were no bad side effects radiation you'd be like okay just do both right, why not.

333
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,810
amondul: But radiation is not something that you want to do if you don't have to do it.

334
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:48,240
amondul: How about that's just fluoride in the water supply decrease the frequency of dental caries in a Community compared to similar community without such water treatment.

335
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:57,270
amondul: So this is an example of a Community trial, not an individual trial right we've given a lot of examples of individual trials, but this is one of those Community trials.

336
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,840
amondul: So what do you think.

337
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:11,310
amondul: Do you think people are going to be willing to relinquish control about this.

338
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,990
Nolaundron Harris: No, because not everybody's going to agree that they need it.

339
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:23,580
amondul: that's right yeah so, and in fact this was something that there was a lot of like I mean, even today, I think there are people who are so.

340
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,160
amondul: You know, have.

341
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:40,590
amondul: misgivings about fluoride in water, even though I think there's a wealth of evidence at this point that it actually does more harm and maybe more good than harm it doesn't really do any harm, but people are worried about it right whoops that's not what I wanted to do.

342
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:46,290
amondul: So maybe that's, the problem is that legitimate uncertainty.

343
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:57,570
amondul: I mean at the time, right now, no now we know we wouldn't bother doing one of these trials again because the work has been done, and we have our answer but, at the time that people were doing these kinds of trials, yes.

344
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:12,450
amondul: And it was up sufficient importance right because dental health is a very important predictor of like other kinds of health right not it's important on its own, but it's also important for a more systemic kind of helps right so definitely.

345
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:15,870
amondul: alright.

346
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,660
amondul: Any questions about that.

347
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,880
amondul: Alright, so we've gotten through.

348
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:40,920
amondul: yeah i'm trying to stop sharing we've gotten through randomized trials we're going to also go through cohort studies let's go ahead and take a five minute break kind of get up and stretch your legs will come back at 227 and then we'll do cohort studies okay.

349
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:43,290
Nolaundron Harris: Thank you.

350
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:56,040
amondul: Alright guys.

351
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,930
amondul: You did our stretches in here we're ready for cohort studies.

352
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:17,850
amondul: Alright, so let's go over the study design of cohort studies.

353
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:31,980
amondul: And again we're called our goal with our objective or goal but epidemiologic studies is to look at some factor and determine if it is causally related to a health act on it, that is causing better health outcomes right.

354
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:40,620
amondul: And so you know you have people who are exposed to a factor and people not exposed and then again you're going to be.

355
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:52,620
amondul: Looking at the outcome in the expose and in the unexposed so far this looks a lot, like the randomized trial that we just talked about right really The difference is.

356
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,990
amondul: Who allocates exposure right.

357
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:07,650
amondul: You have participants choosing their own exposure here right, this is an observational study, whereas randomized control trials you're allocating the exposure as the investigator.

358
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:20,850
amondul: So you have some participants who are at risk of developing the outcome you're going to follow them over time so you're going to assess when you recruit them whether they're exposed or not exposed and you're going to follow them over time to see who develops outcome.

359
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:22,170
amondul: Okay.

360
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:32,790
amondul: There are some synonyms for this, just like there were for randomized control trials, some people call this a prospective study longitudinal study a follow up study or a panel study.

361
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,200
amondul: hey all of this should mean cohort study to you when you see it.

362
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:50,430
amondul: So, as I said, the key distinction between the randomized control trial and the cohort is the reason for exposure, how did people come to the exposed if they chose it for themselves, it is a cohort study.

363
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:57,270
amondul: If the investigator allocated them randomly to being exposed are not exposed, that is a randomized control trial.

364
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,950
amondul: Otherwise it's the same thing in terms of following them.

365
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:07,620
amondul: So, why would you not always assign exposure right well.

366
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:19,590
amondul: You can't assign people to something that you think might be detrimental right, so if you're studying something that you think might cause harm, you cannot do a randomized control trial of it, because you can't randomized people to do something you think.

367
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:32,700
amondul: So anytime you're studying an exposure you think might be detrimental or my cause an outcome, you would have to do an observational study right a cohort studies.

368
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:49,770
amondul: It can also be something that you can't change right there are non modifiable factors like race right you can't assign somebody to be a race, so that you have to study observational It might also be something like environment right that's kind of.

369
00:52:51,180 --> 00:53:00,360
amondul: You can't really assign people to be in an environment, you can like move them to a place and have to live there right, so there are some things that are sort of not really assignable in that way.

370
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:11,370
amondul: So the advantages of a Co worker design is that it maintains the temporal sequence, you are recruiting people who do not have your disease.

371
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:20,100
amondul: You are looking at their exposure and then waiting for them to develop disease, so you know that your exposure came before your disease.

372
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:30,060
amondul: You can estimate the risk, the incidence of disease, the risk or the rate at the cumulative incidents where the incidence rate.

373
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,180
amondul: You know exposure proceeds development of disease and you can also explore time varying information.

374
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:50,580
amondul: it's excellent for studying known adverse exposures are those that cannot practically be randomized and like randomized control trial, it is excellent for studying rare exposures and we'll talk about that point in a few slides so kind of put a pin in that one.

375
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:53,340
amondul: Okay.

376
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:07,830
amondul: And the additional advantage of a cohort design is it multiple outcomes and multiple exposures can be studied, I know of no large cohort study that only looks at one exposure and only looks at one outcome.

377
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:21,120
amondul: Okay, it may have been designed originally with something particular in mind, but it has always been expanded upon if you're going to spend the money and the time to do a covert study.

378
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:27,540
amondul: you're going to think a little bit bigger than your your particular research question right, so the nurses health study.

379
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:31,200
amondul: Is a Harvard study that recruited.

380
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:39,960
amondul: People hundred and 26,000 verses at this point, you have two ways of that so I kind of forget how many are in each one nurses nurses to.

381
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:56,760
amondul: But over 100,000 and they've recruited these women they asked them a very extensive questionnaire on all kinds of things right that might be of interest, so all kinds of potential exposures and covariance right diet exercise medications health conditions.

382
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:09,420
amondul: Reproductive history, you name it right it's probably on there and then they follow them over time and the original in you know, the thing that they said they were interested in was cancer, but they follow these women for.

383
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:24,000
amondul: neurologic outcomes dementia, heart disease, I mean everything you can think of right so same with all of these other studies that may have been started with something particular in mind, but you know you're going to do a very extensive questionnaire.

384
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:36,630
amondul: Because you're going to want covariance information to adjust for potential confounders which we're going to talk about in a few lectures, but those can also be evaluated as exposures of interest and you're going to get all kinds of outcomes.

385
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:38,790
amondul: Does that make sense.

386
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:49,590
amondul: These are incredibly expensive we just got our big grant to do my cares the Michigan cancer research and the environment study we're trying to recruit 100,000 michiganders over the next six years.

387
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:57,630
amondul: between the ages of 25 and 44 and we wrote the grant to look at environmental exposures and risk of cancer.

388
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:04,830
amondul: Because that's what the rfa was, for it was asking for cohorts to study environmental risk factors for cancer.

389
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:09,240
amondul: So we have a lot of that in the questionnaire we're also asking about.

390
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:20,370
amondul: A million other things it's a it's a pretty long questionnaire that we're asking and we're going to get cancer outcomes, but we're also going to get access to some of these people's medical records so we'll be able to get all kinds of outcome information from them right.

391
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:35,490
amondul: If you have recruiting, and this is a multi millions of dollars to set this up right, so if you're going to spend all this time and money and effort you're not going to set it up to be narrow right you're just not doesn't make any sense.

392
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:41,550
amondul: Alright disadvantages long term follow up is required, and it is expensive.

393
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:57,150
amondul: Right, these are not small undertakings it's why we are so excited that we got this grant because it is rare to get the money to do one of these because it's it's just it's a lot right they don't just hand out the money to do these every day.

394
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:09,150
amondul: And it's not effective capturing rare outcomes and can be challenging to study diseases to take a long time to develop right, which is why we're cancer is actually a we're outcome.

395
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:21,270
amondul: So we are that's why we're recruiting 100,000 people is because you need to recruit that money to get enough cancers in the end to study right in your group of 100,000 how many cancers, do you expect.

396
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:26,850
amondul: it's not a super common outcome, so in order to have enough to look at them, you need a big group of people.

397
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:34,320
amondul: And cancer takes a long time to develop so we're going to have to follow these people for multiple decades right, so this is.

398
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:44,820
amondul: it's not actually the best design for super rare things cancer isn't super rare, so you can actually get a big study to study it, but if it's a really rare outcome you're not going to be able to study in the cohort.

399
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,660
amondul: Last a follow up can be a problem.

400
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:56,700
amondul: So if you cannot keep track of all of these people for the amount of time it's going to take for you to follow them to get disease outcomes on them.

401
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:08,220
amondul: you're going to have a problem you have to have very good follow up you can't just lose people and not know if they got your disease or not, because that can cause selection bias, which we'll talk about in a few lectures.

402
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:19,620
amondul: So it's easy to lose people when you have a lot of people that you're trying to follow for a long time right it's a huge undertaking to try to keep track of all these people when i've worked for large cohorts before.

403
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:31,980
amondul: They have you know multiple people whose entire job it is to follow these people up and if they don't return their question or you call them and if they don't answer the phone you call them again.

404
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:37,590
amondul: Do you know what I mean like you have to hound these once they're in your study you need to know what happens to them.

405
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,590
amondul: In order to have internal validity.

406
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:50,550
amondul: of changes in time changes over time and criteria and methods can be problems with inferences so you know if, like the diagnostic criteria for something changed over time.

407
00:58:51,570 --> 00:59:04,650
amondul: Or if you know, the way that you recruit people or the way you follow people changes over time, this can cause problems and people are self selecting their exposures, so the exposed and unexposed may differ with respect to lots of other important characteristics.

408
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:16,020
amondul: As we said I can positive bias called confounding and we're going to talk about that in a few lectures and there are ways to deal with that in your analysis and design phases, but it's something to definitely be aware of.

409
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:30,360
amondul: But there's no real real way around that if you want to study, something that you think is detrimental right you can't assign people to a detrimental exposure so you're dealing with that problem, no matter what, if you're studying something that you think is detrimental.

410
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:46,860
amondul: So what does it cover it's getting warranted so when there's evidence of an association between the exposure and the disease from other studies you're probably not going to jump right into.

411
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:57,690
amondul: Spending multi millions of dollars on a cohort study as your first step right you're going to use one of the easier, cheaper, more efficient study designs that we're going to talk about next time.

412
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:02,850
amondul: When the exposure is rare, but incidence of disease among the exposed as high.

413
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:11,610
amondul: When time between exposure and development of diseases relatively short or historical data is available or you're willing to wait decades right.

414
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:15,270
amondul: And when good follow up can be insured.

415
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:22,620
amondul: So these were our objectives and key terms i'm not going to read them to you, but that's for studying.

416
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:27,090
amondul: So let's talk about some study design issues so.

417
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:37,950
amondul: Since key design elements here, the population of exposed and unexposed individuals at risk of developing the outcome, are going to be followed over time to prepare the development of disease in each group right.

418
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:45,540
amondul: As we said he was selling establish the study population, based on a sample of your base population your source population.

419
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:55,950
amondul: And you're trying again to identify a semi public population that is reflective of your base population of interest, and that has a reasonable distribution of exposure.

420
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:02,070
amondul: This part is important, this distribution of exposure is important.

421
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,200
amondul: So.

422
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:13,500
amondul: One of the things like we run into with vitamin research, for example, is that some like selenium is a good example.

423
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:34,290
amondul: In this country, not that many people are really deficient, so if being deficient is a risk factor for a disease, the range, you know if your range of exposure could be from here to here that's the full range, but in the US population, this is all you see.

424
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:45,630
amondul: You may not find an association between low and high in your study population, because we really don't have a range of full distribution of exposure in your study population.

425
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:47,550
amondul: Does that make sense.

426
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,550
amondul: that's one example.

427
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:01,350
amondul: here's an example, the Multi ethnic study of atherosclerosis or the Mesa study.

428
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,240
amondul: So this study recruited multi ethnic Americans 45 to 84 years old.

429
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:17,880
amondul: In this timeframe, without cardiovascular disease, they were followed for over 10 years and the initial purpose was to identify risk factors for incident party vascular disease, but now numerous endpoints and exposures have been considered.

430
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,230
amondul: Okay, so these are all the different study sites where they recruited people.

431
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:26,310
amondul: So.

432
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:32,730
amondul: You have to identify your group of exposed unexploded unexposed individuals in your study.

433
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:50,520
amondul: You can either get your study population like we said kind of just from getting Americans right, so your base population here is the US and you're trying to get kind of a multi ethnic population from your base population.

434
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:57,240
amondul: And then, once you've got your population you're going to assess risk factors exposures.

435
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:11,670
amondul: You can also establish your study population by targeting exposed and unexposed people, and this is what you would do if you wanted to study a rare exposure, this is why we say that this is a good study designed for rare exposures.

436
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:16,860
amondul: Because you can identify people who are exposed and people who are not exposed.

437
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:28,080
amondul: And then just follow them over time right rather than getting a random sample of some basic population, you can actually go out and collect as many exposed people, as you can find and somebody expose people to prepare them to.

438
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:40,800
amondul: I, I have to tell you, I have not seen this done very frequently this targeting have exposed groups and i'm exposed groups as a way of of establishing your cohort population.

439
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:45,510
amondul: It is most commonly done in occupational settings.

440
01:03:46,620 --> 01:04:04,470
amondul: Okay, so an example of this is the US railway workers study they had almost 55,000 railway workers identified in 1959 they created a comparison of workers with exposures to diesel exhaust and those without in the collected information on the incident lung cancer through 1996.

441
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,320
amondul: Okay, so.

442
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:13,680
amondul: The reason they did it this way, I presume, is because if you just took all of these railway workers.

443
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:28,140
amondul: If you just took all all railway workers in the world, probably only a small number of them are exposed to diesel exhaust because a lot of them are working in offices and that kind of thing right ticket takers and things like that so.

444
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:35,610
amondul: If you just took a random sample of all railway workers, you probably would not end up with very many who are in your exposed group.

445
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:42,690
amondul: So they went out and got exposed and then a group of unexposed to compare them to so that they had sort of equal numbers.

446
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:59,220
amondul: Okay, again, this is not the most common way to do a cohort study, most of the cohort studies, I am aware of do not do it this way, they do it kind of the other way where they just get a sample of people and then assess multiple different exposures in that sample.

447
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:02,760
amondul: OK.

448
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:14,400
amondul: So again, you want to try to you're assuming that any differences in your study population when you, you find out who is exposed exposed and then assess the outcomes of those groups.

449
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:23,580
amondul: you're when you do your analysis you're assuming that any any differences, you see, between the incidence of outcome in the two groups is due to your exposure.

450
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:31,020
amondul: So it's critical that your exposure unexposed unexposed groups be as similar as possible with Chris.

451
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:36,060
amondul: i'm going to try again i'm so sorry i'm just gave up on that sentence.

452
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:44,880
amondul: It is critical that you're exposed and unexposed groups should be as similar as possible with respect to all other factors related to the disease.

453
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:55,920
amondul: And it has to be similar at the beginning and the end so if they have different risks of the outcome at baseline for reasons other than exposure it can result in by associations.

454
01:05:57,060 --> 01:06:09,570
amondul: And because your outcome is ascertained over time problems can occur, even if the population is similar at baseline because you have differential loss to follow up meeting you're losing people differently in your exposed and unexposed groups.

455
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:25,230
amondul: So what this means is you really can't ensure that you're exposed on unexposed unexposed groups are the same.

456
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:32,700
amondul: With respect to all of the factors because you're not randomizing and we're going to talk about ways to deal with this issue and future lectures.

457
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:39,480
amondul: There are ways to do analyses that account for differences and ways to make sure in your design phase that you're doing the best job you can.

458
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,510
amondul: Okay, this.

459
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:53,550
amondul: This issue, the way to deal with that issue is to make sure that you have very good follow up most of the cohorts that we have mentioned so far have over 90 95% complete follow up.

460
01:06:54,810 --> 01:07:02,280
amondul: Meaning that they only kind of just lost people just disappeared, they don't know what happened to them like less than 5% of their cohort at the beginning.

461
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:09,540
amondul: And it takes a lot of money and a lot of effort to make sure that happens, and you have people that you hire whose entire job is doing that.

462
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:27,660
amondul: But they are one of the most critical pieces of the of the machine, because you can recruit 100,000 people, you can do the best job in the world of assessing their exposures, you can come up with the best questionnaire and if you don't follow them.

463
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,410
amondul: If you lose them all doesn't matter.

464
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:37,890
amondul: Right it's trash so you have to be able to have complete follow up as much as possible.

465
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,760
amondul: Okay So how do we characterize your population, how we know what their exposure it so if we're not assigning it.

466
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:54,690
amondul: You can get physician hospital health plan record records a big one is questionnaires and you might do medical exams or laboratory tests on samples right.

467
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:56,550
amondul: So.

468
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,830
amondul: Really importantly.

469
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:05,550
amondul: You can I mean you can use similar kinds of sources for outcome data right you're going to get depth data from vital statistics.

470
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:10,950
amondul: you're gonna get the Presidents presidents of disease from registries medical records questionnaires and examinations.

471
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:24,960
amondul: You might get some political measures of disease from examinations and medical records right so there's a lot of linking of various sources of data so exposures you're going to get from questionnaires medical records lab reports, environmental and physiological measures right.

472
01:08:28,590 --> 01:08:29,190
amondul: So.

473
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:32,670
amondul: There are kind of two types of.

474
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:40,560
amondul: cohorts there's the concurrent or prospective cohort which is kind of what we've been talking about.

475
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:49,290
amondul: and which one you're doing really depends on where the investigator is standing in time, relative to the outcome of having happened okay.

476
01:08:49,830 --> 01:09:00,060
amondul: So a prospective or concurrence cohort design, is where the investigator begins the study you recruit the people you assess exposure and you wait to see who gets the outcome.

477
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:10,350
amondul: there's also a retrospective or non concurrent design, which is where you're using historical data now, this is still like cohort study.

478
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:24,360
amondul: Because the exposure information was collected before the outcome happened, but you might be using records to assess that exposure information, the outcome you're standing here in time.

479
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:30,930
amondul: The outcome has already happened and you might be going back to some stored records to figure out their exposure.

480
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:33,180
amondul: Okay.

481
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:38,190
amondul: An example of this, I did a study, where we looked at.

482
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:46,110
amondul: We had prostate cancer patients, so they were all patients who would have their prostate surgery done by one surgeon to Johns Hopkins.

483
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:55,020
amondul: And I was standing here in 2006 2007 at the time Okay, this is me.

484
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,840
amondul: I had pigtails then see.

485
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:11,880
amondul: Very square glasses and, for some reason I wore a lab coat it was a weird time so 2006 i'm standing here, these patients have already either died or not died of their prostate cancer.

486
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:27,000
amondul: Okay, because they have been you know we started follow up and like these are people who have their surgery anywhere from like 1992 onward right so they've already had their surgery, and sometimes this past and they've either died or they're still alive.

487
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:39,270
amondul: We went back to their medical records to the very first visit where they came in and the surgeon wrote down all the medications they were taking to see if they were taking the Staten or no Staten.

488
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:42,120
amondul: At the time of their surgery.

489
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,810
amondul: And then I was able to do the analysis in 2007.

490
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:58,290
amondul: Because we went back in time, but is a cohort study, because the exposure information was collected before the outcome ever happens to temporal relationship between the exposure and the outcome is preserved.

491
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:05,370
amondul: Because the exposure was written down and then time passed and the outcome happens right they were not assessed at the same time.

492
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:17,850
amondul: I am standing in the future, going back to records and using records that were collected in a temporal manner right so that's still a cohort it's just a retrospective cohort does that make sense to people.

493
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:34,740
amondul: Okay, so this is that really work or study again, which is very hard to say I want you all to try to say railway workers out loud and not sound like they've ever.

494
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:36,960
amondul: hard.

495
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:39,090
amondul: I would like a star.

496
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:47,400
amondul: The US railroad retirement board also difficult to say has maintained a computerized record of work history since 1959.

497
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:57,990
amondul: In 1981 men 40 to 64 years of age with 10 to 20 years of real world road railroad service in 1959 were selected for data extraction.

498
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:09,240
amondul: Based on job in 1959 they identify job codes with exposure to diesel exhaust characterized during industrial hygiene survey of a sample workers in these job codes okay in such in this way.

499
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:25,110
amondul: So they're standing here in 1981 and they're going back and using records from 1959 to determine if someone's been exposed or unexposed job, based on their job code does that make sense.

500
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:29,490
amondul: So this is a retrospective cohort.

501
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:37,770
Okay.

502
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:49,140
amondul: So retrospective has lots of benefits more cost effective and it's good for diseases with long latency because you don't have to wait a long time for them to happen they've already happened.

503
01:12:50,700 --> 01:13:00,720
amondul: But protect perspective has benefits the data quality is presumably higher in that status study that I told you about we only knew if they were taking it or not, taking it at the time of their surgery.

504
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:07,170
amondul: Right so let's say a man having surgery in 1994 I am standing here with my pigtails and.

505
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,130
amondul: My dubious hair choices and.

506
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:18,420
amondul: I know if he was taking a stab in here, but I have no idea what happened all along here.

507
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:22,620
amondul: What if he wasn't taking a step but started.

508
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:28,080
amondul: Right i'm missing that information if I had started a cohort in 1984.

509
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:39,810
amondul: I could have asked these people like every two years, I could have made up a question, or maybe i've asked them about their status news right so presumably I could have gotten better quality, I could have asked them like How long have you been taking that drug.

510
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:50,640
amondul: exactly which one, are you taking what doses it right, I could have gotten all of that information that I was interested in, if I had asked the questions myself in 1984.

511
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:58,620
amondul: But instead i'm left with the poor handwriting of whatever surgeon wrote down, they were taking a stab in the medical record.

512
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:11,100
amondul: Okay, both designed to need to be cautious of ascertain devices if the outcomes that we're exposures know so like if I knew.

513
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:17,190
amondul: When I went back and looked at the exposure the Staten information I didn't know if the men I didn't already know.

514
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:21,660
amondul: Or, I could have known, but I did not look whether the men have had a recurrence or not.

515
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:28,170
amondul: So they were all just jumbled up and I went back and figured out the exposure information without knowledge of their upcoming formation right.

516
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:37,230
amondul: I suppose, if I had been like okay today i'm going to do all people who had a recurrence i'm going to be really, really careful to make sure that I get all of their status, and then the people who didn't.

517
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:52,380
amondul: Who weren't my non outcomes, maybe I wasn't as careful or something right so that's the kind of ascertaining and bias that you might have if the person who is going back and assessing the exposure knows the APP right.

518
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:57,960
amondul: harder to imagine how you could have that if you're doing the prospect of design, where, at the beginning.

519
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:09,900
amondul: Well, I guess it's the other way around, in that case right if you know who's exposed on unexposed if you're the person who's determining their outcome that's the potential issue there for ascertainment bias does that make sense.

520
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:14,940
amondul: Okay.

521
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,130
amondul: So.

522
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:23,250
amondul: You have to consider the source of data to define its quality, the ideal data is objective quantifiable and accurate.

523
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:36,780
amondul: This can be a critical issue if your data quality is poor, or if it's a different quality among makes those unexposed or the disease non diseased right you really want to make sure that you're doing everything the same in your groups.

524
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:50,430
amondul: Alright, so the measure of itself association really are kind of the same for the randomized control trial and for the.

525
01:15:51,540 --> 01:16:04,080
amondul: cohort study you got your relative risk you're a ratio your risk difference or your rate difference we don't have efficacy right in a corporate study that's the difference, the efficacy is kind of a specific controlled trial measure.

526
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:15,120
amondul: And you'll do it kind of the same way, so this is your risk ratio your table looks the same right the table looks the same for the cohort and the mo clinical trial.

527
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:22,380
amondul: Because you've got exposure to the next, those people it's just that in the cohort they chose their exposure and in the.

528
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:33,300
amondul: Control trial they you chose it for them, but that doesn't really show up in this table right so in terms of the math of calculating these these measures of associations basically the same right.

529
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:47,370
amondul: You calculate the cumulative to see is exposed divided by the cumulative excuse me, the cumulative incidence in the expose divided by the cumulative incidents and the unexposed for the risk ratio, so if we give actual numbers to this.

530
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:53,640
amondul: This is looking at hypertension cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality and the nurses health study.

531
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:57,720
amondul: So the total is almost 120,000 people.

532
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:07,890
amondul: who have is right, I was pretty close to the numbers, and so this is whether or not they had a non fatal heart attack and the exposure is hypertension, yes or no okay.

533
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:17,010
amondul: So to calculate the cumulative incidents in the exposed right So these are the exposed the women with hypertension.

534
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:35,490
amondul: So it's the number of people who had the the outcome divided by the total at risk, so that's 117 over 13,422 which gives you this little bitty fraction, then you can do the same thing and your unexposed 125 over 106,541.

535
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:45,030
amondul: But this little bitty fraction and if you divide this by this you get a risk ratio of 7.43 whoo looks like hypertension is bad.

536
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:49,110
amondul: This was published in 1989.

537
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,370
amondul: This may have been new information at that time.

538
01:17:56,790 --> 01:18:06,420
amondul: So the risk of experiencing a non fatal him I was 7.43 times greater in women with hypertension is compared to those without hypertension over eight years of follow up and the nurses health study.

539
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:21,390
amondul: Okay, we can also do the rest difference it's the same cumulative incidence remember these two those little fractions we got by taking 117 over 13,422 which is this one.

540
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:38,820
amondul: And 125 or 106,549 541 sorry, which is this one, and that gives us if you subtract those now it's 7.54 per 1000 right because we're not dividing, and so this has units.

541
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:40,920
Okay.

542
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:54,630
amondul: So the risk of experiencing a non fatal them, I was 7.54 per 1000 greater in women without with hypertension, compared to those without hypertension over eight years of follow up with them the nurses health study.

543
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:15,120
amondul: Okay, you could also do incidence rate ratios right in this case you've got those exposed and not exposed and you'd have the people who have the disease and then rather than the people without the disease you're given the person time at risk among the exposed and the unexposed.

544
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:16,800
amondul: OK.

545
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:24,390
amondul: So the incidence rate would be a over person time exposed.

546
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:31,770
amondul: And the incidence rate and the unexposed to be see over the person time unexposed.

547
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:33,720
amondul: Right.

548
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:44,910
amondul: So here's an example with actual numbers we've got three categories here of exposure.

549
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:54,870
amondul: 1.1 14 cigarettes per day 15 to 24 and more than 25, this is the number of lung cancers in each group and the person years at risk in each group.

550
01:19:56,130 --> 01:20:02,370
amondul: So, to get the incidence rate here we've taken 22 divided by 25,100 for this small fraction.

551
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,840
amondul: And the same here and here okay.

552
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:15,300
amondul: 22 divided by 25,700 equals point 000876 okay.

553
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:20,850
amondul: If this is our comparison group, you can get the incidence rate.

554
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:24,720
amondul: If you want to call this middle category exposed.

555
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:26,940
amondul: You could take.

556
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:39,150
amondul: went 001388 divided by point 000876 which would give you 1.58.

557
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:40,710
amondul: Okay.

558
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:47,040
amondul: You could also do the top category compared to the bottom.

559
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:57,990
amondul: You do point 002271 divided by point 000876 and that would give you 2.59.

560
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:02,010
amondul: That makes sense.

561
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:19,710
amondul: So the interpretation here is that in the British physicians day the rate of lung cancer was 2.59 and 1.58 times higher among heavy and moderate smokers than light smokers respectively.

562
01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:39,480
amondul: You can also do the rate difference here right So these are those same numbers 22 divided by 25,100 person years gives us an incidence rate of point 000876.

563
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:48,450
amondul: So the rate difference here is zero because you're taking this minus, this is the reference category right, so this minus itself gives you zero.

564
01:21:51,960 --> 01:22:04,590
amondul: To get this right difference right, you would take point 001388 minus point 000876 equals point 0005.

565
01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:09,180
amondul: that's the rate difference for moderate compared to light smoking.

566
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:15,270
amondul: And you do this minus this to get that number.

567
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:21,450
amondul: So.

568
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:30,060
amondul: In this they're showing it per 1000 right so they've just divided this side 1000 divided by 1000.

569
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:43,590
amondul: From the next page among the population heavy smoker said at 1.4 per 1000 higher rate of lung cancer, the light smokers moderate smokers similarly had a point five per 1000 higher rate of lung cancer than lightsabers.

570
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:49,260
amondul: That is the end of our slides.

571
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:53,850
amondul: Okay.

572
01:22:59,190 --> 01:23:00,600
amondul: that's okay out there.

573
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:03,600
amondul: Right.

574
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:12,600
amondul: So it is three let's go ahead and take a 10 minute break and we'll come back at 310 we have new groups this week that our teams have created for us.

575
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:27,360
amondul: Those are on today's page, just like they were before in a table form and you're going to be added to those groups in breakout rooms, when we get back okay 10 minute break and then we'll get into our groups.

576
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:40,350
amondul: I enjoyed the confidence interval calculation, I can tell by his giggle.

577
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:51,240
amondul: alrighty guys let's go over these answers, so there wasn't as much math today there's one like big nasty math but I but Oh, thank you.

578
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:56,250
amondul: And I restart the recording yeah Thank you okay.

579
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:10,560
amondul: So there was one big math but I will tell you right off the BAT you are not going to be asked, on an exam to calculate a confidence interval you might be asked to interpret ones that you will not be asked to calculate so.

580
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:21,330
amondul: Okay, so let's talk first about randomized trial section one So this was published on the apple study from 1987 about the dash diet.

581
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:30,540
amondul: And you had a bunch you basically have the the abstract, of the article here, and you had a couple of tables and figures okay.

582
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:31,860
amondul: To do.

583
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:40,680
amondul: So the first question was what was the purpose of the trial, so now we have new groups we're just going to go from the top so group one What did you guys say what's The purpose of this trial.

584
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:47,820
Geehan Suleyman: The trial was to study the dietary patterns on blood pressure.

585
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:58,110
amondul: So to me the impacts of three dietary patterns right control high fruit and vegetables and combination that's right.

586
01:24:59,070 --> 01:25:08,220
amondul: So losing weight causes blood pressure to drop, so why do you think investigators made an effort to keep the caloric intake the same across the three diets in this trial group to.

587
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:17,670
Joshua Tucker: We probably are the authors would want the caloric intake to be similar across the different interventions, so that.

588
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:23,370
Joshua Tucker: The like potential outcomes from changes in weight.

589
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:25,500
Joshua Tucker: would be similar.

590
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:27,990
Joshua Tucker: or control, for I should say.

591
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:29,670
amondul: Yes, right so.

592
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:44,670
amondul: they're trying to isolate the effect of the dietary composition on blood blood pressure right, not whether the diet makes you lose weight, so I guess you could eat you know, three twinkies the day if you were only worried about losing weight and.

593
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:51,960
amondul: If that were the impact on blood pressure, that would be one thing, but they're interested in whether it's the dietary composition right.

594
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:58,950
amondul: Okay group three what was the purpose of randomization in the study, what did they do it.

595
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:05,520
Will Brodwater: So randomization is to try to control on the variables President in your population.

596
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:18,690
Will Brodwater: So i'm kind of in a random way into the different arms, you can somewhat controlled for those potential differences and also can help to find the researchers to keep up from introducing their own biases into the study.

597
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:20,850
amondul: So.

598
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:34,110
amondul: And not just to to ensure that the people are similar but the the two groups, the exposed and the unexposed have similar values of other characteristics right there as similar as possible on all the other things.

599
01:26:35,130 --> 01:26:35,640
amondul: that's right.

600
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:37,500
amondul: Okay.

601
01:26:39,450 --> 01:26:43,530
amondul: How would you evaluate whether randomization worked or not group for.

602
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:53,790
Jordan Ferguson: So we said, you could look at table two and look at the characteristics of each group and make sure that those characteristics are all the same, for each one.

603
01:26:53,850 --> 01:26:57,120
amondul: Right and i'm going to give you a number five as well, what did you guys decide did it work.

604
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:04,500
Jordan Ferguson: So we said, overall, yes, really the only one that stood out to us was the blood pressure medications in the past.

605
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:13,500
Jordan Ferguson: One group I think was slightly higher and they didn't give a confidence interval interval for that, but, overall, the groups were appeared to be a random.

606
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,860
amondul: ever received yeah there's 25.3.

607
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:21,570
amondul: I guess.

608
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:23,580
Jordan Ferguson: yeah yeah.

609
01:27:23,610 --> 01:27:33,060
amondul: yeah it's it's not clear and I guess just you know, because all of the other ones are pretty well balanced, I probably wouldn't read too much into that but yeah you're right that one is maybe not exactly.

610
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:35,550
amondul: What you'd like yeah.

611
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:36,270
Jordan Ferguson: But otherwise look.

612
01:27:36,810 --> 01:27:42,240
amondul: Good and again you're going to get because the numbers are relatively small.

613
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:51,420
amondul: And that's something that I wouldn't expect you guys necessarily to recognize because it's it's hard to be calibrated to what is small versus what is dead, if you haven't looked at a lot of studies.

614
01:27:51,720 --> 01:28:04,170
amondul: But this is fairly small right, and so I would expect more kind of just wiggling around between the groups, as opposed to like if you have thousands of people per arm, you should not see that would definitely be meaningful right.

615
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:07,350
amondul: Okay.

616
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:10,950
amondul: boo boo boo your worry.

617
01:28:12,270 --> 01:28:12,570
amondul: Okay.

618
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:24,120
amondul: The author's note that staff members who took blood pressure measurements were blinded to each participant's group assignment so whether they had which diet, they were out, essentially, so why do they, why do you think the blind at the staff members group five.

619
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:36,900
amondul: Lisa Glenn stock numbers from the reduce the frequency of assumptions assumptions the staffs going out about this, and therefore the results that they know which depends on which diet.

620
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:50,850
amondul: Because the status to evaluate that's kind of subjective maybe that, how do you measure we must reduce that bias so it's one of those things where you think it wouldn't be subjective, but when they're using the actual.

621
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:53,880
amondul: The Sigma monitor.

622
01:28:54,960 --> 01:29:02,550
amondul: It sounds like a fake word it's a real word i'm not saying it again when they're using the blood pressure cuff thing and.

623
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:11,820
amondul: they're actually like looking at like a dial right and so there's some amount of potential subjectivity.

624
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:23,010
amondul: Like a there's some like even digit preference or round digit preference so sometimes the round up or down to a five or a to kind of thing that they've actually demonstrated this and some studies.

625
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:35,220
amondul: So if you keep them blinded to which group there and then that won't be different, you know, whatever subjectivity there is will not differ by exposure group right and we'll find out in a few lectures by that's important.

626
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:37,620
amondul: All right.

627
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:49,320
amondul: The authors state that analyses were performed assuming that participants followed their originally assigned diet, what would the implications be if they didn't follow their site diet.

628
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:53,010
amondul: group one back to you.

629
01:29:54,570 --> 01:30:09,090
Geehan Suleyman: um We said that if they did not follow the assigned diet that could impact the weight on the blood pressure um and that would impact the internal validity um and you wouldn't you might not be able to detect the difference between the groups.

630
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:11,070
amondul: that's exactly right.

631
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:18,090
amondul: So the average blood pressure, those originally assigned combinations that I was compared to those originally side, the fruit, vegetable control diet.

632
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:26,520
amondul: diets regardless of their compliance, so if they didn't follow the diet, it would result in making the dietary groups less distinct and could result in the incorrect difference so you're exactly right.

633
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:40,230
amondul: um so group shoe I think we're back to you why did you why do you think the others classified compare participants, based on their sign diets as opposed to surveying about them about their actual diets and, what is this analytic approach calls.

634
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:46,440
amondul: Please interrupt you.

635
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:49,830
Joshua Tucker: Sorry go on mute.

636
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:56,850
Joshua Tucker: So by querying participants, based on their site treatments, rather than treatment they may.

637
01:30:57,930 --> 01:31:09,990
Joshua Tucker: or may not have followed the authors and analysts maintain the original randomization of the experiment in the approach which analyzes the data provided by subjects, according to the randomized group is the intention or intend to treat technique.

638
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:15,480
amondul: intention to treat or intensity that's exactly right so it's called intensive treat that was actually in the reading I believe.

639
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:28,320
amondul: And so, if you if you kind of break your randomization and start asking them what they actually did then you're allowing them to choose right now you're back to essentially a cohort because you're not really.

640
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:40,080
amondul: it's not what they're randomized to you're breaking up that randomization and you're going with what they chose to do and now you're introducing all of those potential factors that could be associated with what they chose to do, does that make sense.

641
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:46,380
amondul: So you're going to preserve the comparative the compatibility of those in the original study groups.

642
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:57,030
amondul: me that's what I was just saying that the characteristics of each group are similar right that effect of the randomization to give information about effectiveness under real life conditions right, so this is actually.

643
01:31:58,980 --> 01:31:59,370
amondul: You know.

644
01:32:00,450 --> 01:32:08,040
amondul: Reality patients are going to standardize recommended by their physicians so you're actually kind of evaluating the reality of.

645
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:22,110
amondul: telling people to do this diet right, if you think of the randomization as i'm randomizing somebody to be told to follow this diet, then actually, even if they don't quite do it it's the it's the correct randomization does that make sense.

646
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:28,680
amondul: And then to preserve a sample size, by not excluding those who fail to comply right and that's called intensity.

647
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:36,960
amondul: He best remember what it's called when you do it the other way, because people will do it the other way.

648
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:38,700
amondul: taken.

649
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:43,230
amondul: Oh yeah I think the other way, if you actually did it the other way as treated.

650
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:46,410
amondul: again.

651
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:48,150
amondul: Okay.

652
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:59,820
amondul: So thank you guys so it's like my mind was just blank i'm like the only thing that my mind is intend to treat that's, all I can think of, I can't remember what they call the other one as treated as the other okay.

653
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:01,980
amondul: Any questions about that.

654
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:05,070
amondul: That was trials.

655
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,730
amondul: Moving on cohorts.

656
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:16,890
amondul: Alright, so we're thinking about designing a cohort study from feasibility and issues that may lead to incorrect results or bias differences so.

657
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:26,880
amondul: This you want to study of exercises decreases the number that you want to study if exercise decreases the risk of having a part of that cardiovascular event.

658
01:33:27,870 --> 01:33:36,720
amondul: One of your friend has access to data from 5000 us adults, aged 65 to 85 who were surveyed once in 2010 about their current exercise patterns and past cardiovascular events.

659
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:41,670
amondul: You look at this data and find that people with cardiovascular disease reported higher levels of exercise those without.

660
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:52,980
amondul: This is coming to your expectation, because you know other studies have shown exercise should lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, so what's a plausible explanation for this unexpected finding group three I think we're on.

661
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:58,410
Will Brodwater: Now, so this is basically just the Cross section to look at a single point in time.

662
01:33:58,830 --> 01:34:06,210
Will Brodwater: And since they're asking people at this point in time about previous cardiovascular events it's likely that people who have kind of had a.

663
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:18,120
Will Brodwater: Like a threat to their health may have changed their exercise patterns and now exercise more to try to prevent more events from occurring in the future.

664
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:22,680
amondul: that's exactly right yeah so you have a chicken and egg problem right like you can't.

665
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:35,340
amondul: Just because people can have cardiovascular disease or now exercising more that could have been caused by their cardiovascular disease right what you need is a clear to portal relationship, if you want to look at the effect of exercise on.

666
01:34:36,510 --> 01:34:38,820
amondul: To the rest that makes sense to everybody.

667
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:44,580
amondul: So you recruit the current studi bottom but.

668
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:51,210
amondul: I don't know what's happening to me today i'm so sorry I am i'm failing I am having some sort of like.

669
01:34:52,380 --> 01:35:01,800
amondul: Words fail I don't know you recruit the current student body of you sth to prospectively study exercise as a risk factor for many diseases.

670
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:17,400
amondul: One of your friends asks if they can use your data to study exercise as a risk factor for Merck syndrome, an extremely rare disease at the mitochondria with an estimated prevalence of nine per 1 million why or why not make this be a good idea group for.

671
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:25,020
Jordan Ferguson: So we said since it's such an extremely rare disease, the end would likely not be high enough.

672
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:28,320
Jordan Ferguson: With this population to be able to accurately study it.

673
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:38,070
amondul: Absolutely right, yes, if you only get nine per million, there are not a million students that have been on sth so you're going to get maybe he might not get any right.

674
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:50,490
amondul: that's exactly right okay your real interest is in prenatal yoga mothers and cardiovascular disease of their adult children, so what might be the challenges, you will face and conducting a cohort study to answer this question.

675
01:35:51,690 --> 01:35:52,530
amondul: group five.

676
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:57,570
We said that before so they would like to take us to know, because.

677
01:35:58,830 --> 01:36:08,220
amondul: This is Neil yoga, that is, that is research before the babies even born, if you want to investigate CBD or their children that's.

678
01:36:09,210 --> 01:36:13,230
amondul: yeah that's all follow me be difficult and it's going to be very costly yes.

679
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:20,430
amondul: and on top of that, the other, the other piece is that you know you could you could fix this with the retrospective design right but it's going to be.

680
01:36:20,850 --> 01:36:30,000
amondul: Why would there be records of whether someone took yoga prevent you know anything like that's not the kind of thing that there are records of that you can go back and do a retrospective design for.

681
01:36:31,530 --> 01:36:31,860
amondul: Okay.

682
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:42,510
amondul: So, propose a different historical exposure so, something that would be relevant for between the prenatal time period and age 30 that you might be able to investigate as a risk factor for adult cardiovascular.

683
01:36:42,510 --> 01:36:49,920
amondul: Disease so think about what rest retrospective data migration might be reasonably accurate the questionnaire or available via frustrated records.

684
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:52,950
Nolaundron Harris: And we feel feel sorry.

685
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:54,990
amondul: say that again.

686
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:57,150
Nolaundron Harris: Family history.

687
01:36:57,660 --> 01:36:59,490
amondul: per family health history that's a good one.

688
01:37:00,630 --> 01:37:06,210
amondul: that's probably reasonably accurate your questionnaire, maybe, maybe available administrative records.

689
01:37:07,050 --> 01:37:07,710
smoking.

690
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:09,270
amondul: yeah.

691
01:37:09,930 --> 01:37:11,190
Geehan Suleyman: alcohol intake.

692
01:37:12,810 --> 01:37:17,460
amondul: except the thing is that people is I don't know, do you think that that's going to be accurate, be a questionnaire.

693
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:23,460
Geehan Suleyman: I mean even smoking it's kind of the same thing they could lie about their smoking history.

694
01:37:23,970 --> 01:37:29,160
amondul: that's right I think both of those, especially since I think there's a well known.

695
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:35,580
amondul: correct answer for that, I think that that's less likely to be accurate for from questionnaire.

696
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:41,910
amondul: And you're right that it's on administrative records, like the birth certificate, it is there, but again.

697
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:49,830
amondul: Whether or not it is self reported to whether or not it's correct is is up for grabs right.

698
01:37:51,510 --> 01:37:53,880
amondul: But it is you know potentially useful right.

699
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:02,730
Nolaundron Harris: cholesterol levels.

700
01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:04,290
The mother.

701
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:06,720
amondul: Or, as children.

702
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:07,980
Nolaundron Harris: mm hmm.

703
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:11,070
amondul: yeah that might be in there.

704
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:19,350
amondul: The trouble with going trying to go back to medical records from that long ago, though, is that often they aren't available.

705
01:38:21,210 --> 01:38:23,460
amondul: there's kind of a time limit on medical records.

706
01:38:26,610 --> 01:38:32,130
amondul: But you're right, it might be something that would be in a medical record the trouble there, though, is that maybe not everybody had a test.

707
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:39,480
amondul: Is that something I actually can't remember I don't know that that's something that is routinely measured during pregnancy.

708
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:53,490
amondul: So, not every mother might have had a test, while they were pregnant and not every child likely has a cholesterol chest, so the ones that, had it probably hadn't done for a reason and therefore you're going to have like a weird sample people.

709
01:38:57,240 --> 01:39:03,030
Will Brodwater: We had talked about obesity, both for the mother and for the child and you could use charts with growth percentiles.

710
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,990
Will Brodwater: Time yeah that's possible too yes.

711
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:15,330
amondul: And that is something that would be recorded in the medical record probably during pregnancy and after birth, but again you'd have to.

712
01:39:16,410 --> 01:39:22,470
amondul: Make sure that those records were available still, which is always a bit of a challenge going back too far.

713
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:29,250
amondul: Right yeah Those are all good choices.

714
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:38,340
amondul: Okay, given challenges with assessing prenatal exposures you decided instead to look at maximum the teen education level.

715
01:39:39,630 --> 01:39:50,940
amondul: And split up in these in these categories and incident cardiovascular disease one friend has access to participants with low education at a high potential clinic and another friend has access to higher education Members about his total fitness clubs.

716
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:59,160
amondul: If you use these two populations is your unexposed unexposed groups, how would that influence any observed associations between education level and incident CBD.

717
01:40:00,810 --> 01:40:03,630
amondul: What are we on as a group, one now.

718
01:40:05,670 --> 01:40:06,690
amondul: I think we're back to group one.

719
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:26,520
Geehan Suleyman: um so for this, we said, there are multiple factors that a fact that influence education attainment and and then the groups that you are comparing probably don't have the same baseline characteristics rick's risk factors and exposures.

720
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:33,330
amondul: One for your exposure in this case is is education level right so you've got.

721
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:38,550
amondul: And then, what is another variable that's definitely different between these two.

722
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:43,680
Geehan Suleyman: income, I think, obviously.

723
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:45,390
Geehan Suleyman: Probably.

724
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:48,390
Nolaundron Harris: location.

725
01:40:50,250 --> 01:41:00,180
amondul: Not even just geolocation right, but your low education, people are coming from a hypertension Linux so they probably aren't exercising a lot right there already.

726
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:08,700
amondul: They already have hypertension, which is a risk factor for clarity of that, for your outcome right so you've got low income people who.

727
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:17,010
amondul: Are you know are by design you're picking to have a risk factor for your outcome, and then you have.

728
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:31,410
amondul: Your high income, people who are members of a fitness club right so they're probably people who mean I guess you can be number, without going i've never done that I wouldn't know i've never liked paid for a gym membership and then not gone, because I was didn't feel like it.

729
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:44,400
amondul: But I mean I hear people do that but, in theory, you know, these people are working out right and so you've got your high income, people are healthy your low income, people are unhealthy by design.

730
01:41:44,850 --> 01:41:54,240
amondul: Right so who which group your low income or your high income, do you think you're going to have a higher rate of cardiovascular disease in based on your choice here.

731
01:41:54,990 --> 01:41:56,400
Geehan Suleyman: The low education.

732
01:41:56,910 --> 01:41:59,970
amondul: yeah and do you think it's because of their low education.

733
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:04,590
Geehan Suleyman: They have other I mean there are other factors.

734
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:10,590
amondul: If the hypertension right because you picked him at a hypertension clinic and you're comparing of two people you picked it a gym.

735
01:42:11,730 --> 01:42:13,710
amondul: So that's a bad choice right.

736
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:17,880
amondul: Does that make sense.

737
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:24,120
amondul: You would never pick your exposed and unexposed groups from two extremely different populations like that.

738
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:28,980
amondul: So that is a.

739
01:42:31,410 --> 01:42:42,960
amondul: An extreme example and a little bit silly I don't think anybody would make that choice in real life, but it's easy to do this wrong if you're choosing based on exposure it's easy to do it wrong.

740
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:52,020
amondul: The issue here is that you're exposed and unexposed are not coming from the same source population.

741
01:42:56,130 --> 01:42:56,340
OK.

742
01:42:57,810 --> 01:43:02,190
amondul: So the population is not going to work for you, so you instead decided to team up with a professor has an.

743
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:13,170
amondul: Existing cohort study of nearly 7000 people recruited from the general population okay now we've got it we've got 7000 people who we've recruited from the general population, so, in theory, this is relatively you know.

744
01:43:14,190 --> 01:43:15,630
amondul: representative of our stores population.

745
01:43:17,670 --> 01:43:23,220
amondul: Participants of this study word without clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline in 2000 and were followed for 10 years.

746
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:30,840
amondul: Cases of cardiovascular disease were identified through periodic exams annual follow up telephone calls to participants interview of hospitalization records.

747
01:43:31,470 --> 01:43:39,690
amondul: A special committee developed standardized criteria to determine if an event that occurred and the date of occurrences event was noted so, then you get these data for the study okay.

748
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:47,850
amondul: So defining low education as exposed and high education as unexposed calculate the risk ratio.

749
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:58,200
amondul: As the measure of association between CBD and education and interpret your results OK, so the risk ratio is going to be the number of people, so this is your exposed right.

750
01:43:58,830 --> 01:44:15,930
amondul: low education, so you have 273 over the total population, for your cumulative incidence and the exposed and then you divide that by your cumulative instance the unexposed which is calculated to a one over 3217 for risk ratio of 1.22 and then, when we.

751
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:28,170
amondul: interpret that we interpreted as in the epic study population people would love education were observed to be 22% more likely to develop instance CBD between 2000 and 2010 that people with higher education.

752
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:32,130
amondul: Or you can say 1.22 times more likely.

753
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:38,280
amondul: Is that unclear to anybody did anybody get something different.

754
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:46,470
amondul: Now, as I said, i'm not going to ask you to.

755
01:44:47,670 --> 01:44:54,870
amondul: calculate a confidence level, this is really more of a bio stats saying you would learn how to do this, this calculation and a bio stats class.

756
01:44:55,590 --> 01:45:05,010
amondul: I heard some groups weren't sure what he was so he is the base of the natural log so the standard long of phase 10 the natural log is based, he.

757
01:45:05,610 --> 01:45:19,590
amondul: So, and the 1.96 comes from the fact that 95% of the normal distribution is with within 1.96 standard deviations for me so that's how you get that, so this is essentially allowing it to calculate a confidence interval.

758
01:45:20,310 --> 01:45:24,960
amondul: And 95% confidence that our goal can be interpreted as being sort of analogous to the p value.

759
01:45:26,310 --> 01:45:28,950
amondul: is a measure of statistical precision okay.

760
01:45:30,450 --> 01:45:33,480
amondul: So if you were to calculate this out.

761
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:38,310
amondul: Even get a confidence interval 1.2 1.45.

762
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:47,220
amondul: Your point estimate should always be between your confidence intervals okay so it's on an exam you were given a confidence interval.

763
01:45:48,300 --> 01:46:01,770
amondul: after you have been asked to calculate it point estimates and your point estimate is not in between those two numbers, you have done that wrong your point estimate is not correct your point as and it has to be in between your confidence on its OK.

764
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:04,080
amondul: So here.

765
01:46:05,130 --> 01:46:09,870
amondul: A 95% confidence interval around this risk ratio would be expected to include the.

766
01:46:10,350 --> 01:46:23,490
amondul: The true value of the risk ratio 95% of the time, if you repeated this study, many times in the same source population with the same sample size so we're like we're 95% confident that this interval covers that service ratio in the source population okay.

767
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:28,380
amondul: Yes, curiosity and your table rural school.

768
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:33,870
amondul: This that yeah.

769
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:38,700
Maybe not not sure.

770
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:40,650
amondul: A conference I.

771
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:43,230
Think all six.

772
01:46:44,850 --> 01:46:49,980
amondul: Plus 3217.

773
01:46:52,410 --> 01:46:53,550
amondul: I think it's right.

774
01:47:00,450 --> 01:47:01,710
amondul: To 73.

775
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:08,160
amondul: Plus 3296 plus two.

776
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:13,740
amondul: Plus 3016 676.

777
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:18,030
amondul: I think you might have like a weird map, we can look at it together if you want.

778
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:21,630
amondul: But i'm pretty sure that's correct.

779
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:33,810
amondul: Did anybody else get something different for the table here to the group so you got to the speculation that Okay, we found it sorry we had a math math math mistake.

780
01:47:35,550 --> 01:47:35,970
amondul: Okay.

781
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:40,860
amondul: So does this make sense, so if you are given this confidence interval.

782
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:54,090
amondul: Another way to interpret confidence interval is that if it does not include the no value your your results is statistically significant so because this confidence interval does not cross, one which is the no value for a ratio measure.

783
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:57,510
amondul: This is statistically significant at the point of fat level.

784
01:47:58,770 --> 01:48:03,150
amondul: Okay it's like having a P value less than point 05 does that make sense to everybody.

785
01:48:05,130 --> 01:48:12,450
amondul: So that is an important that's kind of the important take home thing about confidence intervals from this course is understanding how to interpret them.

786
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:25,530
amondul: Okay, so in calculating the risk ratio we assumed that there was complete capture of the population over time.

787
01:48:26,970 --> 01:48:35,610
amondul: The study coordinator tells you they've actually had a very hard time getting back in touch with the oldest and most ill participants during follow up so that they don't know what these people had a cardiovascular event.

788
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:47,250
amondul: What do you think that means for your estimates of cumulative incidents in question six which you're never numbers be overestimated underestimated or just right, and I think we're on group to now is that right.

789
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:51,210
Joshua Tucker: yep um.

790
01:48:52,890 --> 01:49:01,170
Joshua Tucker: I said, our estimate to be underestimated, and they would be if the most at risk for the outcomes are included across the last day period.

791
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:05,190
amondul: So that would mean the cumulative incidence of CBD is underestimated.

792
01:49:07,350 --> 01:49:08,070
amondul: So yeah.

793
01:49:08,940 --> 01:49:10,830
amondul: yeah in both groups right.

794
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:21,450
amondul: Except except in nine it says when you're talking with your study coordinator you learn there was excellent follow them on the highest educated individuals over the course of study, but only a problem following those with low education.

795
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:31,650
amondul: So it low education is truly associated with more CBD how what are observed association between education and CBD compared to the actual on observable association.

796
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:34,440
Joshua Tucker: would be attenuated.

797
01:49:35,190 --> 01:49:43,200
amondul: Yes, so because cardiovascular events in the exposed group are less likely to be observed the cumulative incidence among the expose will be lower than the truth.

798
01:49:44,910 --> 01:49:54,660
amondul: So among the unexposed we observe the truth, so the observed over association would be overestimated right because a is too small, does that make sense.

799
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:03,540
amondul: So it will look like the association is is smaller than it should be.

800
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:06,810
amondul: With with low education.

801
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:12,750
amondul: Because we're missing cases in the low education group we're missing a.

802
01:50:24,090 --> 01:50:24,660
amondul: click.

803
01:50:30,990 --> 01:50:31,380
amondul: alright.

804
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:36,480
amondul: So that is it for this exercise.

805
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:44,130
amondul: Any questions about our CTS are or proper studies.

806
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:54,090
amondul: All right, don't forget your reading and your quiz for tomorrow tomorrow we're going to do case control, and I think.

807
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:57,660
amondul: I think cross sectional studies is that right.

808
01:51:00,150 --> 01:51:01,800
