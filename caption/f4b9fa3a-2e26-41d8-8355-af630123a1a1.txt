1
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:31,880
All right. So where to next? Well, I think we need to head down the path that helps us explore what is an anti-racist mindset.

2
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:39,980
If we want to help disrupt unjust power hierarchies in our classroom and beyond, an anti-racist mindset is essential. Right!

3
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:47,720
I think that perspective is so important because it really grounds us and how important it is to change the way we think about and approach teaching.

4
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,800
It's not just a matter of adding a new reading or changing one assignment.

5
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,120
It's fundamentally transforming how we think about our role as teachers.

6
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,750
Yeah, and that work isn't always easy. Many of us received limited training as teachers or none at all.

7
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,940
And most training for professors or teachers don't focus on anti-racism explicitly.

8
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:15,650
Also, we've all been students before. We have been taught in a certain way that usually was not explicitly anti-racist.

9
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,910
Most of my teachers in college were certainly not being guided by those principles.

10
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,310
So this mindset shift often means we are going against the grain in our own institutions.

11
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,590
Absolutely. And it's a risk and it can be challenging to build that anti-racist mindset.

12
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:38,270
The challenges will vary depending on your social identity, but an anti-racist mindset is also so fundamental to doing this work.

13
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,880
Down this path is a module where we'll go to hear from a range of teachers and deep thinkers

14
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,860
about how they've built an anti-racist mindset and some of the challenges that come with it.

15
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,390
Yeah, it sounds great and I know there are some great readings that will help us understand this as well.

16
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,590
Lego!
