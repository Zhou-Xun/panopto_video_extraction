1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,667
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:08,451
We can also look to
the socio-ecological model for

3
00:00:08,451 --> 00:00:11,114
other public health
intervention strategies.

4
00:00:11,114 --> 00:00:15,546
If we look at that outermost circle
that focuses on communities,

5
00:00:15,546 --> 00:00:19,587
neighborhoods, policies in
the state are federal level.

6
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:22,175
There are a lot of intervention
opportunities that

7
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:25,000
offer great potential to reduce obesity.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,485
One policy intervention that's gained
a lot of traction over the last decade

9
00:00:29,485 --> 00:00:30,593
is menu labeling.

10
00:00:30,593 --> 00:00:33,895
What I mean by menu labeling is
nowadays when you go into a fast food

11
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:36,777
restaurant and
you look up at the board at the hamburger,

12
00:00:36,777 --> 00:00:39,682
now you'll see how many
calories are in that hamburger.

13
00:00:39,682 --> 00:00:43,476
Or if you go to a chain restaurant
often times on the menu you'll now see

14
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,290
the calories listed.

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,420
And the history around that calorie
labeling is really interesting.

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,540
So about ten years ago the idea
developed that if consumers

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,090
knew how many calories they were
eating when they were eating out,

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,110
perhaps they would make different choices.

19
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,900
Healthier choices to reduce
their energy intake,

20
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,840
another thought about menu labeling
is perhaps the food industry, and

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,950
restaurant industry, now that they
have to put that number on their menu,

22
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,780
maybe they'll make some changes
to the food they offer.

23
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,070
To give us lower calorie food,
they may modify the composition of food so

24
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,970
it has less calories, they might modify
the portion sizes we're getting,

25
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,820
since today when we go out to restaurants
we get such enormous portion sizes.

26
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,040
So this was the theory
behind menu labelling,

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,380
that it would force the issue both on the
consumer level, and on the industry level.

28
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,230
There were some early studies that
tested the menu labeling concept.

29
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,570
They actually did it in
a really interesting way,

30
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,070
where research participants would
come in to, say, a hotel ballroom.

31
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,890
And they were randomized to either get
a menu with calories or without calories.

32
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,130
And the investigators looked
to see what they would order,

33
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,060
the results from studies like
that though are really mixed.

34
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,880
In a lot of cases, seeing the calories
actually didn't make any difference to

35
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,950
what people ordered, but
in some cases it did.

36
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,670
And that spark of potential for
menu labeling to change peoples ordering

37
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:12,720
habits, led to many states and localities
Implementing menu labeling laws.

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,780
So localities like New York City,
Philadelphia,

39
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,390
Seattle, were some of the first to
say that chain restaurants including

40
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,990
fast food venues had to put
calories on their label,

41
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:29,390
as a public health initiative purely
to try to reduce our obesity epidemic.

42
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,300
So as these states and
localities are implementing

43
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,930
menu labelling on a local level, the idea
also gained traction federally and

44
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,840
is part of the Affordable Care Act or
Obama Care in 2010.

45
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,467
Congress passed the law that
federally nationwide chained

46
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:47,515
restaurants including
fast food restaurants and

47
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:51,373
also vending machines needing
to post the amount of calories.

48
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:56,236
This federal initiative has taken a long
time, actually it's now looking like

49
00:02:56,236 --> 00:03:01,285
in 2017 we will finally implement
calorie labeling or menu labeling.

50
00:03:01,285 --> 00:03:05,986
But it was a huge public health victory to
say that consumers have a right to see how

51
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,975
many calories are in
the food they're eating out.

52
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:12,313
So we can also look to our early
adopter localities to look for

53
00:03:12,313 --> 00:03:17,110
evidence about whether menu labeling
actually changes consumer behavior.

54
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,759
There's been several studies that have
used New York City as a test site because

55
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:23,273
they were one of our early adopters for
menu labeling.

56
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:27,257
And comparing consumer behaviors at
fast food restaurants in New York City,

57
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:30,540
to comparable patrons across
the river in New Jersey.

58
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,060
We're not seeing much difference in what
people are ordering at fast food venues,

59
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,850
in cases where calories
are listed versus not.

60
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,000
However, we have another story out in
Seattle, it's actually really interesting.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,970
So, in Seattle they also have menu
labelling and studies of Starbucks

62
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,070
consumers have found that with menu
labelling that when it went into effect,

63
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:56,900
the amount of calories purchased by
Starbucks consumers decreased by 14%.

64
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,500
So again, like the early studies we're
seeing a lot of mixed evidence, and

65
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,560
from different populations about
whether calorie labeling or

66
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,130
menu labeling actually works or not.

67
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,860
And we can think about a lot
of reasons why we're gonna

68
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,240
get different results, right?

69
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,130
So Starbucks' consumers,
maybe higher education,

70
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,550
a different socio-demographic population,
they maybe more attuned to calories.

71
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,061
They may see that number and

72
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:24,284
understand what it means as it
fits into their daily diet.

73
00:04:24,284 --> 00:04:26,698
Meanwhile if we look at
fast food consumers,

74
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:30,446
there's a thought maybe fast food
consumers they go to McDonald's or

75
00:04:30,446 --> 00:04:33,500
Burger King and
the wanna get what they always get.

76
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,339
They like the taste of
the meal they always order and

77
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:38,000
they don't wanna modify it.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,161
Also we can think that fast food consumers
may be a different sociodemographic group,

79
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:45,574
maybe lower education, lower income.

80
00:04:45,574 --> 00:04:49,733
They don't know how to put that number on
the menu board into the context of their

81
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,060
daily intake.

82
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,150
There's also an interesting thought,
that maybe among lower income populations

83
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,530
they actually want to buy more
calories for their dollar.

84
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,090
So putting that calorie label on there
is helping them order more calories,

85
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,390
which is counter to our intention
of these public health rules.

86
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,080
With the federal passing and
implementation menu labeling,

87
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,280
there's a lot that remains to be seen as
to whether this is a viable public health

88
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,590
strategy to prevent obesity.

89
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,610
But this just gives you an example
how on a local level, state level,

90
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,590
federal level, we can use policies to try
to influence individual behavior and,

91
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,990
ultimately, address obesity.

92
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,351
What I hope you've been able to see is
that over the past several decades,

93
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:35,778
the prevalence of obesity among
Americans have increased dramatically.

94
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:39,592
And our disparities in obesity
are widening, we're not yet

95
00:05:39,592 --> 00:05:43,470
doing a good job at addressing
the obesity epidemic.

96
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,210
Obesity has influences on our physical and
mental health, are costing

97
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:53,160
our country hundreds of thousands if
not millions of healthcare dollars.

98
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,450
And it has impacts on families,
and communities and

99
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:00,090
neighborhoods, we can also think
about families, communities,

100
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:05,140
neighborhoods, states and federal
policy as intervention opportunities.

101
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,700
And as we move forward,

102
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,660
the more creativity we have in
helping families, and children and

103
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:17,792
adults eats better and move more, that is
gonna be the key to addressing obesity.
