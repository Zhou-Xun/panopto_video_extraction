1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,560
So we'll continue the discussion about categorical variables, not categorical variables.

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,820
Now, just to get a refresh your memory.

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:24,480
So categorical variables are very commonly seen in what we see not only a linear regression model, but generalized linear regression model.

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:40,200
Whenever we imagine out of control variables are commonly used, they are they're most often used, I guess, in several December situations.

5
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,830
One is that they are indeed categorical.

6
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:53,320
So for example, we saw the example where all the data from different different states Wisconsin, Michigan, Virginia and North Carolina.

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:03,630
And so for a second example, if the data has these categories that it has no natural order at all, I presume three different states.

8
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,330
And in this case, it's very unlikely to equal a variable, as it were.

9
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,460
Yeah. So so that's that's one couple in case.

10
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,650
Another case is even if you have a continuous variable H, right.

11
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,890
Of course you can choose to include H drag as a continuous variable.

12
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:37,890
However, oftentimes people break age into different categories, range into of course, it depends on the concrete problem, but let's say about the age,

13
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:49,140
what I called my age into less than the 50 and above in two or more categories, like a less than 30 or 32, 30 and 50 and about 50, right?

14
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:58,440
So this is a common practice. There are certain advantages of doing this and breaking a continuous variable into age.

15
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,510
Now, we're going to talk about that in a few seconds,

16
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,390
but that's another scenario where you break a continuous variable into a motion or will you fit in the moment?

17
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,069
Another common in case is while indeed you recorded categorical variables,

18
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:19,490
but there is a natural order because the example we saw was this one, right?

19
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,330
So the income love, now the income level.

20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,529
Usually when people claim that they do not track that exact income or it's very difficult to calculate

21
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:38,750
exactly because people may not report there is an income and people that we report are low income.

22
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,770
I mean, whilst it is not uncommon that if people do not have the exact number already.

23
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,730
We ask their income. So, so but anyway.

24
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:56,430
So if it's very common for people to look people time income to track record the fact whether it's low corporate income or higher,

25
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,470
what were some other categories?

26
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:05,610
So for a sort of categorical variable, there is a natural order if you look out of this and there is increasing order.

27
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,570
This is another case where is well, we will have categorical variable.

28
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,680
So there's no categorical variable.

29
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,770
The point is that categorical there is very important commonly seen. So that's the reason why we are talking about it.

30
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,650
So during a lot less than we have.

31
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:35,990
Yes, I don't think we go back.

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,260
So we have to use the example where we try to study.

33
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:49,450
We're trying to model the health care cost, grow wisely out of the kind of cost on women in our previous life, and we to consider the stage variable.

34
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,090
So that has three levels Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina.

35
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,400
And also we have the age variable age is a continuous variable.

36
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:03,410
Now let's take a look at this. Two models like two ways of including age in the model.

37
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:09,650
One is while we directly age as a continuous variable, it is continuous.

38
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:17,930
Another way is to break age into a few categories. So here are these few categories.

39
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,580
In total, we have five categories, but we are using we're treating the last one as a reference.

40
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,150
So we have four dummy variables included in the model.

41
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,370
So these are two different ways of including age in the model.

42
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,020
Now let's take a look at first let's take a look at how to test the age effect.

43
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,940
And then we're going to talk a little bit about what it is.

44
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:49,580
And these values are at least the models. So the question is, is age associated with health care cost adjusting for a state?

45
00:04:51,440 --> 00:05:02,840
Now, to answer this question, you could fit either mode right along, either model as we can use to answer this question.

46
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:10,240
So essentially, we ask whether age significant, whether age has a significant effect on health care cost across from our state.

47
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,000
Now, let's first take a look at the first model and see how we.

48
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:26,379
Terrible. Well, this has been to answer this question. So in this model, what do you think of a novel?

49
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,620
This is would be. To answer that question.

50
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:49,860
Yes. Waiter three equal to zero theta three equal to zero.

51
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,930
Okay. Yeah. The reason is that we are trying to see the AB effect.

52
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,160
Now Page is here and on the pillar three is that little.

53
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:09,150
So now this is that there are 3 to 3 equal to zero versus beta three, not equal to zero.

54
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,660
And it would be a pest in this case.

55
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:28,030
How to construct how test? We have seen many examples in our past.

56
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,140
This extra song squares for Band three.

57
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:52,750
Given that all the other characters are in the model divided by one over the greater freedom.

58
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,840
Okay, that's great. Thank you. Yeah.

59
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:08,560
If you recall, the f f is actually always considered based on comparing the act for some of squares to the mean square.

60
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:18,309
Well, first, it doesn't matter as long as you are free. So the order has an effect so that we are.

61
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:24,340
Then we need to look at how much extra square are there, the increase in the regressions on the square,

62
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:32,019
or decreasing every square sum of square without adding age into a model that

63
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:37,860
does not have age but has the other similarities and then divided by its own,

64
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:44,830
the more freedom. In this case, it's one because we are passing one data and then divided by.

65
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:57,210
As I see for the full model, that the full model is the model that includes every covariance of they're considering here divided by that

66
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:04,960
were afraid of which is yeah minus P and P in this case is four because we are in forbearance minus four.

67
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,620
So this is the f supposed and so it should follow all vulnerabilities.

68
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:21,220
If this is true, if beta three is equal to zero, this should for F distribution with -44 freedom.

69
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:33,280
And this is the F test. And similarly, we are able in this case, we are able to construct the T test as well.

70
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,840
We are testing a single beta, just a single beta.

71
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:50,230
So we are able to assembler who passes that it's graphical catch of the beta three and and the T statistic we get a three at the estimated value

72
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:59,380
minus the value under this is which which is zero where it hasn't got to be three equal to zero or not divided by the center error of beta three.

73
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,130
This is the key statistic. And Houston has the other.

74
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:13,900
This is. It follows a transfusion with a minus for freedom.

75
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:25,310
We cannot use either test to test whether beta three equal to zero or not and is to pass their equivalent.

76
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,850
So the team square should be equal to F.

77
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,950
Listen, this is positive work for one for a single payer.

78
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:47,480
And but the second way is to, again, to look at it as a fact,

79
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:57,410
whether A.D. associated with the health care cost adjusting versus lost in a ways to include age as a categorical variable.

80
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:05,240
We include in receiver dummy variables for age in the model on here.

81
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:12,080
By doing this again, we are leaving we're leaving the last category out of this category out as

82
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,440
the reference versus our reference category so we can compare each category.

83
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:29,450
So these, as we are called, there are each category here to be lost in the reference category that is people older than 60 years old.

84
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:37,880
So now for this one, in our past, the fact that not with us is not because we have,

85
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,069
but because we have included these this bunch of variables that are old cars.

86
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,930
Most were age. So the not about this is that is to test whether all these.

87
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,780
Bonus. Or equal to zero simultaneously.

88
00:10:54,130 --> 00:11:00,650
And so all these are equal to zero there. No age effect versus the alternative that you know, at least.

89
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,280
At least one one of these bands.

90
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:26,270
At least one of these paintings is not in. Now in this case, the past can be considered a similar.

91
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,750
Again, we look at the change or the extra sample square,

92
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:37,670
but now we look at how much extra some square we have by adding this group of age dummy variables into the model.

93
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:52,489
And so it becomes somewhat square, beat up and better three or 4 to 5 six into a model that does not have these.

94
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,030
There will only has been a beta zero, beta one, beta two.

95
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:06,110
And in this case now this bigger freedom, the the growth of for this egg for a square that's equal to four.

96
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:17,300
Because here because we are testing for betas under novelties where it has information so an one zero and then divided by the assassin.

97
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,490
As for the full model, right? Played out 0.123.6.

98
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:33,900
And then divided by A-minus, amnesty or P in this case is one, two, three, four, five, six.

99
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,870
So we have seven statements. So then we have in line seven.

100
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:44,410
That's our if you go freedom from the denominator and this we will follow on or not.

101
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,910
This is this will follow after this fusion with four and minus seven.

102
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:58,530
Do you go to freedom? And so this is the F statistic that we can use to test this nonsense.

103
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:11,590
Okay. Well, in this case, of course, there's no correspondence you have anymore because they're webcasting several beta simultaneous events.

104
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:17,680
And there's no you has no.

105
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,940
We can forge growth models or other models to answer this question.

106
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,250
But what of what are the value and this value of each model?

107
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:37,130
Now for this model here. Now, if the artifact is indeed linear.

108
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:43,670
Right. So if if the health care cost. Indeed it has an edge in a linear fashion.

109
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,270
Now, of course, this is the model that is that has.

110
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:53,060
Well, then this is a better model in the sense that for 80 or you only have been a three to

111
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:58,760
estimate versus here you have to have a bunch of photos to estimate based on our data.

112
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:05,630
And so this model is is a simpler model and it's easier to interpret.

113
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:17,210
And also because of the true factors in DVD or so you have if you have a fixed dataset, a fixed sample size, then you have more power.

114
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:23,600
Estimating this, they are better because you only have one data to estimate versus here you have for data as Nate.

115
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:29,360
And so that's the advantage of this model that is that the true association is indeed linear.

116
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:43,160
Now this model has fewer parameters last night and thus has has higher power or higher efficiency versus this model.

117
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:54,709
Now, this model has about random intervals. This is a model where you would use if you are uncertain about age, fact, let's say you think, oh,

118
00:14:54,710 --> 00:15:00,410
there may be an increase in trend, but I don't know whether that trend is just exactly linear or not.

119
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,350
The increasing trend could, you know, could look like this.

120
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:09,680
So, for example, let's say this is age and this is this is why this is for cost.

121
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:16,100
And let's say I'm making this up.

122
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:26,450
Okay. So I'm just making out of a curve, like, let's say let's look out, look like this, right where we can look at this and even.

123
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:38,210
So they're saying while there's a certain curve and in this case, while overall there is an increasing trend for sure.

124
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,440
So if I mean you view middle age in old age, canelo's age, you would definitely not.

125
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,890
Or you are likely you will find a lot bigger threes significant. So these are from zero.

126
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:55,540
There are a significant effect, but it does mean that, you know, the average fact is is exactly linear as well.

127
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,230
In fact, while there is a change in how the cost developing.

128
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:09,250
Now, in this case, if you break the age into different categories, now you are able to counter this variation.

129
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,380
You know the difference dependent on age.

130
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,430
So because here you're allowing match this different age categories,

131
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:24,360
they have different effects and have different in fact they are three before physics.

132
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:35,240
You're allowing them to differ in this there's been a four, but because you allow it to be different for all Formula three,

133
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,660
then beta four could be longer than made up for it, or it could be smaller than three.

134
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:44,390
So there is no prespecified shape of that of the curve, right?

135
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:54,530
No. This is by trend and a similar to you. You while beta five could be either smaller or larger than either beta three or bit of four.

136
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,030
So by doing this you are not enforcing any trend.

137
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:06,590
You're just saying that it while I am allowing this different categories to apply with different effects versus here you are,

138
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:12,110
you are forcing increasing, increasing or decreasing linear association.

139
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:19,820
So this is the the advantage of the silent model. That is when indeed if the association is not linear.

140
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,760
So it gives you a. A more robustness.

141
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,030
This is a so-called robustness in terms of gradually modeling the age effects.

142
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:37,540
These are the the comparison of these two models. So both have their values and these values.

143
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:43,020
So in practice, exactly which one you choose.

144
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:53,670
That depends on the specific problem and depends on whether it how based on your scientific knowledge, which one seems to be a better one.

145
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:02,500
Now, let's take a look at one example that of where we use our tools.

146
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,860
This is our example about categorical variables.

147
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:14,910
So we have a data set of your lesson, you know, guide us out here where we use.

148
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:26,460
Okay. So where we want to determine the rule of the following, you know, predictors of life expectancy.

149
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,850
So here are why the response wise is life expectancy is in response to life.

150
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,299
And then we have different predictors or covariates.

151
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:44,610
So we have cognitive science, a person for television and a person for medical doctor.

152
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:51,480
So we have this for predictors that we like to use to protect people's life expectancy.

153
00:18:52,170 --> 00:19:05,040
And this is part of the data our data look like. So we have the variable gratitude for TV, for medical doctor and sex and life.

154
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:14,580
Well, this is the response. Why our life expectancy? And then if you look at the the covariance in the model of life expectancy, this is continuous.

155
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,530
I mean, this response y is continuous. That's why we are you why we are using a a regression model.

156
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,470
If you look at a continent that has has a few different categories.

157
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:35,770
Now, if we here in the next slide, just use this common tool to look at how many categories Clinton has.

158
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,480
It has five categories. Five categories.

159
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:46,920
So in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, in South America.

160
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,050
So and again, this gives you the number of subjects within each category.

161
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:57,750
So so kind of these are this is a categorical variable and it has five categories.

162
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:02,850
And sex variable here also is categorical variable.

163
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,270
It has two categories, male and female.

164
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:12,780
So. M And then a person per TV and person per night doctor.

165
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:19,000
These are both continuous variable or while we can treat them as continuous.

166
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,110
So this is very, very common.

167
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:28,460
So of course, a person's per medical doctor, for example, has to be a positive emitter.

168
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:38,520
So this will probably not average so highly.

169
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,540
Yeah, you see some some fractions here.

170
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,920
And so I think this is on average for each candidate. So it does have to be a positive.

171
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:54,630
But I mean, my point and the point I was trying to make is that even if this were all positive indicators,

172
00:20:54,930 --> 00:21:00,010
then it's okay to treat them as as treated as as a continuous variable, just like age.

173
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,080
A little bit better age usually matter 18 years. It is a positive.

174
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,760
But it doesn't matter too much if we include age because you just continuous collaborate.

175
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,020
Okay. And then. Well, this table here, it gives us.

176
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:22,380
You know, the average life expectancy within each continent.

177
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:35,310
So, for example, for people in Africa, the life expectancies, 59 years in Asia is five.

178
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,510
Europe in 1774, for example, to give to me.

179
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,520
Overall, we are able to compare our model fits to this overall.

180
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:58,570
And then. We try to include a continent as a coverage in the model, as a producer, as a learning model because it's categorical variable.

181
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:04,690
So we define as so we define the variables we delivered observables.

182
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:10,300
We could either do it explicit ourself or we can let R for it.

183
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:16,600
And let's take a look at both ways. And here we are by doing this, we're very funny to our results.

184
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:22,150
So here we are, the dummy for Africa.

185
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:30,550
This is just what a continent is it? Will Africa. This is equal to what otherwise is equal to zero and similar to one for Asia,

186
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:37,870
this one is equal to this time we are equal to one if if the continents is Asia, otherwise it is equal to zero.

187
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:43,450
So here we have this five double variables because we have five categories.

188
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:52,470
Now let's take a look at our model for the model with all continents represented.

189
00:22:53,850 --> 00:23:01,080
Okay. If we look at this model here, we're feeding, we have Y and we included all of these five minerals before.

190
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:08,090
Okay. So then before we you have a results.

191
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,880
You think there might be an issue with this model in favor of such a model?

192
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,330
Okay. I see people are nodding. So what is yours in my house?

193
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:30,410
We can't have all the dummy variables because we need our experience with XY matrix.

194
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:34,579
Mm hmm. Yeah. Great. That's exactly. Yeah, that's.

195
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:40,100
That's the exact reason. What are the exact racial issues or recall that had previously?

196
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:47,960
We had a one slide here when we talk about the diverse states.

197
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:53,140
We had an example where we include all of these three variables in the model one.

198
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,480
And then we look at this matrix. These are matrix.

199
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:06,050
We notice that it's not a full rec. And so the columns, they are linear, independent, and here we have the same exact the same, the same issue.

200
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:12,530
So when you include all of these W variables simultaneously and also the intercept.

201
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,670
Now this model has all the unknown parables and an intercept.

202
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:21,320
So where you plus are the the Sakamoto Well, all right.

203
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:28,219
He's actually well, smart enough to automatically treat one hour notice that.

204
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:35,120
Oh, okay. So that that matrix is not a full rack result, that automatically creates one category as the reference.

205
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,980
So in this case, the artist lost category as the reference.

206
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:51,319
South America treat this category as a reference. So that's why here you look at this row, you have this all this DNA is because art cannot as well.

207
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:59,209
It's not possible to estimate the facts for all these five different categories, plus the intercept, and you have to lay ground.

208
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:02,900
And so our automatically pick a category and treat it as a reference.

209
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:12,170
So this model that is the same model as if you didn't include the last category at all.

210
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,240
How do you see the model from the very beginning?

211
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:24,590
Just include these four variables that you would have seen, that you would have got exactly the same model here.

212
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:39,290
Okay. So this is not the linear model when we include all deliverables in the model.

213
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:46,460
And what later we are going to interpret this this on this numbers as many facts.

214
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,950
But now let's take a look at the model.

215
00:25:53,240 --> 00:26:01,340
So based on this model now, based on this model, we are able to have the feed of the mean from because we have linear regression models.

216
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:09,430
So we can, based on our fate in the model, we can calculate the corresponding y hat or if the count of the Y happened in the field.

217
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:17,450
I mean, these are white hat. For each continent.

218
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:30,490
If you calculate the y hand for each column it. These are the I mean here these while these three lines.

219
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,959
You're asking why. Yeah they get it by hand.

220
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,430
This is our continental capital. My hat. So, yeah, this line.

221
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:51,840
This is. This is my hat. Now, if we look have y hat and if we compare it to the just the summary of the life expectancy within each continent,

222
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,480
we see that they are exactly the same.

223
00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:05,490
So the average within every group average with an Asian average with a euro and so forth, they are exactly the same and they should be the same.

224
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:16,770
So in these numbers, Model Y hat, they can be calculated based on the estimated values here.

225
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,940
Now, let's take a look at what each number represents.

226
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:32,700
Number intercept this number here, because we are treating the last category as the as the reference category.

227
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,989
So this indoors out and we call that indoors out of four linear regression model.

228
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:42,900
That's the average Y average response when all the other covariates are equal to zero.

229
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,799
Right. But here this one only is 490.

230
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:52,800
There was an equal to zero. We'd be out of the reference category that is South America.

231
00:27:53,880 --> 00:28:01,440
So in other words, this indoors, this is the this is the mean life.

232
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:12,380
Life expectancy for South.

233
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,990
South America and for reference category.

234
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:26,760
So that's what the intercept means. And then this number here, this number, this is not been up for some time.

235
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,780
Terrible for Africa.

236
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:41,150
This then is the difference in life expectancy in me, life expectancy when I compare Africa to the reference category, which is South America.

237
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:50,810
So. So in other words. Now this 1910. This means that compare Africa to South America.

238
00:28:51,320 --> 00:29:01,970
On average, life expectancy or the mean strategy is ten years shorter and ten years smaller, ten years lower.

239
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,960
So this is actually this number. Here is the.

240
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:15,460
Difference in the life expectancy.

241
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,960
Comparing African to South America.

242
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:35,020
Right in a similar way. You can get, you know, the other lot you can ask.

243
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:45,400
I can interpret the other as well was we have the difference or the difference is comparing each category to the reference category.

244
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:50,650
And also because we already know what are the reference, what a value is for the reference category,

245
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:59,320
then we are able to figure out what our means are for all these different categories, and that is how the white hat is calculated.

246
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:08,140
So for example, now the 69 that is that is of South America, that's the intercept.

247
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:16,870
And then here, because Africa on average has ten years shorter life expectancy.

248
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:21,190
So now 69 minus ten, that's 59.

249
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:27,330
That's that's a. That's a misnomer.

250
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,640
Similarly, you can calculate all these other numbers and that's how what hat is calculated.

251
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:41,960
And they should be equal to the corresponding average life expectancy within within each continent.

252
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,850
This is the interpretation of all these facts here.

253
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,220
Okay. And then we will see tomorrow.

254
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:06,340
Without the Internet, let's build a model without intercept. So you are.

255
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:11,200
You are this negative one. If we expose it looks like it is actually one that it is.

256
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,510
We are not able to intercept in the law. So we are only including the file variables.

257
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:28,120
But this is a okay model to fit it, right. So as we have talked about one example using that previous to using a state as, as, as an example.

258
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:36,280
So once we remove intercept for a model, if we only include the five variables, then it is an okay model to set.

259
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,190
And in this case, we can see that this output here, it has all these five down minerals,

260
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:50,240
but there is no intersect because mutually exclusive remove remove yourself from the moment.

261
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,230
And if we look at, you know.

262
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:10,270
And if we look at this parameter estimates, all these numbers,

263
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:19,150
they are exactly equal to the corresponding average of the corresponding average of each column.

264
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:28,580
So in other words, if you fit a model without the Internet and clearly spotted that wearables in the model,

265
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:35,180
then you will not even get the corresponding average for each continent.

266
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,770
So these a number that represent not that the corresponding average.

267
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,470
Okay. So this is the another way of thinking about it.

268
00:32:49,760 --> 00:33:02,569
Now, for these two models, if we compare the SSD value for this to regression models, we notice that they are exactly the same for the MSI.

269
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:11,780
I mean, this number here, this is, as we mentioned, this is the root, the square root of the square and a similar to the previous model.

270
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,279
This is the root of these four.

271
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:23,420
And you see that in these two model, these two numbers, they are exactly the same.

272
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:32,840
They're exactly the same. And also here, the number betas are also exactly the same.

273
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:39,360
So here in the first model, we include an intercept, viral load or alternatively, remove one category.

274
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:46,370
Right. Right. So we have five betas in the first month, are similar in a second about what we removed the intercept.

275
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:50,010
But we all have got variables that are chosen. Five figures.

276
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:57,680
So these two, the two MSE, they have the same user freedoms and also they have all the disease are the same.

277
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:09,259
So that means the size C values are also the same because as I see recall that it SD is equal to MSE times corresponding to our freedom.

278
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,250
That's number of betas. Absolutely. This case is equal for number of.

279
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:22,940
So because MLC is the same, this is fine as AC must be the same.

280
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,420
So how can this to be equal? Oh, how about.

281
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,750
Okay. So that's okay.

282
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:37,280
So that's we just figured out that these two are the same from the previous table, but actually we can also get right to look at the ANOVA table.

283
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:44,360
If you look at ANOVA of the first model and over the side of the model, we notice that a sum of squares, here they are.

284
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:53,150
They're exactly the same. For the residuals.

285
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:58,210
Of. Oops. Sorry.

286
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,639
So here is not a five degree freedom. It's actually minus five.

287
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:12,550
I mean, the degree of rhythm corresponding to Arrow Square, that's an amnesty in five of.

288
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:21,970
But anyway, I mean, while this may sound more and more, more more complex way of comparing,

289
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:27,290
as I see now, we can compare the highs I see dragging from the table again.

290
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:32,420
So if you look out to a table, we notice that a sum of squares for this two models, they are exactly the same.

291
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:39,450
Well, this is actually not too surprising at all.

292
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:46,470
The reason is that the reason is that there's two models.

293
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,670
Mathematically, they are equivalent. There are everything about this.

294
00:35:51,210 --> 00:36:01,650
So you are trying to explain how the card uses the continent as a as a variable because it has five categories.

295
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:11,270
Now, the difference between this tomorrow is simply how you called this five continents or how like which categories would include one model.

296
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,410
You include intercept and then you include four variables.

297
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:21,190
You need one as the reference versus the set of the one you would remove eaters out of.

298
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:28,770
I include all five down there. So either way, you're using you're exactly using the same categorical variable.

299
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,470
Try to explain the continent.

300
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:40,440
And there's two models that are mathematically equivalent, because if you think of the design matrix, again, if we think about that matrix.

301
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,320
In terms of, look, these are metrics just like in this example.

302
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:54,120
But one way is that, you know, we removed the last column and so we treat this as a reference.

303
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:00,990
That's one way. Another way is we remove the Intersect, where we include all the three different categories.

304
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:09,000
So without variables. So mathematically, this should be equivalent and doesn't matter should shouldn't matter which column you remove.

305
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,240
Mathematically, they should give you the same result.

306
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:21,809
So that's the reason why in the end we see that the error sum of square are the same, because these are essentially our are the same model.

307
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:25,260
They have the same power in explaining the variation in Y.

308
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,300
So that's why the error we kind have ever an error become the same.

309
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:41,329
However, if we compare, if we look and ask where and when, there is a strange thing about our square.

310
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:44,330
If we look at our square here, this is for a side of the model.

311
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:50,299
We we include all five, but we are also not intercepting the our square is so large.

312
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:56,090
It is almost equal to what? But if you look out of the hours, we are from previous model.

313
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:05,000
The motto got through the last last reference category, but it includes indoors and our square is one, four, three, five.

314
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:11,770
Is this almost half price of war worth more than half?

315
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,730
So what is the reason behind a sudden dramatic change in our square?

316
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:22,320
Why do we have such a difference? Because mathematically, intuitively, these two models should be the same,

317
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:31,000
because we are simply using different columns of X to make four axes a full rack matrix.

318
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:35,530
But then what is the reason behind such a dramatic change in our square?

319
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:43,360
The reason is that throughout our square, if we're writing to ask SSD.

320
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:50,750
Wal-Mart is, as I say, divided by SS one. This is what our square is.

321
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:58,850
Now we just saw that and as I see is the same between the law for the two models,

322
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:03,730
but we have the same as I see and which is also well agree as well with our intuition.

323
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:12,440
So the difference in our square in this photo then is because of the as what the total sum of square.

324
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:24,720
It turns out that for the first model we use the notation M0 So for the first model we've what we call the M0.

325
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:33,980
So for M0. That is the model that includes intercept and also for documents.

326
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:38,220
Yes. That's why. If you find just.

327
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:52,420
The same definition as before. This is essential, however, for anyone the model that does not have intersect.

328
00:39:52,690 --> 00:40:01,990
It includes all of five variables. In this case, the definition of srs y changed because there is no intercept.

329
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,070
So there is no I mean y bar.

330
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:10,600
You can think of y bar as the predicted y where you only include intercept in the model.

331
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:17,320
And that's that's what y bar essentially is. So you fit a model that has only intercept.

332
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:26,440
And then if you predict what you're going to y that's not what y bar is because now we're forcing the model Y,

333
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,710
we're forcing the the intercept out of the order.

334
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:36,720
So in this case, the srs y is defined simply as some square y.

335
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:47,870
If you force intercept out, it's the same mathematical equivalent to a landing intercept equal to zero beta zero zero.

336
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:52,640
There is no intercept, but as a result, that means here.

337
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:56,480
But as I why as a assessment is defined in this way.

338
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,330
So it is because of this different calculation that says why?

339
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,269
But that leads to a dramatic change in our square.

340
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:11,149
We can chatteris in an hour. So, for example, now this is model.

341
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:15,200
And what the model that has five variables but without interception.

342
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:24,920
Without interception. Now if we take the sum of the components and then we'll get to assess what we should

343
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,330
get as this one and this and this as a as as what is the total sum of square.

344
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:37,970
And so it should be about if you pay with some of these, take the sun, you will get another way.

345
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:52,910
And that is this number here. And then if you calculate this is simply the sum of what I square and you get exactly the same number.

346
00:41:53,270 --> 00:42:01,090
So this is just a to check that indeed when you do not include a intercept, this total sum of square as as Y is,

347
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:08,020
as you calculated as the sum of what a square is that of the one minus by bar square.

348
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:17,930
So that's why you have here you have this you can see that you have this huge sum of squares and in the end,

349
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:29,350
you have you have a huge total sum of square. Yeah.

350
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,860
That explains why we see such a dramatic change in our square.

351
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:42,640
Any questions? Yes.

352
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,060
So this is also tied to the change in significance levels.

353
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:54,670
So this ties to the change in significance levels as well for the variables because of the interceptors versus not.

354
00:42:55,810 --> 00:43:08,950
You mean this will change the significance level for estimates with with versus without, first of all.

355
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:23,100
And. That's a good question.

356
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:28,400
It shouldn't. And it shouldn't because.

357
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:45,489
I have two different values on Slide 24. It shouldn't change the significance of each estimation as major.

358
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:54,490
The reason is that while you can think of this, if you look at it now, perhaps the outcast is actually the accurate sum of square divided by that.

359
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:59,440
And I see that the extra central square will not change.

360
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:07,630
And I see. Well, maybe it is easier as well if you look at it in terms of the key, in terms of the key statistic.

361
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:12,640
So the key statistic is the estimated value divided by the center hour.

362
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:21,850
Right. Assuming the value will not change no matter how you code, these categories include whether you have intercept or not.

363
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:26,500
The corresponding estimated value should be the same as what we just checked.

364
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:31,150
So as many dollars should be missing and center errors should be the same as well.

365
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:36,970
The scenario should really depends on because if you recall, well, center areas,

366
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:42,910
center areas is my square times patch transpose times x, then the inverse of that matrix.

367
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:55,450
So whether you remove that, whether you've got a column Y intercept in the model or whether you keep the last category in the model, of course,

368
00:44:55,450 --> 00:45:04,900
then your estimated value, I mean the column in the table will give you while in this case it could give you the difference has made a difference.

369
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:10,870
But in the side in the case it will give you that the the the as the value themselves.

370
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:16,330
What are the other case in an error shouldn't change so that the p value shouldn't change.

371
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:22,719
So for example let's maybe it's easier if we take a look at a concrete example.

372
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,560
Let's say here we look at the intercept. The intercept here.

373
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,530
This is the estimated value for the category reference category.

374
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,310
That's South America, right?

375
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:47,320
And then the P value is the TS 34 and a p is this number where you actually look outside of the model of the South America.

376
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,490
The P value is 34 and this is the p value. They are the same.

377
00:45:52,620 --> 00:46:02,490
Sort of the same. So so that the coding Dever coding shouldn't work, whether including intercept or whether it's called the plus category.

378
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:09,570
It shouldn't change your conclusion about how for the hour it's just 2 hours square.

379
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:16,950
The reason is that now says why is defined difference so so things related to as as Y will change for the

380
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:23,100
P values and the the center error if they are not calculated based on has as much since it was change.

381
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:33,629
I guess my question then is because some of these coefficients are now significant that weren't before and I

382
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:38,220
guess that has to do them with like we're interpreting them differently because we didn't have the intercept.

383
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:42,470
It's no longer just an increase. Is that right? Oh, you mean here, for example?

384
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:48,150
You mean here these p values are not like a you know, the same as.

385
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,300
The problem was, as you saw here. Right. Okay.

386
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:56,990
Yeah. Well, this difference is that these.

387
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:01,880
Well, we are these are p values for for the differences we are estimating.

388
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:12,400
And so these these numbers, for example, this 5.5, this is the difference in mean cost in income,

389
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:16,700
you mean life expectancy, comparing North America to South America.

390
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:21,470
And this this is this is the p value for this difference.

391
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:30,170
But here in this table, these numbers, for example, of we're looking at something.

392
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:34,430
Yeah. So this number, this is the estimated value for the mean.

393
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,840
This is no difference comparing North America to South America.

394
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:42,319
This is this is the estimated mean of North America.

395
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,710
And this p value here, this is the corresponding estimate.

396
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:51,710
What the p value for this for for this number for one estimate the mean not a little the difference.

397
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:57,530
So these yeah. So these p values are for different things. If you want to derive income, compare this to table.

398
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:02,630
Well, the only thing that we are able to compare to actually that's the reference category.

399
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:07,940
And this yeah. This intercept the reference category.

400
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,360
So more questions at the back. That was my question.

401
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:28,220
Right. And.

402
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:46,180
Yeah. Okay. So now let's let's finish this slide before we make some interpret the rule results for the new inner sanctum model.

403
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:51,420
Now we have we actually we just did this. So this is a model that has no intersection.

404
00:48:51,880 --> 00:49:03,940
And then all these numbers here, the estimated values, these are the corresponding mean, mean life expectancy for each continent, for each continent.

405
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:09,520
So, for example, this sum before this run, the figures of the 74.

406
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:14,770
This is the mean life expectancy for Europe.

407
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:23,020
This is the green pass. Now, yeah, this is the new results.

408
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:33,340
This number is actually is different from the other model where you included the intercept, like in this model.

409
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:37,600
In this case, the Europe, this number is 5.5.

410
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:42,730
And this number is actually the difference in life expectancy.

411
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:47,500
You know, the life expectancy comparing Europe to South America.

412
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:55,000
There is, of course, mathematical risk to models are the same.

413
00:49:55,990 --> 00:50:00,940
However, the interpretation are quite different and we have to be very careful about integration.

414
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:06,690
So if you have a reference category to a reference category, then everything is compatible.

415
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:10,840
But ask me the value. We are comparing this category to the reference category.

416
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,129
But if you do not include category, then a reference category.

417
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:21,130
Then by removing intercept, then the estimated values are the corresponding mean for each category.

418
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:33,970
Yeah. In the model without the intercept of so that the p value is compared in our test.

419
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:38,440
The test is comparing like the average to zero.

420
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,910
Right. Like the estimate is like the. Yeah.

421
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:47,530
Where for example says that it's not, but it's equal to zero.

422
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:54,090
Yeah. We know that the low expectancy is not going to be zero for.

423
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:59,380
Yeah. So then like so this t value doesn't really tell us that much.

424
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:06,370
Oh. Okay.

425
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:11,320
I'm sitting here. So I think your question has to has two parts.

426
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:20,890
So here of one thing we we need to make sure is that no, this number,

427
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,930
this P value is for the P value on casting, whether this beta here is equal to zero.

428
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:34,000
And this is the beta theta, in fact, four or the corresponding average for Europe.

429
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:38,590
Right. So this female here, this is for testing, not this is that beta.

430
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:46,509
Oh, I'll just directly use this, this equal to zero versus beta.

431
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:56,770
European is not equal zero. Right. And well and the seven Harlow question well, you mention that now because a lot of it is that is it cannot be zero.

432
00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:08,530
So that a this P value is not a really I really like to write but a here when I we need to here when we we need to a little bit

433
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:20,920
careful because this is actually a lot of like one fundamental thing about a statistic is that is D we always have random noise.

434
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:31,560
So for example, let's say that I give you a data that we're all this.

435
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:38,970
And so like even in this case, I have this mobile account.

436
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:42,490
Let me have a very good example, but let's just take this example.

437
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:51,010
So even if we know that scientifically, I mean, the life expectancy should be positive.

438
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,810
However, if I give you an arbitrary data set, I'm sure to create a dataset.

439
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:57,130
I did. I gave it to you.

440
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:11,560
And then because of the random noise in the data, if you keep that, there is a possibility that in the liquid has does not reject beta equal to zero.

441
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:18,760
This is because of the random noise in the data. So so when we.

442
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:27,280
I mean, here, based on soccer people, we see that. Well, of course, we will reject.

443
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:37,750
That's not how. But this is what we rejected, because the reason is that the luck that the probability of observing, observing like,

444
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:45,720
you know, that the data that I gave you for for this but I give you the probability is so small after this novel is right.

445
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:53,020
If this were true, then they probably did not observe this actual data is is this number virtually zero?

446
00:53:53,770 --> 00:54:00,940
But a still I mean, it's not a it's not a zero number. So it's not it's not zero because of the run of noise in the data.

447
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:12,550
So you would have never get a0p value. So if you have, of course, mathematically, I mean, the life expectancy cannot be zero.

448
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:17,650
Cannot be zero. So mathematically, you would say, oh, there is zero probability of observing.

449
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:24,880
You know, if this were true, if this were true, then there is zero probability observing the actual data.

450
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:30,220
But for because to you we always take the rhythm noise into account.

451
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:35,710
So the probabilities never exactly equal to zero. It may be very, very small, very tiny.

452
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:45,160
But it's not, not, not. So this is the reason why we cannot simply based on the fact about, oh, bearing standards, it cannot be zero.

453
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:49,900
So I don't need to take a look at the beauty of it anymore. I don't mean to look at the p value anymore.

454
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,290
I get directly based on my son level knowledge regardless.

455
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:57,129
So that's that's not about how statistic works.

456
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:07,330
So we have to look at, take the noise into account and this may be an example where there is a little bit but not because not expands.

457
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:12,100
It cannot be positive or cannot cannot be negative so has the quality.

458
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:17,380
So so you would think, oh, it's okay to reject this.

459
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:23,320
In this case this seems to be quite natural, but there are many examples.

460
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:32,080
Suppose you didn't have the prime of related the prior knowledge so that you would have to make a statement that takes

461
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:38,260
the role of a noise into account that the data actually and if you take repeated samples the data may occur otherwise.

462
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:44,509
So that's why we still have to carry out this test and then compatibility.

463
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:50,079
Well, thank you. Okay, so take a little bit there.

464
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,130
So let's take a five minute break and we'll come back.

465
00:56:02,089 --> 00:56:08,749
So let's hear some of us now, because the problems we are seeing here, they are.

466
00:56:08,779 --> 00:56:12,709
They're different. So how do we make the difference about this is different, in fact.

467
00:56:13,939 --> 00:56:21,769
So from this table, if you have a if you have a this is the model that eight years out, it only included phantom genitals.

468
00:56:22,189 --> 00:56:29,239
And based on this, you get an estimated value for each category, the estimated mean for each category for each or each continent.

469
00:56:29,899 --> 00:56:35,839
And then you get the corresponding P value showing that whether that aspect is significant or not.

470
00:56:37,069 --> 00:56:41,859
But if you do not include an intersection, you do not include oh sorry.

471
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:47,059
If you do not include an intercept, but treating the last one as the reference.

472
00:56:47,939 --> 00:56:56,059
What you get is the these p values are the estimated R for the estimated difference for asmall difference.

473
00:56:56,959 --> 00:57:07,789
So in other words, now if you simply run this model a lot, if you just run this model, then there is no direct inference.

474
00:57:09,799 --> 00:57:15,859
For example, here I'm based on this numbers, you can calculate the mean, for example, for Amber, for Africa.

475
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:21,079
You are able to calculate by by subtracting ten from 69, you are able to find, oh,

476
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:30,259
the estimated mean life expectancy for African is 59 and that's the difference between six, nine and ten.

477
00:57:30,769 --> 00:57:40,579
However, this table alone does not have the corresponding p value and p value for that 59, so we cannot have that.

478
00:57:41,449 --> 00:57:49,189
But I feel this model alone by looking at this model, although of course I got a result as implied by this model.

479
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:57,769
You can calculate fine by by taking the variance covariance matrix out because here we have,

480
00:57:58,429 --> 00:58:05,929
we have after as little as meeting this effects, we have various covariance matrix of this estimates.

481
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:15,379
And then if you look at the difference between 69 and ten, that's that's actually based on zero hat minus.

482
00:58:15,619 --> 00:58:25,029
That's a minus one hat. If you if you look at Benazir how the man has been on how you get to the mean for.

483
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:36,929
That's asking me about over Africa. But this table does not tell us the center error for this does not direct the center to refer this.

484
00:58:38,249 --> 00:58:48,898
So if you want to get the center error, you will need to first get the various matrix from the hour of the hour or the calendar of this.

485
00:58:48,899 --> 00:58:52,589
But you will need to ask R to give you the various covariance matrix.

486
00:58:53,159 --> 00:59:01,739
And then based on that you are able to calculate the variance of this difference and then you can get the center out of America, young people.

487
00:59:03,449 --> 00:59:10,499
So again, the point I'm trying to make is that this table alone, it doesn't give you the same error for this if.

488
00:59:10,859 --> 00:59:25,529
You're actually putting or able to calculate it versus the other the other model that you have, this model, this model here,

489
00:59:25,529 --> 00:59:35,188
if you do not include intercept, does include this done here, then are will automatically calculate the scenario first.

490
00:59:35,189 --> 00:59:43,768
For example, this one, this one previously this is below zero had a minus beta one happened for this is

491
00:59:43,769 --> 00:59:48,209
average and so this is because you had minus beta one had in a previous table.

492
00:59:49,409 --> 00:59:57,778
We didn't directly get the center out. What if you follow the fact in this way are we will automatically give you the corresponding center

493
00:59:57,779 --> 01:00:06,269
error flurry for this for this number 39 and then the T value is calculated based on this number.

494
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:18,999
However, I mean, if here if you want to see if the difference between Africa and South America, whether that difference is significant.

495
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:25,569
Now, you can you can estimate that difference that's 59 -60, not negative ten.

496
01:00:26,739 --> 01:00:34,749
That's the estimate value from the previous table. But I did this table in a south doesn't give you a center error for that difference.

497
01:00:36,219 --> 01:00:38,709
If you only calculate the scenario for the difference again,

498
01:00:38,979 --> 01:00:47,379
you will need to first get coherence matrix for beta hat and then based off the various covariance matrix,

499
01:00:47,589 --> 01:00:57,069
you're able to calculate the standard error of let's say beta African minus beta in South America and you're able

500
01:00:57,069 --> 01:01:08,108
counter this center error for this and the center for this for the difference is actually given in the previous table.

501
01:01:08,109 --> 01:01:13,809
And if you if you fit in the previous table, the center error is given here.

502
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:19,739
This is the center error for this 1910 for this difference of.

503
01:01:22,529 --> 01:01:27,599
And whereas here it gives you the scenario for where this 59.

504
01:01:29,529 --> 01:01:34,959
So if you to see what I'm trying to say here.

505
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:40,359
I see some confusion. I hope.

506
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:45,619
Not do have any questions about this, and I hope that I will try.

507
01:01:45,819 --> 01:01:47,959
Well, I hope that I made this clear, but I'm not sure.

508
01:01:50,269 --> 01:01:59,599
My point is that one way, one coding one way gives you the estimate has made a difference compared to the reference category,

509
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:03,259
and the center errors are for the corresponding difference.

510
01:02:04,459 --> 01:02:11,299
The other way it gives you a direct estimates of the mean of each category and the standard errors are for the corresponding mean.

511
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:20,969
Now of course you can based on either amount you had a variance covariance matrix and calculate in the center errors that are you are not even.

512
01:02:22,609 --> 01:02:26,799
I have heard that that's why you have to carry out of some analysis some some calculation.

513
01:02:28,609 --> 01:02:33,199
But but you can definitely do that by asking ARG to give you the variance coherence matrix.

514
01:02:42,569 --> 01:02:45,989
And. Okay, so maybe just another word.

515
01:02:45,999 --> 01:02:50,249
So these two models, which one do fit?

516
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:52,169
That depends on your interest.

517
01:02:53,549 --> 01:03:03,059
If your interest is in estimating the mean for each continent, you don't care too much about the difference how they differ.

518
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:08,149
If you just care about, oh, what is the mean for Africa? What is the mean for Europe?

519
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:15,268
What does it mean for South America, for example? Then you would have fit this model and this model derived would give you the estimated mean and the

520
01:03:15,269 --> 01:03:20,879
corresponding center error and then the corresponding p value you can derive that make your conclusion.

521
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:30,029
However, in another case, if you are more interested in seeing what is the difference between South America and Africa,

522
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:33,929
what is the difference between Asia and South America?

523
01:03:34,409 --> 01:03:39,539
Right. So then you would think is better for him to say to the first model,

524
01:03:40,949 --> 01:03:46,588
because this model directly gives you the estimated difference and of the corresponding center

525
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:51,649
out and of the corresponding plant in which you can draw a conclusion about difference.

526
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:57,419
But my point is that these two models essentially are the same.

527
01:03:58,349 --> 01:04:06,059
If you know one model, if you have the outcome from one model, then you should be able to work out by counting all the quality of your interest.

528
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:13,139
It is just that those the quality of your interest, it may not be directly given by the these are output,

529
01:04:13,409 --> 01:04:19,589
but if you are able to get more out of pull from R and calculate the qualities that you are interested.

530
01:04:22,399 --> 01:04:31,878
Again because the small doses of they are their equivalent. Okay.

531
01:04:31,879 --> 01:04:38,719
So that's. On the connection between this two.

532
01:04:39,499 --> 01:04:43,429
Now, let's take a look at the next slide.

533
01:04:44,209 --> 01:04:49,609
So here. Well, the next slide use a different way of raising about minerals.

534
01:04:49,669 --> 01:04:54,589
Previously, we created, um, variable ourselves, if you recall what we did.

535
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:07,369
We explicitly define these five variables ourselves, but actually we don't have to do this.

536
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:15,409
We don't have to do this and our can do this for us. So that's that is through this comment here the factor this comment.

537
01:05:16,919 --> 01:05:24,028
If you simply use this natural coordination, then what you will get is, well,

538
01:05:24,029 --> 01:05:31,689
our what our will do is it will be able to trade while created this for the areas and including this version

539
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:40,589
together with the intercept and that it's this motor is exactly the same as the first model we saw before,

540
01:05:41,339 --> 01:05:47,519
the one that we expose and create some verbals ourselves and include, you know, the four out of the five.

541
01:05:48,989 --> 01:05:59,639
This is just a display just to show that there is a you could actually let art take care of creation is I'm doing it ourselves.

542
01:06:02,369 --> 01:06:07,499
Okay. So this has actually answered your question, I think.

543
01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:17,339
Yeah. So there's this this slide, the results here, this is exactly the same as the first one that we saw.

544
01:06:20,219 --> 01:06:35,839
Okay. And then. Yeah.

545
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:42,549
Okay, so this is the same. I'm not sure why there are so many different slides about.

546
01:06:42,759 --> 01:06:43,509
Okay, but anyway,

547
01:06:43,509 --> 01:06:57,879
so here this is our model that includes explicitly this for the emergence of an event like this that is exactly the same model as the first model,

548
01:06:57,879 --> 01:07:06,129
but I think maybe the reference category becomes different. So here we have Asia, Europe, North America, South America.

549
01:07:06,129 --> 01:07:09,879
So here we'll finish this model. We left Africa out.

550
01:07:10,299 --> 01:07:17,829
So Africa now is treated as a reference. But in the previous model, we treated South America as the reference.

551
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:24,309
Right? That's the only difference. So then in this case that all these numbers.

552
01:07:25,799 --> 01:07:32,909
These numbers are the differences comparing the corresponding continent to the reference which is Africa now.

553
01:07:33,739 --> 01:07:37,288
But a previously the reference category was South America.

554
01:07:37,289 --> 01:07:41,549
So for the differences, they are comparing each of them to South America.

555
01:07:43,139 --> 01:07:55,649
So in other words, we do have a like flexibility of choosing which reference category to use again, but eventually we will reach the same conclusion.

556
01:07:55,649 --> 01:08:02,789
We will make the same conclusion that it doesn't matter which which category we are treating and treating as a reference.

557
01:08:03,959 --> 01:08:05,699
They're reaching the same conclusion end.

558
01:08:06,089 --> 01:08:15,269
But it's just that of the concrete numbers, the estimated values you would derive again from this table, those are different.

559
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:20,429
You know, which route, which references, which category you are treating has the reference.

560
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:25,169
So are always trees. The first grab was a reference.

561
01:08:29,159 --> 01:08:36,199
I don't know. So I think maybe the last category of the magnitude of the last category is around four.

562
01:08:36,249 --> 01:08:42,139
He's fighting Democrats, but I'm not a 100% certain, so I think maybe you can check this out.

563
01:08:43,769 --> 01:08:50,279
Yeah, I think and if I remember graduate you have a separate categories, then the category up here is the last hour.

564
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:55,469
We'll treat true that as the reference category. I'm not the I'm not 100% certain.

565
01:08:57,909 --> 01:09:04,499
Yeah. You put in all dummy variables and the intercept, it will automatically treat the last one as correct.

566
01:09:04,829 --> 01:09:19,089
Oh, okay. Great. Thank you. Yeah. Okay.

567
01:09:20,019 --> 01:09:26,519
So. Now let's compare this numbers.

568
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:31,809
I actually don't remember which is which, but this model 2.21.

569
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:36,639
Now, if we. Well, this is actually the one that I use the factor.

570
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:40,179
I mean, use the our common factor to create the four top arrivals.

571
01:09:41,709 --> 01:09:50,829
Now, if we let our credit variables in itself using these factors function, we see that the ANOVA table,

572
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:56,979
the output and our table are automatically group all these four categories into one room.

573
01:09:57,639 --> 01:10:04,539
You see that here. We only have one rule for these two. Worked on the variables and the referendum is equal to four.

574
01:10:06,279 --> 01:10:11,258
And we have we have the sum of square and the mean mean that or subscript this

575
01:10:11,259 --> 01:10:17,559
actually that this p value it automatically passed well in task drive the task

576
01:10:17,559 --> 01:10:29,979
like that but not but this is that all the for bakers maybe use this case I

577
01:10:29,979 --> 01:10:38,089
think to trace the trends Africa has the reference so then we had the equal.

578
01:10:40,699 --> 01:10:43,909
Europe. South America.

579
01:10:43,909 --> 01:10:49,939
It was North America. It was it. So it has this null hypothesis.

580
01:10:51,499 --> 01:11:01,428
So it's. So are automatically grouped all these four economists together versus now if you

581
01:11:01,429 --> 01:11:06,329
create your own dummy variable and then you throw that variable into the models,

582
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:13,399
then are will treat this for intervals as if they were separated they were separated covariance.

583
01:11:14,359 --> 01:11:18,999
So then you see that you have one rule for each other that you created.

584
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:25,519
Of course. I mean, again, these two models, mathematically, they are the same model.

585
01:11:27,619 --> 01:11:36,859
So now if you want to test the same well, this is the same model is is that you would need to do your own calculation.

586
01:11:37,009 --> 01:11:42,919
You would need to sum up this four numbers corresponding to these four categories.

587
01:11:42,919 --> 01:11:48,499
That's the extra sum of squared or body to the you added.

588
01:11:49,789 --> 01:12:00,319
And indeed you can check that. Right. So if you take of some of these four numbers, you will get this number, which is this some squares.

589
01:12:12,999 --> 01:12:18,759
So in other words, again, I mean, we have a lot of flexibility,

590
01:12:19,179 --> 01:12:27,338
but dealing with the thorny variables and whether we create that nervous ourselves within an argument or whether I mean, well,

591
01:12:27,339 --> 01:12:34,749
after operating that variable, which we treated as the reference category and whether we include all five of the variables

592
01:12:34,749 --> 01:12:41,019
we not intercept or whether we include intercept by leaving one category out as a reference.

593
01:12:41,319 --> 01:12:46,209
So, you know, there are so many different combinations. We have less than 30.

594
01:12:47,889 --> 01:12:54,679
It's bizarre. Bottom feeding of oranges. So that's why we have all these different sets of outputs, right?

595
01:12:54,759 --> 01:13:06,669
So different numbers, different tables. But one bottom line is that all these results, they should be equivalent, mathematically should be equivalent.

596
01:13:07,059 --> 01:13:11,129
You should reach the same sort of a conclusion in the end of.

597
01:13:12,599 --> 01:13:16,649
But sometimes based on your own interest.

598
01:13:17,069 --> 01:13:20,579
51 bought or maybe easier than 50 another.

599
01:13:21,269 --> 01:13:21,869
For example,

600
01:13:21,869 --> 01:13:30,629
if you are more interested in the mean of each continent than you would to directly have all the fact that matter was included without an intercept.

601
01:13:31,409 --> 01:13:37,019
But if you are more interested in the difference, then you would include further variables.

602
01:13:37,499 --> 01:13:44,099
Class intercept are leaving one category out as to reference and depend depending on your interest.

603
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:53,579
But by the really the point I really want to emphasize is that all these outputs they should give you the final,

604
01:13:53,999 --> 01:13:56,609
final addition, give you the same conclusion in the end.

605
01:14:00,509 --> 01:14:07,349
But depending on what outcome you have, sometimes you may need to do your own calculus in or out of the planet.

606
01:14:11,629 --> 01:14:16,789
So I think it's worthwhile if you got to spend some time after a lecture to try to sort out,

607
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:20,089
try to see the connection between these different outputs.

608
01:14:21,079 --> 01:14:29,809
Because in the lecture, we all unfortunately, we do not have, you know, too much time to talk.

609
01:14:34,009 --> 01:14:39,589
On this album. You have to. We have to move up because we have all the materials that needs to be covered.

610
01:14:41,689 --> 01:14:47,899
Okay. So now interpret in the interpreted the article from this model.

611
01:14:48,619 --> 01:14:52,939
Now we have done this. So now because here we have different input.

612
01:14:54,199 --> 01:14:57,589
If our variables and we left everything out.

613
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:01,699
So this number here, then these represents the difference.

614
01:15:01,949 --> 01:15:07,789
Comparing each continent for the reference category, which is every second of this number here.

615
01:15:07,819 --> 01:15:14,099
The intercept. This is the estimated meaning life expectancy for Africa.

616
01:15:14,689 --> 01:15:18,729
And we have seen the interpretation these.

617
01:15:21,079 --> 01:15:27,319
And then. Well, so far we have focused on just one variable and that is continent.

618
01:15:28,009 --> 01:15:36,079
But in the data side, we do have a bunch of other variables that is sex prisons for TV and prisons for medical doctor.

619
01:15:37,219 --> 01:15:48,678
And this is the model where we include all these variables in our in our model and then we will get the corresponding estimated value.

620
01:15:48,679 --> 01:15:57,319
So for example, they asked me to Sachs, in fact, they asked me did a person for TV that person might by doctor effect.

621
01:15:57,829 --> 01:16:02,119
And of course here we have the the facts for the continents.

622
01:16:02,269 --> 01:16:07,849
You know, we laughed again. We left Africa out as the reference category.

623
01:16:08,299 --> 01:16:18,819
And so and then if we try to interpret the intersection, this number here recall that intercept.

624
01:16:18,829 --> 01:16:25,789
This is the mean response when all the various values are equal to zero.

625
01:16:26,599 --> 01:16:35,509
Right. And so this 60 this means well, this this number, it means this is the mean life expectancy.

626
01:16:36,949 --> 01:16:40,949
Now, what? All the other matters are equal to zero. What?

627
01:16:41,299 --> 01:16:47,149
So what? Sex is equal to zero. Now here sex. I think the reference category.

628
01:16:53,359 --> 01:17:02,029
It's not super clear what is used as the reference category, but I think female is probably use a reference category.

629
01:17:02,029 --> 01:17:08,809
So I've in that with a female is the relevant category.

630
01:17:12,879 --> 01:17:16,959
So then this is the bin Laden's fantasy for females.

631
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:23,338
For females for the reference category and for our continent.

632
01:17:23,339 --> 01:17:29,459
Now Africa is treated as reference right old in Africa.

633
01:17:32,949 --> 01:17:52,439
And then of so prison TV in person for medical under article even a zero for to have zero per person per TV and zero person per minute.

634
01:17:57,269 --> 01:18:01,329
Or who's who's person per TV in person per doctor.

635
01:18:01,349 --> 01:18:06,299
These two atoms are equal to zero. So that's the interpretation of the intercept.

636
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:14,649
Of course. I mean, this interpretation is about one issue is that.

637
01:18:16,269 --> 01:18:23,619
Now, it doesn't make much sense to look at $0 per person, per TV person, per medical doctor.

638
01:18:23,769 --> 01:18:33,909
So that's why the interpretation on The Intercept, although in the mathematical we are able to interpret it by the sun, may make too much sense.

639
01:18:42,209 --> 01:18:59,019
Okay. Any questions? And then the next question is what percentage of variation is explained by gender alone?

640
01:19:01,629 --> 01:19:11,679
So in this case, now we just need to find a model that has well known, has the variable sex image address, just has variable sex in it.

641
01:19:12,339 --> 01:19:17,769
And then we look at the this is another table, listen to some square.

642
01:19:19,419 --> 01:19:25,509
This is some of square. And again, the square is going to be this number divided by the total sum of square.

643
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:33,189
So that is five or five divided by five of five plus four, six, two, five.

644
01:19:33,789 --> 01:19:36,969
And that's that should give us this number over here.

645
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:48,609
So this is the variation in life expectancy that is explained by my gender or by actually by a variable sex a lot.

646
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:56,929
So that's that is the interpretation on our square.

647
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:00,899
And what if the standard of narration is explained by. By.

648
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:07,429
Yeah. Okay. So I mean, you can we can look at it.

649
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:12,829
So here this on our table, this is the so called sequential ANOVA table.

650
01:20:14,119 --> 01:20:20,809
This is sequential. This is actually by by adding steps in the Google model that only has intercept.

651
01:20:21,259 --> 01:20:31,759
So the sum of squared got increased by 505 and we could look at the same question, also the same question by looking at a partial sum of square.

652
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:42,499
This is part of some square by adding the sex variable into a model that has well again here we only consider intercept.

653
01:20:42,509 --> 01:20:46,939
So this is by adding the second variable into the model that has only intercept.

654
01:20:47,779 --> 01:20:53,599
So of course now we see the same answer sample square 505 and.

655
01:21:00,389 --> 01:21:04,929
Yeah. And then, of course, in Andalusia, that same hour square.

656
01:21:06,579 --> 01:21:07,688
So this little slice,

657
01:21:07,689 --> 01:21:16,509
the point is that we can answer this question by looking at either the square ensemble square or that the part of some of the square.

658
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:21,859
In this case, because we are only looking at six venerable blocks.

659
01:21:23,619 --> 01:21:27,589
So the partial sum of square, a square or some square, now it'd be the same.

660
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:36,999
And then let's consider the percentage of our variation explained.

661
01:21:38,559 --> 01:21:43,629
Now, first, let's consider the percentage of variation explained by model with all covariates.

662
01:21:46,429 --> 01:21:56,849
So this is actually the hour square. Explain by the model a boat with O covariance that's s has some regression.

663
01:22:07,149 --> 01:22:11,778
As as a reversion. With all covariates.

664
01:22:11,779 --> 01:22:22,189
That's that's how many ideas we have about, you know, just writing this.

665
01:22:22,339 --> 01:22:27,529
So this is SSR divided by SS y, this is the R squared.

666
01:22:27,889 --> 01:22:31,699
Now, this as as R is the model that has all covariates in it.

667
01:22:32,959 --> 01:22:37,279
So this is how R squared is calculated. Let's see.

668
01:22:51,739 --> 01:23:02,569
Yeah. In this case? No. If we take if we take a sample of all these sample squares, we will get our square.

669
01:23:03,379 --> 01:23:15,829
Oh, sorry. We will get SSR. So if we look at this model that has sex and well, that has all the calories in it,

670
01:23:16,609 --> 01:23:22,789
and then if we take a sample of this for an adverse reaction, the regression sample squared, that's SSR.

671
01:23:23,629 --> 01:23:29,599
And then if we divide this number by SS, why SS Why is actually this number?

672
01:23:40,939 --> 01:23:46,739
Yes. As as why is assuming this number plus this as I see this is as easy as I see.

673
01:23:46,789 --> 01:23:53,389
Right. So then our square, that is this SSR divided by some classes SS way.

674
01:23:53,539 --> 01:24:03,229
So that's SS that's our square. So I leave this to you guys to figure out the exact number for our square.

675
01:24:04,309 --> 01:24:16,219
Now, the next question is what a fraction of this percentage is a trillion attributable to person per medical doctor and person per tb covariance?

676
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:26,849
So now let's. Well, in this case, we are looking at the change in our special hour of this hour,

677
01:24:26,909 --> 01:24:33,449
where we want to see how much of this hour square that is attributable to this to covariance.

678
01:24:34,799 --> 01:24:43,229
So in order to answer that question, we need to look at how much regression is almost square as we come from these two variables.

679
01:24:45,209 --> 01:24:48,689
And we are able to find this by again, by looking at this.

680
01:24:48,879 --> 01:24:55,269
Another table that is actually by looking at the sum of the square and corresponding to these two variables.

681
01:24:59,649 --> 01:25:13,409
So the R-squared. So the R-squared. Attributable to this.

682
01:25:15,779 --> 01:25:35,219
And this is assessed by adding the covariate corresponding to sex and a corresponding non-sex person for many the doctor and person for TB.

683
01:25:35,969 --> 01:25:45,869
Adding these two variables to the model that has intercept and beta sex variable and a beta continent.

684
01:25:50,949 --> 01:26:04,669
And divided by SS White. Divided by assets by each right.

685
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:10,639
And this number here is the numerator.

686
01:26:11,299 --> 01:26:16,849
This is the sample square that that are that is attributable to this two variables.

687
01:26:17,159 --> 01:26:19,249
Not that is some of these two numbers.

688
01:26:21,569 --> 01:26:31,379
So this one onwards and ss1 again is the sum of every single number in this whole column, and that's the essence line.

689
01:26:41,419 --> 01:26:47,629
So then even now, the question is what a fraction of this percentage is trivial to this?

690
01:26:48,919 --> 01:26:53,429
The fraction. That is equal to.

691
01:27:02,489 --> 01:27:08,599
This question is a little bit tricky, since I do not think that you will see such a question.

692
01:27:09,079 --> 01:27:14,209
Well, maybe you will see several question practice, which is probably likely.

693
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:25,189
But this is sort of a, you know, artificially created, created example just to show the elimination of this group in some squares.

694
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:34,399
Then the fraction is actually the regional between those two divided by R squared.

695
01:27:35,059 --> 01:27:43,329
But then that s as y i got to cancel. So the fraction now becomes less divided by one because this is the.

696
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:56,419
So in other words, now, if we look at this table here, the total SSR is the sum of these four numbers.

697
01:27:59,079 --> 01:28:07,569
And some of square that is attributable to this correct covariance, that is these two numbers, the sum of this one.

698
01:28:08,649 --> 01:28:14,979
So the fraction one is actually the ratio between the sum of these two numbers in the sum of the for numbers.

699
01:28:16,899 --> 01:28:24,559
So. Right. So that's that's exactly how following the tragic news coverage.

700
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:25,549
So for example, here,

701
01:28:25,939 --> 01:28:35,479
this is the seven squares corresponding to person per TV and this is the sum squared corresponding to a person per medical doctor.

702
01:28:35,779 --> 01:28:37,459
If you take a sample, this tool,

703
01:28:37,909 --> 01:28:50,598
that's actually the sum of the sum of this one of those some of these numbers and divided by the sum of the first four numbers.

704
01:28:50,599 --> 01:28:53,659
That is the SSR. Right? That's the sum of these four numbers.

705
01:28:54,709 --> 01:28:59,839
And got to use the fraction. The fraction that that's point.

706
01:29:01,109 --> 01:29:09,479
Two one. That's 21%. Okay.

707
01:29:09,599 --> 01:29:20,589
And similarly, you are able to calculate. We hear about similar.

708
01:29:20,729 --> 01:29:34,309
You are able to calculate this number first and this number first and then Calhoun in the region and the hours where you can get an R square by,

709
01:29:34,339 --> 01:29:37,399
you know, by this call land so it doesn't forget our square.

710
01:29:38,149 --> 01:29:49,038
And then you can calculate the seconds. You can calculate this number by getting as as s at the extra squared off as as well.

711
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:54,469
So that's the extra square for person for TV and person for monitoring divided by assets.

712
01:29:54,469 --> 01:30:05,929
Right. So that's if you count of this regional, you get this name and then you got this number of our square, you get this number as well.

713
01:30:12,619 --> 01:30:21,198
So again, this is this sort of, you know, artificially created created an example that show how know how we can play with the

714
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:27,079
different sum of squares just to get a better understanding of some of squares.

715
01:30:33,839 --> 01:30:38,879
Okay. So yeah, so that's the spa example.

716
01:30:38,899 --> 01:30:42,239
Also, any questions about this whole think?

717
01:30:49,879 --> 01:30:57,979
Okay. So hopefully, I mean, after lecture, you guys are able to spend some time going over this whole example.

718
01:30:58,819 --> 01:31:07,759
So again, I will emphasize that all of these results are interconnected and we see this many slides

719
01:31:07,999 --> 01:31:12,139
with different outputs of different tables in a different way at different models.

720
01:31:14,269 --> 01:31:17,539
But we should be clear that all these results are interconnected.

721
01:31:18,169 --> 01:31:24,619
Essentially, they are based on just a model that treats that, like how you model,

722
01:31:24,769 --> 01:31:28,819
how you call to the categorical variable and how you include a component of America in the model.

723
01:31:29,269 --> 01:31:39,529
And so when you run model on well, again, depends on your scientific interest, depends on the question of interest.

724
01:31:39,949 --> 01:31:43,099
You may choose, you may prefer running one mode or the other.

725
01:31:44,469 --> 01:31:47,989
So why model with the easy way to answer the question compared to other models?

726
01:31:48,829 --> 01:31:55,639
But essentially all the models are equivalent. And if you run one model, you should be able to answer all the questions.

727
01:31:56,719 --> 01:32:04,009
But it's just not whether you can directly find those number from the table or you need to carry out some calibration yourself.

728
01:32:07,359 --> 01:32:16,249
So so that's why it's important to understand how these numbers how this different for example somewhat squares if you balanced the

729
01:32:16,269 --> 01:32:23,679
estimated values how they were connected it's only after we understand only if we have a good understanding of how they are connected.

730
01:32:24,249 --> 01:32:28,929
Are we able to give an impression, just one single ontology.

731
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:36,039
All right. We'll figure out how to calculate all the bodies we need. Okay.

732
01:32:36,439 --> 01:32:39,079
So that's a categorical variable.

733
01:32:42,049 --> 01:32:51,229
So as we mentioned at the beginning of the lecture, that maybe allows me just to say a few words about the final product.

734
01:32:52,099 --> 01:33:00,109
So we will post a description of the final product and the details at very shortly.

735
01:33:00,409 --> 01:33:07,549
So that was me and I. We are working on that. And also, you guys will have groups of four.

736
01:33:07,849 --> 01:33:13,789
So it's a group project and the group we have already made assignment of the group.

737
01:33:14,419 --> 01:33:23,509
So we are mixing this two sessions together. So, so then you will have each of you will have three other group members.

738
01:33:25,039 --> 01:33:29,719
And while there there's one group that has only three because, because the total number of enrollment.

739
01:33:29,719 --> 01:33:33,559
So one group has three. You just have three good numbers.

740
01:33:33,569 --> 01:33:38,889
But we will go we will come up with a way how to how to address that.

741
01:33:38,929 --> 01:33:43,609
But but most of the group will have four members.

742
01:33:44,299 --> 01:33:56,059
And so you will well, the final product, then you will write a report and then you'll do the analysis and give your details adding to the analysis.

743
01:33:56,059 --> 01:34:04,759
And then you will write a report and you will do probation on the last days of the semester 100 times.

744
01:34:07,609 --> 01:34:17,269
I think this is probably the the first big approach to AP, of course, per that you guys see I mean during a mass or program, right?

745
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:22,969
So, so 601 probably does not have a product final for next year.

746
01:34:22,969 --> 01:34:32,719
615 now. So I'm sure you guys will have lots of questions when you do the analysis.

747
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:43,339
And also we will, as we know, we will be provided more details about how the group should work.

748
01:34:43,879 --> 01:34:52,199
But this is a group for that. And throughout your master program, you will like any other persons you will work on, of course, verdict as well.

749
01:34:52,219 --> 01:34:55,359
This is the very first course you are working on a group program,

750
01:34:55,789 --> 01:35:03,619
but I believe in 650 and maybe 653 and then definitely six, nine, nine, maybe other courses as well.

751
01:35:04,069 --> 01:35:06,729
You will need to work on that.

752
01:35:06,739 --> 01:35:15,409
So this is the very first time you are working on that and hopefully this gives you guys a good opportunity to of course,

753
01:35:15,409 --> 01:35:25,349
each of us I mean, you need some time to get used to working on group projects, especially if you haven't done group her before.

754
01:35:26,269 --> 01:35:30,619
So but that's okay. So this is the very first step.

755
01:35:30,949 --> 01:35:39,258
And then gradually throughout the master program, you've got to do that because it involves statistics.

756
01:35:39,259 --> 01:35:42,699
It's the conversation is a very big component.

757
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:46,579
So we have to know how to how to collaborate, how to finish.

758
01:35:47,409 --> 01:35:51,979
So this is the very first opportunity to work on that.

759
01:35:52,399 --> 01:35:55,308
And you should be I mean,

760
01:35:55,309 --> 01:36:13,529
we we should be considerate and also be responsible is valuable and can help contribute like have are are always kind of you for the global products.

761
01:36:14,009 --> 01:36:18,079
So each time we have a group, right, so different issue.

762
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:30,779
But of some people we want to figure out ways of working on these issues of okay, so we are okay, so we have 4 minutes left.

763
01:36:30,849 --> 01:36:36,289
This is sort of a new, you know, business model that's not finished yet.

764
01:36:37,069 --> 01:36:44,989
The reason is that now we have to default. I think we are falling behind because this part of the time for going over to for example,

765
01:36:44,989 --> 01:36:49,159
I wanted to make sure that we have a long standing of our example.

766
01:36:49,159 --> 01:36:53,809
But because of that, really, I think we are falling behind.

767
01:36:57,269 --> 01:37:10,809
So let's let's let's even we have just have rumors that you could look at one level of extremism.

768
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:17,279
So in the next lecture, in the next slide, we're going to talk about the interactions.

769
01:37:18,869 --> 01:37:34,019
So interaction is another very important topic. So if you just take a look at the basic concept of interaction before we get into any details.

770
01:37:35,009 --> 01:37:47,189
So now if we consider a linear model that has has two covariance, x1, x2, excellent X and the interpretation of being a zero,

771
01:37:47,429 --> 01:37:54,959
this is the intercept and this is the mean response when all covariates are equal to zero.

772
01:37:56,129 --> 01:38:02,698
We are all familiar with this now and a beta one. This is the mean change in y for y.

773
01:38:02,699 --> 01:38:14,338
You going to change it? X1 beta one it is it to the effect where the association between 1x1 adjusting for x two so beta one then is the mean change

774
01:38:14,339 --> 01:38:25,139
in y for y you only change one unit increase x one by holding x two constant or positively for x we're holding x2 constant.

775
01:38:26,789 --> 01:38:33,839
Now if you look at this interpretation of beta one, well we incorporated, we didn't specify the value of X2,

776
01:38:34,019 --> 01:38:41,159
we just say that if we hold x two constant so it doesn't matter which adds to value you're looking at.

777
01:38:41,219 --> 01:38:44,949
As long as you're looking on the people that have the same extra value,

778
01:38:45,959 --> 01:38:51,989
then that that difference value compared that there are people that have same natural value.

779
01:38:52,379 --> 01:39:00,059
Then the people with higher y unit, higher value x1 you see their y of average is beta one higher.

780
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:06,179
This interpretation we just say we hold x because we didn't really specify actually that.

781
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:17,789
Yes. So the a very important of the underlying implicit assumption is that the effect of X one is equal

782
01:39:18,329 --> 01:39:26,488
across all values of X because it doesn't matter which adds values or health concerns as long as we,

783
01:39:26,489 --> 01:39:30,569
and that does not change how we are able to interpret it.

784
01:39:32,489 --> 01:39:36,449
But in practice, this may not be the case.

785
01:39:36,659 --> 01:39:42,809
So the x one effect may depends on which adds to a value we are looking at.

786
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:50,608
So in that case, we need to model that no pattern is an actual value of x one.

787
01:39:50,609 --> 01:39:55,729
In fact, by using the so called interaction interaction between the covariates.

788
01:39:57,389 --> 01:40:05,669
So, so the previous model, it assumed that x1x2 do not interact with each other.

789
01:40:06,629 --> 01:40:10,859
So in terms of every logic, this is the so called a no effect modification.

790
01:40:11,369 --> 01:40:15,569
It means that a effect of x one is same regardless of extra value.

791
01:40:17,699 --> 01:40:23,009
But often this is not the case. So oftentimes we would like to include the interaction term.

792
01:40:23,189 --> 01:40:27,229
The interaction is actually the product between the two covariate x one.

793
01:40:27,229 --> 01:40:33,719
Next we include it in the model so that you will not know the x one effect.

794
01:40:34,499 --> 01:40:39,449
Now you've had x one on one. It depends on which x two value we're looking.

795
01:40:41,399 --> 01:40:48,539
So this is the effect of interaction allows the effect of x one to change depends on instrumental.

796
01:40:49,559 --> 01:41:00,359
And in this case, beta one. Beta two, these are the so-called main facts, meaning facts on the x1x and then this beta three is the whole,

797
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:04,679
the so-called interaction interaction between x1x.

798
01:41:06,989 --> 01:41:12,239
Okay. So I think we are over time. So let's stop here first do.
