1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,709
Yes. Okay.

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,780
Thanks for being with me there across town.

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:30,780
Does anyone have any but does anyone have any questions or concerns about the paper topics or the exam?

4
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:41,700
I had a question earlier just down the hall about leaving the how long the exam will be available for its give me the same as the first exam.

5
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,870
So one week, right? That's what we did last time.

6
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:54,180
So it'll be the same exact structure, just different questions on the material we've covered since the last exam up until next.

7
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,660
So we'll have a class on Monday and then the exam a little bit.

8
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:08,340
So but yeah, as far as the paper topics any I had a few questions that some people have come to like office hours,

9
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,980
but other than that it seems like there's no big issues there.

10
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:21,989
So. Sounds good. So we'll pick up today on eco toxicology kind of wrapping up.

11
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,430
We started and then we had the neurotoxic lecture from Dr. Mikulski.

12
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,160
And so we're going to wrap up the toxicology today.

13
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:37,380
And yeah, so I'll just jump right into things that there's no questions or comments you don't want to talk about.

14
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,149
Okay. So last time just to like bring us back to where we were for the last time,

15
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:53,400
we talked about you could toxicology the science of contaminants in the biosphere and their effects on the constituents of the biosphere.

16
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:59,969
So one of the big themes I was kind of harping on was the scale is very different when we're talking about eco toxicology,

17
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,150
we're talking about effects on species, on populations,

18
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,219
potentially talking about like global phenomenon as opposed to really up till now,

19
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,740
we've been mostly focused on the human body, chemical impacts on the human body.

20
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:22,380
What we did talk about animals or like cells, we were talking about those as models of processes in the human body for the most part.

21
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,120
Right. So this is like a whole different ball game in terms of we're bringing in all these different

22
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,210
species and operating at a different scale in our sort of the way we think about these things.

23
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,570
So these are just some of the slides from last time. You know, we talked about how kind of pervasive these problems are.

24
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:46,649
They're global. We talk this is just an illustration of like how we move through these different levels

25
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,740
of biological organization until we can actually even be thinking about the biosphere,

26
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,040
which is every living thing on planet Earth. Right.

27
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,129
And the other sort of we think about this, you know, we've talked about this a little bit before,

28
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,830
but even more so, abiotic processes are going to be something we need to think about in terms of eco toxicology,

29
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,200
how the chemicals are interacting with like the non-living environment with, you know,

30
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,190
the water in lakes, even though it's like lakes are full of living things obviously.

31
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,239
But in terms of how they move through like the different matrices,

32
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:27,450
like whether that be streams or rivers or whether they're going to be taken up into the soil,

33
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,270
etc., just kind of how they're moving throughout the environment.

34
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,600
And that's where like environmental chemistry is going to become a really big component of the SICA toxicology field.

35
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,590
And these are different scales, too.

36
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:46,780
We can think about like specifics about like is the chemical ionized or not, and how is that going to change how it relates to the environment.

37
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,770
We could talk about what phase the chemicals in. Is it dissolved in the water?

38
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:57,099
Is it in the vapor phase or not? Is it what is it like the immediate microenvironment?

39
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:02,200
What are the soil microbes doing if the chemicals found in the soil are doing to the chemical

40
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:09,670
and changing how it moves and on and on up through our different like scales of thought,

41
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,560
if you will, when we consider these different toxicants in the environment.

42
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,389
And then we talked about kind of this one health concept we got into a little bit.

43
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,590
And, you know,

44
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:31,220
this idea that there's a feedback loop in terms of we as humans are changing the environment and then that comes back to to affect us in various ways.

45
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,130
And this brought us into this connection between the ecosystem health and human health.

46
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,480
These are all slides from last time. Um.

47
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,010
Let's see. Yeah. We just thought about the different. You know, we talked a little bit.

48
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,780
A little bit about the different ways that human health can interact with animal health and environmental health.

49
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,540
And we'll talk through a few examples of that later in the lecture.

50
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:04,660
And this one health concept, which is this interdisciplinary integrated understanding of animal, human and environmental health.

51
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:13,880
So. I think this is about where we left off last time.

52
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:20,750
So kind of having that in place when we think about ego toxicology.

53
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:27,120
Again, a lot of the same principles are going to still be at play in terms of exposure routes.

54
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:32,930
Right. So if we think about most organisms, the same exposure routes are really going to be relevant.

55
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:41,389
So whether that's absorption through the skin or in the case of like fish absorption through like the scales on the fish or ingestion,

56
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,080
animals are going to be eating things that are contaminated with a chemical eating

57
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,050
plants or other animals that are contaminated with the chemical or inhalation.

58
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,870
You know, animals breathe the same way. A lot of animals breathe very similarly to the way we do.

59
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:02,030
But there are some unique features of these pathways of toxicant exposure that we need to think about because we're thinking about different species.

60
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,200
And they have different behaviors, obviously different feeding mechanisms.

61
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:14,240
They can vary through different structures. Sometimes they have the dermal contact with the environment can be different.

62
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:21,350
So can we just take a second to brainstorm some real, you know,

63
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,050
kind of we can just talk about some real general ways in which and in terms of thinking about

64
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:32,810
different species of animals might have a distinct rate of exposure compared to people.

65
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:39,440
They don't want to take a crack at that. This is really broad.

66
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:48,230
You can just think about anything that might be different between an animal and a human in terms of exposure to toxicants in the environment.

67
00:06:53,080 --> 00:07:05,440
Any thoughts? I think in like amphibians, there's like dermal exposure might be absorption is different in some ways through the skin.

68
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,560
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the skin itself is going to be different, you know, so that's going to impact, you know,

69
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,420
how the chemicals behave, how much of the chemicals are being uptake in in a frog's a great example,

70
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,649
there are going to be you know there's a different the differences there and just the structure of the skin

71
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:27,190
basically and different like biochemical aspects of the way the skin is formed compared to like a human right.

72
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:32,600
I'm not a frog biologist, so I can't go too deep into that. But yes, that's a really great example.

73
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:48,850
Any anything else? For example, when their use when they petroleum ships, they get all the petroleum into the sea,

74
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:57,940
the fish and all the birds and every every being there is exposed to the petroleum.

75
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:09,910
And they might they have different routes of exposure to the birds from is dermal and feathers and everything and the fish and everything.

76
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,960
They they're mostly they die. Right.

77
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,459
Yeah. I mean, there might be sort of like in cases like you'll see, I think we have some pictures.

78
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,880
You'll see like in the cases of like an oil spill, for example,

79
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:28,420
you might have a completely sort of different this is almost not even talking about toxicity in a way,

80
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:37,299
but like a mechanical like effect on like a fish or a bird is see them clumped up with like, you know, the oil and things.

81
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,050
And they can almost be like a physical impact on their ability.

82
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,890
Obviously, it's impacting their ability to move or just, you know, I mean,

83
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,030
it's almost just it's fairly intuitive that's going to impact the ability of

84
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,530
the of the animal to be able to feed itself and have all kinds of effects.

85
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:58,750
Again, it's not necessarily toxic toxicity that we're talking about there, but it's a different exposure.

86
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,280
Exposure routine, which is chemical, is like interfacing with these animals.

87
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:10,840
Like you see these like birds bogged down with like this, this like this petroleum oil, for example.

88
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:16,209
And typically humans are not going to be like interacting with the oil in that

89
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:20,940
way because it's not spilling directly into our environment for the most part.

90
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:27,070
I mean, there's exceptions, but yeah, that's that's going to be a different thing compared to a human.

91
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:33,190
You might be thinking about things like off gassing of chemical compounds that are in the oil in a nearby residents.

92
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,940
So their their main route of exposure might be through inhalation, for example,

93
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:42,820
or consuming animals that were like seafood that was in the contaminated area.

94
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:48,459
So you have like three sort of distinct routes of exposure there.

95
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:56,260
You know, some of them are going to be are going to be sort of relevant, uh, in like a more traditional toxicology way that we've been talking about.

96
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,940
But there's other impacts of the environment that, that, that are at play there.

97
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,480
So that's a good example as well. Anything else?

98
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,890
It might have multiple high level exposures that humans wouldn't have.

99
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:22,640
So if a rat is ingesting ingesting like pesticides from the food that they might be eating, but then also getting it right.

100
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,450
Yeah. Insecticides and pesticides like from foods that they might be eating,

101
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:34,849
but then also might be like experiencing a chemical exposure because it's a rat trying to, you know, and people are trying to kill it as well.

102
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:40,759
So they might just have multiple different exposures to different compounds that we wouldn't

103
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,730
necessarily have because of the foods that we eat in the environments that we tend to live in.

104
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:54,589
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Like, um, like out of a rat or other, you know, rodents or what have you.

105
00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:02,750
They may be exposed to like pesticides on a crop field or from like drift of those chemicals into like other areas

106
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:10,400
beyond the crop field in a way that in ways that humans would just due to their behavior and where they're found.

107
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,950
And so they may face a different exposure profile than like your typical human.

108
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,360
Right. Yeah, that's another great example. Any others?

109
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:26,250
I feel like you could go on this. I could, like, kill a ton of time just going through all the differences.

110
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:32,790
But I'm open to more discussion if anyone's got any additional ideas, because it's kind of fun to think about.

111
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,210
Okay. Well, those are some really good examples. I've got a few more here.

112
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:49,129
Um, so these are just, you know, this is just unique features of pathways, of exposure that we need to think about for different species.

113
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:53,030
So, you know, distinct feeding mechanisms, they could breathe through different structures.

114
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,260
They have different types of dermal contact with the environment in some cases.

115
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,130
So for like one example, we think of fish, they have kills, right?

116
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,459
Um, that's a pretty, you know, kind of intuitive one.

117
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,390
So we have to think about like the biology of gills and how chemicals in the

118
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,570
water are going to interact with these structures that humans do not have.

119
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:21,020
We can think about like ruminants, right? Like, like cows and deer, etc.

120
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:26,210
These types of animals that have basically different digestive systems than humans.

121
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:32,060
So you're going to have different and I'm not going to go into all the biology and that's not something I expected to know for an exam.

122
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:36,800
But just that there's a difference in terms of how a cow digests its food.

123
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:42,080
Obviously, it's eating different things. It's eating, you know, different types of plants that humans eat.

124
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:49,310
And so there's going to be different factors at play and that may affect how the chemical is distributed within the animal.

125
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,329
You know, the way it's bio transformed or metabolized. Is it going to be?

126
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:58,420
Again, we have to think about what our bodies can do to talk to chemicals that we encounter.

127
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:06,290
They can there most most of them are going to be metabolized in one way or the other and they can be toxic, fired or detoxified.

128
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:11,899
Right. So you may have a different scenario there where one chemical might be toxic by

129
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,310
due to some of the unique properties of these like ruminant digestive systems,

130
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,930
whereas in a human maybe it's detoxified. So some differences there.

131
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,019
We can think about like behaviors, like the way birds like prey digest food and, like, feed them to the young.

132
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,880
You know, that's sort of this different thing that humans typically are not doing.

133
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:37,250
So these are just different like mechanisms that we can think about that are going to be something

134
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:42,090
to consider when we want to understand how chemicals are impacting these different species.

135
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,680
Right. Any questions there?

136
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:53,720
I think it's sort of also a comment, but a lot of animals have like development timelines are much quicker.

137
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,770
Does that happen? Yeah. Like thinking about windows on systems, so.

138
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:08,420
Yeah. That's a really good point. I don't know if we'll get to that per se later, but that's a really good point in terms of for a couple of reasons,

139
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,719
development is a huge issue there because when we're talking about population structures,

140
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,480
if we're impacting anything related to reproduction and development that can really you know,

141
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:27,120
if you're if you're encountering exposure to like a toxic hit during a really sensitive phase of development in a fish population,

142
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,210
for example, that could really affect the population structure of that fish in that contaminated lake, for example.

143
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,060
So so reproductive and development is like really important and it's going to be different for different species.

144
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,960
Um, what is the other one that, that brought to mind?

145
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:49,980
I lost it. But yeah, so that's a really that's a really key factor to consider as well.

146
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,179
Oh, the the abbreviated timeline. Yeah.

147
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:00,930
So like, you know, you may be getting like organogenesis for certain structures happening within a narrow or narrower window.

148
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,580
So if there's some type of, say,

149
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:12,870
really bad chemical spill and you're hitting a bunch of these organisms during this like particularly narrow and sensitive window compared to,

150
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:20,510
you know, with humans, it's kind of a different story in some cases, the way they're really impacting Organogenesis, for example.

151
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,880
So yeah, that's that's a really good point. Okay.

152
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:31,820
And again, like I mentioned, the chemistry is really going to drive where the pollutants end up in the environment.

153
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:42,660
So we can talk about like the speciation of metals and this has a real influence on the bioavailability of the dissolved metals in the environment.

154
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,240
We can think about organic versus inorganic forms of, say, mercury.

155
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:54,890
And when I say organic, I think we've really talked about this before, but organic is what a metal like combines with carbon.

156
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:03,050
Right. So like methylmercury, it's got a carbon group on it, which in the case of Minamata Bay, this really bad disaster,

157
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:10,850
the bacteria in the bay basically transformed this inorganic mercury to organic mercury,

158
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:19,190
which made it much more bioavailable to the humans that were consuming the fish from that lake or start from that bay.

159
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:28,840
And so yeah, so that's really the case is a bit about eBay and we get this transformation to this organic form of the model.

160
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:37,480
It's a really good example of how chemistry is a huge factor in where these, you know, contaminants end up.

161
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:42,579
In this case, it was in people as well as like cats and stuff in that area.

162
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:52,890
But yeah, this is just something that we need to consider and certainly at play when we're thinking about like wildlife and ecological effects, right?

163
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,309
So and then we can think about the ionic state of the chemical number as ionic is going to.

164
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:05,740
It's going to be an an ionic form of a chemical is going to mean that it has a charge like a positive or negative charge,

165
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:16,600
meaning it's going to be less likely to like cross cell membranes that are lipophilic and non-polar of a of like a particular lake or particular soil,

166
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:21,340
for example, could impact whether that chemicals, ionized or not.

167
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,890
And that's going to dictate its its movement through the environment as well.

168
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:35,669
And so as toxicologists we can model pollutant incorporation into various biological systems or whether a

169
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:41,070
compound will be more likely to partition into soil versus water based on some of this chemistry that we know.

170
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:49,140
Right. You could do a I've taken environmental chemistry classes where we, you know, run through scenarios where there's a big spill.

171
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,160
We know the chemical has this log, K or W number, etc.

172
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:59,940
We kind of walk through where we think it's going to partition relative to like the vapor phase versus

173
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:06,450
how much is going to be uptake in into like organic systems or organisms and this type of thing.

174
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:14,880
So. Yeah. Chemistry, obviously a huge, huge, hugely important part of all of this.

175
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,820
So we can also talk about we've mentioned this a couple times.

176
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,320
We've talked about bioaccumulation and bio magnification.

177
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,219
And I will confess, I interchange.

178
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:35,340
I know that I interchange when I talk bioaccumulation and bio magnification, I believe quite a bit.

179
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,950
And I'm not an eco toxicologist, so forgive me for doing that.

180
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:48,530
There are these are different terms, but I tend to just. I think I learned the turbine simulation first, and so I just used that one.

181
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,640
So there are subtle differences that we'll talk about between these different terms.

182
00:18:53,540 --> 00:19:00,019
So bioaccumulation is the accumulation of chemicals in an organism from water,

183
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:07,729
air or soil that occurs when an organism absorbs chemicals at a faster rate than excrete something.

184
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,090
Right. So it's building up in the organism, this chemical.

185
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:20,690
Bio concentration is specific to a water situation where you have, say, fish in a contaminated lake.

186
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:28,550
And so the chemicals disperse throughout the lake and it will end up concentrating in the fish over time.

187
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:34,280
So they're going to start to build up this. So it's kind of a specific form of bioaccumulation.

188
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,650
So that's bio concentration.

189
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:50,240
Bio magnification is when you get increasing concentration of a chemical in the tissues of organisms at higher levels of the food chain.

190
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,690
Right. Well, this can also be called bio amplification.

191
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:02,030
So as you move across different trophic levels or up the food chain, you're getting a concentration of the chemical as you move from,

192
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:13,910
say, an insect organism that's being eaten by a particular fish, for example, and then some, like, say, some type of bird eats the fish.

193
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:20,059
You're getting this concentration as you're moving up those different chains, that chain, that food chain.

194
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:26,420
Right. So I want to ask a question based on what we've talked about so far in the class.

195
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:32,390
What characteristics of a chemical would you predict leads to bio magnification?

196
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,879
What do you think? Sorry for Half-Life long.

197
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,320
Half-Life? Yeah. Tends to stick around. Persistent.

198
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,020
Any other, like chemical like sort of characteristics.

199
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,620
Lipophilic. Lipophilic. Exactly. It's going to accumulate.

200
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,240
The stuff tends to store in fat. It's not going to be something. We excrete through urine very quickly.

201
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:02,520
It tends to store in fat. So lipophilic long half life.

202
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:11,400
Those are really good ones. Anyone have any other thoughts? So let's see here.

203
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:18,760
Substances which have a high potential for by magnification or slowly metabolized would be another good one.

204
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,740
Um, not, you know, it's not gonna be metabolized to some other chemical excreted very fast.

205
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:29,320
So similar to the Law of Half Life, it's basically restating that, um,

206
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:35,080
so slowly metabolized or excreted, highly lipid soluble, slowly broken down in the environment, right?

207
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:42,770
So there are like abiotic processes that can change chemicals in the environment hydrolysis, um, for lysis.

208
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:45,730
So like the sun can like break things down into other compounds.

209
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:52,149
So certain chemicals are like resistant to those types of processes if it's going to be like immediately

210
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:57,160
like hydrolyzed to some other compound once it's put into the water that that's not going to bio magnify.

211
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:01,780
So that's another thing to consider. So that makes sense.

212
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,930
So here's a nice cartoon that illustrates these concepts.

213
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:17,550
So with Bioaccumulation. So this is three fish in a lake that gets some kind of chemical spill.

214
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,600
And they're going to grow up in this lake. Chemical is going to be sticking around and persistent.

215
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:27,270
And as they grow, they're accumulating this chemical as colored here in blue.

216
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:34,710
And they're going to continue they're not excreting the chemical as fast as they're taking it up from the environment.

217
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,500
Right. And then so as they grow, they're going to continue to accumulate this chemical in their bodies over time.

218
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,560
And then bio magnification, uh, is illustrated here.

219
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:58,020
Right. So you have some type of, like, organism that is eaten by fish, but so as organisms contaminated, the fish eat this organism, the.

220
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,920
And so they become contaminated. The seal eats a lot of these fish.

221
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,680
It's lipophilic. So it's like storing the fat of the fish.

222
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,230
SEAL probably loves the taste of like the the fat in the fish that's accumulating in the seal.

223
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,969
And then when we get up to polar bear eating, a lot of seals again magnifying.

224
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,270
So he is eating a lot of these contaminated seals.

225
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:22,229
And so he or she is eating a lot of these contaminated seals.

226
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:26,060
And that's magnified in the polar bear lakes.

227
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,370
That's right. Any questions?

228
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:48,290
Any comments? So you could see like a really sad case of this with a killer whale that was actually named Lulu and that was like near the UK.

229
00:23:49,780 --> 00:24:02,739
So they found this Lulu like washed up and dead on the shore and this whales like really contaminated with PCBs, like really high levels of PCBs.

230
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:09,390
So polychlorinated biphenyls, um, this contaminant we're like, accruing in the tissues of this whale.

231
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:15,250
And so, so we have this like, quote here, the threshold where we think that there is some form of physiological effect

232
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,979
caused by PCBs is around 20 to 40 milligrams per kg stored within the tissue.

233
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:27,520
So that's generally where researchers think there's some kind of like health effect on the animal within that concentration.

234
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:33,190
But Lulu had levels of like close to a thousand milligrams per kilogram of PCBs.

235
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,759
And so this is like one of the most contaminated individuals that they had seen.

236
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,910
This is like highly and so, as you can imagine, similar to the polar bear killer whales kind of eating,

237
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,190
you know, a lot of the similar types of organisms that might be contaminated with PCBs.

238
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:54,370
PCBs are fairly lipophilic. So, you know, you just get this bio magnification up through the food chain.

239
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:01,689
I don't know that they know the specific cause of death in the case of this whale,

240
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:05,920
like whether it was PCBs in and of themselves that caused this to happen.

241
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:11,500
But it certainly wasn't helping matters to be this contaminated with PCBs.

242
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:19,090
So that's a pretty sad case. Pretty sad image there. Um, so.

243
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:29,140
Some of the mechanisms we talk about with toxicology. Again, a lot of this is going to be revealed because it's a lot of the same stuff.

244
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:36,250
A lot of the same mechanisms are at play in eco toxicology as in toxicology.

245
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,090
It's just going to be we're kind of applying it in a slightly different manner.

246
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,300
And the current disruption we've talked a lot about and the current disruption.

247
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,710
So we've seen evidence for action of entities disrupting chemicals,

248
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:56,050
probably more so actually in eco toxicology studies compared to human population studies.

249
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,820
We often see this in like aquatic organisms,

250
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:09,420
like indicators that we're getting some kind of endocrine disruption from chemicals in aquatic environments.

251
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:19,450
So you see things like. As intersex and fish where the sexual differentiation appears to be sort of off,

252
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,769
where the certain fish are expressing both like the sexual characteristics of either sex or

253
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:30,130
something happened in terms of their sexual development in fish exposed to agricultural chemicals.

254
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,760
Right. And we saw this with the Tyrone Hayes case with the frogs exposed to atrazine.

255
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:43,000
He was showing some experiments where frogs frogs exposed to this pesticide appeared to switch sex,

256
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,600
but also had like a another a host of other indicators that something was happening with their endocrine systems.

257
00:26:52,530 --> 00:27:01,260
We've seen things like, you know, to some degree the immune system is so big, the great immune system is regulated by endocrine activity.

258
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:07,440
Right? And so we've seen impacts on immune system functions, particularly in fish in the Shenandoah River.

259
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,590
We've seen like widespread fish kills that are thought to be linked to like

260
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:16,080
these immune system dysfunctions in fish related to environmental contamination.

261
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:24,760
We have another example of this chemical nano phenol, which is a byproduct of detergents.

262
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:30,760
We've seen impacts on breeding behavior in male fish exposed to this chemical,

263
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:38,650
and we see an example of a non monotonic dose response in that case where if you recall what that is,

264
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:43,990
we'll see with an increasing concentration of the chemical, we'll see the response going up.

265
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:49,930
And then at the higher concentrations there's this like inverted U-shape where that response starts to go down again.

266
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:56,440
So it's not this traditional dose response curve where there's a.

267
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,200
Just to make sure, you know,

268
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:11,560
their traditional dose response curve would be looking something like this where your response is going up as your dose goes up.

269
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,950
But with a non monotonic, everyone can see that fairly straightforward.

270
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:23,920
Right, your dose. So this is your response.

271
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,660
You see the shape more like this. You get that inverted view.

272
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:41,800
And can anyone remind me why we see this type of shape of a dose response curve, oftentimes in the case of endocrine disruption?

273
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,129
Do you remember what that sort of specific cellular phenomena is that we think kind

274
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:52,510
of underlies why we often see that type of response and the kind of disruption?

275
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,910
So like a downregulation of receptors at high levels.

276
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:11,269
Yes, exactly. So remember, hormones act by binding to receptors that trigger gene expression changes in a

277
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:17,780
cell and the cells have to express that receptor for this mechanism to be active.

278
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,540
And what happens? We think this happens, you know, a lot of different cases we've looked at,

279
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:31,790
whereas as you're increasing the dose of the chemical, the cells start to decrease their expression of those receptors.

280
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:36,560
They stop expressing as many or stop expressing those receptors altogether.

281
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:43,370
And so the hormone is not able to basically act to this mechanism and cause these changes in the cell.

282
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:51,560
So there's this you basically don't have the cell stops expressing the machinery you need to activate these hormone pathways.

283
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:57,709
And so that's that's what we think is going on with with a good number of these kind of

284
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:03,500
U-shaped inverted U-shaped dose response curves we see with endocrine disrupting chemicals.

285
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:11,550
Does that make sense? We saw it with uterine fibroids, I believe with bisphenol A in rats.

286
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:18,730
They had that same type of dose response. Okay.

287
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:32,950
And really well-studied, you know, sort of mechanism of endocrine disruption is estrogen signaling.

288
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:40,720
So we see chemicals and drugs can serve as either agonist, meaning they activate the estrogen receptor or antagonist,

289
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,430
meaning they block the activation of the estrogen receptor.

290
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:59,230
We call these xeno estrogens so they can activate this estrogen receptor transcriptional activity so that they like the estrogen like estradiol.

291
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,900
The main estrogen can activate this gene, these gene expression changes that occur.

292
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,500
Yeah. That are that are regulated by the estrogen receptor.

293
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:18,920
So we have lots of examples of chemicals that do this and to some degree a lot of chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides like DDT,

294
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:25,300
the toxin claw surfactants like nano phenol, PCBs, a lot of PCBs will do this.

295
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:32,900
This phenol a has some degree of estrogenic activity. Um, and then like synthetic estrogen, like ethyl ester diol.

296
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,040
And this is just to kind of remind you what that mechanism looks like.

297
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:47,300
So the estrogen will be all taken by the cell and go all the way into the nucleus of the cell,

298
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:53,320
bind to the estrogen receptor, and you actually form what's called a dimer hormone dimer here.

299
00:31:53,330 --> 00:32:04,940
So it's like two halves of the estrogen receptor kind of link up and then basically sit down on the a certain part of the DNA and

300
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:12,380
activate a transcription factor which tells the cell to start expressing all types of genes that are translated into proteins that,

301
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:19,700
you know, do all kinds of different jobs within the cell. Right. We've talked about this before, but it's a nice to have you here.

302
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:35,160
So in terms of eco toxicology, there is something we can use as kind of a biomarker of estrogenic activity within a contaminated area.

303
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:40,380
So angling vertebrates produce this substance.

304
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:52,010
It's like a protein, like a protein type of compound called Vitello, Genet or BTG.

305
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:58,380
I'll just call it BTG, which is normally produced in the female liver and it's a constituent of yolk.

306
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:04,680
So it's part of the reproductive processes in like female reproduction, right?

307
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:15,700
This is expression of this is regulated by the estrogen receptor and males don't usually make DTG.

308
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,200
Although they can. They have the machinery in place to do it.

309
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,349
They just don't typically do it in a lot of it.

310
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:30,830
A lot of that is because this process is regulated by estrogen signaling, which is at much lower levels in a male compared to a female.

311
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,430
However, when we get the presence of West Janet compounds in a lake or a pond or a stream.

312
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:43,969
If we take some samples of animals living or, you know, of vertebrates like that,

313
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:48,049
live in that powder stream and look at the liver, we can start to detect this.

314
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:58,300
VG In the liver. So this is like a readout of exposure or a biomarker of exposure to some kind of energetic chemical.

315
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:02,680
It doesn't tell you which epigenetic chemical, but it tells you that something's going on here.

316
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:09,480
And so we see this like in fish living downstream of like paper mills that might be, you know,

317
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,220
dumping stuff into bodies of water nearby, bodies of warm water or other types of like manufac chemical manufacturers.

318
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,740
Right. So this is like a really handy thing.

319
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:28,080
We don't have this for like every mechanism, but this is kind of a really important biomarker that we can use of exposure.

320
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:34,740
So again, I'm not going to tell you which is the generic compound, you know, could be multiple ones,

321
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:38,939
but it's going to tell you that something's happening that is like interfering

322
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:43,620
with the hormonal signaling of the that wildlife population in that area.

323
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:55,390
Does that make sense? We also have like chemicals can activate.

324
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:02,130
We've talked a little bit about the aryl hydrocarbon receptor of this receptor kind of acts.

325
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,730
It's something that's called an orphan receptor because there's not really well characterized endogenous ligands.

326
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:13,250
So estrogen, the estrogen receptor is activated by endogenous hormones in our bodies.

327
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:21,050
The hydrocarbon receptor is activated by different chemicals, but not really any endogenous chemicals.

328
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:25,670
It sort of acts as a sensor of the internal and external environment.

329
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:32,930
So we're exposed to some external chemical of either, you know, either if exposed to a chemical externally or internally,

330
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,400
it can talk with this receptor and cause changes within the cell.

331
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,130
That may be a little bit oversimplified.

332
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:50,030
More recent research has identified a couple of potential candidates for endogenous activators of this receptor,

333
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:54,709
but that for a long time, you know, the research is always ongoing.

334
00:35:54,710 --> 00:36:01,880
So for a long time, it was it was thought to have no endogenous ligands or things that bind to it.

335
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:15,200
Right. So anyway, yeah, so this this receptor regulates genes involved in like metabolizing, uh, and exogenous chemicals.

336
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:20,780
So things like the cytochrome p450 is in the final transfer cases that we talked about.

337
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,770
So a lot of chemicals will activate this receptor.

338
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:33,210
Some examples include these like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, some types of PCBs, these dioxin compounds.

339
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:41,880
When you see a lot of these like ring structures here, that's a good candidate for activating the general hydrocarbon receptor.

340
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:57,940
Okay. So and so another thing we've talked about in this class, a good amount is oxidative stress impacting and again, more in the human context.

341
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:02,440
But oxidative stress is of course relevant in animals as well.

342
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,190
So this can cause some of the same problems we've talked about, like lipid peroxidation,

343
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:12,819
disrupting lipid structures, disrupting like protein, chemical structures, damaging DNA.

344
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:17,320
All of that is at play when we're talking about other species, just like it is with humans.

345
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:23,010
You know, we know that these are links to chronic diseases and people.

346
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:32,530
We know, like relatively less in terms of how this works in many like wildlife species because they haven't been studied as much.

347
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:37,450
But certainly it stands to reason that a lot of the same factors are going to be in play there.

348
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:42,860
Right. Well, I think that's kind of interesting is, you know,

349
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:49,740
something that I don't think about a lot as a toxicologist, but, um, oxidative stress is even at play.

350
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,360
We're talking about plants like for it.

351
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:57,629
So it's thought to drive some of the forest dieback that we've seen related to like industrial runoff and things.

352
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:06,240
So we can't even think about it in terms of effects on tree species or plant species in relation to this, uh, oxidative stress mechanism.

353
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:12,440
It's we've seen like. Kind of in the spirit of like one health.

354
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,730
I think that's like a really good example of like this one health concept where these

355
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,070
researchers are looking at integrated effects of air pollution and climate change on forest.

356
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:29,360
So like really big scale and thinking about both like climate change impacts combined with like pollution.

357
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,840
What, what does that going to mean for a species of fur like forests?

358
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:35,180
Right.

359
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:45,110
So this is a really good example of taking like climate modeling along with some of the probably like molecular biology associated with air pollution

360
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:53,660
effects in terms of their impacts on these forests together in order to understand the ecological impacts and the impacts for human health.

361
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,410
So I think that's like a very one health type of study that was done here.

362
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,500
I'll take a quick check and see if anyone has any questions or comments.

363
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,440
Thoughts. Okay.

364
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:18,830
Keep marching through here. DNA damage.

365
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:26,000
Of course, you know, we're talking about damaging DNA of any organism where there is the potential for multigenerational effects.

366
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:35,310
You know, that DNA damage that that damaged gene may be like passed down from one generation to the next,

367
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:40,910
that it might get inherited effects which can alter the population structure similar to the comment we had over here.

368
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,840
And again, we talk about various types.

369
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:52,500
If you go back to I think we this is mostly in the Carcinogenesis lecture, but it might be in the mechanisms lecture as well.

370
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,680
But for example, types of DNA damage,

371
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:06,750
breaking the strands of DNA attacks like binding to the DNA and oxidative stress types of damage are all, again, relevant here as well.

372
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:15,720
Let's see. So we've seen that like Bronco.

373
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,150
So one of the things to think about is like effects on like oncogene.

374
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:25,510
I don't know if we've used the term oncogene in this class so far, but we kind of like sort of hinted at it.

375
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:30,249
But an oncogene is a gene that under certain circumstances can turn a cell into a tumor cell.

376
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:34,149
So, you know, we do see instances of cancer in wildlife.

377
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:39,250
So the impacts are like activation of oncogene is turning them into like cancers.

378
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:46,990
Turning on like cancerous genes is obviously another mechanism that would be a play in terms of impacts on wildlife.

379
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:56,470
See. Sorry about that.

380
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:06,450
Yeah. So this kind of goes back to what we were talking about in terms of like large scale effects on organisms.

381
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:12,749
So we see examples with like oil spills or, you know, mining processes, pesticide runoff.

382
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:19,800
We see examples of like die out like big die offs of populations, animal populations.

383
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:25,380
We can see in fish and we can see fish die offs with like hypoxia.

384
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:32,220
So like low oxygen in the water due to overgrowth of other types of chemicals or

385
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:37,230
certain other types of organisms like phytoplankton when we get like nutrient runoff.

386
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,889
So you're getting like overgrowth of one type of organism that essentially is like altering the

387
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:46,950
environment and making it less suitable for another species that might be in that same location.

388
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:56,360
And we we've kind of already talked about this a good amount.

389
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:03,250
But remember, this reproductive and developmental toxicity was sort of brought to mind, especially in wildlife.

390
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,510
This is kind of like where we first started seeing these effects was with Rachel Carson's book, Silent Spring.

391
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:18,650
So we saw Rachel Carson documented things like bird eggshell, thinning in polluted areas and talked about population crashes of certain species.

392
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,940
And a lot of this was at the time linked to like DDT contamination.

393
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,880
Again, this is like the early sixties.

394
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:35,540
And we see this with like certain types of species appear to be like, you know, distinctly susceptible to reproductive effects.

395
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:45,500
Like there are species of alligators in Florida that with endocrine disrupting chemicals have shown like pretty severe reproductive impacts,

396
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:51,530
such as like feminization and failure to reproduce these types of effects.

397
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:51,800
Right.

398
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:05,330
Back in the fifties and sixties, we've seen population crashes of lake trout lake to developmental toxicity of a group of chemicals called dioxins.

399
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,209
And again, this goes we kind of again, already sort of touched on this.

400
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:15,550
But embryonic development is sensitive to certain chemicals that may impact like organogenesis.

401
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:22,180
So, for example, cardiac development, development of the heart for chemicals, disrupting the development of the heart.

402
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:26,739
That's obviously going to happen at an early stage and a really embryonic stage that's

403
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,700
obviously potentially going to severely impact the population of that species,

404
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:37,740
which. We've also seen that these dramatic hydrocarbons.

405
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,090
Profound developmental effects and like some species of fish.

406
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:46,180
So like malformed hearts, chronic facial abnormalities, etc.

407
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:54,569
So again, this organic genesis we talked about like in the Developmental Talks lecture, how, you know, when these organs are developing,

408
00:43:54,570 --> 00:44:01,440
they're like uniquely susceptible to toxic toxicants, basically knocking them off track in terms of developing these organs.

409
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:14,340
Another big one to consider was eco toxicology being sort of end point to think about our behavioral alterations.

410
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,810
So animals behave in certain manners that make them fit for their environment.

411
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:28,430
And sort of subtle effects in animal behavior could have potentially large impacts on the population as a whole.

412
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:36,270
So we're talking about like feeding behavior, reproductive behavior, behavior when they encounter like a predator, for example.

413
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:42,210
This is like a big deal for, you know, an animal in the wild, right?

414
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:50,070
So any chemical that might you know, we're usually probably thinking in this case neuro toxicants.

415
00:44:50,690 --> 00:45:01,159
So something is going on with the neurobiology of of the animal, you know, chemicals causing changes in mating and reproduction or foraging behavior,

416
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:08,870
the ability to find food in their environment against predator prey interactions, you know,

417
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:17,329
some some types of species may have of may avoid contaminated areas for whatever reason.

418
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:23,840
They somehow sense that it's a contaminated area and move to a different body of water or,

419
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:28,520
you know, a different part of the forest, for example, that's not contaminated.

420
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:34,400
Contaminated. And they may be less suited to basically thrive in that environment.

421
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,730
So it can like alter population structures in that way.

422
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:43,459
There's other types, the types of animals that actually thrive in contaminated areas.

423
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:47,900
They've evolved some kind of resistance to a particular mechanism of toxicity.

424
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:53,510
We can kind of see this in some cases. It's kind of fascinating to see this like evolution in real time, if you will,

425
00:45:53,780 --> 00:46:00,740
where certain like species of fish have developed over generations, like a resistance to a certain type of toxicant.

426
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:06,410
And so they'll do very well in a particular environment. And so, again, you're altering the population structure in that way.

427
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:16,489
Does that make sense? And again, this is this type of behavioral change.

428
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:21,140
These types of behavioral changes are often linked to neurotoxic exposures.

429
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:30,230
So, for instance, like Diana and this OP pesticide has effects on salmon alarm and homing responses.

430
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:36,050
So again, the ability to find food or the ability to like, get the heck out of there if there's a predator in the area.

431
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:45,350
I have a in my cohort in grad school, my friend Chase did research on I believe it was salmon.

432
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:51,110
I would have to double check with him, but he did these experiments with fish, eco toxic toxicity,

433
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:56,510
where essentially what he would do is like take a bunch of like essentially like

434
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:02,030
chopped up salmon tissue and like put it in like a tank with other salmon in it.

435
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:08,299
And what they're supposed to do is sense that the there is probably a predator nearby because

436
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:13,910
there's a bunch of like salmon debris nearby and there's certain mechanisms that tell it like,

437
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:20,360
I need to get the heck out of here. And so he is finding with certain types of chemicals, I forget exactly what chemicals he was studying,

438
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:25,040
but this ability to like sense that that there's danger nearby was dampened.

439
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:30,320
And like they're basically just like measuring how fast they got the heck out of there.

440
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:35,929
More or less. I'm certain I'm completely butchering like what he actually did for his dissertation.

441
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:43,309
But I think I'm hitting the main points of what I'm talking about, this like alteration of like behavior within their environment.

442
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:50,299
Right. Does that make sense? Yeah.

443
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:57,320
So that, again, pesticides, we see this with the metals, too. I believe that's what I was looking at was like cadmium as a contaminant.

444
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:00,830
So out there in Seattle, like, salmon is like a really big deal.

445
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:05,540
So there's a lot of research in that area. Yeah.

446
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:09,890
So we have like certain metals can alter like in zebrafish schooling and predator avoidance,

447
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:16,690
like the way they behave in groups like impacts on like memory formation,

448
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:22,780
you know, like, and we can link this back to like molecular impacts on like brain proteins and things like that.

449
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:27,320
So pretty fascinating stuff. Very, yeah.

450
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:30,620
If you can get into this field, it's like, I don't know. I think it's really cool,

451
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:40,280
especially the ways that they can they can think of these like clever ways to measure some of these behaviors or molecular impacts, like in the lab.

452
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:46,950
Oh, this is I thought this was going to be closer to the other slide in any of that.

453
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:57,880
So cancer is an issue with wildlife. We see cancer in polluted areas like higher rates of cancer of animals like humans.

454
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:03,360
This is often associated with like older age. And for that, well, okay.

455
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:10,469
So in wildlife we see cancer pollution like associated pollution linked to

456
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:16,799
cancer typically like when animals are of a higher age and this is thought to,

457
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:25,710
um, this mechanism is actually thought to not seriously impact or be unlikely to seriously impact the population structure.

458
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:33,170
And does anyone have any thoughts on why that might be? For this particular case with cancer.

459
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,830
Past that are reconnected. Sorry. It's past their reproductive.

460
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:44,340
Exactly. So they've already, like, reproduced by this time.

461
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:52,470
So, you know, in terms of like the overall population structure, if it's not impacting the reproductive fitness, you might not see.

462
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:56,520
Probably you're unlikely to see an effect. So they've already reproduced.

463
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:01,049
Um, it's not good for the individual animals that are getting cancer later, obviously,

464
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:09,180
but this is just kind of a, a sort of nuanced thing to think about in terms of these different health outcomes.

465
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:15,900
So in terms of eco toxicology, this cancer endpoint in some cases might not be as relevant as some of the other stuff we've talked about.

466
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:28,259
Um, yeah. So we see like different types of animals are going to be differently susceptible to cancer related,

467
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:34,229
related to kind of like various things of various aspects of their behavior, like where they're found in the environment.

468
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:37,860
We see like bottom dwelling fish where, you know,

469
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,200
maybe a lot of the chemicals have kind of accumulated at the bottom of the bottoms of streams and things.

470
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:48,940
Um. Yeah, so some examples of the major classes of chemicals associated with cancer.

471
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:53,110
So here we see a lot of this with fish.

472
00:50:53,530 --> 00:51:02,820
Um. And so, you know, we we don't have a great idea of like differential susceptibility to carcinogens across all the species, but.

473
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:11,270
We have seen a good amount with fish. Probably just because there's a lot of contaminated waterways in the world.

474
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,080
Okay. I'm going to try to speed through these. We'll see how I do.

475
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:26,400
This is an example of how the population structure of a particular area can be impacted by exposure to a contaminant.

476
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:34,780
So you have basically the number of species and this is the number of individuals within that species at different.

477
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:43,820
So, for instance, you would have. Say just a few species with like one or two individuals.

478
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:48,040
And then, you know, a lot of species are going to have between eight and 16 individuals.

479
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:53,570
Right. So the big takeaway from this is in the exposed area as illustrated here,

480
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:59,380
you're basically suppressing the total number of species but other other types of species that are thriving.

481
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:08,870
So you're kind of pushing things away from like that biodiversity and more towards like only certain types of species are doing very well either.

482
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:14,210
Like reproducing a lot, like thriving in that area is basically kind of what you're seeing here.

483
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:21,620
You're tending to lower the mode of the species abundance curve leading to highly abundant species and less diversity.

484
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:31,950
This slide is basically kind of just talking through another way to illustrate kind of the same

485
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:37,799
sort of concept that talked about where when we get to when we're talking about eco toxicology,

486
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:43,350
we move across like different domains such as molecular effects,

487
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:53,940
email, immunological effects, physiological effects moving on up to like where we're thinking about like lots of individual organisms,

488
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,010
like a population or a community of a particular organism.

489
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:04,680
And so to some degree,

490
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:14,280
so you're going to see like a linkage between the type of sort of domain that you're investigating and how quickly you're going to see that response.

491
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:20,760
So, for example, if you're looking at PCB contamination, we can see the effects of PCBs on like, say,

492
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:27,270
causing DNA damage, like in one setting maybe that we could do probably in a 24 hour time period,

493
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:33,810
whereas in a contaminated link, the time to effect that we're going to observe,

494
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:38,340
you know, in a particular community of fish is going to be a longer time period.

495
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:44,140
It's not going to happen right away. So. Yeah.

496
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:52,280
And this is also like. And so this axis is talking with the mechanistic relevance to like a molecular mechanism is very mechanistically relevant.

497
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:58,460
Um, these changes in community structures aren't necessarily going to be telling you much about the mechanism of toxicity.

498
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,880
It's more of a just kind of an ecological effect.

499
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:07,830
So there's kind of this tradeoff between how quickly we can see a response and then, um,

500
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:12,680
but we might not know what's actually happening at the ecological level until much later.

501
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,680
We will be able to observe that like right away. Right?

502
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:22,890
Kind of makes intuitive sense. Okay.

503
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,260
If you try to make it through, I think I could do it.

504
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:35,660
So for toxicity tests, you know, you could imagine that there's multiple like model organisms that we use,

505
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:43,130
sort of species that we think are representative of like really important, uh, processes within an ecological system.

506
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,989
So we can test these effects on, you know, individual ecological components.

507
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:52,910
And so you have some examples here like zebrafish are pretty common model worms.

508
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:57,349
Some people, you know, things get a little bit more interesting.

509
00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:00,890
Some researchers do work with like, say, quail, for example.

510
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:07,069
And so there's different you just need to understand sort of the ecological importance of why you're doing that research.

511
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:10,700
And I'm not an ecologist, so I can't really speak to that in a lot of depth.

512
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:17,270
But obviously it's sort of implied if you get toxicology that you're going to be looking at a wider

513
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:23,690
array of test species than just what we what we tend to use in terms of like human toxicology,

514
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:30,740
where we basically are relying on like. Rats, mice, rabbits, these types of things.

515
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:38,360
Yeah. So we try to, you know, understand like aquatic organisms, avian organisms that like terrestrial organisms.

516
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:49,200
And so we're thinking about things like, you know, just death is this chemical like killing these animals.

517
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,060
Does it affect their ability to reproduce? Does it cause cancer?

518
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:56,340
You know, all the things that we talked about and then we want to understand the dose response.

519
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:04,150
There's ways that you can set up even more like elaborate tasks and people get really creative with this

520
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:10,389
where you're trying to set up like small sort of ecosystems within the lab or in certain test sites.

521
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:14,290
And we have some examples here like like a microcosm,

522
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:22,870
a simulated field experiment where you're creating like an artificial habitat, like a pond or a stream, or you can even,

523
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:27,279
like go out into the field and study things in the field, measure effects, you know,

524
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:34,089
in measure levels of chemicals like in actual wild animals, depending on how you designed your study.

525
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:38,170
So there's different scales that you can use and you've got toxicology that we tend to not use in the.

526
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:42,370
Normal talks are the typical toxicology world, right?

527
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:48,120
And this is going to get more complicated. The more factors are introducing.

528
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:58,139
Like in my lab, I am like cells, animals occasionally like rats and tissues like it's all very controlled and very simplistic

529
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:02,100
compared to what you're going to be setting up with one of these types of experiments.

530
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:11,430
I don't want to say simplistic, but, you know, there's less variables to think about in terms of like how you would design these types of experiments.

531
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:22,120
So he has these examples of like, you know, these studies that are done like across multiple countries.

532
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:27,920
So like country specific effects of neonicotinoid pesticides on bees in the wild,

533
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:34,940
seeing effects on like the queen population and these different populations of bees and like reproductive cells.

534
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,069
And we're looking at different sites.

535
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:46,070
You know, you can see like just the geographical span of the study was like much bigger than a lot of studies that we have talked about so far.

536
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:56,110
Yeah. And we can even think bigger than that. We can talk about global impacts so we can leverage technologies.

537
00:57:56,110 --> 00:58:00,190
You know, we've got so much going on in terms of like NASA's NASA's monitoring,

538
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:05,350
like temperatures around the world of ocean currents, etc., satellite imagery.

539
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:10,170
We can leverage some of that to help us understand how the environment is changing, um,

540
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:18,909
and how this might influence population movements and how that might, may interface with the movement of toxicants in the environment, etc.

541
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:25,060
So you can get to like really big scales of the scientists that really work on these huge scales compared to what I work on,

542
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:30,849
which is largely like one or two sets of organs related to reproduction.

543
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:38,330
So. Pretty cool. This is like modeling particulate matter movement.

544
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:45,800
And we're going to talk more about ecological risk assessment.

545
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:54,209
So we want to use this information to support decision making for, you know,

546
00:58:54,210 --> 00:59:01,410
the best way to use these chemicals that are going to be most beneficial to humans and the environment ideally.

547
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:11,160
So you can imagine how sort of involve the skids where like chemicals that are widely dispersed, you know,

548
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:18,540
you're going to you're going to be required to model the movement of these chemicals across a variety of landscapes and,

549
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:28,320
you know, across the air potentially or across waterways, even the global scale, depending on what type of research question you're asking.

550
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:34,250
You're going to be incorporating temporal and spatial variations.

551
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:38,719
You want to understand toxicant sources, transport pathways, etc.,

552
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:45,140
so that it's just a lot to bring in in terms of understanding this and putting eco toxicology studies in into the

553
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:50,330
decision making framework or the assessing of the risk of these chemicals being released into the environment.

554
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:57,799
And ideally we want to come up with like an explicit statement of how risky it is

555
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,840
or what the probability of having an adverse effect on whatever you're looking at.

556
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:11,809
So what's the probability that if we allow X amount of release of this chemical into the environment,

557
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:17,540
that we're going to adversely impact the population of fish in?

558
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:26,980
Michigan, for example. So we want to really, you know, directly apply this to some kind of decision making that stakeholders are going to be,

559
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:31,180
you know, some type of decision that stakeholders are going to be making.

560
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:42,410
And so this is just walking through the steps of, you know, formatting, formulating the problem, making a plan with,

561
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:49,040
you know, the various interested parties come up with like a conceptual model and an analysis plan.

562
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:58,799
And then characterizing like the exposure, what what organisms are going to be like the receptor for this chemical in the environment,

563
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:06,780
what types of effects are we going to analyze and then eventually characterize the risk of releasing this chemical or,

564
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:14,970
you know, whatever question you're asking, what type of risk is presented in terms of you could toxicological impacts?

565
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:19,950
And then you'll follow up with risk communication and risk management.

566
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:24,660
Right. And we're going to talk about the whole risk assessment process more in a later lecture.

567
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:31,830
But you can see like the types of things that would need to be considered at each of these steps, like ecosystem qualities,

568
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:37,680
receptor qualities, like what are the what types of organisms are potentially going to be impacted by that chemical?

569
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:46,410
How are they going to be exposed? What's the sort of dose response of the stress response profile of these organisms to this chemical?

570
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:52,120
And on down. Yeah.

571
01:01:52,120 --> 01:02:02,469
So we've really hit on like a lot of different issues and potential, you know, the things that one could study in the field of ego toxicology.

572
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:06,280
And here's just some more examples of like wildfires.

573
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:12,379
Right now we're seeing like this concern about like climate change leading to more frequent wildfires.

574
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:18,370
And then sometimes we use flame retardants to help fight these wildfires.

575
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:25,930
And so what does that do in an eco toxicological from a eco toxicological standpoint to the environment in that area?

576
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:34,809
Um, you know, continuing, you know, we're continuingly continually having issues with like oil spills for example and trying to understand

577
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:43,840
how that's impacting the environment and other species including humans but other species as well,

578
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:55,329
etc. So, you know, we just have multiple. You could spend a whole class period talking about the various research questions or like public

579
01:02:55,330 --> 01:03:01,420
health issues that are covered by this eco toxicant eco toxicology field kind of broadly speaking.

580
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,300
So you can go to the Sea-Tac website to learn more.

581
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:16,530
If anyone's really interested, you could toxicology as a field. I think that will be it actually made that a little bit early, so that was a lot.

582
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:21,540
Does anyone have any questions, anything that we could go back and like go over again?

583
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:28,430
It's a really big film. There's a lot to kind of consider here, so hopefully that all made sense.

584
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,980
It seemed like everyone was following. But any questions or comments?

585
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:42,710
Ron Good. I was curious. You mentioned that sometimes animals are like stay away from areas that are contaminated.

586
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:46,780
Do we know why? Like how they know? Like, how do they sense that?

587
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,550
Yeah, I don't I mean, I think it's probably it'd depend on the species.

588
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:54,280
I'd have to look into that a little bit more. I would imagine that there's certain types of like.

589
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:03,400
Either sensors that they, you know, just sort of like. They're like detecting some kind of.

590
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,290
Either. Like a.

591
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:14,480
A taste or smell depending, you know, again, depending on the species that that they just don't like or trigger some kind of adverse response.

592
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:16,350
But yeah, I'd have to look into that a little bit more.

593
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:26,129
I'm more familiar with the concept of certain animals that could thrive in like contaminated areas, but it stands to reason that,

594
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:34,740
you know, there might be sort of activation of certain like sort of like fight or flight type of pathways with exposure.

595
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,040
It kind of goes it's kind of the opposite of the effect, you see with, like,

596
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:42,780
um, with the cases of fish where like the dangerous senses being like blunted.

597
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:48,150
So it stands to reason that you'd have certain chemicals that might go the other way and like overstimulate them.

598
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:56,470
But yeah, I'd have to look into that a little bit more. It's a good question. So that's.

599
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:10,580
Okay. Well, if anyone wants to stick around and ask any like one on one questions related to the projects, I'll just hang out here for a minute.

600
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:13,640
But other than that, we'll come back for more.

601
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:24,920
I believe it's food toxicology on Monday and then they can try to get me your paper topics, uh, by the end of the day today.

602
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,620
You know, they can.
