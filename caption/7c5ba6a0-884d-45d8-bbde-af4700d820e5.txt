1
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:13,530
So I think we will. Last time we stopped laughing and we stopped.

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:21,120
You know, we finished this, I think. Okay, well, we will start from here.

3
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,640
So but let's get very quickly respond to what we are doing as examples.

4
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:36,210
This is an example where we treat it as BP, as the response and a birth weight and age as to covariates.

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,600
And so we are building a regression model and we have seen the results,

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,710
the our approach that has only me facts and also has a direction interaction between age and birth weight.

7
00:00:51,240 --> 00:01:00,360
So now let's take a look at another, another important thing that is are centering public covariance.

8
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,300
So we have seen this in previous model to center experience.

9
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,200
This is all previous of when we talk about Central,

10
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:16,020
it helped to make a prediction of the intercept because we saw out in the interpretation of intercept,

11
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:24,060
that is when uncle barriers are equal to zero, but local quantities are equal to zero, then they correspond to a scenario that doesn't make sense.

12
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,230
For example, well interpreted intercept. Well what what?

13
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,509
What does mean by age equal to zero? What does it mean by way zero does not make much sense.

14
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:40,590
So previous we use all we central covariates to interpret where to have a better integration of intercept.

15
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,990
Now with the interaction,

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:53,360
we will see that it also help with the interpretation of the main facts of having direct interaction so central to the coverage.

17
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:01,350
Now before we look at this, I think it helps. So although the slides actually we put this at the very end of the slides here,

18
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,270
but I think it's is better if we go over this first and then look at a hard example.

19
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:13,169
So here viewers see that while we shift the covariates in the main facts model.

20
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,500
So this is our main fact model.

21
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,390
So interactions with too many facts. All next, the events of facts.

22
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,180
Now, if we shift the whole narratives by ship, including errors,

23
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:35,580
we mean that we define x one star to be x one star minus some causal eight and as to start with the x two minus obviously.

24
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,140
And of course centering of the covariates is just a special case of this.

25
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:50,920
And if you said if you center the covariance, that means by taking a to be the mean of x one and taking B to within the myth of X,

26
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:58,110
that's that's what we mean by center the covariate. So here we are looking at a slightly more generous, narrow with arbitrary and arbitrary b.

27
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,460
Okay. It's actually the slides they're supposed to be.

28
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:16,570
So this is not confusing. Not showing enough in the slides launch.

29
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,210
So let's look at this slide over here.

30
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:28,030
So. Okay, so after we shift this covariance and then.

31
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:38,980
Well, I don't know why they used that one now. If we rated as if we use x, one has to let's say the parameters are theta zero beta 1 minutes.

32
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:45,310
Now if we use x one star, extra star, now we use beta zero, start beta one star beta two stars.

33
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:55,270
And you know the corresponding revisions right now if we replace this x one star, actual star by the x one minus x two minus eight.

34
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,860
And then if we take a look at if we compare the regression coefficients here,

35
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:10,540
our interest is to see whether these which ones stay the same, which one after the change, after we shift the coverage.

36
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:17,049
And you can compare, I mean, the potatoes and beta stars in different ways.

37
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,170
And of course, here this is being around for the next one.

38
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,379
And so this is linear, founded on X flags to support other functions.

39
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,630
One way is to just look at the closure of polynomial to compare.

40
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,650
Another way is to take a derivative to compare of five.

41
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:40,870
But the, the, the, the point that we are trying to make is that if you compare the beta starts to betas,

42
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,210
in the end we realize that beta one star is the same as beta one.

43
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,280
Being a two star is the same as stated by the beta zero star.

44
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,339
The Intercept now ships o because as we mentioned,

45
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:09,880
The Intercept and for example if you look at the data to the intercept is interpreted as the average Y when both X was actually zero.

46
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,840
That's how we interpret that. Intersection.

47
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:24,580
But what we see in the corner is not a zero star that's interpreted that 1x1 minus eight equals or F1 eight for extra equality.

48
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:30,070
And so, of course, when the beta zero star and beta zero,

49
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:40,360
they are very likely different because they are interpreted and this is interpreted as X1 equal to age, but this is interpreted as X1 equal to zero.

50
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,240
So the two intercepts will change.

51
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:57,790
This is at x one go to as I was trying to repeat or this is x y equals zero zero, but a beta one star is equal to beta one.

52
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:08,110
This is also easy, very intuitive because both beta one and beta one star just quantified the effect of x one of x one.

53
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:17,140
So when y you increase in x one, we see beta one increase in in, in the expansion of Y.

54
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,570
So, so the shifting of X one really doesn't change this effect.

55
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,520
Whether you look at X, Y or Z, equal to zero does matter.

56
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:36,159
So as long as S one increased by one unit, then the expansion of Y will increase by beta one for vitamin D.

57
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:45,080
So this two should be the same. So this is not the main facsimile of x model again.

58
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,780
So by shooting in the covariates, only the intercept will change.

59
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:58,140
The two main facts will stay the same. But if we look at the interaction model again, let's use the most commonly slice.

60
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:05,620
So if the model include interaction and then if we shift in covariance.

61
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:18,150
Then if we again, if we do use the star beta stars to denote the new covariance when we use the simulated covariates,

62
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,980
and then if we just simply replace the shape of the covariates by how we are defined.

63
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:33,630
Right? And then if we compare, if we compare these patients to the original while the beta stars to the original patients.

64
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,840
And again, while there are different ways of doing the comparison, I mean, you can take the,

65
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,120
you know, compare the coefficients on the x1x2 and now you have a direction x1 that.

66
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,410
So this is again a polynomial function. Excellent, excellent.

67
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:53,130
So we can you can compare the two coefficients to see when we are equal, when they are not.

68
00:07:53,730 --> 00:08:02,850
And then we realize that in this case only the interaction term will be the same, only they gradually will be the same.

69
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:11,550
But the intercepts will be different, the, the fatal one will be different and the beta two will be different.

70
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,800
Only the interaction, the colonies for the interaction is staying the same.

71
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,400
Again, here, this is just some mathematical detail here.

72
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:26,579
Checks this by taking 13 thing. We don't have to really go through the mass in our lecture.

73
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,070
This is really the main point.

74
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:41,700
But if by comparing this by comparing this expression to this interaction and if we look at how the beta stars in beta is how they are connected,

75
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:54,809
we realize that only that means only the interaction, only the beta three and a beta three star are the same for the other bands and beta stars.

76
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,650
They are different after receiving the covariates. Okay.

77
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:05,260
So this is the fuel slice. Yeah.

78
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,280
Maybe we talk about this last before we go back to the example.

79
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:15,910
So the conclusion is that now if we have a model that includes a driver,

80
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,750
then the interaction coefficients using our multi-agent speed of three and the three star.

81
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:31,090
The interaction collision does not depend on shifting or sentry, but all the other covariates that will change.

82
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,630
If you shift to the covariates or if you center the corporates.

83
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:43,300
So in other words, in the model with the interaction now what we interpreted the main effects, we have to be very careful.

84
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:52,650
So by May, in fact, we mean. We mean Peter one star and Peter to star.

85
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:01,320
Right. So in the original model, if there is no Corvette or shooting or entry, this is the main fact.

86
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:08,810
These are the two main events were excellent. That's true. But Peter, three is the cold interaction is de facto leader actions.

87
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,760
Now, would the Corvette are shooting better? One star is the main fact for x1 or x1 minus eight.

88
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:24,120
A two star is the main fact for x2 a minus B. But but this combat or shooting can actually change the value.

89
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,570
So beta one is not the same. I spend one star, it's not equal.

90
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,030
Beta two is not equal to better to a star.

91
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:39,810
So that means while we interpret the mean facts, we have to be very careful when we know if we shoot with whoever.

92
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:47,250
So that's not that's one main point. But the interaction term beta three is equal to beta three star.

93
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:57,140
And this is so interpreting the main facts while we need to be very careful, so we need to know where the areas are centered.

94
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:07,130
Okay, so this is not the main point we are trying to make by comparing this regarding collisions.

95
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:14,150
And now let's go back to the example to see exactly how we interpret how the interpretations are different.

96
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:28,320
If you. So in this example, we sent her both age, uh, both age and, and the birth weight.

97
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,350
And that's all we defined. Age. Send her age, Darcy. And birth weight, Darcy.

98
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,460
These are send her age and send her birth weight.

99
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:44,250
And let's use these to send her version to fit the model and see what happens.

100
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,690
So now for you to model the results?

101
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:56,350
SVP Now the model has the interaction between the two center,

102
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,450
the CLARETS and also the MI effects of Center H and a manufacturing of centered birthweight.

103
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,070
And then we will have the same table at the same collocations table.

104
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,360
It shows that as the median value is centered around P value over the period of and a p value.

105
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,500
So we have seen this table many, many times.

106
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:33,729
So we don't have to we don't have to talk about this specific individual that will compare this truth to the original table without the shooting,

107
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:40,990
that we will interpret these numbers. And then, of course, using this center of the covariates,

108
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:49,270
we had similar we helped him know what table and this is the sequential sum of the square in a shows the sample squared by adding you know

109
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:58,600
this three terms sequentially in the model how much the someone square changed by adding each one for the model that it has done previously.

110
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,810
And then we have a partial some square horizontal square table.

111
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:14,500
This shows the each row shows how often the samples were changed by adding that term to a model that already has the other two terms.

112
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:20,380
So this is part of something stable. Well, again, we have seen this tables many times.

113
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:34,030
Let's not spend too much time on this table, this tables, and then using this model, if we fitted this model and we make a prediction,

114
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:40,780
this is based on this is the prediction based on the center of covariance, based on all center covariance.

115
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,540
And this this is the prediction. So we use the model to predict one.

116
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:52,330
So this is why how there is this y hat why have this is based on the center of.

117
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:09,380
Senator McConnell. And this is what I had based on the original commentaries were centered, right?

118
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:30,150
Now, of course, this history will only show is the summary statistics of the blacks only to show us the mean in the first part out the median mean,

119
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:38,280
the median, the mean, the minimum that the first quarter out in the median and the maximum.

120
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:42,930
And we can see that all these numbers are exactly the same.

121
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,880
So this is very intuitive. Intuitive.

122
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,450
It has to be the case because if you think about it, this.

123
00:14:52,940 --> 00:15:00,590
If you find a linear regression model using the original age and the birth age, now your centrum age and birth weight for revision of the model.

124
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,579
So how well age and a birth weight. Explain your response.

125
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:11,480
Why it shouldn't depend on whether you send her age or birth weight or not.

126
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:16,770
Right. So because I mean. Well, because how? Well, the age and birth weight can explain your response.

127
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:24,730
Why? And that's that's determined by by the underlying truth, underlying mechanism.

128
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,049
It shouldn't matter mathematically how you are, whether you shift the age a little better.

129
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:37,220
You shave the birth weight either because shifting of age or birth weight, not a similar corresponds to if you think about just one variable.

130
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:45,250
A similar car corresponds to shooting the y axis to the left or to the right down the chain.

131
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:52,629
Your regression line. So about the fitted values, they stay the same don't matter which which one you use.

132
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:57,880
That's why here we see that the summary is the those two are exactly the same.

133
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:08,050
So it doesn't matter whether you center much. Now let's compare the two outputs from this tool.

134
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:13,800
Models in to see what change and what stay the same. So this is the model.

135
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:20,200
This is not the Commission's table. Let me use the original page without a century.

136
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,940
But this is the covariant table of we use center age and center birthweight.

137
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,000
And if we compare this to tables, we see that.

138
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:42,020
Only the interaction. The estimated four interactions stay in the same increased hours.

139
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:52,860
Only this two numbers are the same, but the other all the other estimated values for the intercept for the main fact they are all different.

140
00:16:52,920 --> 00:17:04,830
If you compare this four tables, this is actually what we just saw when we look at our mathematical expressions as well.

141
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:09,389
We looked at this table that sorry,

142
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:19,560
the the slider where we compare this expression that has the original covariates to this expression that has not shifted to covariates.

143
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:27,330
And our conclusion is that only the beta three star will be the same as the interaction.

144
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:33,710
But the other all the other beta is like intercepts into the main facts.

145
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:40,650
They will change, they'll be different and indeed the from the output the output as of to confirm that this just

146
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:48,900
to I guess just confirm that so only the interaction term only this estimate stayed the same.

147
00:17:49,260 --> 00:18:01,080
All the other estimates, they are different. So this is the compare like a direct comparison of the estimated value for the radical revisions.

148
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:11,760
I mean, this is just the same slide in what I guess what we remove regarding slides.

149
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,410
He should have removed this as well. This is exactly the same as this slide and we just went over I mean,

150
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:29,580
that the the point is that the point we are trying to make here is that the field value for the Y hat, based on these two models, they are the same.

151
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:41,969
It doesn't matter whether shift of areas or not. So in other words, shifting the covariates are not these two covariates.

152
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:47,150
They should have the same power in explaining why. It doesn't matter whether you shift.

153
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:54,300
Okay, now you see.

154
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:03,100
Now let's try to interpret the estimated value for the space fighters tomorrow.

155
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,700
Yeah, this is the the first table here.

156
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:17,620
This is the first table here. This is the. To debate us when we use the original covariance without centering the side of the table.

157
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:24,250
This is the output by using that the center and as we just mentioned.

158
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,930
Only the inverse bullet interaction. Only beta three star.

159
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:36,880
Only beta three. Stay the same. Beta three is able to better a three star, but all the other betas, they change their value.

160
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:46,030
Now let's take a look at how to interpret the different balance, because indeed of the main facts, especially this to me, in fact,

161
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,370
the change was all the main factors for age and then it has four birth weight,

162
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:57,310
which is it depends on the ask me the valid depends on whether you center the covariance or not.

163
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,830
So how do we interpret this effects then and also regression?

164
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:09,550
Now let's take a look at this first interpretation for the main factors and for age.

165
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:19,600
Now for age, let's first focus on this this this table here, Andrew, without century age and Brooklyn without I.

166
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,190
Let's interpret this number. Use this number.

167
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:36,110
I will run the interpretation here because it's easier to see because writing the table bar, we do have a next back slide.

168
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,270
If you guys need more space, I think I will just write it here because it's a lot easier to see.

169
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:57,250
So. So this egg effect, recall that this model this is model SBP equal to beta zero plus beta one times age where beta eight has a beta to

170
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:09,970
appear better beta be times birth weight plus the beta interaction for a star b fans age and birth weight plus.

171
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,930
So now we're trying to interpret beta day. This is beta.

172
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:29,540
So as we mentioned now, the interpretation of the move that this is the facto right move part part of all this is part of it.

173
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:39,350
You've had it because it also appears here. So in order to interpret it better a long now, we need to look at all the terms.

174
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,630
The other terms disappear. That's that's how to interpret it.

175
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,800
Right. That, in fact, will be right. Now, how do we make the other countries disappear?

176
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,860
That is when birthweight equal to zero, right? If birthweight equals zero, then the other two terms disappear.

177
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,390
Again, let's forget about whether that makes sense or not.

178
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,650
Scientifically, what a mathematically. If you like birth weight equals zero, then the other two terms disappear.

179
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:09,100
So that's how we interpret better. So better aid than is the age.

180
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:16,680
In fact, first of all, let's be clear, is the age effect the age, in fact, on the on the mean SBP.

181
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:37,409
So it's that it's the. So let me just write right down the detailed interpretation just to make sure that every everyone understands.

182
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:49,110
So the change in the mean SBP well the change immune response for why you know change in age for one

183
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:56,940
year an increase in age for one unit and in here I think age is probably matter to in that age.

184
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't remember exactly, but let's say for one unit increase.

185
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:20,160
In age. The change in being SVP for one year, the increase in age for people with birth weight equal to zero.

186
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,750
That's the interpretation of H.

187
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:36,370
If I had a page. Or in other words, if there is one unit increase in h the birth weight average.

188
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:41,110
Oh sorry. The SBB average will increase by 21.20.

189
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,160
But this is for the people with birthweight equal to zero.

190
00:23:50,980 --> 00:24:01,030
That is how we interpret a. Let's go back to see if we can very quickly find out.

191
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,780
I think age is probably married in decades.

192
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:16,290
I am not certain about. Oh, very nice.

193
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:24,990
Okay. So anyway, I'm walking days in the Marilyn days, then here the union and then using in.

194
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,239
So. Okay.

195
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,070
So then this one unit here can do this bit of work.

196
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,409
You know, this is for one day increase. For what day?

197
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:44,510
Increase in age. So this is the interpretation of the similarity.

198
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:49,650
Let's try to interpret this bad US centered age.

199
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:59,400
And this is this is SBP equal to beta zero star plus beta in this age centered a star.

200
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:07,410
Plus Peter Brathwaite is censured and plus.

201
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:24,430
And this is what this mode of. This output corresponds to this model.

202
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:33,950
Now we are trying to interpret the speed of a star. If I start, and then you're gonna write it over here.

203
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,950
Okay. So this better start. This is the interpretation again.

204
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,330
So to interpret better age. Well, the better they start.

205
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:45,980
Now we need to force the other further disappear.

206
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,930
But the other two disappear when birth, way too centered.

207
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,950
Center birth weight is equal to zero. Right.

208
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:08,660
So then the interpretation of a star then is the change in mean SBC for one day.

209
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:19,649
Increase in h right in center age because this is the collateral we are using.

210
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:28,110
So for one unit increase in center age. Now for people this was.

211
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:35,840
Send her birth weight equal to zero. Senator, First lady.

212
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:50,630
So in other words, four people are going to have send her birthday able to zero in for one day increase in age.

213
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,370
We see that as BP increased by 5.86 on average.

214
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:03,489
But that's the interpretation of the age center.

215
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:07,350
This beta a star coefficient.

216
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:15,010
Now if we compare this to interpretation, we see the reason why essentially we send her birth weight and send her age.

217
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:22,990
Because the first one, we have to interpret it. We interpret it, we have to interpret for people with birthweight equal to zero.

218
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,000
This doesn't make sense, right? Because there are no people that have birth weight equal to zero.

219
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:34,750
But the second one that is interpreting about the birth weight center, birth weight equals zero.

220
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:41,590
Not a means for people with birth weight are on average with an average birth weight.

221
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,220
That's where that's how we define birth weight.

222
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,420
Even New Zealand. That's what send her birth weight.

223
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:53,170
It was. It was. So the people with the center of birth weight equal to zero.

224
00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:00,250
That is the people with average birth weight. So then the second interpretation is much more natural.

225
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:07,930
However, we notice that about the age, in fact is is different.

226
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:15,220
The reason that is different is because the first one, that is every fact for people with birth weight equal to zero.

227
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:20,440
Now the second one is for people with birth weight equal to the average birth weight.

228
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,540
Now the model does have an interaction that it means that every fact depends on birth weight.

229
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,760
That's de facto of interaction. That's the reason why we add ingredients.

230
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:40,150
The rule of interaction place is that it allows the age fact to differ.

231
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,870
Across different to different weight. Oh, sorry.

232
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:55,070
So it allows the effect to vary as the birth weight varies.

233
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:59,300
So in this case, indeed, we see that for people with birth weight equal to zero.

234
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:05,520
And for people with birth weight equal to the average for weight event, the exact difference.

235
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,090
So one is 21 point weight. The other one is five and six.

236
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,930
That's how to interpret the main the two main facts.

237
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,030
And a similar to you guys can interpret the closure for.

238
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:27,290
For birth weight. We interpreted the main fat for age.

239
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,180
Interpret birth weight. Yes.

240
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:43,520
Since we're not scaling the age and the second model, couldn't we just say for a one day increase and age instead of age centered?

241
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:51,800
Oh, yeah, definitely. So here you are. Absolutely right. So because we are not getting anywhere similar shooting age, right to the left, to the right.

242
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:57,470
So one day increasing center age, of course, is the same as one day increasing age.

243
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,610
And so here you can definitely say, for one, the increasing age is that.

244
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,840
Any other questions? Yes.

245
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:20,500
We so we mentioned that when we center them because of how the math works out, we change our estimates.

246
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:26,020
But looking at the data, not against the P values because it changed the estimates.

247
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:39,250
How do we reconcile that? The the same the same predictor just like shifted or not, whether we center it or not changes the significance.

248
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:47,510
Oh, okay. So you mean like, for example, this a p value of this age and people for this age, right?

249
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:55,870
Oh, okay. Yeah, this is a good question. So these two about two pivotal region matter.

250
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,709
They are they matter the significance of two different things again.

251
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,430
So recall that this artifact here mean this number 21.

252
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:07,270
This is the artifact for people with birth weight equal to zero.

253
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:17,080
But this 18 out of here, 5.6. This is the artifact for people with birth weight equals for the average birth weight.

254
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:28,510
So the p value, the first p value that is the significance like whether this number 21.28, whether this is significantly different from zero.

255
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:34,280
But the second given is to see whether this 5186.

256
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:44,160
But this is to different from zero. So they are married, less significance of it, in fact, for us, sort of two groups of people, right?

257
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,280
One race is the people with zero birth weight.

258
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:54,100
A lot of the people with the average birthrate. So there's no contradiction in this to point.

259
00:31:54,250 --> 00:32:00,540
It's. Any other questions?

260
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,190
Okay. So that's the interpretation. And in fact, another interpretation of the interaction.

261
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:20,130
Well, we sort of interpret this. So the interpretation in interacting is a little bit tricky.

262
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,040
I think it's easier if we follow.

263
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:31,740
I mean, at the very beginning, we kind of give a sort of abstract interpretation of the interaction and see where it is.

264
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:51,340
Yeah. He's over here. So this is the beta three is the introduction we're graduating about this year.

265
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,459
Yeah. So, like, let's see, let's consider this model.

266
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:00,080
So beta three is the interaction not only interpretation of the browser.

267
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,989
We can go back to this interpretation over here.

268
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:10,880
Let's try to, you know, use this as sort of a template to try to incorporate Beta three in our example.

269
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,270
So this is the mean change in x, y, in fact,

270
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:30,410
for one unit increasing x to the median x1x1 in fact per one unit increase in actual let's use this template to interpret our interaction.

271
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,320
So let's say now we interpret this age birthweight this interaction.

272
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:51,750
And if we use that template for interpretation, then this means that mean change in.

273
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:57,380
Hey, if at all.

274
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:15,140
I mean, SVP for one unit for one unit increase in the other guy at school, which is worth the wait.

275
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:29,690
So in other words, what it means is that because of the interaction the artifact has,

276
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:37,350
BP depends on which weight will depend on which way they are looking at it.

277
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:42,980
So the data, in fact, actually change the kind of birth the birth weight.

278
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:55,160
Now, with one unit increase in birth weight, you are going to see that an aging factor has been increased by, you know, by this 118 plus 1 to 1.

279
00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:05,210
And that's an interpretation of the interaction. So the artifact actually changed you of depending on which age, what birth weight you're looking at.

280
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:18,320
And of course, you can interpret the other way around. So you can interpret that this as the main change in birth weight effect on the SBP for one

281
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,889
unit increasing in age because the interaction this is the interaction between persuasion age.

282
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,880
So it's symmetric.

283
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:38,929
So another was the birth weight in fact on SBP also varies with age and for different for people with different age than the birth weight

284
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:55,760
effect on SBP also change and therefore so the birth weight effect on SBP got reduced by 8.128 for one unit increase in age were for what?

285
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:07,730
For one day increase in age. So that's how we interpret the Korea as the interaction from the interaction.

286
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:19,760
Gradually, the process of interaction allows the fact of age and birthweight to vary according to the value of the other classes.

287
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:31,130
And then it is interpreted as how much the in fact the change if we vary the other covariate by weighting.

288
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:43,360
So again, this interpretation may seem a little bit not socially from a beginning, but hopefully by using and by going back to the,

289
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:49,819
you know, the sort of the more abstract way of interpreting a generic interpretation of an interaction.

290
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:57,440
Now applying that to this particular example, hopefully it gives us a better understanding of how we should interpret the interaction.

291
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,100
So that's the contractual.

292
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:18,730
And then in the previous all the previous example, we saw that we used the old age and we treated both age and birthweight as continuous variables.

293
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:28,600
Is there a common attribute dichotomous to sometimes people dichotomous the continuous variable or to break the categorical,

294
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:35,680
the continuous variable into a few category? In this case, we call PTW the birth weight into two categories.

295
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,900
So the category with a low birth weight and a category with high birth weight.

296
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:49,960
So two categories and let's see what happens. So the high birth weight now this is the indicator indicating high birth weight.

297
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:54,070
So it's either equal to one or equal to zero and only take two values.

298
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,040
And it takes value one if if the birth weight is larger than the mean birth weight.

299
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:09,580
Otherwise, the take that of zero. And then we see tomorrow with age and with that called a modest birth weight, a categorical matter.

300
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:18,340
And then we have the output. So we have a here Andreas do continuous we have birth weight here but now the high birth weight.

301
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:24,700
This is the innovator. Just take one zero and then we have the interaction of this.

302
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:29,050
True. Okay.

303
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:35,200
And then after we feed in the models in this table here, I mean, this is not over the table.

304
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,159
So later, Robel, do look at these specific numbers.

305
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:45,520
But this table, the self we have seen this many times now after we see the model,

306
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:54,610
if we make a plot, we plot the observer data that the value and also the feeding tool eyes.

307
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:03,490
We can see that while the red line here this corresponds to the people with higher birthweight and the black line here as well.

308
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:09,590
So people less for people with lower birth weight and the points the dots and see

309
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:15,219
the red dots in the black squares these are the observed actually observe the point.

310
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:26,260
So this shows how SBP depends on h o has b b depends on H for the two groups separately for people with higher birth weight,

311
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:33,250
people with lower birth weight. And clearly we can see that there are intercept.

312
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:41,080
If you do a slight extrapolation, you can go to the table equal to zero zero here.

313
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:51,340
You can clearly see that the two intercepts are different and clearly the two slopes are also different as a result of excluding,

314
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:57,820
because the direction does allow the in fact to differ between these two groups,

315
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:03,849
between people with lower your birth weight kind of so we can see that just what they

316
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:09,730
have different intercepts and diverse slopes because of the interaction included.

317
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:19,260
Now this is the the two lines based on based on the drawing the drawing model.

318
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,200
That is the model that has the main facts.

319
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:30,780
Delayed reaction or what if we feed a model separately to each group?

320
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:38,820
So if we feed a model linear regression model of SBP all age first, only for people with higher birth weight.

321
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:48,240
And then we feed of the same model as people of age, but only for people with a lower birth weight.

322
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:59,910
And if we think of this to model separately, then we will have these two pillars.

323
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:15,670
The first table, the first table here, this is for model SBP equal to, let's say, beta one plus beta two times H plus absolute.

324
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,280
And the second one best is for SBP. Go through and this is this is for.

325
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:47,800
This is for people with a higher birth weight. And the second table, that's the same model.

326
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:55,810
But now of course we allow the libidos to differ about how they're going to differ and just a deeper lie.

327
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,010
But this is for people with lower birth weight.

328
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:10,060
And so we have this two tables and these are estimating the values of the corresponding parents versus the this table here,

329
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:14,200
the first table, the very first table. We are feeding a model that has.

330
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:26,820
I've run out of time. Let me use a different let me use a different way.

331
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:36,260
Okay. Gamma zero plus gamma one times. Times H plus gamma to birthweight.

332
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:47,620
And plus I've been plus in interaction.

333
00:42:53,700 --> 00:43:02,970
The perception that the first one is a model that that has the two main facts closet interaction.

334
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,460
That's the motto for the first two weeks.

335
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:21,059
And then the point of our trying to make here is that mathematically these while it doesn't matter whether you sit this table as a draw of this model,

336
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:24,360
I draw the model or this model separately.

337
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:30,570
You will get to the same results in the end, the same results in the end.

338
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:39,920
Now, let's see how these two sets of results are connected with two sets of algorithm connected looking.

339
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:47,880
So, for example, first, let's, let's take a look at this target for people with low birth weight.

340
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:53,010
Birth weight equal to zero, right? In this case, we have intercept.

341
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:59,020
We have a defect. And if you look at the first table here, we have the intercept.

342
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:05,310
We have a defect. You can see that these two numbers, they are exactly the same.

343
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:13,120
Between these two models. Now, the reason is that here in the first model, in this first model drawing,

344
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:21,000
the model here now the birth weight for four people with a lower birth weight, that means birthweight, high birthweight, equal to zero.

345
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:24,180
So this is equal to zero. This is equal to zero.

346
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:32,940
So then these two numbers, they actually represent the the numbers for people in the lower birth weight.

347
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,760
Now, of course, they should be equal to this numbers because this is for people with normal.

348
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:53,310
However, if you look at the numbers, the numbers here in for people with high birth weight, look, got an intercept and age.

349
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:58,230
In fact, they are not directly given final fantasy.

350
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:05,000
If you look at the first table here, then you won't be able to find directly these two numbers.

351
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:11,180
These numbers. Well, the reason is that here that the for example, this age.

352
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:20,590
This is the age. In fact, there is in fact all SBP for people with higher birth weight which were higher.

353
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:32,930
Now in the draw the model in the drawing model, we see that the egg, in fact, for people with higher birth weight,

354
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:41,690
that is both they have one and again, one, three, because for people with higher birth weight, the high birth weight is equal to one.

355
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:47,569
So this is equal to one. This is equal to one. But when this is equal to one, there is a three.

356
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:52,190
Also is part of the fact and a gamma one is also part of the effect.

357
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:59,060
So the total age, in fact, for people with higher birth weight, that's down to one plus gamma three.

358
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:06,350
That's actually the age fact over here. If you look at this one, this is equal to.

359
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:13,680
Better to. So this is better to use in Ireland and doesn't matter to.

360
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:22,380
But also this is demo one plus demo three, demo one here and three here.

361
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,660
So in other words, this is the sum of this number and this number.

362
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:31,890
So if you take the sum of these two numbers.

363
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:40,930
Let me tell you about some of these numbers. You will get out of this 5.175.

364
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:50,960
So that's that's that's the number one plus the amount of.

365
00:46:54,210 --> 00:47:00,150
In a similar The Intercept. If you look at The Intercept here, this is the intercept.

366
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:14,160
And the interpretation of this intercept then is the average SBP for a equal to zero for this is for people with high birth weight.

367
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:23,780
Higher birth weight. So if we look at the drawing, the model in the drawing model.

368
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,600
So we see that for people with high birth weight again.

369
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:34,370
Well, for high birth weight and for people with a zero.

370
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:38,210
So. Well, it is equal to zero. There's no this term. No this term.

371
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,370
But for people with high birth weight, this is equal to. So we still have a gamut here.

372
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:53,090
So then this intercept. So this intercepted this 3.4.

373
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,870
This intercept. This intercept.

374
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:03,750
This is Gamma Zero plus gamma from the previous model.

375
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:12,050
So that means this is this is six four or nine +814.

376
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:22,600
Sorry. I think that sums up the missing. Oh yeah.

377
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:26,660
Sorry. 33.4. But it's 773 point.

378
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:36,890
So it was at 73.0. This this is this. Yeah, this is equal to some of this numbers.

379
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:49,700
Okay. Are you guys following here?

380
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,620
I'm trying to show the connection of all of these numbers, how I see this.

381
00:48:54,950 --> 00:49:03,680
So the point is that while we feed these models differently, we feed a drawing model and we feed a model separately for two groups.

382
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,160
In the end will gather the same outcomes outputs.

383
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:15,170
In the end, we will get a same conclusion, but outputs may be different even for the output of the unconnected.

384
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:24,740
So if you're interested in the estimated edge effect for each age group,

385
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:29,300
then you would probably feed a separate model because by feeding a separate model,

386
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:34,910
it gives you the estimated age effect and the corresponding event you can derive in the past.

387
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:38,420
That is in fact zero for other milk.

388
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:48,800
But if you feed a drawing, a model, if a feed, a drawing model, the model only tells you how the egg, in fact differ between those two groups.

389
00:49:49,700 --> 00:50:00,500
It does not give you a direct estimate of the egg factor for not for us for the second group or for the highway high birth weight equal to one group.

390
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:06,500
Although you can calculate this number, you can definitely calculate this number from the drawing model.

391
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:11,090
That's this is how we calculated beta two equal to one plus gamma three.

392
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:16,910
We can calculate it, but the drawing table does not directly do that.

393
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:24,769
So, so then. So of course then it does not give you the estimated value of that.

394
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:26,780
It does not give you that the plan.

395
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:37,970
So the point is that we can calculate so we can calculate the beta two and also we can construct 95% confidence interval.

396
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:44,600
So are we allowed to use the p value that comes from fitting the separate

397
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:50,149
models because you're like for the same reason that we couldn't use it before.

398
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:55,310
When we assume an incomplete model, we're like one that didn't actually match the full model.

399
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:03,070
Elements of the standard errors for the H coefficients are different. So I didn't follow it.

400
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,560
I didn't like that.

401
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:14,050
So the estimates for the standard areas or the age coefficients are different because of how much of what it considers the full model to be.

402
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:19,210
So like when we finished with when we just fit one model,

403
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:27,970
our values and all of the statistics end up being a little different than what it is with this two separate models.

404
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:36,040
Are we allowed to draw conclusions from the two separate models instead of the first model?

405
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:42,220
Given that we're separating it by group and kind of implicitly assuming that the full model includes the interaction,

406
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:50,140
the conclusions we draw will be exactly the same. It shouldn't matter which model will fit.

407
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,790
So it's just that well,

408
00:51:55,900 --> 00:52:05,500
if the difference is that whether you are able to directly read the p value from the output or you have to carry out your own calculation another bit.

409
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:15,730
Right. So we're not so given this because we're implicitly assuming that you're now we use the P values directly in this output.

410
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,090
Oh we, we can't while here.

411
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:26,280
Yeah, I think this is a good question. Yeah, let me try to.

412
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:33,810
So when you said it was more I guess this is realism question like when to say see which model.

413
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:44,999
So these two models, mathematically they're equivalent and in the end based on either a model, we should reach the same conclusion.

414
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,580
We should draw the same conclusion in a conclusion. Bunch these two models.

415
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:55,320
If you look at the outputs, they give you sort of different outputs.

416
00:52:56,310 --> 00:53:03,760
The first model, if you fail to draw the model with the interaction and it gives you the estimate, the model for this scales.

417
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,230
Now if we look at have a three, for example,

418
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:18,420
if you have a three and it shows you the difference in effect across different levels of weight, birth weight category.

419
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,350
And so you have a three here, in other words, this interaction term here.

420
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:34,470
It shows you the difference, in effect, between the two birth weight categories versus if you feed of this tomato separately.

421
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:41,860
It directly gives you the effect for this two categories in the first.

422
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,030
In the first model, it gives you a difference between the two categories.

423
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:50,370
But in the same model that it gives you different aspects of those two categories,

424
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:54,690
of course, was, for example, if you are more interested in the difference,

425
00:53:55,890 --> 00:54:02,610
if you're more interested in difference, one way is you derived three in the first model, then you get a difference and then you get to the p value.

426
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:14,550
You can draw a conclusion, right? However, you can also do that by feeding, you know, the second class to seven models.

427
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:20,520
But then you when you carry out your own calculation, if you are interested in the difference,

428
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,959
then you will just use this number sometime this number or use this number sometime.

429
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:32,130
This number that that gives gives the difference that it will give you the interaction term in the first table.

430
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,790
Right. However, currently the difference from the second.

431
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:45,020
If you fit a model separately, there is no p value arbitrarily corresponding to a match difference.

432
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:55,730
So you would need to calculate the p value yourself by finding the corresponding virus and a corresponding covariance between the two effects.

433
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:05,230
But in the end, whether you're doing your own calculation based on a certain set of rules or you're based

434
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:10,120
on your you're going to push it based on this feedback directly from the first output,

435
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:18,780
you should reach that same conclusion in the end. So yeah.

436
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:31,170
So this two tables again of the first table that tells you that and in fact in the reference category and also how the other category,

437
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:42,450
how the artifact differs in the other in other pathway to category change so it does not drive them tells you that they do that in the other category.

438
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:47,610
It tells you that in fact in the in the reference group that it tells you the

439
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:52,410
difference like a difference of eight in fact from from this reference category.

440
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:59,189
So of course with the fact for the reference category, with the difference now of course,

441
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:02,250
you are able to figure out the edge effect for the other category.

442
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:06,000
But that's that's some outerwear that we have to do ourselves.

443
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:12,810
And versus the second model, if you fit the two two model tomorrow separately,

444
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:19,980
then you will get driver that you refer to for the reference category and of artifact for the second birthday a category.

445
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:29,280
But it doesn't detract or give you the difference if you're more interested in the difference than you would need to do in our own calculation.

446
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:36,880
Like subtract one number from the other. And that gives you about the number.

447
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:47,090
So yeah, the main point is that these two models, they are mathematically equivalent.

448
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:56,030
So once you get our order from one model, you should have everything to make to make conclusions.

449
00:56:56,990 --> 00:57:01,370
But it's just whether you are able to read directly from the table from our output,

450
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:09,410
or you have to carry out a little bit of your own calculation in order to do so, depend on know what quantities you are interested.

451
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:13,820
You might choose one model over the other. You might prefer a 51 model over the other.

452
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:20,810
Because if you are not a fitting but the best model, if you are not taking the best option,

453
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:24,020
you might have to do your own algebra too to draw conclusions.

454
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:35,550
Okay. So, no, we are. Let's just finish the next slide before we take a break, because this is relating it through to this question.

455
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:44,340
So now let's say that we are trying to get a 95% confidence interval for a defect among high birthweight of subjects.

456
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,140
We're looking at 85 for high birthweight subjects.

457
00:57:51,060 --> 00:58:04,590
Now, if you fit in the model failure to separate model separated for each group, and then of course, you rather get the estimated defect.

458
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:12,970
For a higher birthweight group. That is this number, 5.175.

459
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:19,780
And then you have a center error that's point advantage six eight.

460
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:30,580
So you can directly construct 95% confidence interval based on this estimate, but that is based on the center and that's totally fine.

461
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:39,370
So that's very easy if you're afraid of this to model separate because it just gives you the age, in fact, for the higher group.

462
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:48,579
However, let's say that instead of thinking that in two separate quarters you fit into the first model,

463
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:59,830
you fit the drawn more into this model is that now we are still able to construct the 95% confidence interval for age in fact for higher.

464
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:09,580
But but in this case notice that but in fact now this a fact here that is for reference group this is for lower

465
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:17,680
birthweight well the estimated beta for higher birthweight group and that's to this age plus this interaction.

466
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:21,520
So it's 6.44 minus this 1.2.

467
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:29,330
And by doing this, by coupling the sum of this tool, you will get to this 5.175.

468
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:32,560
That's the effect that's needed.

469
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:39,760
And so the calculation for even further relatively easy is some of the numbers.

470
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:46,930
However, calculating the correspondent's dinner is the last we've heard is not dragging.

471
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:56,860
Even from the statement, by the way, to calculate the center error is that first, based on this drawing tomorrow,

472
00:59:58,030 --> 01:00:07,390
you will need to find the variance covariance matrix of this and it was used for the variance covariance matrix.

473
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:17,620
And then you'll note that okay so about 85 for high birthweight group, that's the sum of these two bonus or sorry normalization.

474
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:22,060
That's the sum of demo one and Gamma three, Jahad and Gamma three.

475
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:31,090
And now you're trying to figure out the Bureau for center error of demo one had a plus gamma three hat and of course

476
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:37,600
you can tell they will do that if you know the variance covariance matrix of getting a lot of all the other hands.

477
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:42,350
And this slide shows you how to do that.

478
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:54,530
You just take in the corresponding viruses and covariance from the various covariance matrix, and then you can calculate the variance.

479
01:00:55,310 --> 01:01:00,200
So I think we are going to leave the details for you guys to figure out.

480
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:11,030
Unfortunately, I mean, we are so away and I met on the other day that we are actually behind our scatter

481
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:19,460
in and I think we probably spend a lot of time going over some of the our outputs.

482
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:23,300
So that's another reason why we try to reduce the output a little bit.

483
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:29,470
Redundant output of what we probably compose.

484
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:38,510
We probably don't have too much time to go over very detailed line by line coverage of the our code.

485
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:43,780
So so some some details probably better to get out after later.

486
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:45,379
But here again,

487
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:57,660
the the point of this line is that not if you know the estimated gammas from destroying the table these estimate again as from this table and again

488
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:10,310
if you're interested in this the sum of these two gallons and you're constructing a cover to the scenery for a fact for the higher birthweight group.

489
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:18,800
And then you take the some of this to realize that you can calculate this center out by using the various covariance matrix.

490
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:25,510
Of course, that's more complicated than if you drag my feet in as two separate models.

491
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:33,340
Because if you've seen this two separate models, both in the assembly and a center error will be given.

492
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:49,440
Okay. So that's the constructing 95% combination rule for any fact on any questions.

493
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:10,750
Okay. So then if there's no question, let's take, you know, a 6 minutes break and we will if you don't have more long 15 to.

494
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,152
Well, what's wrong with you?
