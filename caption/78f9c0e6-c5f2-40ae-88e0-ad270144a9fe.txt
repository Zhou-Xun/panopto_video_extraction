1
00:00:00,242 --> 00:00:03,062
When we think about the stories that we're telling ourselves.

2
00:00:03,062 --> 00:00:11,812
One of the things that Renee talks about is that what she calls a SFD and Stormy first draft.

3
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:20,572
That's another way of referring to that. But. When we're in a lot of pain and disappointed and feeling all of our feelings,

4
00:00:20,572 --> 00:00:28,392
sometimes it can be useful to write our story first draft where we kind of vent on the paper about what happened, what we could have.

5
00:00:28,392 --> 00:00:37,382
We think it happened and what we think it means about us. And once you get it all kind of unfiltered, almost embarrassing.

6
00:00:37,382 --> 00:00:46,522
So on paper, something you can step away from it for a day and then come back to it yourself with your self compassion and realize like, OK.

7
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:51,922
It didn't happen because I'm horrible. Like, I made a mistake.

8
00:00:51,922 --> 00:01:01,972
I'm gonna make mistakes. I was up all night. I mean, it's kind of correct, a little bit of why it happened and what it means about us.

9
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:07,672
And sometimes if we're having a hard time and we have a trusted person, they can look.

10
00:01:07,672 --> 00:01:10,162
At our stormy first draft and help us kind of revise it,

11
00:01:10,162 --> 00:01:19,752
because the way we pack all our stories and remember them has a lot of impact on whether we're willing to do it and dare to get back in the arena.

12
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:28,912
So. Journaling and getting it help, seeing on paper kind of what you're telling yourself, why it happened and what it means about you.

13
00:01:28,912 --> 00:01:36,022
And then going back and revising it into a statement that a little bit more helpful has more that self compassion.

14
00:01:36,022 --> 00:01:46,492
Built into it. So that's a really important part of kind of adjusting, revising our stories so that they're helpful in coaching us.

15
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:54,932
As we kind of heal from them all and get ready to take the next thing.
