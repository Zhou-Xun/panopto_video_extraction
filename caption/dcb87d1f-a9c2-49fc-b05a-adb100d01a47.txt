1
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:22,990
All right, good morning, everyone. Yes, an audio video difficulty today, the recording is still going, but without video,

2
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:32,150
which I think in terms of the quality of the video when these recordings are not going to win any Emmy Awards or Oscars.

3
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:39,320
So we'll just do without a little still show the PowerPoint, whatever is on the screen along with the audio.

4
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:49,750
Voiceover All right. So really quickly, before we get into today's topic, I just wanted to give a quick preview of October is Friday,

5
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,560
and that means our first exam in the class, our only exam.

6
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:01,480
But kind of our first big assignment is coming up next week on Thursday, which I believe is October seven.

7
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,650
And I just wanted to kind of review the protocol for that.

8
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:12,160
We'll take the exam completely old school here in the classroom paper and something to write with.

9
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:25,180
I'll provide that the exam on paper, you bring something to write with its closed book and close notes, so you really shouldn't need anything.

10
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,590
There's usually a question about do I need a calculator or something like that?

11
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:40,780
The answer's no. There will be some very simple math, but it should be easy enough to do on paper for most people in your in your head.

12
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:51,650
So no, not no complex calculations, but being able to utilize or apply, you know, a basic formula to determine.

13
00:01:51,650 --> 00:02:03,230
A dose and exposure, etc., concentration. It's it's the exam is designed to be completed in about 60 minutes.

14
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:07,400
There will definitely be those of you that will be done with it in like forty five minutes.

15
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,140
That's OK. Once you're done, you're free to go.

16
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:19,640
I'll just ask you to kind of out of respect for your for your fellow students, just try to excuse yourself as quietly as possible.

17
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:26,150
But even so, you still have the full 80 minutes to work on it during that, during the class period.

18
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:33,020
So for anyone who likes to kind of hem and haw or that whatever, last answer for as long as you like.

19
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,430
You can do that in terms of the format of the exam.

20
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:43,580
It'll be a mix. There will be some multiple choice. There'll be some list, you know,

21
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,910
list the what I look for routes of exposure or something like that where you

22
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,080
kind of like fill in the blank and then there will be some some short answer.

23
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,560
So and in short answer, I definitely do not mean any essays, you know, so don't don't come in with the expectation that,

24
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,600
like, OK, if I write three quarters of a page to answer this question, then I'm going to get more points or something.

25
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,330
That's not not at all what I'm looking for. It's mostly going to be maybe like quality and style answers or something like that.

26
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:24,170
List examples of this or that. Um, I will post a I don't know, it's not really a study guide, some sort of review document just to kind of help,

27
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:30,590
you know, help me think about maybe what you should be reviewing. There's really no no tricks involved here.

28
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:36,230
No. Ha, ha. Gotcha. You know, this is like we've been learning this material in class.

29
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,120
Uh, students ask me, do I need to do the readings? How important are the readings?

30
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,340
The readings are meant to be kind of supplemental, right,

31
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,530
to help cover some things that I can't cover just within the time constraints of the classroom.

32
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:53,690
But really, the focus is mostly on what we're what we're covering, what we're discussing.

33
00:03:53,690 --> 00:04:01,100
So in terms of where to focus your efforts, I will also set aside some time next Tuesday.

34
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:10,970
So a week from today, I'll prepare lecture notes so that we've got twenty or thirty minutes at the end of the class period, just for like some review.

35
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:17,210
I want to call it review. We just like open Q&A. So I'll be prepared to pull up like any lecture,

36
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:27,110
any PowerPoint slide to kind of respond to any questions or anything that you feel unclear about any any questions.

37
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,900
This isn't your last chance to ask questions. The exam, Panopto a week from Thursday or nine days away.

38
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:41,010
But any any questions about what I just described in terms of the format or the expectations?

39
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:49,930
OK. Cool. All right, so as a Segway, you have to listen to me today, all right.

40
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,610
Wasn't that a nice break? You got to hear some from some great outside speakers,

41
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:01,270
people with some fantastic expertize on specific topics that can address those topics way better than I ever could.

42
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:10,540
So I'm really grateful that they were able to come in, but really happy for you all that you get to have that exposure to that expertize.

43
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,590
So Professor Lee talked last week, right.

44
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:23,680
About occupational exposures and kind of the regulatory framework and the different standards that are in place and guidelines that are out there.

45
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:35,700
And so we're going to go through a similar discussion. But moving from the workplace to more kind of community environmental settings.

46
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:43,000
All right, so our objectives today are going to be to kind of similar to what Professor Lay went through last week,

47
00:05:43,000 --> 00:06:01,270
understand those agencies and organizations primarily in the US that are responsible for setting those exposure standards and those regulations.

48
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:08,680
We'll also describe kind of the scope and some of the trends in contaminant levels over time,

49
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:27,100
again with the context of standards and regulations in terms of how successful or not some of those standards have been.

50
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:33,040
And then last, we want to understand the differences between what's a standard and what's a guideline,

51
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,710
Professor Lay spoke about this a little bit on Thursday. But again,

52
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:41,020
we'll do it specifically for kind of community environmental context and what the roles of

53
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:50,300
different agencies and organizations are in either helping to inform standards or guidelines.

54
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,300
And Professor Lee also showed this slide or slide similar to this,

55
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:07,220
that we kind of have the same frustrations in this community environmental regulatory framework as as what exists in the workplace in that,

56
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:17,360
you know, we know from health based literature, you know, what the ideal is, what the absolutely safe standard would be.

57
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:28,550
But the problem usually has layers of reality unrelated to science that often get us to a standard that is less than ideal.

58
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:37,130
And we'll kind of talk about some some examples of that within the community environmental framework where that is the case,

59
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:43,900
then perhaps why or what some of the challenges are. All right, so broad brush here.

60
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:53,110
What are some of the primary, the major federal regulatory agencies in the US, the U.S. EPA?

61
00:07:53,110 --> 00:08:01,450
Absolutely. One, the EPA is has an enforcement role enforcing laws and standards.

62
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:08,020
So regulating our natural resources, primarily our land, our water and our air.

63
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:14,790
The Department of Transportation regulates the transport of hazardous materials.

64
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:24,730
The Department of Agriculture regulates pesticide residues, food safety hormone additives.

65
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:33,010
And then the Department of Interior regulates a lot of the land, uses wilderness designation,

66
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:45,910
wildlife protection, the mining and oil drilling rights, so utilization of those land based natural resources.

67
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:52,180
And then there are some equally important non regulatory federal agencies, right?

68
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:58,660
So these agencies don't necessarily have an enforcement capability within the regulatory framework,

69
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:04,510
but they do issue some really important guidance, more guidelines.

70
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,770
One of those is the CDC and within CDC.

71
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:16,930
This also includes specific to community environmental exposures, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry,

72
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:22,360
or the ATSDR, as well as the National Center for Environmental Health.

73
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:31,840
And then I think Professor Lee spoke about the National Institutes of Health, introduced that National Institutes,

74
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:39,980
in the context of Nawash Right for workplace safety and health within this kind of community environmental context.

75
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:46,960
The institute specifically most applicable is the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences.

76
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:55,320
And this is these Institutes of Health fund, both intramural as well as extramural programs.

77
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:02,500
So, for example, a lot of the funding here in the School of Public Health for research that faculty and students participate in comes

78
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:11,180
from National Institutes of Health and much of it in my department in Environmental Health Sciences from NIH.

79
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:18,290
All right, with apologies, a really, really busy table, we're not going to go through all of these in detail,

80
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:26,570
but it's meant to be, uh, the goal is to focus on the dates, the years, and maybe I should bowl those in the slide.

81
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:33,920
Maybe that would actually make it more useful. But there's there's kind of two tables here starting on the left.

82
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,230
We're looking at the US and this column,

83
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:44,930
the European Union on the right and the table kind of continues over here with the US and then the European Union.

84
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:52,790
And as we're following, you know, the U.S., we see the Toxic Substances Control Act, nineteen seventy six,

85
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:58,730
the Clean Air Act 1970 with subsequent amendments and seventy seven in nineteen ninety,

86
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:04,400
uh, water legislation in the nineteen seventies with amendments in the 80s and 90s,

87
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:11,180
uh, hazardous waste uh legislation in the 70s and 80s and then continuing.

88
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:19,670
Right. So lots of 1970s, lots of 1980s um and then some amendments perhaps in the nineteen nineties.

89
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,420
And if we compare that to the European Union,

90
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:31,220
uh there's been at least a little bit more recent write legislation to address some of these issues around community environmental exposures.

91
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:38,060
We'll actually talk a little bit about Ritsch, just kind of as a nice contrast or comparison with with the US regulation,

92
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:44,960
which was established in 2006, implemented in 2007, I believe.

93
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:52,160
But some examples of some more recent, uh, at least into the 2000s where the EU has has been able to,

94
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,020
uh, to continue to make progress and update, uh, standards and regulations.

95
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:02,330
Whereas in the US, the take away from this slide is that we really lag.

96
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:07,550
And what kind of talk a little bit about, uh, why. All right.

97
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,690
So going through each of these agencies, again, more broadly, uh,

98
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:19,010
the rights of the Environmental Protection Agency, uh, it brings together a number of federal programs.

99
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:25,040
And again, its mission is this is from their website to protect human health and to safeguard the natural environment,

100
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,560
air, water and land upon which life depends.

101
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:45,020
The regulatory authority of the US EPA derives from several really important legislative acts and will actually cover each of these individually.

102
00:12:45,020 --> 00:13:01,370
So starting with air quality standards, so the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970, it was amended through Congress in 1977 and again in 1990.

103
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,390
Again, with my kind of my background and interest in air quality issues,

104
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:13,090
we're going to circle back around and use this kind of as an example or as a little bit of a case study, and we'll step through some aspects of it.

105
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:20,950
But the Clean Air Act regulates emissions for both stationary as well as mobile sources of pollution.

106
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:25,060
So we kind of talked about those source categories a little bit earlier in the semester. Right.

107
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:31,240
Stationary sources are kind of like your traditional smokestack factory power plant,

108
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:40,090
whereas mobile sources are primarily, you know, cars, trucks, trains, airplanes, things like this.

109
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:48,700
And it takes into account the relative contributions of each of these source types to specific air pollution problems,

110
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:56,260
as well as the relative capacity of the different source types to be able to reduce emissions.

111
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:03,250
There are very importantly, six primary pollutants that are regulated.

112
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:11,530
These are referred to as criteria pollutants and they're called national ambient air quality standards.

113
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:21,910
So these are the six pollutants in air that contribute the most to adverse impact on health will step through them here.

114
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:32,650
Carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone led sulfur dioxide, as well as particulate matter in two different sizes.

115
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:44,530
PMG point five and P.M. 10. So those national ambient air quality standards, or as we do at every opportunity, we try to pronounce an acronym.

116
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:49,030
So Naks is what these are to be referred to as.

117
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:54,700
The naks regulate. What's the allowable concentrations of pollutants are in air.

118
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:00,880
Right. So if we take a meter outdoors on the campus measure for an hour.

119
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:10,060
Right. Integrate over time and calculate the concentration of sulfur dioxide, we compare it against the standard.

120
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:15,040
Is it in 18, is it meeting the standards? Is it below the safe level?

121
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:22,900
Right. Conversely, the Clean Air Act also regulates air toxics,

122
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:30,040
which are also referred to as hazardous air pollutants as part of the 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act.

123
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:37,870
It out of the list of these one hundred and eighty nine chemicals that are controlled from an admissions perspective.

124
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,850
So they're not regulated by what's an allowable concentration in air,

125
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:52,260
but they're regulated by how much in total can be admitted to the air from a source perspective.

126
00:15:52,260 --> 00:16:04,390
All right, shifting gears or continuing through this list, the Clean Water Act was established in 1972, amended in seventy seven and eighty seven.

127
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:09,510
Its goal is to maintain the cleanliness and integrity of our nation's waters.

128
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:23,660
It's actually very similar in terms of its statutory approach to the Clean Air Act, both in time as well as in as well as in structure.

129
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:32,190
Staying on the topic of water, so the Clean Water Act is regulating our water bodies, right?

130
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:41,390
So contaminants and the levels that are allowed to exist, like concentration in a river, in a lake, for example.

131
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:53,960
In contrast to that, the Safe Water Drinking Act set standards for finished or tap water, drinking water for both biological and chemical.

132
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:59,810
So when you when you turn on the faucet at home, put your glass under and fill it to drink.

133
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:05,180
This is the level at which it is regulated to the Safe Water Drinking Act,

134
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:15,860
different from what's allowed to be present in the river or in the lake nearby.

135
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:25,700
Moving on to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, also part of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.

136
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:32,330
This one is for the management of hazardous waste, and it states that wherever feasible,

137
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:37,160
the generation of hazardous waste is to be reduced or eliminated.

138
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,880
Waste that is nevertheless generated should be treated,

139
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:48,530
stored or disposed of so as to minimize the present and future threat to human health and the environment.

140
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:57,410
So as you might imagine, this one requires some some complex prospective exposure assessment.

141
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,100
Right. Which means looking into the future. We're going to talk on Thursday.

142
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:09,410
We'll start talking about exposure assessment much more specifically, and we'll look at the different ways that we can approach exposure assessment.

143
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:16,100
One is to look backwards in time. Right. So I think Professor Lee talked about workers in a workplace.

144
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:23,270
They work for 30 years. You try to go through like a survey, have them think back, where did they work?

145
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:30,650
What type of job did they have? And from that, you construct perhaps what they were exposed to you over over 30 years of time.

146
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:37,400
And that workplace, we might be worried about our exposure today, like present exposure,

147
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:44,200
kind of like that example of taking the monitor outside and measuring the concentrations in the air, estimating what could we possibly be exposed to.

148
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:55,130
Now, prospective exposure assessment is, for the most part, utilizing whatever knowledge and estimates we have of exposure around particular settings,

149
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:02,930
but then projecting them into some sort of future scenario to estimate what exposure might be if we did something going into the future.

150
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:10,910
So an example would be if someone is proposing a hazardous waste disposal site to be located.

151
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:20,930
Right. Unfortunately, in proximity to some sort of community, maybe it's actually along a sensitive water body, whatever it might be.

152
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:29,270
And this is where kind of environmental exposure models come into play, where the quality of those models is dependent on the input data into it.

153
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:33,740
So the more we know about a particular context or issue,

154
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:46,540
the more accurate those model results would be to inform what that kind of prospective or future exposure scenario might look like.

155
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:56,320
Hazardous waste cleanup, right, is in a different part of the process, so this is where circle of the comprehensive Environmental Response,

156
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,920
Compensation and Liability Act or oftentimes referred to as the Superfund program, comes into play.

157
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:12,130
So this was legislation passed in 1980. Importantly, it seeks to recover remediation costs from the parties responsible.

158
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:20,560
So this is after like, hey, we've got major contamination of water, soil, whatever it might be.

159
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:31,780
And so this is the Federal Regulatory Act that's responsible for addressing it was amended in nineteen eighty six.

160
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:40,990
And it basically works because it does have limited limited scope and resources to identifying the highest priority sites.

161
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:47,680
So based on the toxicity of the agents involved and what's the likelihood of exposure.

162
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:57,550
Right. So kind of the context to communities, they're placed on a national priority list.

163
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:07,600
In terms of regulating toxic chemicals themselves, back in 1919, 76, the Toxic Substances Control Act was passed.

164
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:20,170
The goals of it were directing EPA to require data from industry on the production use and health of environmental effects of chemicals.

165
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:27,610
It was to require that manufacturers of new chemicals or a new use of chemicals to detail known

166
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:35,730
information about that chemical and authorized EPA to regulate the production and use of those chemicals.

167
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:44,670
There were labeling requirements, tolerance levels or outright bans, depending on what information came to light.

168
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:54,370
In reality, it wasn't a very effective act. It is really only banned a couple of chemicals under this rule.

169
00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:05,680
And none through the original Tosca since nineteen ninety one, which was when dysphasia was being addressed, there is some good news.

170
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:13,090
This is actually an example where a regulatory act has been recently updated.

171
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:21,280
So in twenty sixteen, the Lautenburg Chemical Safety Act, which passed, which updates again,

172
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:29,040
we pronounce it Toshka, is what the Toxic Substances Control Act is referred to by those in the community.

173
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:36,060
And importantly, this new law, the Lautenburg Act, includes much needed improvements,

174
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:44,130
so it's mandatory requirement for EPA to evaluate those existing chemicals with clear and enforceable deadlines.

175
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:51,330
This was a problem with the original Toshka, was how long things could slide before a formal assessment or decision was made.

176
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:58,560
There's a new risk based safety standard. There's increased public transparency for the chemical information.

177
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:05,640
Right. You buy a consumer product. What actually is in it and should I be concerned about it?

178
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,930
And then importantly,

179
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:20,250
there's the Lautenburg Act provides consistent funding for EPA as a federal agency to actually carry out the responsibilities and expectations.

180
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:30,450
So this is where I'm going to switch gears really quickly and kind of contrast some of these U.S. legislative regulatory acts and compare it to reach,

181
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:38,010
which is the framework within the European Union, which stands for the regulation on registration,

182
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:43,860
evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals.

183
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,370
Like I said,

184
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:53,310
it's a regulation of the EU adopted to improve the protection of human health and the environment from the risk that can be posed by chemicals.

185
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:57,960
It was passed in 2006, enforced in 2007.

186
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:04,800
It went through a 10 year kind of implementation and it comes at a real cost.

187
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:15,630
And importantly, it's the industries that manufacture and distribute and utilize chemicals they basically pay into

188
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:22,050
reach in order to support it and allow for the activities to take place in terms of its oversight,

189
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:31,500
regulation and registration evaluation restriction. So which requires manufacturers, importers,

190
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:40,260
exporters and many of the downstream users of products in the EU to generate registration documents

191
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:46,770
to describe the hazards of the chemicals they generate or encounter as part of their business.

192
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:58,710
So any companies within the EU, whether they're importing or exporting chemicals either to or from the EU, need to comply with these regulations.

193
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:05,250
And because of that, it actually has a pretty big impact on the US indirectly.

194
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:14,670
It demands alternative methods for hazard assessment of substances in order to promote the safe use throughout the supply chain,

195
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:21,660
reduce the use of highly toxic chemicals, and also reduce the number of tests on animals.

196
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:30,330
But as I kind of alluded to, it makes companies responsible for the safety of chemicals they place on the market along the entire supply chain.

197
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:35,220
And this is a pretty big contrast with how things historically operated within the US.

198
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:41,010
In the US for the most part, it's like, hey, develop whatever chemicals you need to make a cool product.

199
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:45,270
It gets out there. It's widely used 10, 20 years later.

200
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:51,210
And later, we have some data that seems to show, hey, people who use this product have a higher rate of developing cancer.

201
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:55,110
Right. Or whatever it is, birth outcomes, you name it.

202
00:25:55,110 --> 00:26:02,820
And then we kind of go about, you know, after the fact, kind of chasing the tail, trying to figure out what to do.

203
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:11,700
And then perhaps, you know, an intervention comes into play where that chemical is banned or an alternative is sought.

204
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,680
Whereas with reach, the goal is to identify these things up front.

205
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:26,970
Right. So to have those assessments take place before the chemical is widely distributed throughout and consumer products.

206
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:31,980
All right, this was an introduction to reach we'll come back to it a little bit later in the semester.

207
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:43,370
But yeah, question also, what is the or the body that approves permits from the front line system then?

208
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:52,890
Is there anything that's stopping a manufacturer from knowingly not describing the hazardous and full site?

209
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:58,830
Yeah, for the most part, it's big fines, uh, big trouble.

210
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:05,360
So, yes, there are mechanisms in place.

211
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:17,130
Yeah, I talked about this for a while there, but it's more nuclear radioactive waste or that more people there see the problem that we have.

212
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:28,370
So, uh, yes, actually, it does, uh, cover nuclear waste, uh, in terms of hazardous waste.

213
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:36,510
So, um. I was just I came across that I was going to bring my own exposure science in the news article,

214
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:40,110
and one of them was about a nuclear waste disposal site,

215
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:46,500
a proposed nuclear waste disposal site that could be impacting a water body within the Great Lakes.

216
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:52,360
And I wanted to bring that as an example. But yes.

217
00:27:52,360 --> 00:28:04,040
Sorry I didn't pause and prompt questions along the way and any other questions about what we've covered so far.

218
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,140
All right, good.

219
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:14,360
Oh, and also good news for those of you that were here before class started and you heard the audio going, I do have a break right now.

220
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,520
I'm going to play I have a YouTube video that's about 15 minutes long. So you'll get a break from my voice here in a few minutes.

221
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:30,710
Hang in there. Moving on to food safety systems. So in the U.S., there are several agencies that are responsible for issues around food safety.

222
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:39,860
The Food and Drug Administration certainly is one of those. It's been around for a long time since 1930, the US Department of Agriculture.

223
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:50,210
Their activities include inspections and inspection and labeling of meat, eggs, imported food, some of the human nutrition aspects of food.

224
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:58,580
And then EPA's role in food safety has oversight around the use of pesticides on crops and so forth.

225
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:08,720
A big part of food safety systems is focused on microbiological hazards, so both in the processing and in a domestic use.

226
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:15,350
And this ends up being a high priority at the local level where most of the enforcement take takes place.

227
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:26,760
So food inspections. Right, identifying where biological hazards are in existence, where we don't want them to be.

228
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:37,380
In terms of the FDA, its mission is to assure the safety, efficacy and security of drugs, biological products, medical devices,

229
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:48,150
the nation's food supply, cosmetics and products that emit radiation, it derives its mean authority from the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

230
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:53,510
I won't step through all of these details just in the interest of time.

231
00:29:53,510 --> 00:30:04,980
Um, the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, again, not that long ago, I thought of this as as a as a new progress in the area.

232
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:13,080
Now nineteen ninety six is a long time ago, but this added a healthy standard for pesticide residues in food.

233
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:19,220
So uses something called a reasonable certainty of no harm at the general safety standard.

234
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:28,770
It eliminates what previously were long standing problems posed by multiple standards for pesticides and raw and processed foods.

235
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:34,260
And it requires consideration of all non occupational sources of exposure,

236
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:42,540
so including drinking water and exposure to other pesticides with a common mechanism of toxicity when setting those tolerances.

237
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:53,880
So in this case, it's really good, right? So it's not just saying, OK, uh, I'm going to use, I don't know, uh, romaine lettuce as the example.

238
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,100
And there's a pesticide that's applied to romaine lettuce. And you might go through this whole exercise and say, OK,

239
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:06,090
the average American eats this many grams of kilograms, whatever it might be, of romaine lettuce per year.

240
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:12,150
Therefore, their exposure to this pesticide would be this. Based on what we know, that's not so bad.

241
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:20,880
We can set the standard here. Well, if the pesticide is not just applied to romaine lettuce, but like 30 other crops that are grown.

242
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:30,810
Right. So it's kind of using this more integrated approach and also acknowledging that, hey, the pesticide gets washed off and in into runoff.

243
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,090
Right. Gets into the drinking water system.

244
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:43,950
So what's the exposure to looking a much more holistic approach to coming up with setting a tolerance for pesticide exposure?

245
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:53,070
Importantly, within this Good Quality Protection Act are special provisions for for children and even young infants.

246
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:59,130
So it requires an explicit determination that tolerances are safe for children.

247
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,840
So, again, it's acknowledging, hey, we've got this really vulnerable population.

248
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,160
Children are much smaller right there.

249
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:17,910
They're the body burden overall is greater with them being so small and includes additional safety factor of up to 10 fold if necessary,

250
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,870
to account for uncertainty in data relative to children.

251
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:28,800
Most of what we know out there is related to adults. And it's it's not just as simple as saying, OK,

252
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:34,590
a child weighs an average half of what an adult weighs and then just to cut things in half or double it.

253
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:44,700
Right. So this act really goes. Takes additional steps to account for what that uncertainty might be in children.

254
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,590
It also specifically addressed the issue of endocrine disruptors.

255
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:59,260
So incorporates provisions for for testing and a new authority to require that chemical manufacturers provide data on their products,

256
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:04,240
including data on potential endocrine disruptors.

257
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:12,530
All right, I'm going to I'm going to pause and switch gears, but also prompt if there's any questions.

258
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:19,370
All right, so let's go ahead and jump into a little bit of a of a case study, for example,

259
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:25,250
of some legislation, as I alluded to, I'm going to focus on air quality regulations.

260
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:32,630
There's actually a long history of air pollution control and regulation, not so much in the U.S. because the U.S. hasn't been around that long.

261
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:45,090
But the first environmental regulation actually goes back to 12, 72, when King Edward of England banned the use of sea coal to clear smoky skies.

262
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:56,790
In the modern era here in the US, as I mentioned, we had the Clean Air Act established in 1970 with subsequent amendments in 77 in 1990.

263
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:05,550
And, you know, while we acknowledge that air pollution continues to be a problem not just in the US but in many areas around the globe,

264
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:14,940
it was actually quite poor here in the US going back not that long ago, really going through a little bit of a timeline here, just some photographs.

265
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:25,830
This is Detroit back in nineteen twenty seven. At this point, its manufacturer, whatever you whatever you need to manufacture is part of the process.

266
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:35,370
Just admit it. There's no regulation. Nobody was looking at what's in the emission, what it might result in downwind.

267
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:40,680
Really the biggest mitigation at that point was actually sending the emissions up through a stack.

268
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:46,920
Right. So they were at least released at some sort of height and versus being at ground level.

269
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:58,840
Here's an image of New York City in nineteen fifty three. Pittsburgh steel production in nineteen seventy three.

270
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,880
All right, so the Clean Air Act of 1970, I mentioned the naks, right,

271
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:10,210
the national ambient air quality standards, these have two different functions or purposes.

272
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:14,890
One is is a primary purpose is to protect public health.

273
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:25,030
Right. Kind of the obvious part, children with asthma, elderly folks, and also has a secondary purpose, and that's to protect public welfare.

274
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:36,160
So things like visibility from a safety perspective as a big role in transportation for aviation as well as for physical structures.

275
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,460
So some air pollutants are, for example, accidents or corrosive to materials.

276
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:49,380
And so there are secondary considerations as a purpose for having those next.

277
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:58,350
The criteria, air pollutants, and this is kind of we described what the six are, but this series of bullets here kind of goes through a timeline.

278
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:04,350
They were originally carbon monoxide and two S02.

279
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:12,030
Something called total suspended particulates, so this is just any particles in the air hydrocarbons,

280
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:20,220
which is really interesting these days with our climate change issues, as well as a category referred to as Occidental's.

281
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:30,350
Lead was added as one of the criteria, air pollutants in 1976. Oxidants was changed specifically to ozone gas,

282
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:38,660
this was after there was enough research and studying and the realization that pretty much all of what's out there in terms of oxygen,

283
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:49,010
gas is coming from ozone, specifically hydrocarbons was removed as a criteria air pollutant category in nineteen eighty three.

284
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:56,610
It was almost impossible to regulate. There's hundreds, if not thousands of hydrocarbons right out there being emitted.

285
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:03,350
These are various organics, usually volatile being emitted into the environment.

286
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:08,510
Total suspended particulate was refined to PPM 10.

287
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:16,550
And again, this was after enough health based studies that showed it's not just any particles in the air that are causing these adverse effects.

288
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:24,170
It's specifically particles that are less than 10 microns in diameter in terms of how they can enter our airways.

289
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:31,460
In addition to PPM ten in nineteen ninety seven, a separate standard was issued for two point five.

290
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:43,070
And again, based on evolving health, literature and understanding of the problem, there's actually independent impacts from 10:00 a.m. to point five.

291
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:49,310
And because of that, they each had their own criteria, air pollutants standard.

292
00:37:49,310 --> 00:38:01,790
And then just in terms of the timeline, the National Environmental Policy Act actually established the US EPA as an agency in 1971.

293
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:06,920
So this was about the same timeline that said, OK, we have this Clean Air Act now.

294
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,360
We need something to enforce it and regulate it.

295
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:19,910
And so that's where EPA came in line. And then very quickly on the heels of that in 1972 was the Clean Water Act.

296
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:26,180
I won't spend a whole lot of time on this, but just to kind of illustrate over time, you know, what the progress was,

297
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:35,510
the catalytic converter was like a huge progressive, progressive success and opportunity specific to automobiles.

298
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:41,640
So starting with a single bed catalyst to convert CEO and hydrocarbons to CO2 gas,

299
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:46,550
again, this is a good thing from from a primary exposure perspective.

300
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:53,390
Right. What someone might be exposed to out on the street, on the sidewalk or in a community, unfortunately, as we know.

301
00:38:53,390 --> 00:39:05,000
Right. CO2 is a huge problem in terms of global mean surface temperature increasing and impacts to regional climate.

302
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:13,520
A duel. That catalyst came along a couple of years later, an additional bid to convert NOx into nitrogen gas and then a three way catalyst.

303
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,850
Finally, it was able to convert C0 hydrocarbons and NOx in a single bed.

304
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:31,320
And then you folks know what a catalytic converter is. Some had knives and some handshakes.

305
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:41,150
For me, there is actually a vocal performance, just like a person, but it's a car person thing to increase performance.

306
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:50,690
Yeah, for sure. It's kind of restrictive. It also tends to make it kind of like the engine louder and more rumbly and.

307
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:58,490
Yeah, right. But anyway, yeah. So this is this is absolutely an emissions control technology.

308
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:03,200
So catalytic converters are they're not really visible unless you're underneath the car and looking up.

309
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,450
They kind of run along the underside of a vehicle, but they take that, you know, roar,

310
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:19,820
combusted fuel exhaust coming out of the engine and run it through these basically kind of a honeycomb type material with a really high surface area.

311
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,490
And this is where these chemical reactions can take place.

312
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:31,160
And so what actually is emitted out the end tailpipe that you see at the end of the vehicle is much cleaner, right?

313
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:44,440
It's primarily water vapor and carbon dioxide gas at that point, instead of having carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and so forth.

314
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:53,650
So the Clean Air Act was amended in 1977 and added something important called prevention of significant deterioration,

315
00:40:53,650 --> 00:41:04,690
which regulated across classes, it was recognizing that, hey, we do have some really pristine areas that are in good shape, have great air quality.

316
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:11,510
Let's actually protect that. Right. Let's not wait for it to get bad and then reactively try to do something about it.

317
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:18,220
Um, and it kind of moderated based on classes of regions.

318
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:29,330
What types of emissions were allowed, what type of growth was allowed within generally an urban area?

319
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:38,310
Visibility is an important component of that 1977 amendment.

320
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:47,670
There was also some error health studies around air quality that were part of the Clean Air Act,

321
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:56,730
so part of the Clean Air Act was actually to fund research, to better understand air quality, which pollutants are causing which impacts on health.

322
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:07,050
There was a really important landmark study called the Six Cities Study that found a strong positive correlation

323
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:14,520
between levels of air pollution and mortality in this directly led to a revision of the tax by the EPA.

324
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:19,290
The study, started in the 1970s, went into the nineteen eighties.

325
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:28,800
There were six cities there kind of highlighted here in this green and purplish color on the map.

326
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,830
But basically what it found was that individuals in the most highly polluted areas.

327
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:41,700
So when this study that was Steubenville, Ohio, along the Ohio River Valley.

328
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:48,000
Lived on average four years less than those who lived in less polluted areas.

329
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,320
So in this study that the least polluted area, which Portage was Portage, Wisconsin.

330
00:42:53,320 --> 00:43:01,210
And it demonstrated that chronic exposure to air pollutants was independently related to cardiovascular mortality,

331
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:06,910
so this is actually plotting those six cities, right, with Portage,

332
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:15,760
Wisconsin, down here at the bottom, it's average two point five concentration over the course of the study was about

333
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:22,180
11 micrograms per cubic meter associated with the risk ratio of about one.

334
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:30,010
And then as you go across these studies and you can see this kind of linear response rate relationship all the way up to Steubenville, Ohio,

335
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:39,400
which had an average concentration of almost 30 micrograms per cubic meter of ppm, 2.5, almost three times that of Portage,

336
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:47,720
and it had a corresponding risk ratio of almost one point three in terms of risk of death.

337
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:56,840
Uh, moving on to the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, this authorized programs for acid deposition control.

338
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:06,810
We'll talk about examples of this in a minute. It again, authorized control of those one hundred and eighty nine toxic or hazardous air pollutants.

339
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:17,960
And again, this is from what's allowed to be emitted from sources, not so much what's allowed to be present as a concentration and ambient air.

340
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:26,750
All right, so we are not going to go through the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments in detail.

341
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:32,790
I am going to step through a couple of slides just to give you a little bit of an understanding of the complexity involved.

342
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:41,600
Right. So it couldn't be better timing that we have our US Congress at complete gridlock this week.

343
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:50,180
Right. Trying to pass important legislation. It's very illustrative of environmental health regulation and legislation.

344
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,390
Right. So we kind of started the lecture looking at that table saying, hey,

345
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:59,900
we're making all this progress in the 1970s and the 1980s and we're making some amendments and kind of updating things.

346
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,470
And then, you know, right about 1990 or in the nineteen nineties,

347
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:08,720
they kind of came to a halt and there hasn't really been a whole lot of progress going forward.

348
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,630
The political dynamics have changed quite a bit since the 1990s. That's part of the issue.

349
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:18,200
The other issue is just by definition, it's a huge haul.

350
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,740
It's a huge amount of work.

351
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:27,230
So I'm going to step through just kind of the structure of the amendments to then to the Clean Air Act that took place in 1990,

352
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:37,550
just to give you an idea of what's involved here. So the first slide starts with listing the titles of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments.

353
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:42,590
Title one is focused on a team and maintenance of those ambient air quality standards.

354
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:47,990
Those criteria standards. Title two is Focus specifically on mobile sources.

355
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:57,230
Title three was focus specifically on those air toxics or hazardous air pollutants title for a specific acid deposition.

356
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:05,780
And I'll speed through this. Don't worry. Title five Focus on permit's title six was specifically on ozone depleting chemicals.

357
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:11,660
So this is ozone in the stratosphere. Title seven was around enforcement and so forth.

358
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:21,970
So there's 11 titles total. Just looking at Title one, right, the one that's focused on air pollution prevention and control,

359
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:30,280
it has four different parts air quality and emissions limitations, ozone protection, those pounds,

360
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,970
the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality,

361
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:42,520
as well as plan requirements for not a team in areas so areas that are not attaining the standard or not meeting the standard rate.

362
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,860
So there's these four parts to it.

363
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:57,880
If we just look at part A, OK, now there's 15 sections that are that are addressing all of the subcomponents of air quality and emissions limitations.

364
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,590
We won't go all through these into the detail. But you're kind of getting a flavor, right?

365
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:07,720
This is just tons and tons and tons of written document with specifics.

366
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:12,100
And so it's a huge haul. Yes, I have the same cynical response that you do like.

367
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:17,500
That's their job, right? As elected representatives of the citizenry is to do this work.

368
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:23,920
Um, but it's it's kind of by definition, one of the challenges inherent to that as you layer in, you know,

369
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:36,770
other dynamics around politics, it has basically resulted in not a whole lot of progress over the last 30 years or so.

370
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:42,740
OK, enough with the negative aspects, let's look at some positives.

371
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:51,040
There have been some benefits to environmental regulation and again, staying with air quality.

372
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,310
This is looking at four of those criteria, air pollutants over time apology's.

373
00:47:55,310 --> 00:48:02,340
It's a little bit small, but I'll step through the basics of each one. Over here on the left, we're looking at S02.

374
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:09,240
Which is a gas starting at nineteen eighty over a thirty five year period.

375
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,710
Dramatic reductions in S02 lead.

376
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:27,150
This was an easy one, right? We used to purposely add led to gasoline to again, kind of increase engine performance back in the early 1970s.

377
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:32,430
You know, people realized, hey, you know what that led we're adding it's getting it's a metal.

378
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:36,750
It doesn't break down. It's part of that combustion emission coming up the tailpipe.

379
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:43,470
And we're basically by driving cars all over the place, throughout the country, distributing lead throughout the country.

380
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:47,700
So land was banned as an additive to fuel.

381
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:52,350
And it had, as you might expect, dramatic reductions over time.

382
00:48:52,350 --> 00:49:00,840
And the amount of lead in the air PPM two point five has been the slope here is a little gentler, right?

383
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:09,090
It's we're making progress, but it's not as steep compared to CO2 and led similarly for ozone gas.

384
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:12,300
And the basic reason for the these are these are problematic.

385
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:23,310
And two point five and ozone, basically the main reason or what they have in common is a component of being a secondary air pollutant.

386
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:31,620
So lead would be considered a primary air pollutant. It's emitted right from the tailpipe of a car back in 1970.

387
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:39,520
Right. You can take mitigation strategies to reduce the amount of lead that comes out

388
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,650
of those catalytic converters were put in place for other automobile emissions.

389
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:49,260
In this case, it was just, hey, we're going to ban lead in fuel that was pretty effective.

390
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:54,690
Ozone gas isn't emitted from any source.

391
00:49:54,690 --> 00:50:00,540
It doesn't come out of smokestacks. It doesn't come out of automobile tailpipes.

392
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:07,680
It forms in the atmosphere through chemical reactions of other precursor emissions.

393
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:14,070
So this makes it much more difficult to regulate. PPM two point five is a little bit of a mixed bag.

394
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:23,670
There are some PPM, two point five particles that are directly emitted from a smokestack or from automobiles or diesel trucks or whatever it might be.

395
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:32,820
But there's also PPM two point five that forms through physical chemical reactions in the atmosphere from other precursors that are emitted.

396
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:37,290
So this is the reason that that secondary pollutant component is what makes PPM two

397
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:44,760
point five and ozone a bigger challenge to regulate and to make headway in reductions.

398
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,220
I'll highlight some studies here,

399
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:56,520
I think that actually highlighted we're seeing regulations on emission sources having direct and positive impact to reduce pollutants and rain.

400
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:01,000
So this is looking at specifically an acid rain or acid pollution.

401
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,920
There's acid aerosols that then get removed in precipitation and result in an acidic precipitation.

402
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:15,150
Studies were able to attribute the decrease in amendments to the Clean Air Act of 1990,

403
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:19,710
which regulated emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides,

404
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:27,810
which are the precursors that form those acidic aerosols in the atmosphere and allow them to be rained out in precipitation.

405
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:35,820
This is looking at a map here, going back to nineteen eighty five what what sulfate ion concentrations in the air looked like.

406
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:41,580
And again, these are those sulfate ions that then get washed out and rain and result in acidic precipitation,

407
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:47,040
really high concentrations in the northeast and into the Great Lakes.

408
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:53,320
This is where most of the coal combustion at the time was taking place in the US.

409
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:59,590
And sulfur is naturally enriched in coal that's mined out here so that when you burn the coal,

410
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:03,820
you release that sulfur coal is burned at a really high temperature.

411
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:14,410
So the form of the sulfur that's emitted is sulfur dioxide gas, the CO2, which then reacts in the atmosphere and forms these sulfate ion aerosols.

412
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:24,430
So with the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, which which dealt big reductions in the allowable amounts of sulfur dioxide emissions,

413
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:32,920
by the time we get to twenty eight, huge improvements in sulfate concentrations in this same area.

414
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:40,750
Another study, which was basically a follow up to that original six cities study, this one was basically the fifty one city study.

415
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:45,040
Nobody calls it that. But that's that's the the parallel.

416
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:53,710
And it showed that average life expectancy in those fifty one U.S. cities increased nearly three years over recent decades.

417
00:52:53,710 --> 00:53:02,380
And about five months of that increase was attributed specifically to improvements in air quality.

418
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:13,830
This is, again, a much more robust geographic geographically representative study looking over much of the country.

419
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:22,140
And I'm looking at a little bit of I don't want to call it propaganda, but but EPA kind of saying, hey, you know,

420
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:30,570
a lot of the counter to environmental regulation for the benefit of public health is that it's too expensive,

421
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:36,180
it's too costly, it's too challenging to our economy. It's going to cost jobs and so forth.

422
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,810
And this is looking at, again, over what, about a thirty five year,

423
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:50,700
forty five year time period that we have aggregate emissions of our of our six criteria pollutants that have come down tremendously,

424
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:55,080
all while our population has continued to increase.

425
00:53:55,080 --> 00:54:00,210
We've actually our vehicle miles traveled has increased dramatically over this time.

426
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:06,690
But it's still, uh, we've managed to keep up with this nicely improving gross domestic product,

427
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:10,710
which is kind of illustrating that, you know what, yes, there is some cost to it.

428
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:21,300
There's also huge benefits and it's not so hindering that it's taking our economy out of the question for sure.

429
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,900
So what is.

430
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:36,620
And that is always studies in this case, the most study, most any study, um, and it's also that he said something about the reduction in Ohio.

431
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:40,100
There's a lot of factors or something. Great.

432
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:44,690
Great question. Yeah. And so, yeah, it's probably hard to see the studies.

433
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:48,740
The cities in Ohio that were part of this study were Akron, Dayton, Cincinnati,

434
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:53,750
Cleveland, Youngstown and Steubenville, which was one of the original six cities.

435
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:58,580
Right. Yeah. It's a I would call it south. Get my geography right.

436
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:03,680
Southeast Ohio. Uh, so the Ohio River. And this is not the best map to be illustrating this.

437
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:10,190
The Ohio River runs basically like this along the southern part of Ohio.

438
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:19,310
And it is a huge concentration of all kinds of industry, coal mining, you know, most of why I talked about how,

439
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:25,100
you know, the sulfur emissions historically were concentrated kind of in this area of the country.

440
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:28,790
The reason is just based on proximity to where the coal's mined.

441
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:35,990
Right. So the the coals mined there, hey, it's a great form of energy production, burn coal, generate electricity.

442
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:38,570
And so that's why they're all the sulfur emissions.

443
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:47,210
And so there's there are tons of coal fired power plants historically that have lined this Ohio River Valley.

444
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:57,200
All of the industry that has high energy demands like iron and steel production also are part of this industry.

445
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,700
So, yeah, you can take, you know, a river cruise up and down the Ohio River.

446
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:10,130
And it's just, you know, one huge industry with smokestacks after the next going up and down that whole stretch.

447
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:14,420
That's basically the the reason why. Yeah, and it's right.

448
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:18,920
It's not as simple as just saying, oh, Los Angeles, you know, lots of people, lots of cars.

449
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,660
That's why we're concerned.

450
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:31,070
You know, Steubenville, Ohio, is not this huge urban center, but it is kind of in the heart of all of this historical coal burning and industry.

451
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:39,420
So where the numbers are. The numbers.

452
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:46,530
Ah, I think just counting the cities, so I think it's one through fifty one.

453
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:55,630
In alphabetical order, perhaps. Yeah, I mean, I pulled this from from the article.

454
00:56:55,630 --> 00:57:02,270
I'm not sure how useful that is exactly, but I think that's what it is.

455
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:06,290
Yeah, right. Right. For sure. So for easy reference. Right. All right.

456
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:12,050
So I'm looking at the time I have almost exactly enough time to play this video.

457
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:16,190
We're going to end class with the video. I'll say bye.

458
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:23,210
We'll pick back up on Thursday and kind of debrief from maybe what we observed from the video.

459
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:38,870
With that, let me see if I can pull this off with our technology.

460
00:57:38,870 --> 00:58:02,150
Los Angeles suffers the worst blanket of smog in its history, the giant California city is shrouded by the ugly mist, dangerous to health and traffic.

461
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:15,150
California. 1943, it was a growing problem and still a mystery, everyone knew something had to be done and quickly the Hays called small.

462
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:25,800
Was getting worse, audio burning eyes, searing throats, literally choking the life out of California's.

463
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:35,580
But what was small? What were the health effects and how much was too much, where did it come from and how do you control it?

464
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:42,090
The best scientists at Caltech, the University of California and Stanford were put to work what they discovered

465
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:46,980
set the stage for pioneering air pollution work over the next five decades,

466
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:52,080
making California a world leader in the fight against smog.

467
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:57,270
Scientists simulated the atmosphere in chambers until the answers came.

468
00:58:57,270 --> 00:59:03,420
They discovered that smog was mainly ozone, gas and very small particulate matter.

469
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:10,860
It came from the burning of fuels and the emission of hydrocarbon vapors cooked under stable air in warm sunlight.

470
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:19,920
It was the recipe for a toxic soup of the city for 12 years.

471
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:30,960
And brother, I can't take it anymore. In those early years, few understood that smog could cause permanent lung damage.

472
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,430
Fewer suspected that it came from thousands of different air pollution sources.

473
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:44,790
No one imagined that it would take the next 50 years of science and politics to make substantial progress controlling smog.

474
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:51,900
It would take concerned citizens working with local and state government to pass laws that protect the public from air pollution.

475
00:59:51,900 --> 01:00:02,910
And it would take academia and industry working together to create innovative engineering solutions to reduce air pollution emissions.

476
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:08,910
In early years, smoke from factories was wrongly perceived as the main ingredient of smog,

477
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:15,510
the city of Los Angeles was forced to jump into the fight during World War Two years, adopting smoke regulations.

478
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:18,120
They had little effect on the smog.

479
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:26,730
At the same time, officials realized that it would take more than one city standing alone to reduce smog throughout a vast air basin.

480
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:34,860
They discovered that the chemistry of air pollution is complex and that it knows no geographic boundaries.

481
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:41,580
Smog forming emissions from one county frequently find their way into a neighboring downwind county.

482
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:52,230
The public demanded that more be done. The California legislature passed a law in 1947 allowing counties to regulate local sources of air pollution.

483
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:56,490
That year, the Los Angeles Air Pollution Control District was formed,

484
01:00:56,490 --> 01:01:04,080
followed later by the Bay Area Air Pollution Control District and other Southern California counties.

485
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:13,090
Mayor of Los Angeles. I am deeply concerned over the smog and this is the time to cut out all red tape.

486
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:22,910
I've ordered the police department to cooperate with the County Air Pollution Control Board at every major.

487
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:36,930
You when you were talking about. The air districts started their cleanup with large industrial sources of air pollution emissions,

488
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:42,210
burning landfills, refineries, power plants and factories.

489
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:48,000
Later, regulations controlled emissions from thousands of smaller industrial sources, paint shops,

490
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:55,770
plaiting operations, gasoline stations, boilers and incinerators, emissions from these sources.

491
01:01:55,770 --> 01:02:01,290
Taken together added up to a major portion of the smog problem.

492
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:09,890
Emission controls had to be fairly applied to all kinds of air pollution sources and the cost effective.

493
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:16,310
As research progressed and California grew, a major culprit came into clearer focus,

494
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:22,670
the automobile, just about everyone owned a car and no one wanted it to be true.

495
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:27,890
But cars and trucks were to blame for much of the smog.

496
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:32,990
Now, everyone would make a more personal sacrifice for clean air.

497
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:42,830
The legislature also mandated motor vehicle emission standards for the first time, putting a limit on smog forming gases that pass out the tailpipe.

498
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:52,310
A record was set today for the longest duration of hazardous air in the history of Los Angeles, and the smog conditions will be just as bad tomorrow.

499
01:02:52,310 --> 01:03:02,500
Everyone, no matter how physically fit, is being warned to stay inside and take it easy whenever possible.

500
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:09,940
Local air pollution districts were not enough, a coordinated statewide effort to fight air pollution was needed.

501
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:11,500
In 1959,

502
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:20,950
the legislature passed laws making California the first state to establish air quality standards based on the public health effects of smoking.

503
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:30,310
This was a crucial first step, figuring out how much air pollution is too much to implement the statewide fight,

504
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:34,390
the legislature created the Air Resources Board, or PRB.

505
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:40,480
In 1967, Governor Ronald Reagan signed the Mofford Carol Air Resources Act.

506
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:47,590
The board was given the job of controlling air pollution from cars, trucks and other mobile sources of air pollution.

507
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:53,680
HRB was also directed to coordinate the efforts of the local air quality districts.

508
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:59,230
The federal government issued a waiver that allowed California to set its own stringent standards for

509
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:07,090
air pollution control HRB SEPTA work requiring auto manufacturers to build cleaner running vehicles,

510
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:15,610
less hydrocarbons, less oxides of nitrogen and less carbon monoxide industry met the challenge.

511
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:20,140
First, cars had to have positive crankcase ventilation valves.

512
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:27,760
Later, every car had to have a catalytic converter. Vapor recovery nozzles became mandatory at gas stations.

513
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:35,230
Letter gasoline was phased out. Low sulfur, fuel oil and diesel fuel were phased in.

514
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:43,240
In 1969, HRB was first in the nation to set ambient air quality standards for ozone oxides of nitrogen,

515
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:47,860
sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and particulate matter.

516
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:56,200
The first automobile, nitrogen oxides, or NOx standards in the nation, were adopted by AARP in 1971,

517
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:01,870
ushering in a 40 year long effort to require ever lower emission standards.

518
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:08,500
But even as cars and industry polluted, less smog levels declined only slightly.

519
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:17,770
Between 1950 and 1980, 13 million more people called California home, and most of them drove cars or trucks.

520
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:26,560
They drove more and they drove further. The downtown Los Angeles skyline was shrouded in smog again today.

521
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:31,960
Commuters driving into the city saw it slowly emerge from a dense gray haze.

522
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:38,290
Millions of people are coughing and wheezing their way through the worst October smog attack in almost a decade.

523
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:41,410
All through the morning, the eyes had been riveted on the instruments.

524
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:47,440
Kuumba officials waiting to see if the smog levels would rise high enough to trigger still another second stage alert.

525
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:52,750
Finally, the answer came. This is the South Coast Air Quality Management District.

526
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:57,460
A second stage episode, health advisory for accident has been attained.

527
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:09,130
The maximum of the average contaminant concentration is going to three nine parts per million in the East San Gabriel Valley Area nine,

528
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:12,880
air quality planners and government agencies had no choice.

529
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:19,890
They would have to design tougher rules to keep up with explosive population growth and more air pollution.

530
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:24,390
The effort involved in drawing up the smog rules in the first place has been enormous.

531
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:35,130
It's a task that has taken several years and now it's obvious that the job of working to comply with those rules will be equally as large as before.

532
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:43,140
California led the nation and the world developing new strategies to reduce smog levels to protect public health.

533
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:51,810
It was the only choice we had. Good to get out in the open air and I wish it wasn't so smoggy.

534
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:57,150
Looks to me like the air is so messed up we won't even be able to breathe someday.

535
01:06:57,150 --> 01:07:06,430
Excuse me, I didn't catch that.

536
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:16,120
During the 80s and 90s, California cars became the world's cleanest running cars, computers controlled the engines, fuel and exhaust systems.

537
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:29,880
Smog check made sure the equipment worked. California skies began to clear the choking, burning haze that once blighted Los Angeles began to thin.

538
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:37,410
Despite millions more people, cars, trucks and more industry, California air quality was getting better.

539
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:42,810
In 1993, HRB required new standards for cleaner diesel fuel.

540
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:52,710
This reduced particle emissions by 14 tons per day, sulfur dioxide by 80 tons per day, and NOx by 70 tons per day.

541
01:07:52,710 --> 01:08:03,450
Later, cleaner burning gasoline was introduced, it was the air quality equivalent of eliminating the pollution from three point five million cars.

542
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:05,010
In 1995,

543
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:16,740
HRB had reduced automobile NOx emissions by 58 percent compared to 1970 levels and reduced hydrocarbon emissions by 80 percent compared to 1970.

544
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:24,660
From the 1970s through the 80s and 90s, smog alerts in L.A. and the Bay Area continue their steady downward trend,

545
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:30,090
levels of ozone, carbon monoxide and NOx were reduced.

546
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:36,150
The public had demanded that something be done about smog. It was clear the system was working.

547
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:45,650
State and local government working with academia and industry, making measurable progress in the fight to protect public health.

548
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:56,150
Into the 90s, the work for Clean Air continued, Arbi was first in the world to identify diesel particulate emissions as a toxic air contaminant,

549
01:08:56,150 --> 01:09:00,530
laying the groundwork for a cleaner running trucks and equipment.

550
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:10,250
In 1998, AARP also greatly reduced smog, forming emissions and water pollution from outpoured engines and personal watercraft.

551
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:21,230
New rules in 1999 cut smog, forming emissions from over 2500 common consumer products from nail polish to glass cleaners in the same year.

552
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:27,200
AARP sponsored the newly created California Fuel Cell Partnership to help study and introduce

553
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:33,830
fuel cell vehicles as a real world alternative to conventional gasoline automobiles.

554
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:38,170
Clean air progress was measurable by the turn of the century.

555
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:47,270
The total emissions of hydrocarbons and NOx from California vehicles was 200000 tons per year, less than it was in 1990.

556
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:58,520
And this despite a huge population driven increase of 40 billion miles per year in total vehicle miles driven air quality got even better.

557
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:05,870
L.A. smog alerts went from 148 in 1970 to none in the year 2000.

558
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:09,770
Smog alerts in the San Francisco Bay Area disappeared completely,

559
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:16,550
but more work remained to address the impact of air pollution on California's children,

560
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:20,750
HRB initiated the Children's Environmental Health Protection Program.

561
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:27,920
In 2000, six communities were selected for study and a pioneering research study firmly established

562
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:34,710
that children's lung development is damaged by long term exposure to air pollution.

563
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:42,900
AARP approved a comprehensive plan to reduce harmful particle emissions from a wide range of diesel powered equipment,

564
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:49,300
part of the massive effort to reduce diesel pollution centered on goods movement in California.

565
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:53,020
Working with the ports and local air quality management districts,

566
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:59,290
ARB helped develop the most comprehensive plan in U.S. seaport history to reduce diesel pollution from

567
01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:05,890
port related operations ranging from ship emissions to rail yard emissions to support equipment,

568
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:13,450
particle and smog forming NOx emissions are being reduced further in its forward looking stance.

569
01:11:13,450 --> 01:11:24,870
AARP adopted in 2004 the nation's first greenhouse gas rule to require automakers to sell cars with reduce greenhouse gas emissions starting in 2009.

570
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:33,540
When AB 32 was passed in 2006, the California Global Warming Solutions Act HRB became responsible for the world's first

571
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:40,500
comprehensive program of regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve greenhouse gas reductions.

572
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:47,950
To avert serious environmental consequences, greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced.

573
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:54,820
Much has been accomplished over the last 40 years, protecting public health while allowing for economic growth.

574
01:11:54,820 --> 01:12:01,780
Now scientists know that had we done nothing, the air in Los Angeles would be the worst in the world,

575
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:07,750
with peak ozone levels at least four times higher than they are today.

576
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:13,240
Air pollution control programs by AARP and the local air districts have reduced

577
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:19,240
air pollutant concentrations to a small fraction of what they were in the 1960s,

578
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:25,540
researchers estimate. This effort has prevented thousands of premature deaths in California at a modest

579
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:32,090
cost of less than point one percent of California's yearly gross domestic product.

580
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:35,120
That led not been banned from gasoline.

581
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:43,490
Scientists believe that the IQ of some people growing up in Los Angeles could have been reduced up to seven points.

582
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:53,000
The air is much cleaner, but not clean enough. Today, automobiles run 99 percent cleaner than they did in the 1960s.

583
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,530
But transportation must pollute less as population rises.

584
01:12:57,530 --> 01:13:08,450
And we know now that PM 2.5 more particles, less than 2.5 microns in size are responsible for most air pollution related deaths.

585
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:13,580
AARP and local districts have adopted an aggressive control strategy.

586
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:21,200
Today, PM 2.5 pollution has been reduced to roughly half of what it was in the 1980s.

587
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:28,130
But PM 2.5 is still too high for unhealthy levels of air pollution.

588
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:32,280
Violating state and federal standards are still with us.

589
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:42,890
With more people driving, with even more cars, more trucks reaching clean air goals will require even more innovative solutions.

590
01:13:42,890 --> 01:14:03,777
Zero pollution options such as electric and fuel cell vehicles will chart the future of.
