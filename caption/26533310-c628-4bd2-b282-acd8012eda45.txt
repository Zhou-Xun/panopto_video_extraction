00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hi, everyone. This is Eskira, one of your GSIs for Public Health 512.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'll be doing a brief demonstration on how to download and use the Respondus Lockdown browser.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So here I just have the Public Health 512 Canvas page open and I have it in student view, so I should be able to see what you see.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So first what we're going to do is navigate over to Quizzes.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And then scroll down to find the "Lockdown Browser Download and Test your Equipment" practice quiz.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And so here what we're going to do is take this quiz, which will prompt us to download the Respondus Lockdown Browser,

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and then after we install, we'll be able to actually use it and see what it looks like.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And once in the lockdown browser, we'll be able to navigate back to this page,

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
take the quiz and then see what it looks like in that interface.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So we'll take the quiz and then it says here we need to download the Respondus Lockdown Browser.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We're going to do that. Which will open another page. And then here you have the option to install.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And then depending on whether you have a Mac or Windows, you'll also have different options.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So here you can also select the "Do you need the Windows version?"

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So I'll go ahead, click, install, and then proceed with the installation process.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
All right, so I've just finished installing.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And then here it says, "Once installed, locate the lockdown browser icon on your desktop and start the application."

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So go ahead and do that. So here I'm just launching the lockdown browser.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So this is what it looks like, the first prompt will ask you to "Choose a Server" and you'll select the "UM Canvas Prod", which is usually the default.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Then you'll click continue.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And so it takes us to the Canvas log-in page, which is very similar to what you would normally see. And sometimes before you get to this page,

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
you'll also see a prompt that asks you to close applications that are running in the background.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Here, I didn't have any applications running, so it didn't ask me to close anything.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But if you do, select the "Close all applications" option so that you can move forward, otherwise you won't be able to use the lockdown browser.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So I'm just going to click here for "U-M Web Log-in" and then go ahead and sign into canvas.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
All right. So I was able to successfully log in using the duo authentication and I'm in the Public Health 512 Canvas page again,

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
but this time in the lockdown browser. So I'll do that same thing where I navigate to Quizzes.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Find that l"Lockdown Browser Download and Test your Equipment" practice quiz.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And here we'll do the same thing where we click on Take the Quiz.

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But this time, we shouldn't be prompted to download the lock down browser since we're already in the lockdown browser.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And so here this is what it looks like to take a quiz in lockdown browser.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Then if you scroll here, you see that we just have one question, which is select the name of this course.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So we'll go ahead and select this and then we can submit the quiz. And that will take us back here.

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So the only difference between this and when you take the actual exam.

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Is at the top of the exam, you'll see a Zoom link for each of the sessions.

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And before you actually click, take quiz for your exam, you'll click on that Zoom link, which will send you to the Zoom.

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And then from there, you'll see either myself or the others GSIs to proctor the exam.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And then once you get the go ahead to start your exam,

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
you'll be able to click exam and then go from there and complete your exam in lockdown browser.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And if you're ever unsure about what to do, you can, while in lockdown browser, also navigate to Week 7 where we have instructions.

40
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So here, if you're ever unsure if you go to Week 7 and click, "Zoom/Lockdown Browser" instructions,

41
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
you'll be able to see the instructions for what we just did, which is downloading and installing the lock down browser and sort of testing it.

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And then if you scroll a little bit down, you'll be able to see what to do on the day of the exam,

43
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
which includes logging into the locked down browser and then joining the Zoom protocol call before beginning your exam.

44
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And then from there, it'll give you more details about what will happen in the Zoom, including the proctors, such as myself or the other.

45
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
GSIs giving you an access code so that once you take select take the quiz,

46
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
you'll be able to put the access code in and then you'll be able to start your exam.

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And then once you start and finish your exam and submit, you can leave Lockdown Browser.

48
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And to do that, you just select the red X at the top here, and then you'll just get a prompt that says,

49
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
"Are you sure you want to quit responder's lockdown browser?" and then click quit and

50
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:46,836
then it'll send you back to where you were before to your regular computer settings.
