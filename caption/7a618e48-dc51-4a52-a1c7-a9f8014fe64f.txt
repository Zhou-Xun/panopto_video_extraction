1
00:00:03,905 --> 00:00:05,130
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,810
Let's continue the discussion about negotiation.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:13,090
In this last segment, we'll focus on two uses.

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,290
One negotiation as a means for devising interests.

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:24,500
And negotiation as a process for joined problem solving.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,660
Before we proceed, I think it will be most useful to emphasize

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:35,380
one more time that negotiation should not be an end in itself.

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:43,330
It's not just a game to play, also to bring about sustainable agreements.

9
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:52,600
Negotiations won't be successful if the goal is to satisfy our interests only.

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,442
And to recap the previous discussion, in negotiation, we should not so

11
00:00:58,442 --> 00:01:04,300
much ask, what is my position, and assert this is my position.

12
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:10,250
Instead, we shall seek, we shall try to understand directly and

13
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,480
indirectly what the real interest are that lie behind

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,480
our position as well as the position of our counterparts.

15
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,260
Another crucial question to ask involves BATNA.

16
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:34,010
Which stands for Best Alternative To negotiated Agreement.

17
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:39,928
BATNA also known as no-agreement alternative, is the course of

18
00:01:39,928 --> 00:01:45,962
action that one would take if the proposed deal were not possible.

19
00:01:45,962 --> 00:01:48,821
Or the alternative that we may consider,

20
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:54,785
if no agreement can be reached through negotiation.

21
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:58,196
Depending on the issue on the negotiation table and

22
00:01:58,196 --> 00:02:02,740
the situation involved, I can offer you several example of BATNA.

23
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:08,020
It may include walking away, doing without any agreement, approaching a different

24
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:14,360
potential partner to form an alliance, speaking to a different supplier or buyer,

25
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,570
providing a service line in-house, rather than contracting the service out.

26
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:26,190
Or going on a strike to force an employer for different proposal.

27
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:33,370
Or if the issue is a legal dispute, going to the court without settling.

28
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,170
All these are examples of BATNA.

29
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:43,170
Whatever a situation may be, to negotiate effectively,

30
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:50,523
we have to continually assess our, as well as our counterparts BATNA.

31
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:56,810
So that we can determine if there is a possibility of reaching an agreement.

32
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,970
This is crucial because whatever agreement that is reached,

33
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:07,190
has to be better than BATNA or the best no agreement alternative

34
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:15,860
in terms of satisfying our interests as well as the interest of our counterparts.

35
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,250
This is a necessary condition for agreement.

36
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,120
Let's make it more concrete.

37
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,090
And go back to the example of physician contract negotiations between

38
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,000
Henry Ford Health Systems and CHASS.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,300
In this case, Henry Ford Health System's BATNA

40
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,910
will be terminating the physician contract with CHASS and

41
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:46,040
perhaps no longer offering hospital and specialty care to CHASS patients.

42
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,200
For CHASS, the BATNA may be to form a partnership

43
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,550
with a different medical center, for example, Detroit Medical Center.

44
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:59,450
Or CHASS can actually opt to recruit their own primary care physicians

45
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:05,010
to staff the clinics, rather than relying on other organizations.

46
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,978
In order to keep the negotiation going,

47
00:04:07,978 --> 00:04:12,781
the proposed cost increase in the physician contract should look

48
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:21,017
better than Henry Ford Health System's as well as CHASS's BATNA.

49
00:04:21,017 --> 00:04:23,817
This means for Henry Ford Health System,

50
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:28,380
the cost increase in the physician contract should look better than

51
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,024
the balance of their loss in physician recruitment and retention and

52
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:38,351
their revenue from offering hospital and speciality care to CHASS patients.

53
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:45,130
For CHASS, the cost increase should not be a threat to their financial viability,

54
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,160
and should be better than the alternatives of seeking a physician contract

55
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,720
with a different health system, or having their own primary care physicians.

56
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:02,280
A very important implication of discussing the concept BATNA is this,

57
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,530
you should invest efforts to improve your BATNA.

58
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:13,130
Mainly, your alternatives if no agreement is reached.

59
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,860
The reason is actually quite intuitive.

60
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,890
Because to be able to walk away from the negotiation

61
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:25,180
can significantly increase your negotiating power.

62
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:31,240
Also, because the better your BATNA appears both to you and

63
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,150
to your counterpart, the more credible your threat to walk away would be.

64
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,010
If the threat is credible,

65
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:45,000
you have a chance to ask your counterpart for a better deal.

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,688
The correct question is how do you improve BATNA?

67
00:05:52,688 --> 00:05:58,370
It requires you to draw a very wide circle in your analysis.

68
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:04,530
And spend time, energy, and resources on improving your alternatives,

69
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,950
your options, away from the table, to prepare for

70
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:14,310
the negotiation rather than focusing only on improving the deal.

71
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:24,013
And your negotiating skill at the table during the negotiation.

72
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:27,408
As the Web TV founder Steve Perlman said,

73
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:33,040
if you cannot walk away, you cannot negotiate.

74
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,170
So let's apply this principle to the physician contract example and

75
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,910
think from the point of view of CHASS.

76
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:48,075
In this negotiation, CHASS is a much less dominant party.

77
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:57,110
CHASS is the David against Henry Ford, the goliath.

78
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:03,350
Applying the principle that we just discussed, CHASS negotiation power

79
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:08,270
can be greatly expanded if they could solicit a similar

80
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,380
physician contract and patient referral relationship with a different center.

81
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,803
For example, the Detroit Medical Center
