00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,952
Welcome to HMP 610: Cost-effectiveness analysis in health, this is our

2
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:09,240
first lecture economic overview of what is cost effectiveness analysis.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,340
So first of all the question is why is this important?

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,809
And we got a couple things to think about here, one is spending and

5
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:21,910
here in the US we can look at spending per capita.

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:27,328
The U S Is the blue line on the top here much higher spending than a lot of other

7
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:33,640
OECD countries, almost double what these other countries are spending.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,639
And that might be okay if we all lived twice as long or

9
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:43,890
even substantially longer, but it's not clear that that's really the case.

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,951
Here we can look at some comparable countries, rich countries and

11
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:53,740
the US has very similar if not maybe lower life expectancy, life expectancy at birth.

12
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,292
But there are some challenges in how life expectancy at birth is counting what birth

13
00:00:58,292 --> 00:00:59,991
is in some of these countries.

14
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:05,238
So some people say well maybe we should look at life expectancy at let's say

15
00:01:05,238 --> 00:01:11,010
age 60 and actually after age 65, the us basically has socialized medicine.

16
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,679
So that should be similar to some of these other countries, but

17
00:01:14,679 --> 00:01:17,610
at age 60 we have similar life expectancy also.

18
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,025
The red bars here, so clearly the challenge here is we're spending a lot,

19
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:25,180
but we're not really getting much better outcomes,

20
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,130
and you can look at a bunch of an outcomes besides life expectancy.

21
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,628
But this is a common one, and we don't seem to be getting good value for

22
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:38,658
the spending that we have, and this is a problem, not just in terms of value but

23
00:01:38,658 --> 00:01:42,880
also Medicare and Medicaid, or big drivers of the federal debt.

24
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,300
And so that's a problem kind of nationally and also cost increases affect coverage.

25
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,479
And so there's been some research that suggests that in premium increases

26
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:58,325
encourage employers to drop coverage and also discourages employees from purchasing

27
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:03,340
coverage and also discourages people from purchasing insurance on exchanges.

28
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,010
And some research has shown that about a 10 increase in premiums leads to

29
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,811
a little less than one decline in coverage.

30
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:13,352
So you can imagine is as expenses increase,

31
00:02:13,352 --> 00:02:17,240
maybe fewer people will get health insurance coverage.

32
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,050
Some other things to think about here are maybe some new drugs in the news.

33
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,635
There are a lot of cancer drugs listed here that are very expensive but

34
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:31,637
maybe have kind of low survival for so for example,

35
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:36,040
provenge the first one in your avoid the third one here.

36
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,957
It's about $100,000 for treatment here and

37
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:42,531
each one of those leads to about four months increased survival.

38
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:46,378
And the question then, is is that a good value?

39
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:51,813
Is that a good way that we as individuals or we as insurance companies or

40
00:02:51,813 --> 00:02:55,580
we as decision makers about federal spending.

41
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,651
Is that a good way to spend our money?

42
00:02:57,651 --> 00:02:59,551
And that's one of the things we'll look at or

43
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:01,601
talk about in cost effectiveness analysis, and

44
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:06,340
that's something that can help us kind of think about some of these trade offs.

45
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,898
A few other things to consider healthcare costs are the key to our fiscal future,

46
00:03:10,898 --> 00:03:14,793
says Peter Orszag Obama's first budget director.

47
00:03:14,793 --> 00:03:16,864
Some researchers at Harvard and

48
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:22,003
the National Bureau of Economic Research have said that the US has yet to wrestle

49
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:27,678
really with the question of public policy priorities in a world of scarce resources.

50
00:03:27,678 --> 00:03:31,776
Even with perfect productive efficiency, we can't cover all services for

51
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:36,000
all people, so we need to start thinking about how do we allocate those limited

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,848
resources that we have?

53
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:40,250
And this is also affecting healthcare investment.

54
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:45,112
So, this final quote here is from a health policy analyst that's saying life

55
00:03:45,112 --> 00:03:49,549
science companies are aware of the debt and deficit situation and that

56
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:54,360
indirectly limiting Medicare and Medicaid drug prices could be on the horizon.

57
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,512
So I think in the private sector, people were are concerned that,

58
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:03,271
yeah, running out of money could lead to pressure to reduce payments.

59
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:05,477
And this is talking about drug prices, but

60
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:09,177
presumably that would also be physician payments could be hospital payments,

61
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:13,240
a lot of things if the federal government starts feeling the squeeze.

62
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,327
Another thing to think about here are related to private sector actions are drug

63
00:04:17,327 --> 00:04:18,130
development.

64
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,968
You know, if you're a private equity investor, you've got a lot of places where

65
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:24,730
you can put your money, or even venture capital money.

66
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,780
You can vest biotech or you can invest in video games.

67
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,472
And so that's the challenge is if we don't,

68
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:33,612
on the flip side is if we don't invest a lot in healthcare,

69
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:38,036
maybe that will drive investment away from what we think might be potentially life

70
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:41,911
saving health improvements and money could go into other directions.

71
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:46,198
If we don't spend money on health, it could go towards video games and so forth,

72
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:48,050
which may or may not be a bad thing.

73
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,286
Right?

74
00:04:49,286 --> 00:04:51,808
So the final thing here is or not the final thing,

75
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:54,401
but we want to ask ourselves the question here.

76
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:57,740
What can cost effectiveness analysis do?

77
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,660
Well, it can do several things.

78
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:05,340
It can evaluate the monetary and non monetary consequences of health programs.

79
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,461
It can support decisions about investments in single programs.

80
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:11,928
In the design of programs could help guide allocation of

81
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:15,249
resources between different competing programs and

82
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:20,640
help us guide data collection efforts to help us answer future questions.

83
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,134
And finally it can also show when a decision is justified even if we have

84
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:26,840
incomplete data.

85
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,256
So even if we don't have all that we think we'd like to have maybe this type of

86
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:32,650
analysis can say stop.

87
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,117
We at least have enough information that we can make a decision and

88
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:39,640
we don't need to collect additional data.

89
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,248
Cost effectiveness analysis is not a silver bullet and

90
00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:45,128
there's something that can't do, it can't provide.

91
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:50,105
It can provide input decision to decisions but it can't replace the decision maker

92
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:55,540
and how he or she thinks about different trade offs.

93
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:01,171
So again, to hammer home the idea of limited resources here, this cartoon here.

94
00:06:01,171 --> 00:06:02,812
Now you're looking away,

95
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:08,140
says the doctor now is the time to be sick while Medicare still has some money.

96
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,432
Yeah, So the question will be trying to answer in when we do a cost

97
00:06:12,432 --> 00:06:15,141
effectiveness analysis is answering.

98
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,521
When is a health program?

99
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:18,240
Good value.

100
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,790
And we're able to answer the types of questions like suppose an educational

101
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,220
Intervention reduces risky behavior by 80 And costs $10,000.

102
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,140
Is that good value?

103
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,040
Should we invest in him?

104
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,920
And we can also answer the questions like what if

105
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,098
the reduction is only 50% 25% 10% 5%?

106
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:40,350
What if the reduction is not as good as we thought it was?

107
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,671
Is it still worth investing in?

108
00:06:42,671 --> 00:06:43,581
And those types of things?

109
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:48,540
We can answer it with cost effectiveness analysis.

110
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,104
So what is cost effect themselves is a formal method for

111
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:56,364
comparing the cost of a medical intervention with its benefits

112
00:06:56,364 --> 00:07:00,171
to determine whether the intervention is worth doing so.

113
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:04,510
The goal of this analysis is to help inform a resource allocation decision.

114
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,840
Should we allocate resources to these new interventions?

115
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,171
Cost benefit analysis is something you may have also heard of.

116
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:15,273
It's a special case of cost effectiveness analysis that assigns a dollar value to

117
00:07:15,273 --> 00:07:16,060
the benefits.

118
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,897
So saying, for example, a year of life Saved is worth $50,000 or

119
00:07:20,897 --> 00:07:26,558
a death averted is worth $5 million dollars or something.

120
00:07:26,558 --> 00:07:29,281
Cost effectiveness analysis is slightly different.

121
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:32,740
It does not assign dollar values to the health benefits.

122
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,330
It's going to measure Things along two dimensions,

123
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,520
the health dimension and the cost to mention and

124
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,191
keep those separate when these types of analyses are doing are being undertaken.

125
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:48,304
We're going to take the societal perspective to try

126
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:51,481
to consider all costs and health effects.

127
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:54,391
And this is the kind of reference case analysis.

128
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:59,145
What's recommended is you take a societal perspective considering everyone's costs

129
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,197
and health effects, the cost and

130
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:04,491
it's also recommended that you do a cost utility analysis.

131
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:08,248
So you measure those health benefits in terms of both life expectancy and

132
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:12,560
health related quality of life, in terms of something called the quality adjusted

133
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,779
life here, which we'll talk about later on in the semester.

134
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:18,318
And if you're really interested in this kind of

135
00:08:18,318 --> 00:08:21,680
thing there are some excellent books on this kind of stuff, and

136
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,240
there's a more recent version of this one just coming out.

137
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,339
So, just an example of what you might be able to do if you had cost effectiveness

138
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,519
analyses conducted, you can build something like this called a league table,

139
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,845
and this is A example hypothetical league table for

140
00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:45,640
a village in Malawi with an annual health budget of 50 $8000.

141
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,631
What you can do is you can put all of your interventions in this table and

142
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:54,268
list of their cost effectiveness ratios here, and

143
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:59,090
what you can do is you can rank these by cost effectiveness ratios and

144
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,251
the ratios with the lowest ratios are the most favorable.

145
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,325
And you can kind of go down the list here and

146
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:07,360
rank which ones you want to prioritize.

147
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,211
And you could kind of go down the list here And kind of fill up your budget.

148
00:09:11,211 --> 00:09:12,831
So we've got 50 $8,000.

149
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:16,442
The total, if we did all of them is 92,000.

150
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:17,511
So we can't do them all.

151
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:21,827
So we'd probably start going down the list and do the measles vaccination,

152
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:27,240
the STD treatment, pneumonia treatment, and then potentially some mosquito nets.

153
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,131
Okay, so that's kind of this type of analysis.

154
00:09:30,131 --> 00:09:32,670
When we do this analysis for multiple interventions,

155
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,428
we can build something like this called the league table and

156
00:09:35,428 --> 00:09:39,940
it can help us prioritize which interventions we want to do.

157
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,655
So the final question is, is this Ivory tower research actually used in

158
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:49,950
practice and and the good news for you is yes, it is at least in some settings.

159
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,201
So it explicitly is used in health systems in the U.

160
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:55,179
K. Australia and a few other countries.

161
00:09:55,179 --> 00:10:00,037
Canada Austria Germany in the US though, cost effective analysis has

162
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:04,644
been cited as key evidence for some significant decisions.

163
00:10:04,644 --> 00:10:09,081
And it's actually used by some organizations like the CDC and the V.

164
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:10,594
A. In certain situations.

165
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:13,760
But often it is used under the radar.

166
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,894
It's not explicitly used in a lot of settings, particularly for

167
00:10:17,894 --> 00:10:19,344
US private payers.

168
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:21,140
And Medicare Medicaid.

169
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,654
They don't they've talked about it, but they don't necessarily explicitly use cost

170
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:27,390
effectiveness analysis for decision making.

171
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,648
But with that said, there are thousands of cost effectiveness analysis studies

172
00:10:31,648 --> 00:10:36,640
published each years of someone must be paying attention to this.

173
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,017
So I'll leave you with this here just after this overview of cost effectiveness

174
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:46,210
analysis is healthcare is constantly being reformed and they're always challenging.

175
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,010
There's always challenging trade offs here between expanding coverage, which could be

176
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,880
exploding costs or controlling costs, which could be rationing.

177
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,065
And so, a lot of difficult decisions and

178
00:10:56,065 --> 00:11:01,035
cost effectiveness analysis can help us frame these issues and

179
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,801
really yeah, analytically quantitatively.

180
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:07,535
Look at what we think the costs and benefits will be of different

181
00:11:07,535 --> 00:11:10,256
interventions and weigh those with each other.
