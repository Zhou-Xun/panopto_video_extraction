1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,179
My like I have in the fall winter. I have this, like, fleecy blanket that goes on top of my other blankets.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,060
And I had to get out less than you said. But it is what it is, you know.

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,510
So we're going to pick up where we left off.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:24,400
So on Tuesday, Matt gave a very interesting guest lecture about, you know, the infectious disease and emergency response in Egypt.

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,750
I definitely learned a lot of new stuff. So we'll pick up where we left off, which is you're on it.

6
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:37,350
So this European network here, they have the ability to isolate and provide care for patients.

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,940
Most of them had access to onsite biosafety level three reference testing laboratories.

8
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,579
So what does that mean? So most labs that you work in as like an undergrad or grad student will typically

9
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,490
be a level one lab or level two is when you have to wear a little bit more PPE.

10
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,159
But badass biosafety level three deals with pathogens that may be harmful to human.

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,800
And then there has to be higher security for access.

12
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:12,000
So the nice thing is when you have a reference laboratory on site meeting within that same like hospital wing or facility,

13
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:20,970
you can turn around diagnostics super fast. So at the biocontainment unit originally they didn't have a BSL three in there.

14
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,120
So when the Ebola patients were like being treated and monitored,

15
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,660
they would have to run their blood samples across campus, which of course scared a lot of people.

16
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,030
Right, because you essentially have like, you know,

17
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,629
a cooler and then people with lab coats like scurrying across campus and generally people knew who was doing it.

18
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,670
So everybody knew what it was.

19
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:53,760
So after a certain point, they were able to bring a biosafety level three cabinet into the facility that like barely cleared the ceiling,

20
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,510
but they turned one of the rooms into an onsite testing laboratory.

21
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:06,480
So rather than like waiting hours potentially to get your test results back, you can get them back within an hour, which is really nice.

22
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:19,950
So these Euronet facilities also had to have special focus on health care worker, occupational safety and health and regular exercises and trainings.

23
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:27,210
So transparency in an establishment and like this network published all their findings, checklists, surveys.

24
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,700
So they did have some issues, though it wasn't all good.

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,430
So each facility did have different models of isolation across the hospital.

26
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:48,720
So some had negative pressure rooms, some had inflatable pressure tents, some had, like Trexler units or a negative pressure bed is what you see here.

27
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:57,090
They also had differing levels of terms of like standards of care, and they also differed in routine versus reserved.

28
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:06,270
So like I mentioned, that NBCU is considered a reserved use facility and that it's empty most of the time except for exercising and drills.

29
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,869
But a lot of hospital facilities can't afford to do that.

30
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:18,420
They have to have the beds occupied. Right. So interestingly, though, like for the 16 EU states involved,

31
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:31,580
that cap that went to about one ICU bed per 1 million people in terms of member nonmember states versus sorry,

32
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:39,480
high level isolation beds per member state and then intensive care unit beds, which are less high level, is up to 2.74.

33
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,610
But there were also issues in personnel management in terms of like, you know,

34
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,559
this terms of like this shift rotation and letting people off with less experience centers.

35
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,370
They didn't actually know how to backstop people or plan for that.

36
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:01,710
They had specialists available, but oftentimes they weren't trained and there was little or no compensation for teams.

37
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:10,710
So there was really like no incentive to put yourself at this additional risk or take time off of work to participate in such a center.

38
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:20,580
There were also issues regarding disinfection procedures and training on hygiene and disinfection in some facilities.

39
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,040
So you have like maybe the health care team,

40
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,479
but no environmental health services or industrial hygiene professionals kind of thinking about what happens, preparing for the care.

41
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:38,190
And then in the aftermath. And not a lot of attention is focused on the psychological aspects of patient care for health workers.

42
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:45,540
How many of you have had the opportunity to wear like a full Tyvek suit with like a big mask before?

43
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:58,220
That's very hot. But also, like if anybody is claustrophobic, for example, that can be a very, I would say,

44
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:06,920
like discombobulating experience because you're wearing it anywhere up to 4 hours at a given time and it's confined,

45
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,490
but also with the high level of care that you're.

46
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,920
Potentially giving, like you're seeing some traumatic things, right?

47
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:22,510
So people might have some secondary trauma or you might have like elevated levels of stress about potential contamination,

48
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,060
which is the purpose of training an exercise.

49
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:32,140
So you not only like prepare yourself for the skills and steps, but like psychologically prepare yourself for the tasks at hand.

50
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:39,129
But a lot of people afterwards still have like trauma associated with it.

51
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,840
I know for us at the end B.U., we did have one of the patients pass away.

52
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,930
He he was evacuated pretty, pretty late in the stage of him having Ebola.

53
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:59,620
And so our team there developed protocols which were later adapted by the CDC on how to like properly

54
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:08,470
give funeral rites and and package and transport somebody who had died of like a viral hemorrhagic fever.

55
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,379
So the family wasn't like allowed into the rooms.

56
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:20,530
So they performed last rites over webcam and try to you like adhere to the family's religious beliefs as much as possible.

57
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:27,730
And then he was transported to a partnering funeral home and then cremated.

58
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,600
And then like by that afternoon, the ashes were returned to the wife.

59
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,079
But I know the nurses who took care of the packaging and sealing of the body and all that kind of stuff.

60
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:50,230
It was very emotional for them, right, because it was a very intense 72 hours of care and then like interfacing with the family and all that stuff.

61
00:06:51,160 --> 00:07:00,520
There were also major gaps in the management of solid waste transport and again post mortem management in particular with the solid waste.

62
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:08,169
So category air pathogens are typically considered things that are like super duper, very hazardous.

63
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:17,290
So, so coronavirus is not a category a pathogen, but like Ebola plague, botulism, anthrax.

64
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:27,250
So if you have waste that's contaminated or potentially contaminated with a category, a pathogen, you have to sterilize it.

65
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:37,570
So the only way to sterilize it, John, back to that conversation is either incinerate it or you autoclave it, but you have to do it on site.

66
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:43,090
So what does that mean? That means within the hospital wing that trash has to be taken care of.

67
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:50,590
Within that wing, it can't be transported to another part of the hospital or to the local, like municipal whatever.

68
00:07:51,520 --> 00:08:01,720
So during the 2014, 2016, because Dr. Smith had the foresight to do the put it install a double pass pass through autoclaves,

69
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,430
you know, we were able to autoclave all the associated trash,

70
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:14,170
all the PPE, all the like, people's passports, money, phones, all that kind of stuff,

71
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:22,690
so that you could transform that category a level trash to category B and when is category B?

72
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:29,110
It can be thrown away in regular hospital trash, which is like super cheap.

73
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,920
It's like $0.33 a pound or something like that.

74
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:42,610
But when you have category a level trash, not a lot of facilities will want to take it to treat it.

75
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,430
So at the time this was all going on.

76
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:55,570
There was only one site in the whole of the United States in Port Arthur, Texas, that was taking the trash to incinerate it.

77
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:02,350
And because now we're moving into like the trash area, it's being transported across state lines.

78
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,200
So now the Department of Transportation is involved.

79
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:12,580
You have to get special permits to move the trash, but also accept the trash, but also be able to like hand over the trash.

80
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,880
And certain states did not allow.

81
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:21,320
Vehicles of trash to be driven through or even patients to be driven through.

82
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:30,260
So rather than taking the most direct path from like A to B, some people had to go on like this wild journey around the state to get there.

83
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:38,179
And then you can imagine, because if you're like the one place doing the thing, everybody needs your services, right?

84
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,150
So you can charge like whatever you really want.

85
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:52,100
So for us at the Nebraska biocontainment unit, I think I have slides on this potentially later we had thousands of pounds of trash,

86
00:09:52,100 --> 00:10:01,070
PPE, bed linens, all this kind of stuff, and the total cost to get rid of all the waste was a couple thousand dollars.

87
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:06,590
Where as the physician who is at MIT, who was at New York,

88
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:15,019
you like didn't know he had Ebola and then like went to Brooklyn and rode the subway and all that, and they had to do contact tracing on him.

89
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:21,979
And he was treated here. They didn't have onsite incineration or autoclave capability.

90
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:32,330
So his trash was estimated to cost anywhere between 1 to $3 million to yeah, 1 to $3 million to properly get rid of.

91
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,430
So you're only identified, you know, such issues with themselves.

92
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,139
What do we do with this solid waste? Liquid waste is like a whole other thing I mentioned.

93
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:51,440
Some people put like stabilizers in to solidify it or you just treat it before flushing it down the toilet.

94
00:10:52,340 --> 00:11:01,880
But sadly, though, the Consensus Network has not been in place since 2010, I do have a Taser, a video clip packed day.

95
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:08,180
So I'm going to show you Germany. This is one of their exercises that they did.

96
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,800
About? Oh, no. This is why the coronavirus rate in Germany is so low.

97
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:25,830
Okay. Germany may have recorded its first locally transmitted case of COVID 19 earlier than Italy, but its death rate is significantly lower.

98
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:32,700
The number of deaths in Germany has remained lower than many other countries, whether in Europe or around the world.

99
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:42,540
In fact, its fatality rate has remained relatively low, despite a surge in the number of infections in May as social restrictions were eased.

100
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:52,610
So what is Germany's secret? Germany's comprehensive mass testing is the main reasoning behind its success,

101
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:58,160
experts say, and it is spearheaded by a leading virologist called Christian Drosten.

102
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,990
Shortly after Chinese researchers published the genetic sequence of COVID 19.

103
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:14,600
On January 10th, Justin's laboratory team of a charity hospital in Berlin, Germany, created the world's first coronavirus diagnostic test.

104
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:20,780
The diagnostic test was later made publicly available by the World Health Organization on January 13.

105
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:28,610
Justin became a key adviser to the German government because of his expansive knowledge of coronaviruses in Germany.

106
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:36,880
We have a community that is very open for establishing new diagnostic assays for several structural reasons.

107
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:45,010
His team also developed the first test during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,

108
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,990
an infectious disease which claimed the lives of around 800 people in 2003.

109
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:55,900
Even before the alarm was sounded and COVID 19, Justin understood the gravity of the threat.

110
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:01,180
His early warnings to the media made him the face of Germany's fight against the pandemic.

111
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:08,920
The most effective way to prevent infections and save lives is breaking the chains of transmission.

112
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,920
And to do that, you must test and isolate.

113
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:26,500
Germany's early understanding of the virus created a sense of urgency even before the country recorded its first case on January 27th.

114
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:32,170
Laboratories around the country were already stocking up on diagnostic tests in large quantities.

115
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,750
This graph highlights the importance of early testing.

116
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:42,190
Not only was Germany more decisive, it also conducted tests much faster until the end of April.

117
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,280
Germany had conducted more tests than its neighbors.

118
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:53,270
By mid-March, it was clear Germany's preparation had paid off, despite the rapid rise in the number of confirmed cases.

119
00:13:53,630 --> 00:14:00,800
Its focus on mass testing had allowed experts to study the spread of the virus and to nip the transmission chains in the bud.

120
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:08,110
The expansive testing also ensured that the asymptomatic were isolated early,

121
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:15,610
while the sick received early treatment strategies, which experts say have reduced the mortality rate of COVID 19 in Germany.

122
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,920
Another strategy that has allowed the government to study the spread of COVID 19 is contact tracing.

123
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:28,360
This works by identifying and monitoring an infected person and the people he or she has come into contact with.

124
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,920
While the idea sounds easy executing and making sense of all the data,

125
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:41,260
is it the government's tracing is so meticulous that it even identified a salt shaker at a company cantina Munich,

126
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:48,909
as the source behind an early community spread. The German government was one of the early backers of a centralized contact

127
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,800
tracing strategy that tracked infected cases using a device's location data.

128
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,670
This proposal was eventually ditched due to privacy concerns.

129
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,010
It has since backed a decentralized approach that allows Germans to voluntarily provide

130
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:08,230
data on an application which is in line with a system being developed by Apple and Google.

131
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:17,740
As the country's effective testing and tracing strategy limited the spread its robust health system also prepared to treat those already infected.

132
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,819
We have a high number of ICU capacities here in Germany.

133
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:29,880
We have managed to increase it now in the crisis, up to 40,000 ICU beds here, and that is a high number for a country like Germany.

134
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:34,900
So we took it very serious from the very beginning and that gave us time to prepare.

135
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:41,500
And he's right. Germany was well equipped before the pandemic in January.

136
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:48,790
It already had 34 intensive care beds with ventilators for every 100,000 people, while Italy only had 12.

137
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:58,930
Germany has also increased its overall intensive care beds from 28,000 in 2017 to 40000 in 2020 because of its well-equipped hospitals.

138
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:05,620
Germany's health system was not overwhelmed, allowing it to treat other patients from Italy, Spain and France.

139
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:12,820
In the city of Heidelberg, medics were also mobilized in corona taxis to check on infected people at their homes.

140
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,890
These health care workers would conduct blood tests just five or six days after a

141
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:22,090
diagnosis to assess a patient's risk of decline and refer them to hospitals if necessary.

142
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:30,550
All these factors working in tandem at a local and federal level have given Germany the upper hand in the fight against COVID 19.

143
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,810
This has allowed Germany to slowly resuscitate its economy.

144
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,599
In May, German Chancellor Angela merkel announced the reopening of all shops,

145
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,710
schools and even the country's football league, although with no spectators.

146
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:53,400
Her government has urged Germans to abide by the social distancing rules to mitigate the risk of a second wave.

147
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,630
The easing, however, depends on the number of infections in a region.

148
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:03,329
Restrictions will be reinstated if the number of daily new infections exceeds 50 per

149
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:09,480
100,000 people in an area until the numbers subside to less than 50 for seven days.

150
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,399
Germany continues to be a model for other major European countries who have suffered

151
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,830
missteps at the early stages of the pandemic as the country continues to ease restrictions.

152
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,130
Only time will tell if its reopening strategies will keep its death rate lower than its peers.

153
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:34,050
Thank you so much for watching our video. Of reactions to that.

154
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,860
I thought it was really cool to have the health care workers mobilized to check on work.

155
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:47,980
Yeah. So they have universal health care there.

156
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:55,960
So my mom's whole family lives there after the war in Vietnam, like my dad's family came here, this one mom's family came to Germany.

157
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,130
So as a kid growing up, I would go visit my family in Germany.

158
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:10,900
And it's just such a stark contrast there. Like when refugees are resettled, they they do become like they receive welfare benefits from the state.

159
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:21,129
But essentially, like all of their health care is free. My grandparents lived in Germany subsidized housing apartment for their entire lives.

160
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:26,170
When it came time for my grandparents to be moved in, a nursing home like that was all paid for.

161
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:34,209
You know, when they started as refugees, they received like every year they would get to pick like new coats for the wintertime.

162
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:40,870
And there's all these, like, resources and supplies and like my aunt, like eventually,

163
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:47,290
like I would say I don't agree with this because I feel like at this point she's just like over using her free health care,

164
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:54,940
but now she's just like removing like sunspots and stuff like that with her dermatologist because she can and it doesn't cost anything.

165
00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:00,009
But it's very it's a very different model there.

166
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:06,969
And they do have, like a lot of doctors like, you know, back back in America, like, I don't know, the 1800s.

167
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,360
Like you'd have the doctor come to your house, right? They still do that there.

168
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:17,230
So it is it is quite different spectrum because I sanitizing this.

169
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:25,930
Okay. So moving on to infectious disease response, I'd like to highlight a couple countries, Singapore, Japan and Taiwan.

170
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:37,270
So Singapore has a population of nearly 6 million and it is a super dense country with about 20,000 people per square mile,

171
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,870
third greatest population density in the world.

172
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:52,759
But, you know, Singapore, I would say, is one on the front of high level isolation, not only in Asia, but all over the world.

173
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:58,450
So a lot of us, when we have like National Workshop and stuff, we generally have representation from Singapore.

174
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:05,770
So they had experience already was sorry in 2003 when it killed about 30 people and they took those

175
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:11,950
as lessons exposing weaknesses in their epidemiological surveillance and health care systems.

176
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:18,249
So after that, they established a disease outbreak response condition framework and they built

177
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:23,500
this really fancy facility called the National Center for Infectious Diseases,

178
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,620
which was a 330 bed purpose built management facility.

179
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:36,370
They trained about seven times as many infectious disease experts in the span of 20 years,

180
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:44,469
and the Ministry of Health there regularly conducts four yearly quarterly scenario based

181
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:51,640
simulations at all public health hospitals in the country to strengthen pandemic response plans.

182
00:20:52,150 --> 00:21:00,940
So they, like us, also have national stockpiles for PPE and vaccines for up to six months, and they have consistent public health,

183
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:08,650
education and communication on educating Singaporeans on like disease transmission, appropriate behaviors,

184
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,610
super stringent surveillance and screening, border control measures,

185
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:19,479
but also like community and social measures and what the norms are there like mask wearing

186
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:25,600
is the norm for respiratory illnesses in a lot of like southeast east Asian countries,

187
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:33,460
even pre-pandemic. I think in Singapore, like even if you like chew gum and spit on the sidewalk, they will find you like so hard.

188
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:39,310
So this is I will say this is the their National Center for Infectious Diseases.

189
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,150
This is their corporate video. So it is like a little jazzy.

190
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:50,750
But let's take a look. Okay. As a major trade and travel hub.

191
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,720
Singapore's open and porous borders make us vulnerable to the threat of infectious diseases,

192
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:01,580
as we have experienced with the Nipah virus SA's and Monkeypox.

193
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,500
For Singapore to remain vigilant of emerging infectious diseases,

194
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:13,249
the National Center for Infectious Diseases was set up as a centralized management model to manage infectious

195
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:18,770
disease outbreaks with the mission of protecting the people of Singapore from infectious diseases.

196
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:27,950
A National Referral and reference center in Sydney streamlines clinical services, public health research,

197
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:34,820
training, education and community engagement functions under one overarching structure.

198
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:42,530
Designed to strengthen Singapore's capabilities in the management and prevention of infectious diseases.

199
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:56,340
Providing specialized outpatients and in-patient infectious disease services.

200
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:05,710
Our public health units conducting surveillance, epidemiological investigations into diseases of public health importance,

201
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:13,450
and that lady detecting pathogens and supporting outbreak investigations through specialized laboratory tests.

202
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:20,570
Coordinating the national response to antimicrobial resistance across sectors.

203
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:30,050
Coordinating and facilitating infectious disease research, training and education to prepare Singapore for outbreaks.

204
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:36,980
And driving national initiatives for tuberculosis and HIV.

205
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,180
These integrated functions work together in managing emerging infections and infectious disease outbreaks.

206
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,130
Within a state of the art facility built around five design principles.

207
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:56,400
Inside, he is equipped with advanced safety features that protect the people within the building and the surroundings.

208
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:01,890
The airflow design is a single pass air conditioning system without recirculating

209
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,210
with separate air handling unit supplying fresh air to different zones.

210
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:14,190
Exhaust air passes through a top tier HEPA filter and is treated with ultraviolet rays before it is dispersed into the atmosphere.

211
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:21,000
There is clear segregation of people and materials flow and a safe and thorough waste management system.

212
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:33,590
Inside is built with capability. The past and scalability.

213
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,750
None of which would mean anything without a multi-disciplinary and dedicated team at the center.

214
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:56,770
Trying to protect the people of Singapore from infectious disease.

215
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,540
And that is why our logo is represented by a sheet.

216
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:18,120
With people at the center. The National Center for Infectious Diseases stands united with our partners and the community to keep Singapore safe.

217
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,730
It was like a movie trailer. Right.

218
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,030
I mean, besides that, that's a reaction video.

219
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:42,519
What? Good marketing. It's really downmarket. What if you saw, like, a video like that here in the United States?

220
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,730
Where would you think? Yeah.

221
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:51,860
That's obvious. Okay. Why would you say that for a volunteer?

222
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:58,100
Well, just because, like, we have probably the best health care systems available.

223
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,430
Yes, yes, yes. But access to health initiative.

224
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:07,340
So if you ask for this. Oh, that's great. But I can't access that.

225
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:11,690
Yeah, I mean, there's no way to actually get to it. Yeah, this is free for people.

226
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,270
Yeah. Free health care. We have the money to build something like this, for sure.

227
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:23,589
Yeah. The next one is is an exercise video they have.

228
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:29,229
It's still I don't know who their video producer is, but it's still like a little dramatized.

229
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:39,220
But it's it's less. You know, so this is this is they were we're doing an exercise that they videotaped.

230
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:51,130
This is fictitious. Like the more intense you know, you have to have disclaimers like any time we watch like Law and Order Special Victims Unit,

231
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:56,090
you know, like that kind of thing. Okay. Like, I mean.

232
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:12,000
You have an active and authentic homeland. I travel and I to talk about how I do.

233
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:27,050
So pretty stuff. The back.

234
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:39,690
At the time, this room was probably getting five or.

235
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:14,220
There. It does give us a good laugh, but, you know, like the fact that.

236
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:38,390
The master audio player. The best gift I can give to my lover.

237
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,730
All right. And yours is safe, too.

238
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:46,530
We don't need. That's in reactions to that video.

239
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:54,600
Okay. It's not it's not as sexy as that. But, you know, like where, you know, it's obviously dramatized.

240
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:03,179
So when you're, like, giving the camera, like anytime we're doing a suit up or an exercise, you're told not to wear makeup or anything like that.

241
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:09,509
You come clean face because you don't want that stuff smudging off or you sweating it off or like, you know,

242
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:15,870
mascara, like burning your eyes, but also glasses if you're supposed to wear contact lenses if you have them.

243
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:22,830
So they don't fogged up internally in the suit, you know, but this is this is like night.

244
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:29,760
They have really nice stuff. Like one of these pods easily cost a couple thousand dollars and depending on the place,

245
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:36,719
some places just like incinerate them afterwards or some people might try to like sterilize them and reuse them.

246
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:45,390
But yeah, I have. Yes. Paige, it looks like the suits that they're putting out here, like, a little like a little tube system like this.

247
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:50,790
That for airflow. Yeah. So that is a powered air purifying respirator.

248
00:31:51,180 --> 00:32:01,380
So essentially, like, you wear this this HEPA filter battery pack on your back and it's blowing air, clean air into your hood.

249
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,640
And then whatever you're breathing out, it's filtering it out.

250
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,839
And generally with patient care, you see people wearing these more because, number one,

251
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,540
it's more comfortable because it's not that into your face directly, but because it has some airflow.

252
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,739
It kind of cools you down while you're in there and it allows you to wear like any

253
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:27,000
intercom or earpieces and it's not uncomfortable is wearing like a tight fitting mask.

254
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,609
They're trying to improve the models because some of them, like you see them on their hoses,

255
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:39,090
they have them like wrapped in plastic and all that as an extra precaution and like a lot more expensive than.

256
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:45,510
It's like $1,000 per unit, whereas like a tight fitting mass.

257
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,340
When I get to that lecture, I have some in my office I'll bring down.

258
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:54,250
We can pass around. Those are usually like a couple hundred.

259
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,710
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

260
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:03,240
But they have all kinds of different models that you see amused, depending on the quality if you ever have a chance.

261
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,219
At the Industrial Hygiene Conference we go to annually at the Expo Hall.

262
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,570
It's all these like PPE exhibitors trying to get you to buy their brands.

263
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:19,920
So they have like a bunch of like these fancy suits and then they have like a simulation, things you can get into and all that.

264
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:30,109
Yeah. No, it's just we are having to approach it as like why aren't they all like that's yeah, that's really nice technology.

265
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:34,280
No touch technology. Right. We could again, we could be having this.

266
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,780
We just don't have these things.

267
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:49,550
So Japan, huge population, 125 million with a density of of nearly 900 people per square mile, the 11th most populated country in the world.

268
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:55,040
A little bit complicated here because it is a main island with 63 surrounding islands,

269
00:33:55,790 --> 00:34:00,350
but they as well do a really great job with infectious disease care and response.

270
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:05,360
So they have a National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Ministry of Health,

271
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:12,800
and they had an infectious disease control law implemented in 1999 to provide unified,

272
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:17,270
comprehensive lots for the comprehensive control of infectious diseases.

273
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:22,010
So they also have a national epidemiological surveillance system, which is lab based.

274
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:28,970
But in 2015, they created a unique governmental program called IDI Emergency Specialist.

275
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:41,089
And what that did was try to build the capacity of people who actually want to specialize in this field and train them specifically to deploy.

276
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:47,960
So like during the time that this was created, they like double or triple the amount of infectious disease specialist that they had.

277
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:57,740
Taiwan also a country that had really no low number of COVID deaths, and it is also very dense.

278
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:03,500
So most of its concentration population, though, is densely populated because it's very mountainous.

279
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:09,499
So they have a communicable disease medical network that was established after SA's because they

280
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:16,790
too had experience with SaaS and they had a chance to test out this network during H1N1 and Ebola.

281
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:26,749
So they spent about two decades on medical system reforms and health care workers on the support lists for infectious disease.

282
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:34,340
Emergency response deployment are required to participate in training courses, PPE exercises, annual simulation drills.

283
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:41,390
They have supply chain prioritization, strong emergency response plans, annual inspections of isolation wards,

284
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,980
and very, very strict adherence to government guidelines and mandates.

285
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,750
And that's all I had to say about those countries.

286
00:35:52,490 --> 00:36:01,790
Any thoughts or comments about those places or experiences you might want to share?

287
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:11,309
We know that this class I talked about how Vietnam did really well with the war, with the COVID response.

288
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:15,150
It wasn't my other class. Oh, it wasn't this class.

289
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:24,630
Oh, so so Vietnam in comparison to like Japan, Taiwan, Singapore is considered like a lower resource country where,

290
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,600
you know, it's becoming more capitalized, capitalistic.

291
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:36,330
Now there's about 93 million people, but they certainly don't have the level of health care facilities that those countries do.

292
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:42,780
But again, in the culturally great following directions and like doing what's good for the community.

293
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:50,520
So at the very beginning of the pandemic, they had a low number of COVID deaths.

294
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,020
Right. And it's not like it's because like the sanitation was super great or anything like that.

295
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,300
It's because people masked up and they isolated.

296
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:07,740
But also, the Ministry of Health put out this pop of a video on hand-washing that actually like the The John Oliver Show featured.

297
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:13,830
Yeah. Yeah. So you can see it later after class. You couldn't you don't have to understand the words because there's there's pictures.

298
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:22,890
But you can look up this like Vietnam handwashing video. It's pretty it's pretty creative because they get the like the pop stars to do it.

299
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,560
They're very whole lot of social capital.

300
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:36,190
So next we're moving into the portion of our class now in week four and subsequent weeks where we're going to start talking explicitly.

301
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:40,860
Oh, sorry, sweetie. I just have one quick question.

302
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:50,729
Yes. Now, we did discuss how a lot of Southeast Asian countries handle the situation very well.

303
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:57,360
Do you think one of the reasons is because most of these countries have the have

304
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:03,089
already adopted strategies of masking up whenever there is respiratory illness,

305
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,520
because in India that wasn't the case.

306
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:19,980
And despite being very densely populated and not in terms of health care, it wasn't that good in comparison to other countries.

307
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:30,330
So I know how the situation was like. It was a lot more difficult though, in terms of contact tracing and just this,

308
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:36,710
uh, um, for the majority of the population to receive proper health care.

309
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:44,670
So do you think that was one of the reasons why other Southeast Asian countries were able to handle it a little better?

310
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:50,180
Because. I think so. Like, culturally, the stigma of wearing masks wasn't there.

311
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:54,900
I can't maybe I don't want to speak to what it is like in India, because I'm not sure.

312
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:07,170
But also, I would say, do you feel like in India because they're regularly exposed to other pathogens that seem like another pathogen?

313
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:17,790
Yeah, I think that's another thing as well. They, they all really believe a lot in like just getting being naturally immune to certain things.

314
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:21,810
And I mean, there's definitely.

315
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:30,880
I guess a cultural or a religious element to the way people perceive.

316
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:40,800
Modern treatment and things. So it's not that they that everyone would just accept it just like that.

317
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:47,999
So I do remember that like convincing certain groups of people to get vaccinated

318
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,050
or receive the proper kind of treatment was an issue I was just trying to like,

319
00:39:55,470 --> 00:40:03,120
understand. I know that we we saw a lot of example of just trying to analyze.

320
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:08,670
Yeah, no, no. These are great questions. I think there is humanity, etc.

321
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:17,759
But I think culturally there has historically just been like for respiratory illnesses that practice but also in those countries.

322
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,480
Thank you, Lexie. In those countries, I think there is also great trust in the health care system.

323
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:36,240
I d would you say that is true in India? That is true if everyone had like access to thank you like c, you know,

324
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,610
proper health care there but nearby because the problem with most rural areas

325
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:46,830
is that they have to travel a really long distance just to get to a hospital.

326
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:57,719
Mhm. I think that is one of the main reasons why you know they don't um if they, if they have access to it then they definitely do have,

327
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,820
they're putting a lot of trust in them,

328
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:10,720
but otherwise it is a little difficult to and I think also because most of them aren't educated that well it's a little.

329
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:16,079
You you have to put in extra efforts to sort of like convince them and make them

330
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:24,090
understand certain things which are basic to people who are who receive basic education.

331
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:28,470
Mhm. So I think that is another factor for sure.

332
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:34,440
And also like 93 million people versus like 1 billion people is, is a huge difference is.

333
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:39,899
Thank you. So I think Huddah there is a book which is going to email you after class of the

334
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,960
Comparative Politics and policy of COVID 19 is done by two researchers here.

335
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,870
It's free to download. Oh, maybe you can.

336
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:54,409
Yeah, because I was like, it's not quite like the index of like the system, but it talks about like, what are the policies?

337
00:41:54,410 --> 00:42:02,380
So India's in the book, if you want to read more about that and you can read more about other countries, I think Japan is in it.

338
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,780
Okay. Yeah. If you share that with me, I'll post it as an announcement for the class.

339
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:12,330
Cool. Thank you. Yeah, definitely a lot of factors.

340
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:18,150
But I think like especially in East and South Eastern Asian and even South Asian countries,

341
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:28,070
we see this confluence of like Westernized medical, medical practices, but we're still doing our own like natural holistic practices.

342
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:33,600
So like, you know, when I got COVID, like I talk, I texted my mom, she doesn't live here.

343
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:48,030
I was told like gargle hot water was salt and then, you know, Vicks Vicks on the feet with socks, we do something called Dao ja,

344
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:56,759
which is basically like you put Vicks on your chest in your bag and you use a spoon to break the subdermal capillaries.

345
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,180
And it looks like someone like whipped you basically.

346
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:06,089
But it's just a like it's like called releasing like to release the wind because they believe that, ah,

347
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:14,760
we have this other thing called Yo Sadan, which is like a green oil that just like fixes our remedy, like, you know, a tiger.

348
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:19,950
Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, we still use that with, like, NyQuil and Ibuprofen, right?

349
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:27,899
But it's like combining things or my friend who is also Indian and I was texting with her, she lives in Toronto.

350
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:34,770
She was like, you should drink milk with turmeric in it because that will help prevent the inflammation as I can't drink milk.

351
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:39,210
But that sounds delightful. Yeah, yeah, that's good.

352
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:46,799
Turmeric and a little bit of black pepper is actually a good remedy for like if you have a sore throat or something.

353
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,110
And I see, like, I don't know if it was Starbucks, but they started selling.

354
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:56,260
That said, was it like a new innovation or something?

355
00:43:56,290 --> 00:44:01,570
We've been doing that. All Yeah, yeah. But yeah, yeah, yeah.

356
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:09,209
And there's all this whole, like, clean, clean girl culture now or like that, like Inspo girl,

357
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:15,990
where it's like, I wake up at 5 a.m. and I have perfect hair and I do my yoga and like,

358
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:20,729
you know, and then I and it's a lot of like a cultural appropriation, you know, it's like,

359
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:25,680
whereas like the first 2 hours I wake up, I'm still like getting over the trauma of being alive.

360
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,260
So it's like, you know, very different. Okay, so thank you so much.

361
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:39,180
So now we're moving into the portion of the class where we're going to, like tackle head on and continue to integrate throughout the semester.

362
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:44,850
Systemic racism, environmental justice, systemic social justice.

363
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:50,460
Right. So, you know, this is where community guidelines will really come into play here.

364
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:58,230
So, you know, I know we've all you've probably you've definitely heard about racism for sure.

365
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:07,300
I don't really honestly know to what extent your other professors make a concerted effort to cover these topics in class.

366
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,990
But all of you come from very different backgrounds as well.

367
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:20,680
So just to get us all on the same page, I'm going to frame what we're considering the levels of racism in this class in the context of this class,

368
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:25,930
and then just give like a rundown on like racism and microaggressions and then why

369
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:30,550
we're talking about it in relation to infectious disease and emergency response.

370
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:36,040
So, you know, obviously, I am not like a racial.

371
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,640
Like a race and ethnicity scholar. That is not what my doctorate is and that's not what my training is in.

372
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:51,010
Like, I'm just like the rest of you are trying to figure out how to adapt and exist and be like as mindful as possible.

373
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:56,110
So what I'm not some ground rules is what I'm not able to do.

374
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,760
Obviously, I can't speak on behalf of all people who may share my identities.

375
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:04,899
I can't erase all the discrimination and injustice in the world.

376
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:11,290
And I may not always be able to resolve every issue of racism or cultural insensitivity.

377
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:16,600
But what I can try to do is serve as a a good moderator, a facilitator for this class.

378
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:23,980
What I am able to do is educate you about systems of oppression that affect us as a society.

379
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:32,740
In this context of this course, both positively and negatively, and then maybe provide some action items to be more inclusive.

380
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:39,460
And I'm hoping all of you will be able to have an open mind, allow yourself to be like a little bit uncomfortable,

381
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:44,620
acknowledge your own personal lens and biases, try your best to fully engage.

382
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:57,140
And then again agreed to our community guidelines. So there are many different definitions of racism by organizations, scholars and individuals.

383
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:03,110
We're going to be using the definitions provided by Dr. Camara, Phyllis Jones.

384
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:11,750
So she's a senior fellow at the Satcher Health Leadership Institute and Cardiovascular Research Institute at Morehouse.

385
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:20,809
And she was the former president of the American Public Health Association back when I was a master's student, actually very formative during my time.

386
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,180
So I got to see her as a keynote speaker a couple of times,

387
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:30,440
and she's a really well respected researcher in social epi research methods, social determinants of health and anti-racism.

388
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:40,370
So rather than making you read this article, we'll watch her talk about this because I think she's very like great and explaining things in a motive.

389
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:48,050
It isn't like a little bit longer of a video. So I'm actually going to put it on 1.25, which I think is will be fine.

390
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:54,230
But if it gets too crazy I'll elderly back. But this is how many of you are familiar with the gardener's tale.

391
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:00,150
Okay. Okay. Sorry if you you handful. It's kind of like a repeat that.

392
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:13,360
Okay. Okay. All right. I'm sitting down with Dr. Camara Jones, my colleague at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

393
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:16,480
Why do you think that racism is important for public health professionals?

394
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:22,150
Well, right now we have a national commitment to eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health by the year 2010.

395
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:28,959
But it's not like in 1998 when President Clinton and Dr. Satcher announced this initiative,

396
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,150
that that was the first time people noticed that there were racial disparities.

397
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,630
Public health people have known about these disparities and been trying to address them for decades.

398
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:40,210
But I think that we haven't been successful because we've just been our approaches have been sort of pruning at the edges.

399
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:45,660
And I think that if we're really going to be successful at eliminating racial and ethnic disparities, we need to deal with the fundamental causes.

400
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:51,220
And it's my analysis that racism is one of the fundamental causes of racial disparities in health outcomes.

401
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:58,270
I think we're going to have to think more broadly than just intervening in medical care.

402
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:02,790
We have to think more broadly than just our public health strategies. We need to think about other factors.

403
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:08,110
We need to think about systems and changing the way that systems impact on people, the way that opportunity is structured in this country.

404
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,120
We need to think very broadly about.

405
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:18,560
How this how living this country is producing these these differences if we're going to be successful in eliminating them.

406
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:22,460
You talk about multiple levels of racism. Can you explain these three levels?

407
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,069
I do think about racism and talk about racism at three levels.

408
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:29,600
And I do that because, first of all, it helps us to try to figure out, well, how could racism be operating here?

409
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:35,120
How could racism be impacting blood pressure? You know, and it also helps us to think about how would we intervene.

410
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:42,620
So the three levels of racism that I describe are institutionalized racism, personally mediated racism and internalized racism.

411
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:47,480
So I'm going to briefly define each of those levels for you and give you some examples of how how they impact on health.

412
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:54,710
Institutionalized Racism. My brief definition is differential access to the goods, services and opportunities of society by race.

413
00:49:54,980 --> 00:50:01,070
And this kind of racism is a kind of racism that is often manifest as an inherited disadvantage.

414
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:04,490
It's institutionalized in our norms, in our customs, in our laws.

415
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:09,410
And it's often invisible to people because it's not that you can there's no identifiable perpetrator.

416
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:12,320
You can say, this person did something. If somebody was born into poverty.

417
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,470
It's manifest in terms of material conditions and in terms of access to power.

418
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:20,809
So examples of material conditions like differential access to quality education or found housing or job

419
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:25,850
opportunities or equal income for the same job differential access to health care and health care facilities.

420
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,089
So when people ask me, are you talking about racism or socioeconomic status,

421
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:35,270
I say that institutionalized racism explains the fact that there is an association between race and socioeconomic status in this country.

422
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:38,719
And that's a very, very important point. The other thing,

423
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,570
before I go into the other levels of racism that I like to say about institutionalized

424
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:45,860
racism is that it can be through acts of commission or acts of omission.

425
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:53,030
And very often institutionalized racism is manifest as inaction in the face of need for personally mediated racism.

426
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:56,900
My quick definition is differential assumptions about the abilities,

427
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:01,970
motives and intense of others by race, and then differential actions based on those assumptions.

428
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,750
So that's what most people think of when they hear racism. Somebody did something to somebody.

429
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:11,090
It is, in fact, the prejudice, the different idea and the discrimination, the different action.

430
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:15,710
Now, how could that impact on your help? Well, certainly police brutality impacts on people's health,

431
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:20,839
but you also have examples of within the health care system, physician, what I call physician disrespect,

432
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:26,360
which could be as subtle as a physician feeling that a patient couldn't understand certain

433
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,510
directions or didn't comply or couldn't afford or wouldn't be interested in certain treatments.

434
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,900
Or it could be as blatant as sterilization abuse. I'm personally mediated racism.

435
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,760
Other examples of teacher devaluation.

436
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:42,540
A teacher look at a young child figuring that that child can't learn or interpreting that child's questions at a low level

437
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,310
sophistication as opposed to a higher level of sophistication in sort of tracking that child in a whole wrong trajectory.

438
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:52,010
That's not going to let them realize their full potential. So there are many, many examples of disrespect when you go shopping, all of that,

439
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:58,220
all of the things that are part of everyday racism, I think add to our stress and directly or indirectly impact our health.

440
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:02,120
What I like to say about person mediated racism is that like institutionalized racism,

441
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,570
it can be through acts of commission doing as well as acts of omission not doing.

442
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:12,020
But also, it's very, very important to realize that personally mediated racism can be unintentional as well as intentional.

443
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:15,740
People do not have to mean to have been racist, to have a racist outcome.

444
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:19,700
Moving on to the third level of racism that I describe, internalized racism.

445
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:26,240
My definition of that is acceptance by members of the stigmatized races of negative messages about our own abilities and intrinsic worth.

446
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:35,120
So that is a kind of racism that manifests in terms of helplessness and hopelessness and self devaluation, self-evaluation,

447
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:41,090
feeling that you really can't do or you shouldn't aspire to be a physician or a teacher or whatever that may be.

448
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,290
That's not for you. And of course, person mediated racism, getting you to revise that.

449
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:48,320
But when you internalize those messages and don't try anymore.

450
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:54,170
I talk about this syndrome called the white man's ice cold syndrome as part of internalized racism.

451
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:57,230
And what do I mean by that? Well, that expression comes from my parents generation.

452
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,890
If you were black and you needed a lawyer, you might pick a white lawyer over a black lawyer.

453
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:03,530
Or if you needed a doctor, you might pick a white actor over a black doctor.

454
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:08,900
In fact, if you needed ice, you might go and buy the white man's ice over the black man's eyes because the white man's ice is colder.

455
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,979
You have deeply internalized that white is superior in terms of the helplessness and hopelessness.

456
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:18,830
I think that turns into a lot of self-destructive health behaviors. So I would just kind of summarize internalized racism by saying that it's.

457
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:26,790
Accepting the limitations of the box into which we can put. Accepting that there are certain ways to be, for example,

458
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:32,820
in black ways to be or Latino ways to be accepting that black folks don't play violin or do ballet, you know,

459
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:36,870
whatever the stereotypes are or that if you're trying to if you're smart and trying to achieve in school,

460
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:42,240
that you're acting white since wind at white people claim that. So those are the three levels of racism that I describe.

461
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:48,060
And I think that when we're asking ourselves in a public health setting, how could racism be causing, you know, higher rates of diabetes?

462
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:51,840
We can think about, well, how could that be happening on the level of institutionalized racism?

463
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,950
How could it be happening at the level of person databases? And how could it be happening in terms of internalized racism?

464
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:01,890
And that will guide us, first of all, if we're researchers in the kinds of questions we might want to ask when we also try to be interventionist,

465
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:06,750
it will guide us and where we need to intervene. I've heard you use a story to illustrate these three levels of racism.

466
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:11,160
I believe that you call it the gardener's tale. It's a very powerful story. Can you share it with us?

467
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:14,340
This story, which I call levels of racism, a gardener's tale.

468
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:19,360
Actually, like most of the stories that I tell, I've developed quite a few allegories for understanding race and racism,

469
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,170
and like most of them, comes from one of my own personal experiences.

470
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:27,870
This gardener has two forward boxes, one which she know to have which fertile soil and one which she knows to have more rocky soil.

471
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:31,650
And she has seed for the same kind of flowers, in-patients, let's say,

472
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:35,610
except some of the seed is going to produce pink blossoms and some are going to produce red blossoms.

473
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:39,240
And the gardener prefers red over pink. So what does she do?

474
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:44,550
She takes to bad seed and she puts it in the rich, fertile soil, and she takes the pixie and she throws it into the poor rocky soil.

475
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:48,780
And in three weeks in her garden, the same thing happens that I call my garden all of the red flowers.

476
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:53,520
You know, not only stop it, they're flourishing. And growing up, even the weak seed of the red makes it to a middling height.

477
00:54:53,580 --> 00:55:01,200
But in the poor rocky soil, the week she died and even the strongest, he was struggling, struggling, struggling to make that same middling height.

478
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,509
And then in those boxes, those will always go to seed and drop the seed in the same soil.

479
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:11,489
And then the next year the same thing happens. And that's why I was going to see and year after year, the same thing happens.

480
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:17,490
And so finally, the gardener two years later is looking at her garden and she says, you know, I was right to prefer red over pink.

481
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:24,180
Now I'm going to stop the story there. To say that that's that's part of the story has been about institutionalized racism.

482
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:30,360
You had the initial historical insult of the separation of the seed at two different kinds of soil.

483
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,990
And then you had, through acts of omission, not attending to this the perpetuation of this situation.

484
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:40,470
And you even had the contemporary structural factors, the flower boxes keeping the soil separate.

485
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:44,520
Now, you might ask, well, where would personally mediated racism be in this garden?

486
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:48,719
Well, that would be when the gardener is looking at the flowers and she looks over there and says, Oh, how beautiful.

487
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,740
It looks over the pink of this. Oh, how scrawny. And she plucks the pink blossoms before they can even go to see.

488
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:59,010
Or she notices that a pink seed has been blown into the rich, fertile soil and she plucks it out before it can establish itself.

489
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,610
And then you say, well, where is internalized racism in this garden?

490
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:07,770
Well, that's where the pink flowers are struggling, and they're in their box and they're looking over at the red.

491
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:12,360
The red is just all, you know, flourishing and haughty, even about it.

492
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:19,950
And the pink flowers, they would be coming in and out collecting pollen or actually collecting nectar, but pollinating them in tiny.

493
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:23,339
So it's over into red flowers and it comes over and it gets into a pink flower and then it comes over.

494
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:26,220
In this next thing, flower says, Stop me, don't bring me any of the pollen.

495
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:32,100
I prefer the red because the pink flowers have internalized that red is there in the pink looking over there and it looks that way.

496
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:36,180
So the question arises, what do you do to set things right in this garden?

497
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,389
Well, you could start by addressing the internalized racism.

498
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:42,660
So you could go over and you could talk to the pink flowers and you could say your power to the pink.

499
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:46,139
Pink is beautiful. And that might make them feel better.

500
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:49,170
But that in and of itself will not change the condition in which they're living.

501
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:53,670
We can say, no, no, we're not going to do with the internalized racism. Let's deal with the personally mediated racism.

502
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:57,180
So you might go over and talk to the gardener or you might even, you know, let's not just talk to her.

503
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,989
Let's hold a workplace, you know, multicultural workshop for the gardener.

504
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:04,170
And you say, Dear Gardener, would you please stop plucking those pink blossoms?

505
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:09,870
And maybe she will. Maybe she won't. But even if she does, that's not going to change the situation which the people always find themselves.

506
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:14,580
What you really have to do if you want to set things right and address the institutionalized racism.

507
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:20,489
So you either have to break down the boxes and accept this oil, or if you want to keep separate boxes, which is okay too, I guess.

508
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:23,830
Although it makes it much easier to segregate resources, I think that if you want to do that,

509
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:27,450
then you enrich the poor rocky soil until it's as rich as the rich fertile soil.

510
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:32,549
And when you do that, the pink flowers will flourish. It's interesting.

511
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:37,500
They may even do. Then look at it in the red flowers because they've been selected for survival and strength, which is an interesting notion.

512
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:39,420
But when you do that, the pink flowers will flourish.

513
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:44,430
And when they flourish, then you have also addressed the internalized racism because no longer do looking over at red,

514
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:47,160
wanting to be bad or thinking red is better because they'll see how beautiful they are.

515
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:53,820
And you might even over time address the personally mediated racism. Now the original gardener may have to go to her grave, preferring that over pain.

516
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:59,880
But her children, who grow up and see the two parts know equally beautiful will be less likely to adopt those kinds of attitudes.

517
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,900
One of the gardener really thought that pink was inferior to red.

518
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:09,780
And this is when we get into the whole notion of biologic determinism. What if she thought that the pink seed was weaker than red?

519
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:13,259
She wouldn't even ask the question, What can I do to set things right in the garden?

520
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,880
Because she would think that there was no other way it could be.

521
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:19,470
I raised this because so much of when we a scientist and as public health practitioners.

522
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,340
Document race associated differences, which is important.

523
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:27,710
But if we do that without thinking more deeply to see what is causing these race associated differences,

524
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:31,280
then we are contributing to ideas of biological determinism.

525
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,790
And I think that we have to recognize as scientists that, yes, we must.

526
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:38,599
When we see these differences, we must continue to measure things by race as long as there are racial differences.

527
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,049
But we have to ask a deeper question why do these differences occur?

528
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:46,580
And not just leave it as that? We must start asking questions, including questions about how is racism contributing here?

529
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:51,200
The most important part of the story we haven't talked about yet. That's to ask the question who is the gardener?

530
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:58,670
Because after all, it's the gardener who has the ability to to move, the ability to act, the ability to decide the control of resources.

531
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:02,210
And in our context in the United States, the gardener is our government.

532
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:08,359
And I think it's particularly troublesome if the gardener has a preference for one side of the other.

533
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:12,250
You know, usually I have some slides that I show and I paint the gardener red, which is why she prefers red over pink.

534
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:18,200
And it's also a problem if the gardener does not have a commitment to equity.

535
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:23,600
That is, if the gardener doesn't care. Is a gardener so identified with a red box that it's the garden?

536
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:27,770
It's not even caring what's happening in the other pink box. I mean, that's not even part of her definition of the garden.

537
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:32,240
You know, I think that at least in this country now what our initiative to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities

538
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:37,040
has given us is an explicit commitment to equity and explicit that we're going to eliminate disparities.

539
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:41,930
And so that equips us to say, okay, now we have to take a look at this garden, take a look at what's happening and try to make things right.

540
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:48,830
So what this story has been about is to illustrate the three levels of racism institutionalized, personally mediated and internalized racism,

541
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:52,730
and to further give us guidance to suggest and if we want to set things right in this garden,

542
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:56,570
then we have to at least address the institutionalized racism. We can address the other levels at the same time,

543
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:00,680
but we must at least see institutionalized racism and if we do the other way to take care of ourselves,

544
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:05,450
and now we understand to change the garden that we need to focus on institutionalized racism.

545
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:12,379
But how do we really measure that type of racism? Well, to start addressing institutionalized racism, I think we have to do three things.

546
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:16,310
We have to be brave and vocal about naming racism.

547
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:18,529
I think we have to monitor data.

548
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:25,610
We need to ask ourselves, could racism be here and monitor data sentinel to identify where we need to take a closer look.

549
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:30,860
And then finally, we need to identify mechanisms, ask how is racism operating here?

550
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:34,820
Let's talk about what CDC is doing to address racism and health disparities.

551
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:39,350
Well, I guess one of the first things I mean, we will eventually.

552
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:45,170
But, you know, so that was me. That was from 2014.

553
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:50,550
But this was filmed in 2002. So that's one yeah.

554
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:54,140
Yeah, it was uploaded in 2014. It's 122.

555
01:00:54,380 --> 01:01:00,050
But I think she has such a beautiful, clear job of explaining it.

556
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:05,280
She has another a new allegory now about like a cliff that she has some animations where she does a talk.

557
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:09,740
But any thoughts or reactions to that to that video?

558
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:19,490
I put the full paper on canvas if you want to read it. Oh, right.

559
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:30,020
So. Okay. So again, just her definition of institutionalized racism.

560
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:34,190
But this is also sometimes other people refer to it as structural racism.

561
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:42,320
But other definitions do distinguish institutional and structural racism, actually.

562
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:49,309
So the Racial and Social Justice Initiative defines institutional racism as policies, practices,

563
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:56,810
procedures in a culture of an institution or system that work better for white people and cause harm for people of color,

564
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:06,979
often inadvertently or unintentionally, where, as they say, structural racism is the history, culture, current reality across institutions or systems.

565
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:14,000
So they see institutional racism as being, you know, a piece of the puzzle of larger structural racism.

566
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:21,620
United Way for Southeast Michigan. They say that it is institutional racism, is discriminatory treatment,

567
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:29,810
unfair policies and practices in equal up and equitable opportunities, impacts within race, within organizations and institutions.

568
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:36,290
Whereas again, they say structural racism is the system of public policies, institutional practices,

569
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:47,420
cultural representations and other norms in work, reinforcing ways to perpetuate racial group inequality and racial bias.

570
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:50,390
So they do make that distinction now.

571
01:02:52,560 --> 01:03:02,430
This is Dr. Jones definition of personally mediated risk, this personally mediated racism, something sometimes called interpersonal racism.

572
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:07,070
I think this is the one that, you know, people most easily identify.

573
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:12,149
Right. But, you know, they also have other definitions.

574
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:18,090
So prejudgment, bias or discrimination by a white individual towards a person of color.

575
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:25,230
I kind of disagree with this because persons of color can be racist towards other persons of color as well.

576
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:34,120
United Way for Southeast Miss Eastern Michigan calls it interpersonal racism, an expression of racism between individuals.

577
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:39,720
It occurs when individuals interact and their private beliefs affect those interactions.

578
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:45,880
Then lastly, this is her definition of internalized racism that she talked about in the video.

579
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:55,180
And these are very long definitions. So you can look at them on a slide united way set of privately held beliefs,

580
01:03:55,180 --> 01:04:00,760
prejudices and ideas about the superiority of whites and the inferiority of people of color.

581
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:09,009
And the Racial and Social Justice Initiative differentiates it between two types of internalized racial inferiority,

582
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:17,380
internalized racial superiority, whereas the inferiority is acceptance and acting out of an inferior definition of self.

583
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:23,709
Rooted in the historical designation of one's race and the opposite of that acceptance and

584
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:30,610
acting out of superior definition of South rooted in historical designation of one's race.

585
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:39,550
So, you know, sometimes people might refer to that as a white privilege or entitlement, but you can you can look further for those definitions.

586
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:46,150
Okay. Post, Chad. How are we feeling?

587
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:56,530
I just hear a lot of scoffs. I don't know what that means. We feeling bothered?

588
01:04:57,890 --> 01:05:02,970
No. Okay. No one's bothered. Enlightened. Not enlightened either.

589
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:09,540
Britain is like an indifferent oak tree.

590
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:14,440
Intrigued. Is anyone uncomfortable? Okay, cool.

591
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:25,400
So I did ask our own Diversity and Inclusion Office to actually come give this talk today, but they said they were too busy.

592
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:29,900
So you can ask because I had that same question.

593
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:35,420
So these next set of slides come from our former DCI director,

594
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:43,640
who is now the Diversion Diversity and Inclusion Coordinator at the Eskenazi and Jacobs School at Indiana University.

595
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:51,469
Sashi Watson She was great. She used to come to my intro to industrial hygiene course to kind of give this talk,

596
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:54,770
but she did leave me with her slides, so I definitely want to credit her for them.

597
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,760
So I'm going to do my best to just like go through them.

598
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:06,020
But again, we're just, you know, today and after today I think I'm actually going to be caught up on schedule haha.

599
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:11,509
So just some introductory terms. First is colorblindness.

600
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:18,440
So people use this to refer to ignoring racial differences or characteristics.

601
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:22,670
Some people might say things like, I don't see color, for example.

602
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:31,030
Intersectionality refers to how different power structures interact in the lives of minorities.

603
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:36,610
So this might include like race, gender, class, ability and ethnicity.

604
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:43,370
So for example, like the intersectionality of my identity is like I am a young Asian-American woman.

605
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:47,380
Right. So I'm Asian-American. I'm a woman. I'm in academia.

606
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:52,960
You know, like these kinds of things make up the intersectionality of my identities.

607
01:06:54,520 --> 01:07:01,630
Bias is an attitude that is favorable or unfavorable towards people, groups or things.

608
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:10,780
So, for example, if someone is biased towards women, they might display that a bias by hiring a man over a more qualified woman.

609
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,170
Or if someone is biased towards a certain religion,

610
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:21,790
they might show it by making like rude or insensitive com comments or go as far as like vandalizing religious buildings,

611
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:30,160
which I think is more than bias. That's just racism. And then it might show some bias towards political affiliation as well.

612
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,120
One irony of you on academic Twitter.

613
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:44,260
It is. Why? So last night I saw this tweet that was like probably didn't go as they planned.

614
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:54,010
So Rice University, which is in Texas, just announced their cohort of postdoc scholars who are coming into the tenure track for engineering.

615
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:58,710
And it is like two rows of just dudes.

616
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:05,229
And the comments on the jokes below it were like chef's kiss, right?

617
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:09,340
But that might be like maybe something Rice University may not be aware of.

618
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:16,090
I mean, yes. Are there generally there are more women in STEM now than there used to be, and there are certainly women in engineering.

619
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:22,600
But is there some kind of bias, inherent or implicit bias at play in this program,

620
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:29,260
in particular in terms of like who they're selecting to be in the program and who they're choosing to advance in the program?

621
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:39,130
Okay. So implicit bias refers to attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding actions or decisions in an unconscious manner.

622
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:48,040
So this type of bias does not have to require the perceiver to either endorse it or devote attention to its expression.

623
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:53,860
Whereas explicit bias refers to attitudes and believes we know we have and report.

624
01:08:54,790 --> 01:09:00,220
So this is more like rational and higher level thinking rather than like subconscious.

625
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:09,459
So for example, an implicit bias might be like if you see somebody walking towards you of a different race or ethnicity,

626
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:15,670
like you might hold your purse tighter or your backpack closer because you think they're going to like bribe you or something, right?

627
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:28,149
Whereas explicit bias is like people who belong to the KKK who actively discriminate against minority members bigotry, prejudice and discrimination.

628
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:33,010
I know these terms seem very, very similar, but there is some nuance to it.

629
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:38,979
So bigotry is a stubborn and complete intolerance of other creeds, beliefs,

630
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:45,220
opinions that differ from one's own, whether that is religious but also political as well.

631
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:53,260
Prejudice is prejudging or forming opinion before becoming aware of the relevant facts in that case.

632
01:09:54,130 --> 01:10:00,730
And then discrimination is the practice of unfairly treating a person or group of different than than you.

633
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:03,800
Or from people of other groups of.

634
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,230
Yes. Microaggressions.

635
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:12,360
Now, this one is a big one. And this is you see this a lot.

636
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:17,020
You see explicit in implicit bias, a lot in health care and even in public health.

637
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:23,800
But microaggressions is still very rampant, and this one is the hardest to document.

638
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:31,809
So this is a common or action that subtly and often unconsciously or unintentionally expresses

639
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:37,570
a prejudice attitude toward a member of a marginalized group such as a racial minority.

640
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:46,270
Microaggressions are often brief and commonplace, and they can be verbal, behavioral or environmental indignities.

641
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:50,030
So there are three forms of microaggressions.

642
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:52,149
First is micro insults.

643
01:10:52,150 --> 01:11:03,820
So these are verbal and nonverbal communications that subtly convey rudeness or insensitivity and demean a person's racial heritage or identity.

644
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:14,500
So then there's micro assaults. So this is conscious and unintentional actions or slurs using like racial epithets or displaying

645
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:20,890
swastikas or deliberately serving a white person before a person of color in a restaurant.

646
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:26,620
And then there's micro validations, which is communications that exclude,

647
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:34,900
negate or nullify the thoughts, feelings or experiential, experiential reality of a person of color.

648
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:39,130
So, I mean, if you think about it for a second,

649
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:44,290
it's very likely at some point you've either experienced one of these forms

650
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:51,070
of microaggressions yourself or you've seen somebody make progress towards.

651
01:11:51,940 --> 01:12:03,580
So an example for me, for example, when I used to work at this other university, I was a faculty member, but I wasn't on the tenure track.

652
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:07,779
I was not tenured and I didn't have a Ph.D. at the time.

653
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:12,310
And I'm like one of the few young Asian-American faculty there.

654
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:20,409
So I was being moved out of a cubicle because I was like, you know, my my supervisor was like, why is she in an open cubicle?

655
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:26,050
Like, all the other academic specialists of her rank have their own office, right?

656
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:31,630
So space was a tight commodity in that building, just like this building.

657
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:35,470
So they were thinking about, like different places to put me.

658
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:42,429
And I was working with the dean who does facilities or whatever and they're at I iu

659
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:46,960
they very much explicitly had like what they called and were very open about it.

660
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:51,100
Good old boys club, which they have.

661
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:58,610
What do you do? Right. And so we were kind of going around so like different places about like where your office could be.

662
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:08,410
And so, like the first option was above the basketball courts in the gym, which was like this, like look out Hawkeyes, Hawks Nest facility.

663
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:14,580
But it was like a not a cube farm, but like a shared open space that usually postdocs are in.

664
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:16,270
So that was my first option.

665
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:26,980
Another option was a storage closet in one of the haunted houses owned hotel that the university owned across from the school.

666
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:31,300
And this dean said to me there, this assistant Dean said, like,

667
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:37,250
I would never put a tenured track professor in here, but for someone like you, it's okay.

668
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:44,949
Right. So I'm like thinking to myself, like, I've never one of those people in the moment where I'm like super quick on my feet.

669
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:49,510
I'm like, that person 2 hours later, that's like that was messed up.

670
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:54,489
And so when he said that, I didn't know what he meant by that.

671
01:13:54,490 --> 01:14:03,040
Does he mean because of my rank, my education, my gender, my ethnicity, like all of the above?

672
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:06,220
Like, I don't know what that means. Right.

673
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:18,040
He was very, very good at the microaggressions or like even micro validations here, where I think especially myself as a person of color,

674
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:23,140
sometimes I wonder if I'm being too sensitive about things or if I'm, like,

675
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:31,120
gaslighting myself into thinking I'm being sensitive because what they call microaggressions are a death by a thousand cuts.

676
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:34,120
Right? Because it's not it's not as explicit.

677
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:41,769
It's someone calling me like a slur, like, you know, like Asian slurs or like yelling at me like, oh, I have to China or something like that.

678
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:46,390
Right. But these subtle microaggressions are just like a little paper cut.

679
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:51,790
And every time you get one, it just keeps adding up and it adds up and it adds up.

680
01:14:52,840 --> 01:15:01,659
So even here, my friend Validations, I get told a lot to like.

681
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:05,559
Rather than acknowledging my experiences, I'm told to practice forgiveness.

682
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:12,150
Which is one of the. Tenants of the school or I'm told to continue being gracious, which I'm like, What does that even mean?

683
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:16,110
And you certainly wouldn't tell this to like a senior white male, right?

684
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:20,370
So so these are like forms of microaggressions.

685
01:15:20,370 --> 01:15:24,929
And you even see this in the health care setting. More so implicit bias.

686
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:27,330
And we'll talk about that as the semester goes on.

687
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:33,960
Does anyone want to share their experiences or have any thoughts or comments about microaggressions?

688
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:45,510
Hood up. What you are seeing now, I really struggle with like we do like community guidelines and they say assume positive intent.

689
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:54,209
And for me, that's just like a way of protecting the person who did the harm rather than like being like,

690
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:59,940
I have to manage how I respond to them or like there are certain guidelines on how I can respond that

691
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:05,130
that was not taken into consideration when they said something and there might have been positive intent.

692
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:14,009
Sure. And all behind it. I also really struggle with like that the way we talk about like implicit and explicit bias,

693
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:21,960
because there usually is that association, that explicit is at the level of like using the example in the slides, the Ku Klux Klan.

694
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:30,480
But it doesn't even need to if it's almost a way of saying, well, I'm not that like you want to really distance yourself from it.

695
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:38,880
And I almost like I feel like implicit bias is just a way for people to not have to take accountability.

696
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:43,930
Like, it's just a way for them to say, like, Oh, well, I didn't know that wasn't my intent, but I.

697
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:50,860
There are still habits that you have and required, like a conscious like paying attention to what's going on.

698
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,760
So those are some of the challenges that I have when people.

699
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:59,489
Like not the way you presented it, but just like when people talk about like, oh, it's implicit bias.

700
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:03,750
It wasn't like those are challenges. I. Yeah.

701
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:10,420
Thank you for sharing that. And I will say one thing that we do talk about is intent versus impact.

702
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:19,149
So even if you didn't intend something to come across in a certain way, there's still an impact on that person.

703
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:28,000
Right. So, you know, there's this my Angela Angela quote that's like sometimes people won't remember what you said or what you did,

704
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:35,170
but they'll remember how you made them feel. So even if someone's intent wasn't something,

705
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:44,410
if they let you know that this had a negative impact on them or you made them feel a certain way, naturally people want to be defensive.

706
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:55,030
Right. But what we're trying to learn, even myself trying to learn is that if that was the impact, own up to it and just apologize.

707
01:17:55,030 --> 01:18:00,270
Like apologizing and acknowledging it doesn't really cost that much.

708
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:08,169
I mean, some some people may have a lot of pride, but acknowledging the impact of what you said or what you did on that person and then

709
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:13,389
reflecting potentially on how could I have communicated that better or gone about it better?

710
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:20,470
Or if that was your intent and you don't plan to apologize, at least that person now knows kind of where you stand, right?

711
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:33,400
Yeah. Yeah. So a few generalized themes we'll discuss in in the coming weeks is how institutionalized racism relates to infectious disease outbreaks,

712
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:39,370
environmental hazards, how disasters exacerbate conditions, levels of exposure,

713
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:45,460
and then institutionalized and personally mediated racism in aid and response.

714
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:53,799
Thank you. Yes. That's all I have for today.

715
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,870
And I think you have a quiz, do you this weekend?
