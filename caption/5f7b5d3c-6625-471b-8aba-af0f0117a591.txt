1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:01:41,650
And yes, I. Is there a cost before this class?

2
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,400
What is that? Is there any class before this class?

3
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,799
I mean, I don't know if there are some students in the class.

4
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,070
This class take courses right before this class.

5
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,550
So. Robert.

6
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,100
Robert? Yeah. Okay.

7
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,970
And who also teaches who is teaching the same?

8
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,740
From when to live with you in a tent.

9
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,649
Okay. Okay. Okay.

10
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,979
Let's get started. I have a flight, and for.

11
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:28,420
So I have to cut this lecture a little bit short, right after lecture to rush into airport to catch my flight.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,890
Um, so maybe we'll have one hour of 511 hour lecture today.

13
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:46,090
Depends on how it goes. Anyway, I prepared the first homework, and I wanted to do three questions, and I just always want to know your feedback.

14
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,970
Your. Everybody is involved, this pandemic.

15
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,079
Regardless, being willing, we're not waiting.

16
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:03,950
And this is you know, we have been going through this the past few years and everybody has their own experience and exposure to different mediums and,

17
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:09,409
you know, observe all different happenings in the country outside coming in.

18
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:22,550
So it's a very complex. But anyway, we come to the scientific sort of focus that, well, this course suppose we're a very serious biostatistician.

19
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:33,590
We're going to look at data and we know that data quality is not ideal, but we still want to learn from something from data and do a rigorous,

20
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,810
rigorous quantitative research using the data to answer some questions.

21
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:46,520
What are what is the burning question you like to study or you know, so we can start with this.

22
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:53,360
AC And then I, you know, try to understand your position and your thoughts.

23
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,390
And so, you know, make a plan. We can set up a meeting to talk through what things you want to do.

24
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:10,640
And I said that last year there was one team that end up with submitting their final project to spatial epidemiology for publication.

25
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,820
We were to study the data from Michigan because we know Michigan probably better than other states.

26
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:25,480
And so we look at Purdue, look at how vaccine protects senior people in the state of Michigan.

27
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:33,780
So so that was a quite interesting spatial analysis, analyzing sort of the different counties calls different.

28
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:42,709
I mean, visiting the state because Michigan is like swing state, part of the states are more blue and some part of more red.

29
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:50,950
I mean, it's kind of a mixture of lot of the political opinions and suspicious about the effectiveness of vaccines, you know.

30
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:56,140
But anyway, so they did a very interesting study looking at just state of Michigan,

31
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:02,360
see how to look at how the two dose of vaccination would protect senior people.

32
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,399
And that's that's a quite a sort of rigorous study.

33
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,639
And somehow I think that projects are very publishable.

34
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,760
And so I haven't seen and I mean,

35
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:23,000
people you have this like New York Times order newspaper where they look at a data but not at the level of the stats.

36
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:32,989
Right. So we were kind of one. And look, all of the data, we're in a very deep vaccine where you not only do just feed a model,

37
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:39,080
but also check the model assumptions and talking about the limitations of all sorts of things like we usually do.

38
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:47,360
Okay. So that's something I want to you give give you opportunities to think what you like to

39
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,629
do for this course is just now learning just bunch of models and skills and durations,

40
00:05:53,630 --> 00:06:00,410
but you should have a clear objective what you want achievement and yeah I mean this

41
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,490
is something you can make a plan is more like when you start write a grand proposal,

42
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,900
the first thing you will think, oh, what are we going to do for this?

43
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:16,760
Here's, Oh, kind of big structure or data, and you want to sort of think through like what would be your focus,

44
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,770
what you want to accomplish and come off as a couple.

45
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,170
One burning question were two sort of innovations.

46
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,129
Do you want to somehow give a try in the project? Okay, write it up.

47
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:36,350
I'll be ready reading your CV with great interest.

48
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,550
Okay, that's something.

49
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:48,259
So question two is more about some kind of numerical analysis where I want you to my SBIR model and based on some of the, you know,

50
00:06:48,260 --> 00:07:01,940
the numbers from newspaper or from some or some scientific publications, how do you figure out how to use a software to actually look at the dynamics?

51
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:09,919
Okay. So I will call this differential equation solver is these solve this is our package

52
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,760
that help you to solve differential equation so that you can generate those,

53
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:32,690
you know, dynamic curves like the s, t, t and r, t and so, so, so we need this so numerical solver to solve this ordinary defense equation.

54
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,030
And of course that this whole work start from Euler, right?

55
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,469
So he was the first person who actually tried to introduce numerical solution

56
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,700
for partial or partial differential between ordinary differential equation,

57
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:58,099
but later on. A lot of mathematicians apply these and try to improve Euler approximation from new order to high order and without first order,

58
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:03,620
approximation seems to be most popular. I will introduce that in this course.

59
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,880
How that solver is formulated.

60
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:17,370
And why is better than over. But today I'll introduce the software so you can play with it and to generate the curve.

61
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,420
And finally, I think one thing we need to learn is how to write the system of the equations.

62
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,870
Right? In our course, we basically look out only three compartments and four prominent compartment.

63
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,190
Now, I give you a very complex compartments.

64
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:39,380
So you have successful, you know, exposure and vaccine, antibody infections,

65
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:46,400
hospitalization that you'll recover back to antibody and back to the center.

66
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:59,270
Right. So we have much, much more complex system of this, like circulation of people moving from one parliament to another and given time.

67
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,020
And you can write a differential equation out whether or not you are going to solve it.

68
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,389
Do we have actual data to estimate this system that's differential?

69
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:22,610
But you can create a system of differential equations to describe this dynamics, or it is kind of like a translation from one compartment to another.

70
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:29,420
And so here you have delta beta, etr, gamma d gamma are.

71
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,819
Okay. This has to be new. This is all the Greek letters to denote different.

72
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,720
The translation reads. Okay. Oh, there's a power here as well.

73
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,920
Okay. So you just write out. Oh, I forgot about this.

74
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,620
Okay. Here shall be Beta. I'm sorry.

75
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:56,200
There's another arrow, so it should be beta. I just make that here.

76
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,710
Beta EPA. So they're all transition from exposure to.

77
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:11,540
But. So. So anyway, they would write it out and then we'll we'll see how.

78
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:20,090
Okay? Yeah. Oh.

79
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,330
Lecture two I already applaud lecture three.

80
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:33,560
That's something I started cover on Thursday where we're going to start a prediction on the best needed unbiased predictor blue block.

81
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,280
But I should say that's something I start over. But today I want to finish up lecture to.

82
00:10:41,360 --> 00:11:02,500
This is probably one of the. But we need to be careful in facilities that's been widely used by US facilities is epidemiology.

83
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:10,390
Okay. So I start with. Everything to.

84
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,290
The authorities haggle over assumptions.

85
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,320
There are a lot of assumptions.

86
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:28,060
And first of all, talk about property where the you know, so basically we we talk about the Internet, about it versus the issue.

87
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,090
So that's one thing. And another property is two.

88
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:46,240
Is that successful infected we move model S although or server model is deterministic does not contain any problem probabilistic components.

89
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:54,010
So this is a functional is a dynamic there's no stochastic involved in this model.

90
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:03,660
Well, this dynamic is essentially a formula or model by or display to by a differential equation.

91
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,950
There's no randomness.

92
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:19,730
Well, this is very, very important because I've got a lot of people in practice very confused 0bb with these dynamics with the casters.

93
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:28,220
So it no worse that dynamics as the cast as the are two different mathematical properties or concepts.

94
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,470
A dynamic system like center model is not necessarily stochastic.

95
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,850
While a stochastic, it's not necessarily dynamic.

96
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:46,730
Okay, so this are totally different things. So that dynamics is a term people use in applied mathematics to describe kind of a system,

97
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:52,969
but it's a deterministic system, stochastic process or stochastic.

98
00:12:52,970 --> 00:13:00,220
So the is a concept that we use in probability where we trying to use that to describe some kind of randomness.

99
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:05,810
Right. Some think that beyond deterministic phenomena.

100
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,800
So that's why it's deterministic is not stochastic.

101
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:16,720
So this happened this to have to be you know, you have to understand are very different.

102
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:26,920
Okay. So so. I can trt the mathematic model of sire oh all time very functions the.

103
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:36,190
I mean those three compartments right. Total number of successful individual total number of infections infected individuals in.

104
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,000
Well, you know, our moving functions are moving, but they are now stochastic.

105
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,220
Okay. But they change. But they do not change stochastic.

106
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,440
Right. So they change. But deterministic.

107
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:57,870
There's no random fluctuations which are complete determined by the model parameters, initial conditions of the ceremony.

108
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:07,590
So this is very important that this or this may indicate that the limitation of dynamic system.

109
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:14,250
Because once you have a parameter set as well as the initial conditions set, right.

110
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,790
So then the function itself is completely determined.

111
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:26,370
You can really just, you know, figure out whole functional and you can know the actual value of function at a given time in the future.

112
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:37,410
So the initial conditions become very, very important, which is mostly like determine the fate of this whole of dynamics.

113
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:44,159
But in reality, you know, that this, this whole thing changes all the time and we have all the experience that,

114
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,540
oh, there are so many random shocks coming to the system, that's really a chance.

115
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:59,069
You know, the dynamic of system, you know, the trajectory can change direction, can, you know, slow down or can speed up.

116
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:07,290
Who knows? I need a trigger. All of rendered shots come into the system to change the the parameter of to change the initial condition to the system.

117
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:15,929
Basically go into really different sort of a path, you know, determined by initial conditions.

118
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:27,660
But this is something like we for a mathematical revealed that we we need to understand what are the key things that determine the dynamics of system.

119
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:35,190
Okay. So this also determined the sort of the defines the limitation of this system, right?

120
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:44,790
So we need to as a statistician, we always want to link parameters and initial conditions as a function of covariates.

121
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,559
Okay. Something like that.

122
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:58,230
We want to model them in some way so that we can have a bit more flexibility in the understanding of the fascist evolution of fashion.

123
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:06,580
So that's third condition. So do you.

124
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:14,350
Right. I already show you the future. Right. So the you say that, you know, this is three figures right here.

125
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:21,690
So this is the compartment of the susceptible individuals is always monotonic, decreasing,

126
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:27,909
because, you know, people are either stay here or they're moving out from this compartment.

127
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:34,500
There's nobody moving. So technically speaking, that this compartment is always decreasing.

128
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:41,040
Okay. So is and this are is upswing or exit compartment?

129
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:47,110
They always it always takes more and more individual coming to this compartment.

130
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:55,470
Right. So there is no sort of the place to move that individual from this compartment to another compartment.

131
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,130
So so this is losing always is this is always receiving.

132
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:07,180
And so that you can see that this is modeled on a decrease in this model increasing.

133
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:17,200
But this one is is is, you know, not you know, it's like this shape.

134
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,270
Okay, basically, this is kind of compensation of the difference.

135
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:37,060
So basically it tells you that the the increased of this compartment up to a certain point that this compartment will, you know, of reduce this size.

136
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:46,030
This is actually the picture you can have according to this sort of the model that we have.

137
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:56,020
Well, that's that's what I'm trying to see, you know. Oops. Obviously Property three so that this is also about commissary.

138
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:02,800
This is art is monotonically 90 creasing and this is mankind now increasing.

139
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:10,090
And so there are two major features you want to look at.

140
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:19,510
As I said, that particularly for the ice compartment. Right. So typically under the CIA model, so you have something like this, right?

141
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:26,170
So that this shape. And so what are the most important features that are we trying to figure out?

142
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,740
The first one is to find a time period as time.

143
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:37,840
Right. Well, this kind point is very important.

144
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,550
Why is that important? Because it's more like you drive a car.

145
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,680
Right. So. So here you think this is it?

146
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,850
Right. So. So they'd be handed.

147
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,180
They should be determining the speed of your car.

148
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,610
Right. So. So essentially that the.

149
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:15,259
So what happens here is that's the turning point that basically you sort of turn around

150
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:22,130
this direction of this infection basically is from the golden up to the direction.

151
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:35,240
So this is the time that you if a clear you can't expect or protect that something is going to decrease and the final that goes to zero.

152
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:41,540
Basically, this is a time, a turning point of this whole sort of a process.

153
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:48,350
Of course, the reality you probably will have that for a short period of time.

154
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,800
I mean, whatever you really want to find that the.

155
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:04,030
It's the maximum if you can figure it out, then going to next time, that is it will.

156
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:11,670
So so so that that's the point that you really think.

157
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:18,790
What? Yeah. Like stocks or beef and buy you what you want to find but some.

158
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:27,100
So can make maximum profit here like infectious disease that you'll also want to fight the.

159
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:47,370
Through that time, the whole process. A time that you the process becomes easier.

160
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,370
So that's another sort of critical point that we're interested.

161
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:58,380
And of course, that what time? So.

162
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:10,180
So what? The one thing we want to do here is. Oh, well, that's why we say if you aren't where we are here.

163
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,570
Right. We're here and the early stage of this, if we have some.

164
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,979
Well, this is what we will turn around and win.

165
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:32,860
This will be. So if you'll observe this point, then who cares?

166
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:43,030
That's the end. But what? You are really interested that you build a model of that that allow you to predict that or up epistemology.

167
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:47,110
They only predict one fifth in three months.

168
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:53,350
This will. But well, as a statistician, we predict.

169
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:00,120
They'll be twins three months and five months that this will be done so that that

170
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:04,500
you give them confidence of this prediction rather than singled out a prediction.

171
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:13,680
So this is much harder job but they know we're going to study and later on will introduce conform.

172
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:31,410
One data point for big. A set of data points, a set of about projects that have like 95 sort of coverage that they complement coverage.

173
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:39,460
So. So that's something we'd like to do. So those are key features we'd like to figure out from Dynamic System.

174
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:46,530
More important, why we want to use dynamics is the big prediction up to the prediction sort of perspective?

175
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:52,089
We're not only interested in single value prediction, we interestingly are confident that.

176
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,320
Confidence. Confidence set prediction.

177
00:22:55,330 --> 00:23:00,729
Okay. That's something we like to do. And as statistician, great, we'd like to really figure it out.

178
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:08,559
And if you have no intervention, no external sort of interference,

179
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:16,030
then this AI compartment will become zero eventually according to this dynamic system.

180
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:24,220
So when time goes to infinity, right? When time goes to infinity, only the number of in fact that individual won't become zero,

181
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,860
or this proportion of individual in the IV compartment will be zero.

182
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,430
So why start? This is simply because of this.

183
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,200
It's our model, right?

184
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:52,630
So if you look at this iron model, well, so here is the dynamics, the ordinary differential equation, the speed of of this happens, right?

185
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,780
The percent of all of you are being affected.

186
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:03,760
Right. Is equal to this. Right. This is that if you fact price, they stated it right.

187
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:18,549
So if you factor out this that you'll be able to see that s t minus gamma and times theta and t okay.

188
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:22,510
You're fact where I'll say that I t and then you have this,

189
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:30,190
then you know that they see that s t this is what the percentage of the individuals in s compartment.

190
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:41,090
This is always smaller t. People are eventually will move out from this compartment of susceptible unless the disease is controlled.

191
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:48,100
If the disease is not controlled, let's say, you know, this evolution will come, will continue forever.

192
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:54,710
Then this s compartment will be shrunk, would be reduced, would be shrink to zero.

193
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,780
When this becomes zero, of course, then this will become the negative.

194
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:08,150
The factor will become negative. Then this derivative will be a decreasing function and eventually will decrease to zero.

195
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:14,210
Right? And this, as I say, that it will be bounded and zero below.

196
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,060
You cannot have anything smaller. Zero.

197
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:28,370
So this one, the function is it will decrease because the factories is zero and then eventually it will basically die down to really zero.

198
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:35,000
So that's basically mathematically true given this equation, the dynamics that have been specified by.

199
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:42,360
But what about all this is right? I mean, we can up to for a debate.

200
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:49,070
But once you write, I say our model is classical model that you do this.

201
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:56,240
This model tells you that there is a decaying this this part one decayed to zero eventually.

202
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,650
That's what this is. Okay.

203
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:07,729
So, of course, I just said that, you know, the this going to zero is really based on the argument.

204
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:23,360
I just said, of course that if you are compartment is as always having new sort of individuals coming like people are refactored, right.

205
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:31,070
So like problem assumption three says that when people get recovered, they are fully immunized,

206
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:40,370
they have no chance to be to become sort of associate to become a step susceptible anymore.

207
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,900
But that's not true. Right. So we know that there are some repeat infection.

208
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,270
So this assumption is not right.

209
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:57,800
In the homework one, I put this antibody compartment back to the a simple apartment so people can move back to be successful,

210
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,020
susceptible again after even the tourism antibody.

211
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,880
But that's only good for like a few, few months, right?

212
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:13,870
Like we know that all kind people see that you probably have enough like titers to protect you for three months or so.

213
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:17,790
The assumption why is that aging is constant.

214
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,860
So the population size is a constant. There are no people moving out.

215
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:29,179
Moving out. So. So if if those two assumptions of island, of course, that you cannot get on to that this factor is negative.

216
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,600
So you cannot guarantee that decrease there.

217
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,260
Of course, for the influenza, you know,

218
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:45,710
we all know that immunity does not last long unless while everybody is encouraged to give to take a flu shot every,

219
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:53,810
you know, fall season and so so not something like that proper defies.

220
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:07,700
Oh, this is so so if you if you do this numerical approximation, I am all right here.

221
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:19,180
So. So this is a. They say this is a function of age.

222
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:25,029
Okay. But. Okay. I just wrote there just for simplicity.

223
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:28,989
I just want to to your stated address.

224
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,040
My point. Well, this is a differential.

225
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:39,460
And you basically model the speed of this process, of this dynamics, the speed some of.

226
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,240
A very stochastic thing is a dynamic.

227
00:28:46,450 --> 00:29:00,209
So you work on the speed of this. So of course that's in many cases the this one cannot be solved analytically have a close for

228
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:05,670
me expression of what people do is they do numerical difference basically here you have.

229
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:13,280
I'd like you to a date, for example, to one day.

230
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,910
So you have see that he lives long and deep.

231
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,680
He will be one day. Right. So that the T minus T minus one.

232
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:28,790
This is a numerical approximation because this speed is a continuous function.

233
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,850
Right? This is differential equation. Right. You have a well.

234
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:38,170
So if the A is complex enough, you cannot solve this differential equation to have a coastal expression.

235
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:44,600
So what you should do here is do this discrete, okay, discrete ization you can.

236
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:49,480
Alter but don't how could be pulling zero zero.

237
00:29:54,890 --> 00:30:01,000
They all want one minute, whatever the way you use it.

238
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:12,350
And then you have this right. So what you have here is the t equal to say that T -180.

239
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:20,370
Plus. Plus. From the right hand side.

240
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:26,670
So what you have here is a recursion recursive relationship.

241
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:34,799
That's what I'm saying here. So this differential equation, after we do discrete ization, use that unit that one minute when now, one day,

242
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:44,470
one week, whatever the one you use, essentially you are creating a recursive equation, equation of recursion.

243
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:50,070
Okay. So this is this should all be confused with this Markov property.

244
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:56,790
Okay. We also have some of that similar stuff in this probabilistic or is called Markov property.

245
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:01,290
So the dependent data today depend on data yesterday.

246
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:06,900
All right. So first of all, under Moscow property, so we'll all do Markov property.

247
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:12,330
Okay. So so that's kind of stochastic version of the recursion.

248
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:17,260
But, you know, it's defined in the probability space, right.

249
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:25,980
Is is defined by chance, by probability or by distribution, not by this mathematical equation.

250
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:30,300
So this kind of recursive relationship.

251
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:38,460
Okay. So that should not a thing I need to tell you that should not be confused with Markov property, although they look very similar.

252
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,380
Okay. Finally, I want to talk a little bit about the extension.

253
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,559
Okay. So why extension, of course,

254
00:31:47,560 --> 00:32:01,210
is that we want to relax this sort of a constant transmission rate beta and transmitting trying to recover the recovery rate.

255
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,510
Right. So the beta in a virus transmission rate, gamma is the recovery.

256
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:15,550
So and the original PSI model, these two parameters are constant, which of course not very realistic.

257
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:22,840
But you in principle, you can you can relax beta and gamma to be time dependent.

258
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:32,470
You have a functional parameter, you have a function, a time course function as your parameter.

259
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:39,310
Okay. So those those are the the rates that determine the are the size of two, right?

260
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:50,290
If you think about this, three compartments are like scoop up like three hour bucket to hold water to water runs from SW to R.

261
00:32:50,680 --> 00:33:00,579
So this beta gamma or the size of tube, how much water would run per minute from one bucket to another one.

262
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:06,639
So so by the way, the Y people origin of the constant of Barack Obama,

263
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,960
because at that time when the model was proposed, there was no powerful computer.

264
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:22,780
You can have this model. We cannot solve it because this can be very complex of dynamic system that required, number one, really good computing power.

265
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:30,370
Number two, very good data. You were to estimate a functional parameter rather than a constant parameter, right?

266
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:35,020
So so people just trying to work on very, very simple model.

267
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:41,230
Okay, now I'll change them. All of them just relax the parameter to be time dependent.

268
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:52,000
Okay? Now the beta t is your parameter is the functional is now a constant, so it becomes more complex that requires more data to estimate.

269
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:57,460
So people working on this kind of estimation using non parametric statistics, you know,

270
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:08,469
non parametric which in my spline kernel wavelets and all the dumb parametric regression techniques have been developed by statistician

271
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:17,080
to estimate functional relationship and by kernel smooth things blind smoothing that that can be used here to solve the problem.

272
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:24,760
But in reality people want from time to point of view rather having a fully unspecified of functional parameters.

273
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:31,810
You want to impose some kind of understanding of the disease, for example, seasonality, right?

274
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:36,940
You know, the flu influenza is is very seasonal thing.

275
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:45,670
Right. That's why, you know, we require we are encouraged to take a flu shot in fall semester in the fall.

276
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:53,560
And so you can model this the seasonality into this equation where you have some parameters,

277
00:34:54,040 --> 00:35:00,639
but it's much simpler than a fully unspecified number of functions.

278
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:10,570
So for example, you specified this where because ST is the peak time of this transmission, okay, so for example,

279
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:18,790
you'll start to monitor the this this of influenza and from day zero, then you say,

280
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:23,800
well, typically somewhere in the November will be the peak of the season.

281
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:27,610
Right. So you can set up could see as 100.

282
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,750
20 days, right? Is this 100? I think that's 120 days.

283
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,210
Let me see where I put this. Yeah.

284
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:50,579
Anyway, I don't know where I put this. So I choose Cassini to be walking through toe so that you basically say, okay, I have a seasonal function,

285
00:35:50,580 --> 00:36:04,020
I have this varying transmission rate where I had this peak achieved at 120 days from the original, the time I study.

286
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:11,760
Okay, that's the parameter, Cassie, that I can specify. There is a couple of parameters, but this is much simpler that you can estimate.

287
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:21,440
Okay. Well. Or start to you could, you know, make this function a bit more complicated.

288
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:29,570
For example, you can add agent to it. You believe that senior people are more likely to be on higher risk.

289
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:40,050
They have higher tests. I if I, you know, three people sitting there like one senior, one junior, and, you know, if the one person is contagious.

290
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:43,600
Right. The senior person, probably because of a weaker immune system,

291
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:53,060
are more likely to contract disease and develop symptoms so that you can pull some cohorts into this to model this transmission risk.

292
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,290
Okay, so, so and whatever you want and.

293
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:17,430
Hmm. So so what do we did here in our paper 2020, that this is a small incremental things, but it becomes quite a challenge.

294
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:25,470
I'm telling you why. Okay. If you will cut this bait a t here when you incorporate this seasonality into it.

295
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,400
This is a continuous function. It is a continuous function.

296
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,760
So you do not change the dynamics of assistance.

297
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,360
Everything is a continuous sort of fashion.

298
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:44,100
But now if you have a very rigorous intervention like in China, we try to mimic that.

299
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,750
You have this whole safety blockage. You basically put everyone in the inside.

300
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:54,560
Yes. I believe no traffic. No, everybody is inside.

301
00:37:54,570 --> 00:38:00,540
Right. There is no way you can get out. I mean, I very firmly would allow have one person to go all the official people per day.

302
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:12,750
You cannot expect that you have a very continuous transmission rate, sodomy rate, this transmission rates, you know, versus Sodom.

303
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:20,070
I saw them sort of decreasing. This is a discrete country is discrete by that.

304
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:24,360
He is that discrete. So we did not notice this at the time.

305
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:32,560
Right. When we say, hey, we need to really see, evaluate how much the push the government need to control the disease.

306
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:43,710
We want to simulate right to which level of this rigorous control in the policy to the government that is facing isolation.

307
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:51,980
The the. And how long will it take if you make this harder that how soon that the disease

308
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:57,560
would be content if you put all of the software and how long you take that.

309
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:02,150
But whole thing here is that we have to this sort of sudden change.

310
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,630
These are gene points in this being a T.

311
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:13,400
It becomes a non continuous function that they basically break this dynamic system.

312
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:20,630
Okay. But it's hard to believe that that this is a continuous one.

313
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,890
Of course, you can ask something that's continuous here, but.

314
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:35,630
And what we did at that time, we didn't notice. I mean, as I said, I'd never working this fields like, you know, until 2020 that we'll feel okay.

315
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:41,500
We need to create a software for the scientific community to feed their data to their data analysis.

316
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:51,890
We just did this like a step step function to to sort of say how much control you want to have this very

317
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:59,330
sharp and rigorous control the government needs in order to control these things as fast as possible.

318
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:05,600
And this jump function basically breaks this dynamics because you have the differential equation,

319
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:12,470
everything is supposed to be continuous, but magically, magically m CMC can't handle this.

320
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:19,969
I think the I think this will be very challenging for applied mathematics when these studies stability,

321
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:28,840
uniqueness, whatever the sort of dynamic properties for statistician we have M SIM ce mark chairman Carlo.

322
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:34,520
We just need to estimate parameters, right? So, so we propose this to, to do that and that we.

323
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:40,729
How did you get the idea that the values of these are the discrete function?

324
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:44,570
That is my major goal and that that was made possible by DuPont.

325
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:48,350
Yeah. So so this is very, very hard question.

326
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,850
You know, of course that for me was zero, but.

327
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:59,330
Then you can have different scenarios that I think you need if you really want to figure out the factors.

328
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:15,209
Lacks the data to some extent. So basically we try different functions and then they the government has I mean, we talk to some of the people,

329
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:22,470
their scientists there, they have some way to translate this function into a common policy.

330
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:25,080
Okay. But that's beyond our understanding, right?

331
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:33,209
So there must be some behavioral management science behind this, how people have studied this kind of behavior integration,

332
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:37,920
and they can translate this kind of function into some of the government policy.

333
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,570
And proximately, of course, we cannot do that. Exactly.

334
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:50,660
Prediction is totally bending over. The biting is recruiting, of course, the whole how how stringent this party would be.

335
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:57,150
And you can imagine that if you put the pilot to zero, then you meet a controller next week.

336
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:03,420
Of course you cannot do that then one. There's no intervention.

337
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:14,540
Right. And getting. Well, if you're working in the Northeast, so you have the beta zero, right?

338
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:21,270
There's another parameter. There's always a identify ability problem.

339
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:27,630
So basically we're saying here is the basic reproduction number and Heidi is the one to try to modify this.

340
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:34,920
Right. So for when you have this coffee comes in and there, they're always a basic transmission rate.

341
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:40,450
But the interface in trying to see what we're going to reduce one third of that transmission.

342
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:48,370
We're we're it's more like a proportion of that how much you want control to of fact it's

343
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:54,330
fractionalized fractionalized this bit original but it has zero transmission that that's

344
00:42:54,330 --> 00:43:00,840
what did I mean just from my point of view that I didn't notice I mean I didn't work in

345
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,850
the field that you can now to really simply put a jump function to this dynamic system.

346
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:13,850
But it works fine. And it just so let me just give a couple of extension.

347
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:18,090
This is for your homework. Homework problem too.

348
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:23,490
Now I just introduce exposed and then I mean,

349
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:34,530
people tell me that this is more popular than this air model because you introduce a you will be exposed a compartment, exposed compartment.

350
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:41,880
This is the the case that takes the incubation period as into a consideration.

351
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:51,630
Okay. So if you want to take extension of our model with a additional compartment of incubation,

352
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:58,230
you can add this exposed compartment between susceptible in fact.

353
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,809
In this case that you know this are population based before we combine is two but now

354
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:14,420
you can have a detailed sort of a division of that apartment into two so exposed.

355
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:23,200
So you might feel, I think, that this exposure compartment is more far more like a waiting room.

356
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:28,810
Right. So to hold various carriers who are about to spread the virus in the population.

357
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:38,740
Okay. So if you have Delta, the letter, all of these rates from susceptible to exposure becomes contagious.

358
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:49,240
So that under the assumption a special distributed waiting time, one delta will be the time of sojourn in the E compartment.

359
00:44:49,300 --> 00:45:00,370
If you stay the four days of incubation after contracting virus like you are just shedding to be contagious four days later,

360
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:05,309
then you basically have the full days of floating in this compartment.

361
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:12,100
Then that the delta will have this .251 over four as the rate of transmission.

362
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:16,809
Okay. So one thing that we should be careful here.

363
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:22,750
So there is a difference between the duration of being asymptomatic and duration of incubation.

364
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,880
Okay. So in the literature, this two things are mixed up quite often.

365
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:34,659
And the former is in this state of viral shedding and contagious with no symptoms,

366
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:40,770
while the later is the state of expose, no shedding and no not contagious yet.

367
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:51,040
Okay. So that's the the difference. And so from a mathematical model point of view, now you add to the E.

368
00:45:51,640 --> 00:46:05,350
Okay. So here that so these are compartment is always the absorbing compartment but just receiving individuals from this system so that you always

369
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:17,200
lose that individuals from that so you have minus so e here is you receive and the you lose because after people get exposed from the S,

370
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,859
then they will move to the compartment.

371
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:33,460
This is the much volume that the individual delta you t will be the volume for given time that people exposed will move to either compartment.

372
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:41,110
Okay. The eye compartment. Same thing receiving from e compartment and lose this to the outer compartment.

373
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:50,500
Okay. So you have in and out. So this is amount of year in this amount about is the amount of UV this compartment.

374
00:46:51,070 --> 00:47:03,700
And finally, R is the so the absorbed compartment that only received amount of the human volume coming to our compartment and only loses.

375
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:09,300
It would move it to the outer compartment. So this is the equation.

376
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,660
So based on this principle, you can write more.

377
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:22,310
Sort of. And so it's very difficult to estimate Prime for Delta.

378
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:28,800
Incompletion for sure varies from one person to another. In the case of COVID 19 Alpha variant.

379
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:37,790
The incubation period ranges from 0 to 15 days, with a median of 1.5.1 days, according to publication 2020.

380
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,960
And in another study, COVID 19 patients in China.

381
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:47,120
The estimate incubation period is between 0 to 24 days.

382
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:51,170
These are media three days. Very right. Skewed distribution.

383
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:57,520
It's always the issue of ascertainment. Ascertainment, right.

384
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:03,460
All the time and exposure. So how do you know that you met the person who got the contract?

385
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,800
I mean, who knows? And it's so complicated.

386
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:14,230
We're on the very unprotected situation where so ascertainment on the time exposure and onset of contagion.

387
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:22,089
Right. Seems practically impossible gives it lends by sampling problem which is a very famous problem is,

388
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:30,130
of course, in survival you need to really ascertain time to event right time to events that is.

389
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:40,780
I mean, Len spies sampling is always a problem in survival when you have hard time to ascertain the time of occurrence of event.

390
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:52,710
So similar issues here because you need to really figure out when you get contracted versus when you get you when you become infectious, who knows.

391
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,720
Right. So so that there's always a little spice issue.

392
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:04,600
So some people wrote a paper about estimating incubation period using this sort of this by sampling technique,

393
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,799
people developing survival analysis to deal with the problem or discuss some

394
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:15,850
of the limitations of issues in the estimation of exposure parameter delta.

395
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:23,980
Okay, there are always issue how to do this and with no good data to estimate delta,

396
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:31,150
the rate of the incubation rate SVR model would not be identifiable.

397
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:43,150
Okay, so here is another extension where people are small, but where you allow people who are in the outer compartment back to susceptible.

398
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:56,070
So you make a full circle of that. I mean, it's essentially just, you know, here in the east compartment, you have a volume going out,

399
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:03,980
then you have volume coming in because there's people who are in the outer compartment can move into the S compartment.

400
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:07,380
Right. So people can be infected, you know.

401
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:11,460
Well, this is the cause is the rate moving from our to this.

402
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:15,360
So for ye also you receive the volume.

403
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:26,430
I and I. Come on. You'll receive the volume from me and the volume to our in our compartment.

404
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:31,670
You receive the volume from I, but lose this volume to s.

405
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:42,890
Okay. So, so. So when you add them all together and it has to be equal to zero because you have this balance of and you have some to zero gain, right?

406
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:47,000
So every everything would be balanced in and in and out.

407
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:53,840
You can use the same principle to develop the system equations that in your homework to.

408
00:50:55,910 --> 00:51:00,420
Okay so India the 2020.

409
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:06,980
We wrote a paper where we really want to figure out that the sun antibody and that time and we don't have vaccine yet.

410
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:16,459
Right. So but some people are infected and people are trying to say, oh, after we got this sort of infection from the wild type virus,

411
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:25,430
then they start to develop some kind of antibody and they are less likely to be, you know, infected again.

412
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,400
And so, so so this is the one we developed.

413
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:36,560
So so basically we're thinking that people can go ahead and put people, in fact, that we call self immunized.

414
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:45,680
Okay. So in New York, Massachusetts and kind of phone out ers free survey in the May 2020.

415
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:59,840
The surveys want to figure out what the percentage of people who are have this sort of antibody derived by the infection of the wild type virus.

416
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:07,520
So we're trying to mimic that because this is different from those individuals who have never been infected.

417
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:13,070
So we developed this antibody compartment and work on that.

418
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,400
This is the paper in Harvard Data Science Review.

419
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:25,280
And so you can write. So first of all, it's closest to the the antibody compartment.

420
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:35,660
So you have a transmission rate that one person will be moved to the antibody compartment and you go into another apartment.

421
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:43,370
The antibody compartment only received the individual, the volume from the one type of infection and so on.

422
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:57,500
So first step, you know, this, this very simple. Yeah, I'd repeatedly repeat it again and again to really to, you know, odd build ups system,

423
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:02,179
which when sucking one another, you are able to estimate all the parameters.

424
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:07,879
That's different issue, but you can use this principle in an art balance.

425
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:13,190
And to write a system equation, you can have five compartments, you can have ten apartments.

426
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:19,430
And therefore, you know, this sort of question what we have quite a number of compartments but you just

427
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:25,710
it to analyze which way and see which ones out and how do you balance that.

428
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:30,080
And when you add this four speeds together, right?

429
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,620
This is to run with that and you should have zero.

430
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,970
Okay. So. Oh.

431
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:42,730
Infrastructure lecture. Let's move on to the software.

432
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:51,219
You like virtual creations. You can all define the Anodic solution.

433
00:53:51,220 --> 00:54:02,080
You have to really rely on some numerical solvers to do the discrete ization to solve the the differential equation numerically.

434
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:11,260
Okay, so this are these solve this already available in MATLAB, but people put this into R.

435
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:15,669
Okay, so that's very nice that we can use this.

436
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:20,829
The R package can help solve the initial value problems of a system.

437
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:24,340
First order differential equations. Okay. Only first of all are different questions.

438
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:29,679
Luckily that all the equations that we're talking about here are all about first order differential

439
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:35,590
equation because we for the infectious disease people are very interested in the speed,

440
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:41,980
okay, the rate of change. So that's essentially the first order of derivatives.

441
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:45,280
People do not really model the acceleration.

442
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:52,630
Okay, the supermodel curve. Okay, so do solve the, you know, different types of equations.

443
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,690
And so here is a couple examples.

444
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:12,759
Right? So so just to remind you, you know this from first, so you know this initial value problem you O.D. so now you have the first order derivative.

445
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,030
Basically X is argument, y is the function.

446
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:20,350
Essentially you're solving a function of Y in x, okay?

447
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:29,049
So X or B or T here, right? So time x could be a spatial location or it could be something is an index of your function.

448
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:34,030
So why is the function that satisfies this mean your differential?

449
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:40,300
I mean, this part is another function, another. Will you work to solve this differential equation?

450
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:47,930
You need initial condition. For example, you know, you put that at the time zero when X equal to zero.

451
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:54,010
What's the value of your y function is to observe this initial condition.

452
00:55:54,100 --> 00:56:01,390
Okay, you can put any condition you like, but from a dynamic system point of view, people always say, what's the origin of time?

453
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:05,320
What's the origin of time? We don't know. We don't know the origin of time.

454
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,899
Right? We don't know the origin of the Earth, of the universe.

455
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:19,600
But people are trying to put a hypothetical time, zero, to say it was the function value at that time of origin, the beginning of everything up.

456
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:26,820
So you to solve this, of course, that you can have many ways to solve it, but for this simple problem you can solve is not right.

457
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:31,230
So you just do this an integral calculation, okay?

458
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,900
You do this antiderivative calculation by integral, right?

459
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:39,460
I said, can you then figure out like two, 300 years ago. All right.

460
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,240
You have this, you have now you just integrate this.

461
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:49,030
Okay. Then of course, remember that you need to constant because this indefinite integral.

462
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:52,720
Right. You get it out and you take in the role.

463
00:56:53,470 --> 00:57:00,610
And then how do you figure out this constancy? And then you just plug in the initial condition, right?

464
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:07,770
So then C, we'll be able to. Okay, so finally your function Y is a function of X.

465
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:12,010
It's it takes this polynomial, the second order polynomial.

466
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:20,919
It's quite easy to say, okay, so then you can have this multiplicative form, which is also solvable analytically, right.

467
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:26,230
You know this. So this X, the Y are separable, basically multiplicative function.

468
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:33,040
So you can solve this by the same argument. And finally, you get this exponential function.

469
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:36,550
You plug in this about it. That's what you get, right?

470
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:40,780
So you kind of work out this this question for.

471
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:51,670
Now, if you add one more X, so to x, y minus X, just to little bit of chance, they call this delay of the system.

472
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:59,080
I mean, somehow you have a one minus. Well, then this problem becomes very complex.

473
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,560
Okay, so it's not that easy to solve if you supply this, you may not be able to solve this.

474
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:13,570
So what did people do here is to use numerical sort of solve or two to solve this numerically.

475
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:27,250
Okay. So that's about this discrete transition to solve this differential equation, changing this continuous derivative into recursive formula.

476
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:37,209
Right. Change this. Throw it into a recursion that's originally from Euler, but later on has been proved by many mathematicians.

477
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:47,110
So. So there is a R K for that's the branch you could go to German mathematician who worked on this for the

478
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:54,429
numerical approximation of for the first order integration that I will give you a little more detail later.

479
00:58:54,430 --> 00:59:03,160
How how the formula in case you want to do this kind of work in our field like survival analysis or something,

480
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:09,429
understanding how this numerical approximation works will help you to write your own program.

481
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:14,830
But anyway, I will do that. But most of that old over.

482
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:20,200
And now this archive for provides a full sort of approximation.

483
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:24,459
It's much more popular in the literature of fashion.

484
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:30,090
The smaller links give us a better approximation sample.

485
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:37,209
Consider a sample the full hypothetical population with this 100 residents,

486
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:43,630
and then you have initial condition with nine dense assessable individuals, one in fact, the individuals zero.

487
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:55,719
You know, the so here is the rate beta .5.2 ratio is the basic number is the racial pillar of Ghana,

488
00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:02,560
which is 2.5 now where using this solver to create the curve.

489
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:10,860
So so here is library the solve the differential equation solve.

490
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:20,940
This is the library we call and we specify this vector and then for the 100 days and put the parameter into this.

491
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:30,660
Then we write up as our model, our function. This is essentially it functions that call it according to differential equations.

492
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,379
You can if you have a SDR model. Second question of your homework.

493
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:40,010
One, you just have a chance to see our model put additional equations here.

494
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:46,290
I mean, whichever expression is. So you just follow this barcode that should work.

495
01:00:46,950 --> 01:01:00,030
And now you call this, you call this package the actually there there has a approximation, but we use our branch called a approximate approximation.

496
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:09,960
This is the way you call the function. So you basically use the all to solve this system of three differential equations numerically.

497
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:14,560
Okay. And you get out and you plot the curve. Okay?

498
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:20,010
You can see this. Of course, you can change different values and to see different shapes.

499
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,100
And that's something you can play with.

500
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:33,780
QUEST Before it. I mean, the good part is really to argue for this is the really the key right after you get

501
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:40,290
this function that you can solve this numerically and the plot this by eyeballing,

502
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:47,460
you can all tell actually this is a discrete transition, looks pretty smooth and pretty continuous, right.

503
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:55,610
So by outbuilding we as humans, we can all see the gaps but actually calculation in the machine based on some increments.

504
01:01:55,620 --> 01:02:03,060
So but you can now visualize so that you can see the pattern pretty clearly what's going on under this same.

505
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:12,900
Hey, I think that's all I want to cover today. Any questions?

506
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:21,350
Clock. Okay, so thanks for giving me 20 minutes so I can catch my flight.

507
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:29,640
Oh I don't have official records or something about well come back to town Thursday so.
