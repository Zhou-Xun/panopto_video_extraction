1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,860
now we're gonna talk about something very tired about a little bit I think it's more straightforward than

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,380
what we just covered. so we're gonna talk a little bit about

3
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:23,160
what people usually just call proportionate mortality racial studies but they really standardized

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,240
testing payment. p.m. are you could say SPM because

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,580
those are use your you must they only see them in occupational

6
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,600
studies it's weird to see them and others. so you probably won't run into it and that she's

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,780
doing occupational studies so what's the definition of a p.m. hours day. means

8
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:49,160
that what you're doing is investigator as the person doing the data analysis is you're

9
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,640
looking at what proportion of all the deaths and some population that was exposed

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,213
to something years. suspicions can can cause mortality

11
00:01:01,213 --> 00:01:07,073
what proportion of total deaths do to help the particular because pauses

12
00:01:07,073 --> 00:01:12,813
as compared to what's the expected proportion for the people matched

13
00:01:12,813 --> 00:01:17,833
county H et cetera. what would be the expected proportion

14
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:22,873
based on how US population is a comparison. so I'm just

15
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:28,213
like same time. okay.

16
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:33,473
I mean when I put it all together. based on the age and gender

17
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:38,533
and race ethnicity and so on and so on. I thought I my calendar here they died in with all

18
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:45,073
these individuals. I and I expect him

19
00:01:45,073 --> 00:01:50,613
I mean with the reasonable number. I expect six or seven percent of the

20
00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:55,893
smoking population. a lot of people smoke. I expect six or seven percent

21
00:01:55,893 --> 00:02:02,245
of them to die from one care. bye. I study workers

22
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:08,245
and instead of it being six or seven percent fifteen percent of them died from lung cancer

23
00:02:08,245 --> 00:02:13,345
so I think it's very likely that there's something in the workplace

24
00:02:13,345 --> 00:02:18,405
call calling people die from lung cancer. so have a bit of a car summer to they.

25
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:23,485
you notice I didn't give me any absolute rates are comparable. I

26
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:28,825
didn't say I had this many person years in the study I had this many debt and

27
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:33,825
which let you calculate rate. just said here's all here's

28
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:41,425
all the data all the colleges. there's too many gaps in this pub kind of cost. okay

29
00:02:41,425 --> 00:02:46,605
right. so that it's got that's our nest MRIs a ratio of absurd as the study group

30
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:51,665
compared to expected. this is not correct. it's not an athlete number is

31
00:02:51,665 --> 00:03:03,467
just a proportion of everybody that died. yeah

32
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:10,287
well that's sort of what we're talking about here um

33
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:15,727
did you wait a slider to. I think I I think I answered your question. okay.

34
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:20,827
tell me if you did. so why did they wanna do

35
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:26,007
p.m. our study. I'm gonna tell you the quality of living point is good. well I

36
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:31,287
suppose you have information on I'm on a call hard that you know have some kind of exposure.

37
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:36,427
you got information on who died and what they died from but you don't have

38
00:03:36,427 --> 00:03:41,687
complete information either to identify the entire cohort in other words if the person

39
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:46,807
haven't died in a living. I can't really tell you that all that was an individual was part of color the hard

40
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:52,067
because I don't have the information to do that and it won't allow you to attack a person using

41
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:58,107
read because you don't know exactly what everyone hired and so it's.

42
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:03,171
so the beauty of p.m. our study you stated that tends

43
00:04:03,171 --> 00:04:08,491
to be available which is death certificate which has positive contacts and it's usually

44
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:13,531
relatively quick and easy to do. where compared to that

45
00:04:13,531 --> 00:04:18,731
of our analysis. where you have to calculate every with person yours you need to know who

46
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:24,131
works. when here when all those years and do all these calculations. okay. and

47
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:29,191
another thing is if you if you have some separate shows out there you is suspicious. well you

48
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:34,411
are to have how hard you can go back and spend a lot more money and collect much better information

49
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:39,531
on them and basically create a nasty case controls inside of the color

50
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:44,831
hard to choose for you if you are to to better establish whether this might be something

51
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:49,891
real causal relationship.

52
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:55,551
so the weakness of cards is there's no determination about the risk. that means

53
00:04:55,551 --> 00:05:01,351
overall ask them are standardized mortality ratio

54
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:07,011
so hot any cause of death because of the death if that happen in our

55
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:12,351
separate term one hundred. from what's expected for the general population.

56
00:05:12,351 --> 00:05:17,731
thank you for your PM Archimedes started. well I was looking with means that.

57
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:22,971
okay. so basically waiting Jack you lay the MRI

58
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:28,631
I save you a lot of like really detailed equations. so you you can I'll take it later.

59
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:33,631
I never saw them. I just kept for the quick. hey great you. you're gonna

60
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:38,971
add the observer portion of people who say died of lung cancer that's what you're looking

61
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:44,271
at all the people that died and your cohorts and you're gonna use information at their age

62
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:49,351
and race in calendar year and so on to come up with what would be

63
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:54,491
the expected proportion based on US national statistics and you take you

64
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:59,543
take one over the other model type nine hundred all right so what

65
00:05:59,543 --> 00:06:04,583
are the criteria by which you would evaluate this kind of study some of the current area are the

66
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:09,663
same as in essence talk as of our study but I wanna focus what's on different

67
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:14,823
issue here is that you have to worry about competing really compete many competing risk how did

68
00:06:14,823 --> 00:06:21,423
things people could die besides likely to be interested interested in the lung cancer

69
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:27,123
because the because you look in proportion of death due to particular because

70
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:32,803
what have some I think was usually high or unusually low.

71
00:06:32,803 --> 00:06:38,025
that's gonna distort these ratios and resolved lower. however forced to from dance

72
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:43,825
other colleges to say this another way care if you call me back but

73
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:48,865
so supposedly I think lung cancer was only

74
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:53,925
like supposed in the US population service call based on

75
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:58,965
the US population statistics you'd expect seven percent of people die of lung cancer and

76
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:04,305
said you found nine percent down in on care. so that's an increase in fact

77
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:09,385
you know it's an increase it's only about a quarter more than it was to begin with that mean

78
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:14,745
anything without the issue of these populations and people are working

79
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:21,625
occupational study that's what you're doing and so

80
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:26,785
if you if you had the data and ask them our data person years invested

81
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:31,805
to let me who died. well which you down. if you had that

82
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:36,924
you would almost undoubtedly find that they have a really low compared to the general

83
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:43,564
population dying of cardiovascular yeah again I'm talking about the disease.

84
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:48,704
that's gonna have a big influence on the proportion of people

85
00:07:48,704 --> 00:07:54,764
dying of everything. basically it's like oh well always people

86
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:59,944
have died of heart disease but they didn't. so that wasn't a smart some dialogue cancer even though there was nothing

87
00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:05,584
in the workplace that actually time that's that's what the issues. p.m. our study.

88
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:10,704
if it you can you can get a distortion and

89
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:16,004
this is not it this you know what that's waiting for sinuses across but it's not

90
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:21,524
not perfect the mass of them are complicated but basically. hey your car specific

91
00:08:21,524 --> 00:08:26,904
team are and all the ours are kinda specific by definition because you picking it particular type of debt.

92
00:08:26,904 --> 00:08:31,904
thank you. all this is gonna be Ross Ross when you

93
00:08:31,904 --> 00:08:37,120
go to the car specific at are which card you didn't measure that's like if

94
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,300
you had that data you wouldn't have an similar study not a p.m. our study divided by the overall

95
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,360
Aston Martin. so that's the potential for distortion is when that overall that's R

96
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,700
J because so few people are dying apart makes

97
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,720
this denominator smaller then you would have expected. that means the

98
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,780
ratio is gonna be higher. so you're gonna use the foods and all the other deposits including including

99
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:08,180
lung cancer and some of that. so some of that boost

100
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:14,200
had would have nothing to do with exposures at work to discover. okay.

101
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,800
but if you read their records are frequently done because it's so much easier

102
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,980
to say here's a call heart. I look for in a plastic case against

103
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:30,560
him. I did found a pretty high percent of the people I was looking for.

104
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,640
I probably didn't find the people who are in the car but I don't know their car because they didn't work out

105
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,660
an offer but we didn't join union the or something but it's very it's

106
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,860
much easier to say oh so and I have another just like to is do make

107
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:52,280
sure we're really doing the underlying confidence it's but pretty simple. it doesn't

108
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,360
require some effort don't give me wrong to go look for all those death certificates but it's actually pretty easy

109
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,480
to collect the data and then do a quick analysis for and asked them our study.

110
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,640
you have to know everybody's work history in great detail. when they hired and

111
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,400
what their exposures where having uses it and since the exposure. just

112
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:19,000
father for person years. have a car is a more information.

113
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,180
bye. so some uncommon because it is healthy. this probably healthy worker fact

114
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,540
is because garden variety heart disease is common

115
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:34,920
and so here's a sort real it's time for you. you know

116
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,662
if you look at GM ours for all cancers or specific answers

117
00:10:40,662 --> 00:10:45,962
and you're doing it. so you p.m. our study. you should expect all

118
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:51,182
cancer. p.m. are about somewhere in the range of ten to twenty

119
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:56,402
percent higher. then you would see in the general US population. and again that's

120
00:10:56,402 --> 00:11:01,442
because you know working population. the how the strength of the healthy

121
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:06,462
worker effect the reduction in mortality for cardiovascular disease. tends to be much

122
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:14,802
more dramatic and from five to another call. bye.. okay.

123
00:11:14,802 --> 00:11:21,062
so I paid ways and that's why it's pretty straightforward it's just like

124
00:11:21,062 --> 00:11:26,802
you know know what to definition I have a p.m. our study. it's strange.

125
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:31,982
it's it's pretty easy to do and to collect information you need and they can give

126
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:36,982
you no idea what's happening and it's weaknesses. the big rate is being taped

127
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:42,310
you don't know what is the actual underlying reservoir for

128
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:47,630
the population you're studying so you don't know how much distortion you have and just the differences

129
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:52,930
between if you are studying and some other stuff differences in what day do you have to collect how you're analyzing it.

130
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:58,210
that's in our studies again actual the rate that for a person year.

131
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:03,370
larger just get a proportion of Dallas and have the rates. alright. any

132
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:08,770
practice and answer your questions right now. maybe

133
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:17,750
maybe not.

134
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:29,350
okay. we'll going anywhere. yeah

135
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,470
well I mean you can you can justify in the finance at five I put

136
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:39,618
some out things that usually like ten to twenty percent impact you so can say

137
00:12:39,618 --> 00:12:44,998
okay I'm being conservative. I've found that thirty

138
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:50,098
p.m. are for lung cancer and this call hard but I suspected the sages they're supposed to we can actually cause

139
00:12:50,098 --> 00:12:55,178
lung cancer and there's been enough. you know they're just a years since they were supposed

140
00:12:55,178 --> 00:13:00,458
to expect to see the cancers. I'm gonna be conservative and you know I

141
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:06,138
found that I'm gonna pick some really big number. if you know I found it

142
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:11,278
twenty five percent of the death from lung cancer. when you only expect maybe seven percent

143
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:16,410
or something from the whole population. I'm big conservative and kinda see that's

144
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:21,490
elevated by twenty percent because he

145
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:26,530
she was affected and then so I think the twenty five percent and I'm

146
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:32,130
gonna say I'm gonna subtract out of that twenty percent of the twenty five percent.

147
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:37,230
mean basically you can say well I want I found twenty five percent then

148
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:42,630
assume it's really only twenty percent. it's the ratio that you're talking right. so

149
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:47,930
you stay safe. okay. it's twenty percent tax toll way to hide something in those workplaces

150
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:53,450
causing people to go. if not if not eight percent. you don't have that big an impact from

151
00:13:53,450 --> 00:14:15,705
the difference. so yeah

152
00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:20,745
okay well that's a long conversation I mean it's the p.m. are. I'm giving you a type of style

153
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:26,225
he explain you can do it. it's actually often done for occupational studies I. imagine can

154
00:14:26,225 --> 00:14:31,425
how hard and saying that

155
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:36,625
you expect healthy worker effect. it is an occupational color

156
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:41,625
heart. so you should be aware that when you do have the MRI

157
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:46,645
depends on what kinda how come looking at. you expected to start things either up

158
00:14:46,645 --> 00:14:51,765
or down that you brought you don't know you don't know for sure how much is distorted

159
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:56,865
unless you go back and do an of ass our study on the same population and compare them directly. and you know

160
00:14:56,865 --> 00:15:02,305
how much it was distorted. but so it's a little stronger. I can't

161
00:15:02,305 --> 00:15:07,605
then guess where it's like for example I just case. if it

162
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:12,865
if it turns as it turns out so if you did I suppose no I never worried about it

163
00:15:12,865 --> 00:15:18,183
before and it was nineteen people exposing the nineteen forties fifties

164
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:24,643
sixties and asbestos is being used nobody money was at problem

165
00:15:24,643 --> 00:15:29,803
and then you're lucky that you do have p.m. our study for for

166
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:35,663
long cancer and you find it

167
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:41,203
thirty percent of the people in the call haven't died of lung cancer among others to die

168
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:46,343
without me that it's just you have a weird looking help

169
00:15:46,343 --> 00:15:52,223
you it's nice. I'm kind of a strong for part

170
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:58,183
probably week for a lot of cats are much much more likely it's something

171
00:15:58,183 --> 00:16:03,223
they're exposed to project lung cancer because that proportion is too far out to be

172
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:09,203
explained by which expect the differential help.

173
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:12,960
okay
