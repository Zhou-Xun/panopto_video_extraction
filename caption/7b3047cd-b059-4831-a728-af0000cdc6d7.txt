1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:08,810
I'm just really serious. She might be frantic.

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,010
Faster if it's a workout. She is on a workout.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:23,100
Oh. Oh, there's only one today. Really good, actually.

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:31,440
I just see that music in my brain and my brain.

5
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:39,620
I see that. I think I know what I'm talking about.

6
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:53,850
Well, certainly of all, when I was nine years old, I don't like to be honest.

7
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:02,640
It was just like I never really wanted to work out.

8
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,080
I had to do it all that time saying things like that.

9
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:25,740
I remember like I was starting to be the really good old boy, just like dark, like someone that I might not like.

10
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:49,700
I was in that moment, I kind of like I was pretty interesting myself, but I felt what it looks like when I start getting somewhere.

11
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,960
But like I said, I mean,

12
00:01:52,620 --> 00:02:02,280
I want to have a fun class we're going to do in class based on price setting for a drop in the river for student presentation on the sugar price tags.

13
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,800
So this case is courtesy of Cornell University.

14
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,499
It's ugly, right? It's not like I read Cornell Red.

15
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:23,790
So. Okay. So Shawn developed this case and has graciously offered it to me to be precise, and I really like it.

16
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:32,429
So hopefully it will to serve an example of how a drug company might assess the potential demand for

17
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,410
its product and then incorporate that information in its decision on how to price their product.

18
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,500
Even though we're now talking about firm decisions with this case rather than consumer decisions,

19
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:51,540
I think you kind of see that it sort of fits in nicely now with our kind of discussion of demand and factors like the elasticity of demand.

20
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,660
And so how does a firm that they've got some product are developing?

21
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,070
You don't yet know fully what the market for that product is.

22
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:10,580
They have to make some guesses as to who'll buy my product if I charge it at various prices for it and then determine the best prices.

23
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,650
So we're going to do is going to go through the facts of the case.

24
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:26,070
And then I have the set of slides on canvas and then kind of break up into small groups of maybe six people or so.

25
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:33,660
And if one of you can have your laptop open and have the have the document off that ensures access to the documents in every group,

26
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:43,970
and then look back at the information as you're thinking about how this company should assess the potential market and basically said,

27
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:53,280
so we've got a new drug being developed called angiotensin tens of,

28
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:01,530
let's say drug that this kind of a common drug in that area that was the preexisting drug that they were trying to compete with.

29
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,880
And it was used in particular for angioplasties, a cardiac procedure.

30
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,100
700,000 of them a year. And heparin was essentially always used.

31
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:19,490
So think of the market crapper in 700,000. Angioplasties and heparin was cheap.

32
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,110
Developed a long time ago. It was off half and it's $2 a dose.

33
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:36,310
So that's what they're trying to compete with. And so this company, Biogen, spent about seven years on R&D, on this drug, about $1,000,000.

34
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:42,070
It all begins with the idea we're going to build a better blood thinner that will compete with heparin.

35
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,020
Unfortunately, the initial trial results were not all that fantastic.

36
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,420
They showed only sort of small improvements relative to relative to heparin.

37
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,250
But the production costs of the drug look really high, about $100 a dose.

38
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,870
So $2 a dose versus $100 a dose. It's a very well, $100.

39
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,500
The dose to produce that obviously have got to be able to charge over $100 a dose to make this worth my while.

40
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:15,670
And if there's only a small clinical improvement, probably looking at what hospitals are going to decide, there is a stigma.

41
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:24,940
So they kind of punted on it. There is another company, though, that was willing to buy the drug from them.

42
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,520
You take a chance on surgery and some further research on it. So it was a deal.

43
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,240
They got $2 million. Not really a whole lot.

44
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,350
I consider how this all ends and they get some royalties.

45
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,829
So million dollars upfront.

46
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:50,440
So, you know, if the drug is never approved, never sold, well, it's got back 2 million of the $150 million, 150 million they use to develop the drug.

47
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:59,620
So it's pretty paltry. But they did get sort of agreement to have royalties of between six and 20% to account depends on the sales.

48
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:06,250
The bigger the sales, the bigger the royalty would be. And so that's what they sold it for.

49
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,190
So that situation is really not looking great. One company has more or less given up on the drug and sold it,

50
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:19,390
sold the rights to it for literally pennies on the dollar compared to the investment they'd already put in.

51
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,960
So the other companies, well, you know, we don't really have that much invested and we can give this a shot.

52
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:34,180
And it turns out that with further research to show that this new drug had substantial clinical benefits.

53
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:42,850
Okay. So you're the main kind of clinical comparisons, heparin for an unpredictable effect there for us being closely monitored,

54
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:48,340
too much blood thinning all of a sudden for people at risk of stroke and some other type of a bleed.

55
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,480
So you really have to monitor it and your max is more predictable.

56
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:59,900
I give a certain dose I can kind of understand what that what impact that's going to have within a much closer tolerance.

57
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,590
And I don't have to monitor quite, quite as closely heparin,

58
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:11,979
high bleeding risk in your max at a lower bleeding risk, two, two or 3% adverse reactions.

59
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:19,150
Some of them could even be fatal. And angio max in the trials really didn't have any big adverse reactions.

60
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,110
And in terms of controlling it, heparin sort of it took it takes a while.

61
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,280
You have to dose it for a while before it kind of takes effect, before it reaches a therapeutic level.

62
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,900
And at that point, it kind of maintains that for a while. So you don't want the blood thinning anymore?

63
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,670
Well, you don't just take the person off heparin and 5 minutes later, it's gone.

64
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:48,540
It kind of persists in the system for a long time. Whereas Angio Max, you give it and it kind of takes effect much, much more likely.

65
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:55,750
And the cost, as we said, it's think thing of cost of goods is just being like the marginal cost of producing a dose.

66
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,469
So it's nothing to do with the research cost or any of those past sunk costs,

67
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:04,480
but it's just if I want to actually literally produce one more dose of this drug, how much is it going to cost?

68
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:11,920
So $2 now with further out of research and working on production processes.

69
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:19,030
They got that $100 down to 40. And so still 20 times the cost of producing a dose of heparin.

70
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:26,949
But that's better than 50 times the cost of producing a dose of heparin. So things look a little better, quite a bit better on the clinical research,

71
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:32,110
and they look at least somewhat better on the cost of production after the new company sort of took over.

72
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,130
And so that's kind of the clinical basics, and you've got a better product.

73
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,060
But making it is a lot more expensive.

74
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,800
So how do you deal with that? Here are some of the numbers.

75
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,650
I kind of got off set a little bit, but so.

76
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,170
That's to this point.

77
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:05,020
2% is here. The sole column just. Shoot it over.

78
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:22,990
Here we go. That looks better. So I'm going to classes of patients here, high risk patients.

79
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:30,969
Those are people who previously had a heart attack or were admitted to the hospital due to unstable angina and then very high risk patients,

80
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,580
those who had a heart attack within the previous two weeks.

81
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,470
So those are kind of the two classes of patients that were primarily studied and thought, well,

82
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,460
if people are going to benefit from this drug, the benefits finally largest in these two groups.

83
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:54,620
So deaths were kind of a wash in terms of heparin versus angio max and the high risk, but the heparin patients did worse still.

84
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:07,950
Now it's better. Sorry about that. Approbation stood better in terms of the variant.

85
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,940
Anti-vax patients did better in terms of the very high risk.

86
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:19,819
Risk of a heart attack was a little bit lower in the high risk group with Andrea makes a bigger difference for the very high

87
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:29,380
risk group having to do a repeat procedure repeat angioplasty very slightly lower for the Andrea max group in the high risk,

88
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,440
a little bit bigger difference yet again in the very high risk group of patients.

89
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:41,990
And then finally, major bleeds. And that's where there was a big improvement in both groups for angio max rather than the.

90
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,310
Brandon Harper.

91
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:55,980
So if you kind of add them all up and just say adverse events, call these all adverse events in the high risk, 16.5% versus 9.5, very high risk.

92
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,610
So even a starker difference, 21.4 versus 7.8.

93
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:04,170
So now we're seeing substantial clinical benefit here. Okay.

94
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:12,269
So they got the drug approved by the FDA in 2000, three, 2000 for prevention of blood clots during angioplasty.

95
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,580
And these two patient groups, high risk and very high risk.

96
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,540
We're also going to add a third group, late or low risk patients.

97
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,540
So if the FDA approves a drug for these two indications, are you not allowed to use in anybody else?

98
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:30,060
Well, depends. Use it or we can use it off label physician.

99
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:37,500
General physician can can order it. So this is a group that was approved for by the FDA and the data that was used for that approval.

100
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,240
It could also be used in more patients than that if the clinicians decide to use it that way.

101
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,790
So the fact the FDA has only approved it for these indications does not prohibit its use for other indications.

102
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:54,530
Once it's an FDA approved drug, generally it can be used for whoever the clinician wants to use it for.

103
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,819
It's not an FDA approved drug that you can't use it for anybody outside of a trial setting.

104
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,680
But once it's approved, you're not limited to using just in these two groups.

105
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,740
And that's going to be important to the case later on.

106
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,370
And so I just think about how should they determine the price.

107
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:22,370
Now, what are what are some of the considerations that they ought to take into account so that drug companies try to maximize their profits?

108
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:29,600
That's their objective here and say, at what price am I going to be able to make the most profit from selling this drug?

109
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:41,330
So if I overprice it, nobody's going to buy it. If I underprice it, let's say if I price that $39 a dose, what was the cost of producing it for me?

110
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,410
So not only am I not paying back any of the sunk costs of my research,

111
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:51,680
I'm not even paying back the marginal costs of producing another dose so I can underprice that I can overprice.

112
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,630
And so how do I find that balance? What are the worst of the big picture things I'll look at?

113
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,890
Yeah. How much is it saving the hospital? Like, what is this saving the hospital to use?

114
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,950
Okay. So, in other words, what what's the business proposition to the hospital for adopting the drug?

115
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,610
So if I've got a lot of complications that are being avoided and the hospital, in fact,

116
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,700
would have to pay for the costs of those complications, that's a good thing to add.

117
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:31,110
Argue that they are generally that's true here because they could say, well, let's look at look at it from the hospital's perspective.

118
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:39,150
Now, the hospital is demander here. So think of the hospital now as playing the consumer role relative to the theory we've been talking about.

119
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,570
They're the ones that have to decide the demands of the individual patient who's deciding, am I going to get Antiemetics versus heparin?

120
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:51,660
No. So they want the instruments, too, because they do.

121
00:13:51,660 --> 00:14:02,130
A lot of the time when you learn the completion order, they may make a decision, you know, on this in this situation.

122
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:07,500
So this is a little bit different because it's sort of an in-hospital thing.

123
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,819
It's not an outpatient drug where it's a prescription drug coverage of the patient that's

124
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,600
going to determine whether it can be used or how much it's reimbursed based on the deal.

125
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,520
Instead, it's the hospital buying the drug and admitting and administering it as part of the procedure,

126
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,120
and it's generally receiving a bundled payment for the procedure.

127
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:30,630
So if you think your hospital, you know, most of these patients are Medicare, probably it's a lot.

128
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:37,009
And probably at least half of them, I would think would be Medicare hospitals getting fixed, DRG payment diagnosis related groups.

129
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:44,820
So if you're admitted for an angioplasty, a certain class that's going to determine, you know, you're going to get $21,000 for that admission.

130
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:51,959
If it costs you $100,000 to care for that patient, tough luck to cost you $1,000 to care for that patient.

131
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,980
Good on you. But in that case, you're you're you.

132
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,180
The hospital are are out the price of the drug because your reimbursement for

133
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,440
that case is fixed independent of whether it was an aggregate max or heparin.

134
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:10,740
And then simply if you think about the complications, then that's why the hospital cares financially about the complications,

135
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:16,020
because if a complication occurs, they don't get to say, Oh, that's over three days in the hospital.

136
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,770
We can go in three more days, cool. We get the money instead.

137
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,550
It's like, well, we still have our $21,000 or whatever the drug payment is.

138
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,240
And now we got to keep in the hospital three days longer, fever or complication.

139
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:34,049
So it's the hospital here that is the demand or not the patient and is the hospital is

140
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,550
paying for it and the hospital is going to save any money from avoiding complications.

141
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,440
Yeah, I would just say I would start if I was the drug company, I would start with the break even analysis of how much is it,

142
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:49,829
how much do we need to charge to break even over a certain period of time and then figure out what margins are in that drug group

143
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:55,920
for the hospital and what percentage of the market can we capture based on all the marketing things that you talked about?

144
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,020
Yeah. And go from there, what percentage of the marketing can capture at different prices?

145
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:06,420
That's going to be the key to your some of the data that you're that they're going to have financially.

146
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:14,790
So for a lot of the patients, Shawn didn't have the exact numbers for complications with heparin or with Angio Max,

147
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:20,490
but the estimate that was a benefit to Angie, a maximum of 3.5% reduction in complications.

148
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,290
So complications, again, were any one of these things.

149
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:36,030
And there you see the 7% advantage for high risk and then roughly 14%, a little under 14% advantage for low risk.

150
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:43,409
So you see the estimated advantage of about 3.5% reduction in complication for low risk patients.

151
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:49,229
Again, these are the patients that that are not under the FDA approval and they weren't under the formal clinical trials.

152
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,370
So it's more of a little more of a guess on that group.

153
00:16:53,370 --> 00:17:03,060
But let's just kind of assume that it's a fairly accurate guess. So here we got the 7% advantage in high risk, 13.6, the very high risk.

154
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,790
So across all of these complications,

155
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:13,239
sort of a weighted average cost to the hospital of dealing with the complications could be different of being one type of complication.

156
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,190
It is, but sort of a weighted average across them is about $8,000.

157
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:23,100
So every prevented complication is going to save the hospital 8000 bucks.

158
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:31,080
Okay. So then what is the expected savings from using angio max rather than heparin?

159
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:40,140
Oh, yeah, it's 3.5% times 8000. 3.5, unless patients experience a complication for each one of those to save 8000 bucks.

160
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,480
So the expected value per patient treated in the low risk category is $280.

161
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,840
In the high risk category.

162
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:58,860
That doubles because the avoided complication sort of so the angio max you reduce complication 7% say they thousand dollars if you do avoid a complex.

163
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,760
Patient. So on average per patient treated, you're saving $580.

164
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:11,800
And then it gets even bigger. Not surprisingly, for the very high risk group, 13.6% fewer complications.

165
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:17,200
8000 savings per avoided complications. So on a per patient treated basis.

166
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:23,590
So I don't know if I treat a patient. Would you have had a complication in 13 13.6%?

167
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:30,040
Fewer of you would if I used angio max than heparin. It's a little over $1,000 savings per patient.

168
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,760
On average, you have to give one and a half doses per patient.

169
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,250
So think about how much you've saved per dose given.

170
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,200
Figure out the price per dose.

171
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:51,880
So from a hospital's perspective, if it takes one and a half doses on average to save $280 on a per dose basis, I'm saving $185 per dose given.

172
00:18:53,190 --> 00:19:04,920
Similarly, if it takes one and a half doses on average to save on average $560 and complication costs $375 savings per dose dividing this by 1.5.

173
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,040
Similarly, 88 divided by 1.5.

174
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,300
We put it on a per dose basis, sort of standardized masking per dose.

175
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:18,210
$725 savings per dose given on average.

176
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:27,420
Okay. Now, how many patients of the very high risk where the savings are the greatest is the smallest group.

177
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:39,670
It's about 70,000 patients a year. A much bigger group is that high risk group where the savings per dose is lower, 280,000 per year,

178
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:45,790
and then half of all patients in others, just incidentally, turns out to be equal to the sum of these two.

179
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:53,560
I could further double the number of patients treated if I could, if I, as a drug company, can convince hospitals to use in low risk patients.

180
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:02,220
So that's your data. Now break up into three groups of about five or six.

181
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:09,520
You can pull these slides off. You have access to everything and think about what the drug companies best price would be.

182
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,869
I want you to make a kind of a few assumptions. George Rock the hospital.

183
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:19,870
Here is the demand early care about the patients, not the patient who's deciding copper, emperor and or NGO Max.

184
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,510
The hospital is paid on a fixed basis per patient treated.

185
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,310
So they can't just say, well, if I'm going to pay $10, I'd use the more expensive drug and until the patient more, they get a fixed case.

186
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,290
In private insurers giving a bundled payment rate which say, well, for an angioplasty, we're paying you X.

187
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:46,840
And Medicare explicitly does that for with the drug system, the hospital gets a fixed fee for a patient,

188
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:53,290
and that fee is independent of whether they're going to use antiemetics or heparin.

189
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:57,190
And it's independent of whether the hospital has to treat complications or not

190
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,840
so that the hospital is bearing the financial costs of those complications.

191
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,100
Their payment is independent of whether they use heparin or angio max.

192
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:14,020
Their payment is independent of whether the patient experiences a complication or not, and also assume that that's kind of the main thing.

193
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:21,660
The hospital cares about avoiding the costs of treating complications, assuming it has at least the direct financial incentive to care.

194
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,050
So don't take it for purposes of this sort of argument.

195
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:34,479
Assume the hospital doesn't sort of assign an independent value to the patient, avoiding a complication, really.

196
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,430
They just care about what is the complication going to cost to keep things a

197
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:45,160
little bit easier and also assume that the drug company has to set one price.

198
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:51,970
In other words, they have to say, okay, the price of Harper, the price of angio, Max, is going to be X dollars.

199
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,740
And they can't try to differentiate that price, say, across hospitals or across patients, which is going to be one price that they have to set.

200
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,580
So in that world where they have to set one price, what's the best price?

201
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:14,429
Okay, come to us regulatory any questions?

202
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:20,260
Is is a set up clear in pain?

203
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:29,530
Sure. But how does it work?

204
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,770
So this is pretty much all of us.

205
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:44,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

206
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:58,180
I guess that's why don't you talk about theoretically some assumption about the hospital.

207
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:15,640
How about what you found out when you just look at how much I think about it right after I got it.

208
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:35,980
And so I think there's a very high temperature.

209
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,350
Yeah, that's about $50.

210
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:53,080
Be a little bit longer. Those are going to be worth less than $60, starting at $169.

211
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,170
44.50. Right.

212
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:05,650
I see what you're saying. I see you're giving the chances versus you're getting more of the same.

213
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:22,360
But, you know, it was somewhere between 300000 to 3000 starts that there would be some we might use as much as we would like to see plastic.

214
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:31,840
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I definitely think it's easy, but I think.

215
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:37,710
What do you want them to think about it? Well, I think that would be charges.

216
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,660
So they only buy it? Yeah.

217
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,670
I think some company more than double her.

218
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:53,250
So what are they?

219
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,570
They don't give us good for everything.

220
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:14,550
So it costs $20. Right. So if we charge them for profit, not something like this, but if we start like 325 or so,

221
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:30,660
we're going to buy more than, like how much they learned gave us all the problem.

222
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:42,570
Yeah, I was in the hospital too, so we were the last five patients expected savings account?

223
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:50,560
Yes. And that's what we are really concerned about investing in this,

224
00:25:52,140 --> 00:26:01,500
because you might find that everybody's like different kinds of things and pricing it lower and not really going to use for lowest anyways.

225
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:11,549
I think if you go in the futures market, creating more prices are actually pretty easy for hospitals.

226
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:17,760
As long as those numbers are summarized as very high risk and very high risk,

227
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:30,080
stay the same on right now and not just be high risk or lower in the market.

228
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:38,820
And you know, I don't feel like it's the reason haven't paid the price is fixed.

229
00:26:41,810 --> 00:27:05,610
I mean one of this is sometimes like they feel like they do the math but I think it's like $90 per week is not as good as.

230
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:13,110
Yeah that's true for them.

231
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:24,179
Double the property you like 3 to 350 day that it's just it's just it's still wouldn't you know the higher education savings that you

232
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:44,530
incentivize hard for those two groups because you don't want to have no access to higher rates to um when you got so much advance.

233
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:53,610
It's not as much as they're trying to get $150 million.

234
00:27:53,780 --> 00:28:07,649
Yeah. So it's still a high dose and that's one of the main thing that would happen to me.

235
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:16,930
Exactly. It'll be 7.7%, which is double that at the hospital.

236
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:21,180
So how about this?

237
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:26,940
So we're trying to help the both of you be very inspired.

238
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:43,560
So, yeah, so sometimes, you know, you're not sure how much hospital staff to know, even though it's okay.

239
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:57,890
It's it's to say I was I knew you had on your taxes that are going to be presented by.

240
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:06,160
Yeah I'm so on .00.

241
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,430
So yeah. It's always an email.

242
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:19,890
It was, hey, we need a thing that seems a little set, you know, that's what's going to take us forever.

243
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:27,930
So we're saying, like I said, it's it look like it was like the number one thing that's like.

244
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,950
Yeah, that's not so. Oh, I see.

245
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,530
So we discovered this kind of civilian R&D for this company.

246
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:48,520
And a lot of this consideration for thinking about this doesn't make the number of patients in hospital how much you've got to pay,

247
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,100
$2 million plus royalties.

248
00:29:54,170 --> 00:30:02,440
Okay. See how you can multiply it by one to price to make it.

249
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:11,540
They would still be 50%. Sorry. What I do is our highest risk for this change is 20%.

250
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:21,460
I don't think that the whole thing in my list is a 10% to 8% sales.

251
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:29,500
But to say like so like you say, like it really isn't for say this.

252
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:36,070
I mean, I asked that, but you have to accept both sides of it.

253
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,040
Okay. So you were like yesterday that like samples that they have.

254
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:48,040
So it's almost like let's talk about transparency.

255
00:30:49,910 --> 00:31:03,610
So yeah, so which I did, I did times once I need a multiply because I feel better because I was looking a little bit different strategically.

256
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:14,790
It's not supposed to. We have got to have an opportunity to shoot it at them with 5%, which is higher than we expected by the government.

257
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:22,410
And they think that is against the idea of I heard that it should be like a lot of people have.

258
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:28,510
That's tough to get all the numbers up there.

259
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:33,610
What's the difference between expected saving money?

260
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:44,820
Exxon expected to produce things for the last $2,000.

261
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:56,660
Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. I expected, by the way, 60, 60.

262
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,410
And we certainly do.

263
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:13,660
And that'll be like I wasn't expecting how much the hospital saves on average, waiting for an expected does the R&D to have to do something.

264
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:24,730
So in terms of what would they have to consider, you don't even get some valuable lesson about how to do that.

265
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:48,920
That's why I like it like that. Yeah, that's how much that's how much time I was in the morning by the square station, for example, like, like 400.

266
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,650
And something inside of it is hard to figure out exactly what a good it would be,

267
00:32:54,250 --> 00:33:02,500
because then every time when you're asking me, well, you're saying that it's like dependent.

268
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:08,850
So in the person next to me versus some of the risk category,

269
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:29,650
I realize a lot of this is also on the I say there's high very high end rumors also only.

270
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:39,130
Yeah it is also said that patients especially like took on its way to prison.

271
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:51,760
I spent less on whatever some researchers spent less on some advancements or try not to for the tradeoff 45 more minutes.

272
00:33:52,030 --> 00:34:01,870
Surely we can try it. So let me just give you a little different.

273
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,240
You just save and make it possible.

274
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:18,970
Now, I'm just trying to say that right now we're looking at a lot of assumptions that make the case that it's just like the better for us.

275
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:26,580
So just so you know, this wasn't that this was just based on individual sales people.

276
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,910
Yeah. You would you would eliminate a huge predictor. But I'm trying to mean.

277
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:52,780
My time doing so that the number of people in this conflict, I think is the most important.

278
00:34:53,150 --> 00:35:01,740
If you think about it and you get a role like this other, you know, better options.

279
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:07,200
Yeah, I'm talking about like multiply between or anything like that.

280
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,980
So. Yeah, that's, that's like I told you about 40 times.

281
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:29,420
So this one really it was just too much because I just every patient has a complication.

282
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:35,710
So I think that's crazy or altering or not.

283
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:45,000
I, I know it's like a single level.

284
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,950
Yeah, it kind of. So we had to increase discussions to different things.

285
00:35:50,280 --> 00:36:01,650
So some of us, like I think it would have said, okay, I wouldn't was just thinking, yeah,

286
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:39,870
I think once we take the worst cause I suppose you come over here now shifted to South Africa which is going

287
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:51,360
to take a happening because I have someone that I have that I was thinking like help my boyfriend like,

288
00:36:53,730 --> 00:37:04,710
you know, just go because like I'm going to get, you know, that's my question, I assume.

289
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:23,740
So he is not going to learn to do that to be one friends like I suppose you could say, like add some things like.

290
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:28,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

291
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:29,260
I don't know.

292
00:37:30,590 --> 00:38:01,160
I think it's interesting that this was the one that when I found out I don't really want to talk about what you thought the best pricing strategy is.

293
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:16,170
Let me just remind people, I'm on the side, like in sharing their thoughts about how this works.

294
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:23,100
What was your what was your thought process before you come up with a list of if you can sign up.

295
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:37,950
Okay. So first started by how much the hospital to Andrew on that and then we calculated how much it would cost I guess the

296
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:46,500
pharmaceutical company to make sure that for each patient because we know that it's $40 a dose that each patient is 1.5 dosages.

297
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:52,270
So that would be $60. And the hospital is saving like roughly 330 million.

298
00:38:52,860 --> 00:39:04,050
So the way we saw it, as long as we're able to charge a price above 60 and hospital is paying less than they would be saving and complication rates.

299
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:09,330
But that would be like the range of what gives you a window to think about.

300
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:13,379
So lower floor of that window would be sort of a $40 a dose production.

301
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:18,870
So $60 per patient treated. If you charge any less than that, obviously you're going to go out of business.

302
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:26,850
And if you charge more than the hospital's potential savings, the hospitals are going to pass and you're not going to sell anything.

303
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:29,999
So you've got a couple of ways of getting no revenue.

304
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
One way is to overprice. It's nobody by. Another way is to give it away.

305
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,850
You don't want to give it away, and it won't sell at the low cost and you don't want to give away all your sales.

306
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:45,010
And so it gives you some range to think about. How can we make that range a little more specific?

307
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:50,260
So is a $41 a dose price a sensible idea?

308
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:55,960
No. Why not? Yes.

309
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:00,609
The hospital saving, even with the low risk patients, is saving 185 per dose.

310
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:13,930
So you could at the high end of your range priced at like 175 or even 180 and saving $5 per patient for 350,000 patients adds up for the hospital.

311
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,830
So the hospital should be willing to pay. All right.

312
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:28,720
So hospitals should be willing to pay up to $185 a dose, even for the low risk patients.

313
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,850
So if your pricing is less than that,

314
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:37,090
you're clearly losing money on the table because you're not you're not giving up any sales by setting a higher price.

315
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,390
If I charge 100 rather than 90, it's not going to affect my sales at all.

316
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:48,730
But by revenues are going up. So clearly 100 is a better price, the mighty and 110 is a better price than 100 and so on.

317
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:54,220
So let's say kind of the floor of what I ought to be thinking about as the drug company is $185.

318
00:40:55,030 --> 00:41:00,580
If I charge less than 185, I'm not getting any more sales than if I charge 185.

319
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:06,020
So I might as well sort of get every penny of the hospitals willing to pay.

320
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:14,390
So that's my serve. Everybody price the whole 700,000 people are going to get it.

321
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,720
Yeah, I got a question about the savings per dose.

322
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:22,080
Is that $185 over what they'd be paying for heparin?

323
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,820
So that's $2 with their maximum willingness to be on an $87.

324
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:30,300
Let's assume it's relative to heparin. So it's a 100 or just keep it 185.

325
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:38,260
Factor in the cost of heparin. All right.

326
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,760
So he's 185 the best price. Yes.

327
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:51,159
Well, we just kind of talked about if you price it at like 360, 370, you're going to more than double your profits.

328
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,970
And we see that there's like this 330,000 low risk.

329
00:41:55,030 --> 00:42:02,140
It's also 350,000 high risk and very high risk. So you would only sell half as many, but each one with more than double in profit.

330
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:09,670
So if you weren't trying to serve the low risk patients as well, the best profit price would be closer to the 375.

331
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:14,920
So what concept from class does that sound like you're employing there and your reasoning?

332
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:27,640
Not like an elasticity of demand. Because your time and proportional changes if I you know I could double my price and get.

333
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:35,670
No. And I'm only losing a small number of sales and I'm safe and I'm saving the cost of using those extra drugs.

334
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:41,790
So now it's profitable to serve the low risk people because you couldn't get $185 for serving.

335
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,410
That would only cost $40.

336
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:51,420
But it's actually more profitable, as you point out, not to serve the lower risk patients to price high enough that the hospitals say, you know what?

337
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:55,830
We're staying with the FDA guidelines. We're not going to give this to low risk patients.

338
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:56,550
Yeah.

339
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:05,400
And because the it is not FDA approved for the low risk patients, a lot of doctors and for certain patients, they would not even prescribe it to them.

340
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,690
So it's not a guaranteed prescription for every one of the patients.

341
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:16,490
So that is why we were thinking that's just at least until there's more research, just target the high risk.

342
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,770
Very high risk. And as things change, we could maybe change the price.

343
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:26,040
Okay. So one possibility then sort of onto the low risks.

344
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:26,640
Yeah.

345
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:37,290
And would be profitable to serve them because $185 is more than 40, but it's not as profitable as more than doubling the price and losing those sales.

346
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:46,760
Now, should I roughly double the price again and restrict my market to only the very high risk and I see some head shaking.

347
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:55,270
Why is that a bad idea? Among the very high risk patients, like the number of patients is going to be smaller than the virus patient.

348
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:02,680
So we can bring this back to elasticity of demand. And we talked last time about how the elasticity of demand can vary along a demand curve.

349
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:08,050
This is a much more elastic response here at basically roughly double the price.

350
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,209
And I'm losing half my sales. I'm losing this 350,000.

351
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:16,930
Out of my 700,000, you're roughly doubling the price again.

352
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:21,040
And I'm losing 80% of my sales.

353
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,100
I'm losing 280,000 of my remaining 350.

354
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:30,670
So there's a much more elastic response to raising the price from 375,

355
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:37,060
doubling it roughly to something 25 than there was doubling it roughly from 185 to 375.

356
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:43,540
So I'm paid. So the elasticity of demand, that's my sales penalty for raising price.

357
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,830
If the demand is very elastic, I pay a big penalty in lost sales from from raising the price.

358
00:44:53,510 --> 00:45:00,680
The penalty was not sufficiently high to say, well, you know, it's worth charging this higher price and I'm willing to give up these sales.

359
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:05,090
But here, the elasticity is so much larger going from this price to this price,

360
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:11,690
and we'll calculate them in a minute to see how much larger that I'm not willing to lose these 280,000 sales.

361
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:19,880
In order to be able to charge 725 for the much smaller number.

362
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,430
Here's essentially the demand curve for the drug in this case,

363
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:46,680
since we've got sort of these three groups and we sort of assume there's not really differentiation within them,

364
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:54,180
that they're sort of three discrete groups and they're relatively clinically similar within groups.

365
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:59,310
Now, if we assume there is some differentiation between patients, maybe even among the very highs,

366
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:05,590
there are some there we know are at even higher risk than that average for a complication and others are lower.

367
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,840
Then we have a more continuous demand curve like we have seen in class.

368
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:18,419
But for now, let's just kind of assume that, you know, the drug company in the hospitals just kind of lumped these patients into these three groups,

369
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:22,140
and we're not going to sort of have a differentiation within them.

370
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:31,350
So we get this sort of stepwise demand curve where if I set a price above $725 and we talked about the patient,

371
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,660
the consumer dropping out of the market,

372
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:40,320
we set their demand with a vertical of some price, like when we added up those market to those individual demand curves to get a market demand.

373
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:53,360
And so we have. Like we have the consumers price interceptors, $50, $50.

374
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:59,660
We said really far be complete about their demand curve. Their demand curve is this equation.

375
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:03,200
This slide at prices below 50.

376
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:14,250
And it's vertical at zero and prices above 50. So 77 or $25 is the equivalent of that $50 from our problem.

377
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:18,360
Last time the company price is above 725.

378
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:23,190
All the hospitals are out even for their very high risk patients and demand is zero.

379
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:24,730
Now,

380
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:31,650
since we're assuming there's just sort of three discrete groups of patients and there's not any sort of differentiation between them within a group,

381
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:36,780
then suddenly it's like price drops to below seven or $25.

382
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,780
My demand is going to jump from 0 to 70000.

383
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:02,810
Now, if I drop my price below 725, let's say I drop it to maybe about $500.

384
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:11,600
My getting any extra patients and extra sales? No. There is no point in charging a price of 500 rather than 725.

385
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:17,900
I'm losing $225 a dose and my reward for that is exactly zero additional doses sold.

386
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:32,180
So that's kind of pointless. But if I drop it all the way to 375 on the low, then suddenly I get this next mass of patients, I get the second group.

387
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:40,570
And there's no point in dropping it to say $200, because if I drop it to $200,

388
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:45,520
I'm still self selling 350,000 patients times the dose, two and a half a patient.

389
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:57,820
Again, no sales and I've given up revenue, but if I drop it to 185 or below, suddenly my demand doubles further to 700,000.

390
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:05,320
And there's no point in selling it for, I say, $100 because if I sell it for $100, I'm still a self serving 700,000 patients.

391
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:13,300
So with this sort of three discrete groups of patients, rather than a continuous demand curve, we have kind of this stair step demand curve.

392
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:18,070
Quantity is zero and prices above 725, then it jumps to 70,000.

393
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:26,040
Terms of patients served, it stays at 70,000 until price falls to 375, three, 74, 19.

394
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:31,540
Then it jumps to two. 350,000 total patients served an extra 280,000.

395
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:38,320
Then I still I still stay at that number of patients unless I drop my price all the way to 185 or below,

396
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,800
at which point my demand jumps up to 700,000 total patients served.

397
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:48,309
Again, if we were to say that hospitals somehow can differentiate between the groups and say even among the very high,

398
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:51,490
these are the ones that are very, very high. And these ones are only a little Henry Hyde.

399
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:56,260
And then we do have more stair steps or even a continuous demand curve if hospitals

400
00:49:56,290 --> 00:50:01,210
kind of sinuous estimate of the probability of each individual's risk of complication.

401
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:07,510
But probably there's not that level of information to be able to kind of differentiate.

402
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:10,629
So this Kevin Broad brush seems probably pretty accurate.

403
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:20,830
There is three discrete groups of patients and so we argue that it makes no sense to serve, even though it's profitable to serve.

404
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:29,440
The low risk 185 is a lot more than the 40 hour production cost, since we have to sell the drug at one price for all patients,

405
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:36,070
we're sacrificing too much profit from the higher price that we could have gotten.

406
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:42,230
So let's think about the elasticity of demand. Okay.

407
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:48,530
So if we go for a price of seven $0.25, the highest price we're considering is any higher than that.

408
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:55,550
We sell nothing and we drop it all the way through 75 because that's the next lowest price we should consider.

409
00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:10,180
What's the elasticity of demand? I'll put up the generic formula and then you can help me fill in the numbers.

410
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:22,140
Q New minus. Q Old. Divided by Q old P new minus the old divided by P.

411
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:31,410
What we're doing is we're going from 725, considering dropping it to 75.

412
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:36,760
75 or 85. Okay, so what numbers should I stick in this formula?

413
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,230
So what's Q new in 2000?

414
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:57,540
Q So at 350, so at the lower price, I could sell it, serve 350,000 patients.

415
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,080
What's Q Old 70?

416
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,290
Okay. And then we know that Q old is 70,000.

417
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:20,430
And what are the prices? 7725 divided by 745.

418
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:31,350
So when I put all that in, this is going to end up being for 280 divided by 70.

419
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:37,290
This is going to end up being negative .483.

420
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:46,500
It's it's 48.3% drop in price. And if we do all that math, we are -8.28 elasticity of demand.

421
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:52,860
Now, one of the things we talk about with elasticity is one of the nice things about them is they're unit less.

422
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:58,319
Okay. So here I just plugged in the number of patients. I could have also done the number of doses.

423
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:07,950
Right. And that would have multiplied this by 1.5, this by 1.5 and this by 1.5.

424
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:10,950
And what would it have changed? My elasticity. Now.

425
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,240
Because we're asking just what what proportion of changes there.

426
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:22,799
And since the expected doses per patient are 1.5 in all the patient groups, I could have done this calculation the way I did it,

427
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,070
just by plugging the number of patients served in as my measure of quantity.

428
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:31,470
Or I could have used a measure of quantity. The number of doses that we've gotten the exact same.

429
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:39,300
The 1.5. So just about everywhere. So that's a very, very price elastic response.

430
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:46,710
So that says, you know, I'm really tempted to lower that price from 725 to 375.

431
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:51,599
Now I'm cutting my price almost in half. I'm dropping it by 48%.

432
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:56,010
I don't really like doing that. But look at how big the reward is.

433
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:03,999
The reward is also a massive, massively more doses announced.

434
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:16,320
Now still the same calculation. But if I drop the price from 375 to 185.

435
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
And so what's the new quantity going to be?

436
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,120
The new quantity is going to be our 700,000 patients served.

437
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:46,610
And if we look at those numbers, that's going to be on the top.

438
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:50,420
It's going to be one over 350 divided by 350.

439
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:59,750
On the bottom, it's going to be -4.5 or seven coming the price just over 50% and cutting it by.

440
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:12,350
And the elasticity is going to be -1.97. Okay.

441
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:15,530
So that's still elastic, but it's much less elastic.

442
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:22,210
So now what that's telling me is the reward or the extra sales that I get for cutting my price by consumer

443
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:28,340
is roughly I'm dropping my price in half once and this roughly I'm dropping my price in half a second time.

444
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:33,080
I get a massive reward for that first 50% cut in price.

445
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:43,550
I get a much smaller reward for that second 50% cut in price still might be worth it because that still looks like I'm getting a lot of extra sales.

446
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:57,470
Why isn't it worth it? What else do I have to take account of, other than just how many units I selling and how much revenue I got in this?

447
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,980
Cost and what's it going to cost me to produce it? All right.

448
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,080
So here's some of the bottom line in my profits.

449
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:19,190
So if I charge the price, the highest price I can get away with charging to serve only the very high risk market, I get a profit of 72 million.

450
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:27,600
If I charge the very highest price, I can possibly get away with the charge to serve the very high and high risks.

451
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:31,380
My profit is 176 million.

452
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:41,790
If I charge the very highest price I can possibly get away with and I'll put these up with these slides with all this in there.

453
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:47,850
I have a copy of the stuff. I didn't have them on there for purposes of you guys looking at the case.

454
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:57,660
So charge a very, very highest price. I can get away with the charge to serve the entire market by profit falls to 152 million.

455
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:03,070
So what am I? What's the difference there?

456
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:06,930
It's the difference. Mostly my revenue. Or is it my cost?

457
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:15,890
For every additional patient. Do I have to spend more money? Going to make another dose and a half.

458
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:44,470
So let's look at the revenues. So on the revenue is really just going to be price times cases surge times 1 to 5 doses per case.

459
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,640
So that's the formula for revenues. So if we plug that in.

460
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,860
We have $76 million in revenue at the very highest price.

461
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:59,720
So 725 times, 70,000 patients times to the house.

462
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:11,620
So if I charge a dose price of 375. My revenues go way up, I charge a dose of 185.

463
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:16,510
Revenues are essentially unchanged. They go down, but only by $3 million.

464
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:21,909
So, Gavin, sort of big picture is sort of well, in revenue terms,

465
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:27,370
it's roughly a wash of serving half the market at this price or serving the entire market at this price.

466
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:39,700
Now, what about the costs? So the cost is just simply $40 times cases, times 1.5 doses per case.

467
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:47,680
I'm only serving 70,000 people up here. My costs are only $4 million.

468
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:55,000
So almost my entire revenue is profit. I'm serving a lot more people here.

469
00:58:57,070 --> 00:59:07,490
I plug in that formula 40 times. 350,000 times, 1.5 an now have to spend $21 million in production costs to make those doses.

470
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:14,050
Not surprisingly, if I'm serving 700,000 people instead of 350.

471
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,520
My production costs are going to double.

472
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:29,120
So even though I still get a substantial reward in terms of my elasticity of demand being roughly negative two, dropping price from 375 to 185.

473
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:38,870
That reward basically keeps my revenues more or less unchanged or even a little down as Fayyad.

474
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:46,970
But this call, this roughly a wash on revenues. But I've got to spend an extra $21 million to create the extra 350,000 doses.

475
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:56,420
So that's why the the profitability there's a much bigger gap here between the median price and the world price.

476
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,920
That was almost all from the cost side, not the revenue side.

477
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:10,010
Question I'm a little confused about how we're interpreting the elasticity of demand in this case.

478
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:15,740
Like, I understand it, like what it would be if it was like a substitute versus an elastic.

479
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:20,840
Actually, I just realize it's 930 and we have to leave 20 minutes for the speaker.

480
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:26,719
Well, we'll come back to this. Okay. I didn't I didn't think it was quite that late yet.

481
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,560
So I apologize.

482
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:44,990
The other 2415 minute presentation is five minute discussion and we kind of got everything involved and I running over on your favorite show.

483
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:54,680
It's not the time to shoot, but I'm over here to get right for the vote total.

484
01:00:54,800 --> 01:01:00,960
You might want to email me your presentation and I can put it pictures at a time for you.

485
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:16,620
Yeah, I got it as well. Thank you. I don't get it that someone really wants to email.

486
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,970
Yeah, I can just imagine.

487
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:59,900
I'm sure you can only imagine an average person like this, but I tried to say this has like a lot know what can you do me in a row?

488
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:04,340
So I'll just I'll just ask everybody. Oh, oh, we're going to get started.

489
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:09,020
So our presentation is the sugar sweetened beverage tax.

490
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:18,890
So first, we wanted to quickly describe what our sugar sweetened beverages so sugary beverages are any drink that has caloric sweeteners,

491
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:26,810
which includes soft drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, and doesn't typically include 100% fruit juice or diet drinks.

492
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:31,790
But different taxes have different descriptions of what these drinks are.

493
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:35,629
So some of them actually do include diet drinks and some of the make exclusions for

494
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:39,170
things like chocolate milk because it does have some kind of nutritional value.

495
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:44,659
So every tax is a little bit different and includes in the U.S.,

496
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:51,160
we see that about 2% of adults consume at least one of these drinks per day and consumption actually varies income.

497
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:56,870
So we see that lower income people actually typically consume more of these sugar sweetened beverages.

498
01:02:56,870 --> 01:03:06,130
That high income people and we've seen that sugar consumed in drinks has actually has higher health risks than sugar consumed in food,

499
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:10,700
mostly through weight gain, type two diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

500
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:20,510
And we have a $0.01 per ounce taxed estimate, say it would say between 17.1 and $23.6 billion in health care costs over the next ten years.

501
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:30,080
So this is our first question for you guys. So what do we think? Some internal issues and externalities of drinking these are in challenges would be

502
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:35,060
harms to the individual whose drinking and externalities would be harms on others.

503
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:39,470
So does anyone have any ideas of what those would be? Activities?

504
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:44,900
Diabetes? Yeah. So that could be a harm to the individual. The cost of having diabetes.

505
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:50,270
Anybody else? What about externalities?

506
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:54,230
What do we think? How do we think drinking sugar sweetened beverages can harm other people?

507
01:03:57,050 --> 01:04:01,430
Increased utilization in health care. Yeah. So health care costs are shared, right?

508
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:08,270
So whether it's government government funded insurance that comes from our taxes or whether it's cost sharing,

509
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:13,970
private insurance, increased health care costs increases the health care costs of everybody in the population.

510
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:25,460
So we have into reality on this side is the realities shared health care costs to the whole population, again through different types of insurance.

511
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:32,000
The estimated cost per per beverage is .8. $0.09 per ounce.

512
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:40,940
So for every ounce of drinking, that's the estimated cost for the population as a whole, or into realities that health harms to the individual.

513
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:45,470
So those might be because people ignore the future consequences.

514
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:50,450
We've talked in class about like making the best choices for your future self versus your current self.

515
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:55,760
So if people were making the best choices, they'd probably drink less of the sugar sweetened beverages.

516
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:04,850
It's difficult to measure, though, but estimates go from 0.91 to 2.1 $0.04 per ounce of cost to you for every ounce that you drink.

517
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:16,310
So this graph has a lot of stuff going on. But first we have this line D one, which is the individual demand curve for sugar sweetened beverages.

518
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:22,160
So if we're starting here at the price zero, we see this this quantity purchased.

519
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:27,800
And then if we increase the price to include a tax, we see a lower quantity purchase.

520
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:34,520
So we're moving up the demand curve when we add that tax. We also have this kind of hypothetical line D two,

521
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:41,330
which would be a reduced demand that we would see if people actually thought about the Internet and the future cost to their health,

522
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:47,030
we would see this reduced demand and this line B would be the per unit informality cost.

523
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:53,570
We can also look at this line for thinking about externalities. So if this is the per unit externality cost.

524
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:58,670
This would be the consumption we'd want to see to reduce the cost to the population.

525
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:05,210
We also have these shaded areas. So the area is tax revenue.

526
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:11,930
So as we have the tax price as a quantity that's now purchased, this is tax revenue that goes to the government.

527
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:17,660
And then we have this triangle C that's reducing the welfare to the individual.

528
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:22,670
So as we reduce consumption, we would prefer to drink more sugar sweetened beverages.

529
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,970
So there is a welfare loss because now your drinks cost more money.

530
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:35,120
But we have this area, B and C, which is increased welfare for the individual and for the population because less sugar sweetened drinks are consumed.

531
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:40,100
We save health care costs for ourselves and for the population as a whole on health care spending.

532
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:43,490
So we see this area as an increase in welfare for everybody.

533
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:49,700
Okay. So I am going to talk about a concept called tax pass through.

534
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:58,700
So in several situations, the producer of the sugar sweetened beverages might not want to pass the entire tax on to the consumer.

535
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:03,020
And that could be affected by many factors.

536
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,820
One of them is when the elasticity of demand of these beverages changes.

537
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:14,480
So if the demand for the sugary beverages increases the elasticity, sorry, for demand increases,

538
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:21,620
it means that consumers might be willing to substitute the sugary drinks with other drinks.

539
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:28,310
And that would kind of force producers to want to sell more and to target their products more aggressively.

540
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:36,370
And therefore, the consumer, the producer, might actually bear some of the tax instead of passing the entire tax on to the consumer.

541
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:44,420
And other ways that tax pass through can happen is if we have large retail stores that have stores in different areas with different taxation,

542
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:53,240
they might be able to have a uniform tax or even take it out altogether because it would not affect their bottom line as much.

543
01:07:54,050 --> 01:08:03,500
And another thing that retailers could use is just category pricing when they kind of split the tax between Diet Coke and,

544
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:13,129
you know, regular Coke or sugary beverages. And this way they would be you know, it would be more uniform for the for the consumer and,

545
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:19,970
you know, would cause this uproar and this and would people would buy more of the sugary beverages.

546
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:27,600
But of course, this decreases the welfare that we are looking to get from the tax and it defeats the purpose of having tax.

547
01:08:29,790 --> 01:08:34,290
Alexandra talked about the individual demand curve. This is the market demand curve.

548
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:38,140
Over here, we do take into account a couple more variables.

549
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:46,160
Over here we have the total tax that we are adding and we are assuming that at least the consumer's

550
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:52,260
share of the tax is p t minus p zero and the producer's share of the tax could be zero.

551
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:57,200
But over here that's this much we do have the D one.

552
01:08:57,210 --> 01:09:07,200
This is the demand curve of these sugar sweetened beverages and D two is the demand curve without considering the internet as these externalities.

553
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,790
And therefore the beam would be the effect of the internet.

554
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:18,090
These externalities also s would be the supply supply curve.

555
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:22,800
So basically with the supply curve, if the cost of the sugary beverages goes up,

556
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:30,780
then the producers would be more inclined to produce even more of the sugary beverages because it would give them more revenue over here.

557
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:40,770
The area Y would be the total tax that goes from the consumer into the government because that's the consumer's share of the tax area.

558
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:44,670
X would be the producers share of the tax that goes into the government.

559
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:50,300
And here is here it is combined. It shows the picture.

560
01:09:54,140 --> 01:10:01,730
Here is he is the combined beneficial reduction from the Internet of these externalities from the sugar sweetened beverages.

561
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:10,760
And the question is, do you think having a tax would be progressive or regressive?

562
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:15,800
Where progressive is it affects the higher income households more than the lower income households.

563
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,110
And regressive because the other way around.

564
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:27,920
It's probably regressive because you said that more lower income individuals are the ones that are consuming less.

565
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:33,009
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. I was going to agree with that.

566
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:41,110
And like how oftentimes in low income areas, they have these, like stocked more often too, and it's going to consume more of their income.

567
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:46,120
So at first thought so this over here would be the regressive.

568
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:51,969
Just so poor households do consume more sugary sweetened beverages.

569
01:10:51,970 --> 01:10:55,240
So with by paying the tax, they would get even poorer.

570
01:10:56,860 --> 01:11:05,080
But we think that, yes, we by having a tax paying poor household, would consume even less sugar sweetened beverages.

571
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:10,330
What we do find is high income and low income households with the tax,

572
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:17,830
they end up consuming less percentage, which is the percentage of less consumption is the same.

573
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:21,820
But because poor households consume more than the effect on them, it's higher.

574
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:26,200
It would end up consuming even less absolute amounts of.

575
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:32,900
So now we need to start thinking that it might actually be progressive because

576
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:37,640
lower income households do have larger in turn out of these from consumption.

577
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:43,820
Their health care costs would be higher. They would have more health problems down the line.

578
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:51,710
They did end up paying more for health care. So we do find that benefits of the tax are actually highest for the lowest income households.

579
01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:55,309
So we're here. Basically,

580
01:11:55,310 --> 01:12:03,800
we find that the progressivity of the Internet latte reduction benefits would be actually higher from the basic first class through the tax.

581
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:13,480
Yes. The second article we analyzed was a multi-city study done on the effects of beverage taxes,

582
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:17,229
and I looked at comparisons between Philadelphia and Oakland.

583
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:20,260
So think about different geography, different city characteristics.

584
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:21,100
Those would come into play.

585
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:26,960
But the study basically split up its results into four different categories, which were prices, purchases, consumption responses.

586
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:30,460
So the next couple slide to kind of go through the main hitting points from each of those categories.

587
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:37,240
First of all, starting with prices. So the main observation that they found was that prices rose much more in Philadelphia than they did in Oakland.

588
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:42,700
And a good main question to ask would be why? Why would prices vary between cities from city to city?

589
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:47,050
And they're kind of two main contributors to think about when you're trying to answer that question.

590
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:50,320
And the first do is what I mentioned before. So plastic bags.

591
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:57,040
So in the case of Philadelphia, they decided to pass on more than the actual tax amount on a consumer's, whereas Oakland passed on relatively less.

592
01:12:57,370 --> 01:13:01,120
So that right there would result in differences between prices and seem good in cities.

593
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:05,580
Other thing may be a bit more obvious is the actual tax rate itself.

594
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:10,570
So Philadelphia, in addition to passing on more as consumers, also started with an initially higher tax rate.

595
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:13,270
So when you consider these two different things in combination,

596
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:17,110
that can account for some of the variability you might see between prices between cities.

597
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:23,079
Potential policy question with that is what is the potential issue that the pass

598
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:26,410
through data highlights about policy making if you're trying to enact something,

599
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:33,040
what like what might those values kind of make you think about? These are determined by individual retailers and distributors.

600
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:42,040
Any kind of issues you might run into trying to enact a widespread policy when decisions are made on such an individual basis.

601
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:51,920
Something you might have to think about. I mean, you shouldn't be able to charge more than the tax if you're telling consumers that that's the tax.

602
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:58,400
So that would be an example of a regulation. You would have to maybe specify that that's something that you can't do.

603
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:03,270
So. You're trying to get at something. The tax covered area makes a big difference.

604
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:05,520
And passing value, something you might have to look out for.

605
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:09,750
You might have to institute some policies that make strict range regulations or anything like that.

606
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:16,560
Or maybe you go wider spread and you say, okay, I'm going to cover a larger area, try to decrease that variability of individual decisions.

607
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:22,230
So it's something to think about for policymaking, etc. purchases.

608
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:29,100
So they found that in filled up in Philadelphia, the tax did reduce the quantity of purchases of tax beverages relative to comparison areas.

609
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:34,050
They did note that they did not detect a statistically significant impact in Oakland.

610
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:39,000
I put the graph up here to demonstrate that there was a decrease. Again, just not statistically significant,

611
01:14:39,330 --> 01:14:46,890
but they found the decrease in Philadelphia to be about nine ounces less for shopping trip space purchased as a result of the tax.

612
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:52,110
And simple reasoning behind this, we already showed you some of the demand curves. This was just a simplified one,

613
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:59,399
but increase in price corresponds to movement of that demand curve and so correspondingly smaller quantity purchased and it is of note

614
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:06,420
for this dot this data evaluation that the impact size of that change in how much it's purchased depends on what comparison group use.

615
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:12,240
So when this data in your target city you're looking at was compared to purchase quantities nationwide,

616
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:19,020
you saw a relatively larger reduction in quantity purchased than if you compare those values to the cities or the neighborhoods right around the city.

617
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:23,700
And that's also a policy kind of consideration to make because you might ask why would purchase

618
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:28,080
quantities be higher in the cities right around the city that's taxed compared to nationwide?

619
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:33,570
We kind of touch on that in a second, but something to remember for purchases.

620
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:40,080
The other type of data they looked at was consumption data. So the study did try to differentiate between children and adults.

621
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:45,570
However, they did not find a detectable impact on the frequency of how often children consumed assemblies,

622
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:50,190
but they did find a statistically significant decrease in adults.

623
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:55,440
So they found that it was about ten times per month less that adults consumed ssbs.

624
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:59,730
And this would be an example of where price elasticity comes into play.

625
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:07,290
So I believe the purchase, the price difference was about 22% and the change in quantity was about 30% here.

626
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:13,439
So if you plug into the equations that we kind of just did, you would find a value that's within that less than or equal to negative one range,

627
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:17,820
implying that the demand for regular soda within these prices is elastic.

628
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:26,430
Each other type would just general consumption data. They found that the tax did reduce the chance that adults consumed regular soda by about 9%,

629
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:31,170
while at the same time also increasing the chance that they consume tap water daily by about 20%.

630
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:38,130
And this would be an example of the substitute ability of goods, implying that price of soda goes up, decreases consumption,

631
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:44,370
and then you might shift your consumption over to some other substitutable goods, such as water or some other untaxed beverage instead.

632
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,719
Last Friday, we had to do a strategic response to this.

633
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:55,390
So questions for you all would be what might be some other actions taken by consumers in response to the.

634
01:16:55,810 --> 01:16:59,410
So we already said that they're likely to purchase less. They're likely to consume less.

635
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:04,690
But if you were a consumer and you're your favorite kid was suddenly taxing your city, what's something else you might choose to do?

636
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:09,460
And on the other side of that, if you are a retailer and a good that you stock is on the increase in price,

637
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:17,480
is there anything you might change about the way you operate your business? Just kind of anybody has any use for consumers.

638
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:24,770
Yeah. Like if it was a local toxic, let's say Ann Arbor toxic beverage, I'd go to the Sam's Club and see and like, stock up.

639
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:31,680
Yep. And that's exactly what consumers did. So we call it cross-border shopping,

640
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:38,340
or we get this basically when consumers started just outright avoid the tax and so they purchased in nearby cities and that comparison group.

641
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:41,220
No earlier. This is one of the actions that contributes to that.

642
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:45,899
So why you might see the purchase quantities in nearby cities actually relatively increase compared to nationwide

643
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:50,910
values is because you have people moving out of city purchased where it's either lower tax or not taxed at all.

644
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:54,810
What about a retailer? If you were a store owner was something you might change.

645
01:17:56,650 --> 01:18:06,690
Can think about inventory advertising. I probably wouldn't buy as much at first just to see how much the consumers are given by all my products.

646
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:10,410
Yeah. Yeah. You might change what quantities of the tax revenue stock. Mm hmm.

647
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:16,860
What about on tax revenues? Would you change anything about how much of those you stock?

648
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:21,820
What you stock? More. More on tax revenues.

649
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:27,970
Exactly. If retailers did both of those in the cities, they increased their untaxed beverage stocks.

650
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,690
People are going to buy less of the tax revenue, more something else.

651
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:38,320
They were also going to be sued to notify customers of what the tax was for, why prices were suddenly increasing.

652
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:45,280
You can kind of think about that as like intangible value of the business relationship and then they also increase promotion of untaxed beverages.

653
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:48,590
So like those coolers with all the sodas in them, write a check out that you grab because they're just there.

654
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:52,840
They would instead replace those with promotion for untaxed beverages to, you know, get people to buy more of those.

655
01:18:53,650 --> 01:19:01,570
Those are the main findings. So major findings are pretty much exactly what we've already discussed.

656
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:10,870
We noted in our study that the observed increase of taxed beverages increased obviously because we taxed them.

657
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:12,790
But that amount varied, like we said,

658
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:18,790
because we have different retailers passing through different tax rates and different rates of the tax as a whole.

659
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:27,040
Due to that, we saw a decline in the purchase and the consumption of taxed beverages and this was of specific statistical significance.

660
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:33,160
But the magnitude kind of varies city to city because again, the price increase varied from city to city.

661
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:42,190
We saw that consumers responded by shopping less and they also shop outside of the cities where they didn't have taxes on these beverages.

662
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:50,700
And retailers responded by stocking less of the text beverages, which led to decreased availability, and then they stopped more untaxed beverages.

663
01:19:50,710 --> 01:19:53,920
So that is an example of a good substitution.

664
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:58,366
We also have the spillover effect where the cities that.
