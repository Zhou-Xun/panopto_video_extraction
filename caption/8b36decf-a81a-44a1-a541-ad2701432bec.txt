1
00:00:00,255 --> 00:00:06,165
In this module, we're going to talk about dealing with times where you feel overloaded and overwhelmed.

2
00:00:06,165 --> 00:00:10,575
And in this first section, we're going to talk about how to hopefully plan

3
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:15,405
so that happens as infrequently as possible.

4
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:21,515
Then we're going to talk about when it happens, because inevitably it does.

5
00:00:21,515 --> 00:00:29,705
So think right now about what systems you have kind of where you plan for your week, where you can see it, where you can see your tasks.

6
00:00:29,705 --> 00:00:34,615
Think about what is working well for you right now and what isn't?

7
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:41,295
I'm going to show you a few tools that I use. I think the organizational systems

8
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:46,485
vary widely by kind of how you think and just your schedule and your personality.

9
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:54,255
So these are not necessarily ones that you need to take on, but if you're finding that some of the systems you have aren't working,

10
00:00:54,255 --> 00:01:05,635
some of these may. So one thing we'll often do is map out a whole semester, quarter,

11
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:10,615
or the length of a program with someone so for example, if your program is 10 weeks,

12
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:20,335
you can make an excel sheet like this, and you would have all 10 weeks going down this column.

13
00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:29,875
And then in the date column, you would put the first date of the week.

14
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:34,255
And then you would look over all of the things that you have due,

15
00:01:34,255 --> 00:01:43,095
important meetings. And you would put them on a sheet so that in one sheet, you can see your entire semester.

16
00:01:43,095 --> 00:01:50,155
Or, for example, right now the entire 10 weeks of the program. So I might put

17
00:01:50,155 --> 00:01:57,915
due dates regarding one project in one color, purple here, and due dates for something else,

18
00:01:57,915 --> 00:02:04,045
in a different color, and then important meetings or events in a different color.

19
00:02:04,045 --> 00:02:07,625
The other thing, and this is kind of key that I do is,

20
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:17,855
if I know, for example, there's a weekend where I am going on vacation or to a family event or something big is happening, where

21
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:23,525
I know I'm not going to get a lot of work that weekend, I block it out on the sheet.

22
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:27,775
And what this allows you to visually do, for example, this person, if this was their schedule,

23
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:33,175
would know that week three is pretty busy for them and they're going to be

24
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:37,765
kind of not working the weekend, week 2, before it.

25
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:45,665
That means everything that they need to get done, especially before Monday,

26
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,455
should be done hopefully by Friday.

27
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:55,315
So this allows you to kind of see where your work starts to back-up, gets kind of condensed, where there's a lot of work,

28
00:02:55,315 --> 00:03:02,645
and start planning backwards so that you make sure that you're allowing the right amount of time, because often, let's say you have a weekend planner,

29
00:03:02,645 --> 00:03:09,185
you may flip the page and all of a sudden see all of these things that were due that you actually wanted to know when you're planning for an advance.

30
00:03:09,185 --> 00:03:14,135
So this is something that should hopefully let you see

31
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:21,665
an entire, if it's a semester, sometimes I'll do a front and back, so you can see the first week on one side, and the other eight weeks on the other side.

32
00:03:21,665 --> 00:03:26,195
But you just want this to be somewhere where you can see it and it can help you plan your life, you want

33
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:31,465
kind of like a bird's eye view, a high level view, and then you want to have a more specific view.

34
00:03:31,465 --> 00:03:47,595
I'll show you one more way of looking kind of at the big picture. So this is, let's say, your time is less kind of classes and more projects,

35
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:58,625
and you want to make sure nothing is falling off of your radar. You might use a sheet like this where each column represents different

36
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:04,275
projects. So you might have an internship that you have tasks for, you might be putting in some fellowship applications,

37
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:08,835
you might be secretary or treasurer for an organization,

38
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:15,165
and so you have e-broad tasks. You might be, for fun doing a blog or a podcast on the side.

39
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:24,325
You might also be needing to prepare for a study abroad or an upcoming vacation or some family event, and there may be tasks related to that,

40
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:27,985
and you want everything to be kind of in one place to see what's coming up,

41
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:32,275
and nothing's falling off the radar in any area of your life,

42
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:38,985
allowing you to track different areas of your life, again, all on one page where you can kind of see it.

43
00:04:38,985 --> 00:04:48,465
The rows then show you, for example, you could do this by semester or quarter if you were looking at a year, or you could just do it by the month.

44
00:04:48,465 --> 00:04:56,855
So what you would put in this green row, anything that you need to make sure happens this month.

45
00:04:56,855 --> 00:05:02,045
Anything that comes up that you know is next month, you would put in the yellow and anything further out than that

46
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:06,185
you just want to keep on your radar and not forget, you would put in the red.

47
00:05:06,185 --> 00:05:10,715
If you use it a month than each month, you would redo this sheet.

48
00:05:10,715 --> 00:05:15,705
And if you do it online, you can kind of just move and pace things up and print it out again

49
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:20,845
so that you can have it around, or screenshot it, whatever works for you.

50
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:28,445
And this bottom row, you're just putting notes or let's say you're like, oh, there's this workshop or this conference

51
00:05:28,445 --> 00:05:35,585
that I think I might want to go to, but I don't know yet. You can put possibilities in additional notes at the bottom and then you move them up,

52
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:40,735
if it becomes integrated into one of the months. What's key about this one, that

53
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:45,755
I think can be really helpful is,

54
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:54,455
you can look at any area of your life and see what's coming up, and you can see it in that view.

55
00:05:54,455 --> 00:06:03,005
Sometimes, though, I think the other thing that becomes really important is looking at the rows. You might see in this month,

56
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:07,105
there's too much going on. Like, if there's a ton of stuff in all of these.

57
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:15,395
And that might be where you kind of take inventory and are like I need to move blog and podcasting down into next month, or

58
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:21,545
I may have to move it down into the further out area, this month is too busy.

59
00:06:21,545 --> 00:06:28,915
This one allows us to see a high level view and assess when we've got too much on our plate in a given time,

60
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:34,415
and also make sure that all the various areas of our life we're keeping up.

61
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:39,235
So those are two ways to look at the big picture.

62
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:47,315
What you'll do then is whichever sheet you're using, you want to have that available each week when you find out your weekend.

63
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:54,285
So your weekly planner, a lot of people like to do this digitally now.

64
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:57,925
So you might be using Google Calendar or I still am the big fan,

65
00:06:57,925 --> 00:07:01,555
if it works for you, to use a paper where you have them side by side,

66
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:04,795
you can see each day of the week.

67
00:07:04,795 --> 00:07:12,415
So once you know what you have coming up, you want to plug in your calendar when you're going to have time to do different tasks.

68
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:16,465
You want to try to be realistic with yourself about how long they take and the transition.

69
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:23,995
If you go from this place, to this place that you leave time, and you want to make sure that you're leaving time in there for your day-to-day things.

70
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:27,935
So, eating, it's very easy to go through a work day

71
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:33,395
unfortunately, and just forget to eat. So, meal planning.

72
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:38,925
When your sleep is going to be in there, like your basic necessities, when you're going to do laundry.

73
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:47,335
A lot of times we think that we have more time and hours than we do, and so we want to make sure that we're getting these things in there.

74
00:07:47,335 --> 00:07:52,035
And then we also want to make sure, because we've been talking about all the other, you know, our self care, that

75
00:07:52,035 --> 00:07:58,235
we have time to do the things that matter most to us, maybe we just need quiet time and we need time to go on a hike,

76
00:07:58,235 --> 00:08:05,745
we need time everyday to get some physical activity in. We want to make sure that those things are blocked off.

77
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:11,395
And remember, when we talked about self-care, if it's a finals week, if there is a bunch of deadlines,

78
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:17,125
it doesn't mean we don't put self-care in there, it just means it might have to be tinier and more bite size.

79
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:23,915
We don't want to go weeks and weeks and weeks not seeing things on there that are helping kind of take care of us.

80
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:29,085
So we want to make sure that that's in there. And we also want to make sure that we're getting in time for social connection.

81
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:37,785
So sometimes when we're only working on our professional and academic lives, we can get kind of tunnel vision,

82
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:43,305
and realize that we're not making that connection with family and friends that refuel and rejuvenate us,

83
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:45,225
And so that's a good recipe for burn-out.

84
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:52,805
We want to make sure that when you're looking at your week, you can see where you marked off, not only for your deadlines and your work,

85
00:08:52,805 --> 00:09:00,205
but for your self care and social connection. It's important to know that there is going to be times,

86
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:05,935
remember our continuum, where you're thriving, there's going to be times where your getting by, just getting by, and

87
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:10,975
there may be times when you're struggling. So most of us plan as if every day we're going to be thriving and everyday we're going to have energy,

88
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:19,225
and so we pack things full, but we want to leave ourself some time to catch our breath.

89
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:26,805
We want to anticipate that some days, we may not feel the best, and so we want to try not to leave everything right until the last second,

90
00:09:26,805 --> 00:09:30,435
because, if that's a day where we're kind of in the yellow, it's going to be harder.

91
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:35,285
So instead of planning on having all green days, you want to know that there's gonna be some yellow,

92
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:41,025
and occasionally there's gonna be some red, and you want to plan for that as opposed to almost being surprised,

93
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:46,245
and not having a little bit of breathing room in wherever it's possible.

94
00:09:46,245 --> 00:09:54,065
And the last thing I want to say on this slide and in this section is just that you've got to get used to saying, no, there's, you know,

95
00:09:54,065 --> 00:10:00,115
you can Google people and TicTok different things on a nice ways to say no.

96
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:04,865
No is a complete sentence. Sometimes we want to take advantage of every opportunity out there,

97
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:11,805
we don't want to miss out on anything. We can kind of have professional FOMO, even social FOMO.

98
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:17,025
But if we don't see no to things, our time ends up overcrowded and it could actually

99
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:23,075
lead to us being more overwhelmed and more likely to be in a crisis state.

100
00:10:23,075 --> 00:10:31,055
So think about that, in order to do your best and to have space to really enjoy the things that matter most,

101
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:37,245
you're going to have to say no to some things that are like kind of exciting, but not your top priority.

102
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:43,865
We don't want, you know, when we talked about it in the beginning to treat this like a buffet, were you stack it and pile it too high, because

103
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:47,905
that's going to lead to overwhelmed, that's going to lead to overloaded.

104
00:10:47,905 --> 00:10:53,785
We want to make sure there's time in our week where if we're having a hard time, we can get the support that we need,

105
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:59,165
we can pause when we need. This is planning ahead of time,

106
00:10:59,165 --> 00:11:05,565
to reduce the amount of times that we end up struggling, overwhelmed, and overloaded.

107
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:11,305
But in the next module, we'll talk about what we can do when we have those moments.
