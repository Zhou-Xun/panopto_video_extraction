00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,970
That content sparked so many ideas for me in terms of how to tweak or in some cases overhaul my teaching.

2
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,540
Yeah, I just think it's so useful to get that guidance from Dr. Peoples.

3
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,390
That really frames for us how to think about anti-racist curriculum design and then the examples.

4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,960
I know it's so, so useful for me to hear examples.

5
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,750
When these ideas stay at the conceptual level, it can be hard for me to think about how to put them into practice,

6
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,300
but the examples really help me connect the concepts with aspects of my own teaching and reflect more.

7
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:01,059
Agree. And I want to take this inspiration from the module and go straight to some of my course

8
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,930
syllabi and reflect on how to further take the course towards anti-racist principles.

9
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:12,430
Yeah, really smart idea. So important to turn these ideas into actual changes in our teaching practices.

10
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,650
All right, well, let's keep going. Let's go!
