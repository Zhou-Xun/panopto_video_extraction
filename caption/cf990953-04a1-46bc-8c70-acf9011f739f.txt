1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:13,830
What new worlds do we dream, and who do we have to be as leaders to midwife them into being?

2
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:21,280
What is this time in our world asking us to see?

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,110
Who is it asking us to be?

4
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:37,580
My name is Leseliey Welch, and I am excited to be one of your primary faculty for the Future Public Health Leaders Program. In this session,

5
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:49,260
I will be introducing myself to you and asking you who you are and what is your why?

6
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:56,370
On paper, I am a public health leader with a business mind and a visionary heart.

7
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:03,570
I hold love as a guiding value. I am co-founder and executive director of Birth Detroit,

8
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:11,940
which will be Detroit's first freestanding community birth center and co-founder and co-director of Birth Center Equity Fund,

9
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:17,750
which is a national fund established to grow and sustain

10
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:23,920
birth centers led by Black, Indigenous and people of color across the country.

11
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:35,740
And I earned my undergraduate degree in women's studies and my graduate degrees in Public Health and Business Administration,

12
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:45,550
all from the University of Michigan. On purpose, on purpose.

13
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:53,770
I am a mother, and my prayer is that I be the mother my children need me to be,

14
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:59,080
and the leader that my great grandchildren need me to be.

15
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:07,960
I approach my work with an understanding that the broader transformation of

16
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:15,400
external structures of power can never fully occur if we do not simultaneously

17
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:24,610
transform our internal investments of power that exist in ourselves, and examine

18
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:33,400
our relationship at multiple levels to the realities we see in the world.

19
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:42,970
And so I would share with you that I was a birth dula before I was a mom.

20
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:57,850
Birth dulas provide educational, informational, emotional and physical support to birthing people before or during pregnancy, birth and postpartum.

21
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:04,810
And there is nothing more amazing than being with a birthing person and family during that time.

22
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:16,780
And I fell in love with that work. I had the experience of having one preterm baby, my Zoe, who is now fifteen.

23
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:26,260
You wouldn't know that she was born early by what she looks like now. And then one full term baby born on her due date,

24
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:38,600
my Savannah, who is now seven. And I've also had the experience of being with my brother in law and sister in law the day my nephew was

25
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:49,610
born in a local Detroit hospital, and died the same day. Born too small, low birth weight and too soon preterm.

26
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:58,700
And so my work in the world, my work, particularly as it pertains to birth equity,

27
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:06,700
is, you know, rooted in professional, personal and political interest.

28
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,780
Right? Professional, personal and political interest.

29
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:22,440
My first job out of public health graduate school was as Healthy Start project coordinator at the city of Detroit Health Department.

30
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:30,830
And my last job in government public health, was as deputy director of public health for the city of Detroit.

31
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:38,460
And so I've worked in multiple levels of public health locally.

32
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:48,320
I've also been interim executive director of Birthing Project USA, which is a global maternal child health organization.

33
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:59,670
And now I am, you know, finding my place with a mix of local and national work.

34
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,770
And so on vision,

35
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:15,950
my vision is that I can lead in growing vibrant and abundant community birth infrastructure for generations to come. At Birth Detroit,

36
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:24,630
we are doing that through expanding access to community based midwifery model care.

37
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:33,630
We know that midwifery model care, which means caring for birthing people in the wellness model,

38
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,340
seeing pregnancy and birth as normal physiological processes,

39
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:45,210
prioritizing connection, trust building, relationship building and shared decision making with families.

40
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:54,120
We know that that type of care improves outcomes, enhances the birth experience and lowers cost.

41
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,460
And we know, despite the way that childbirth is constructed in our country,

42
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:06,660
that more than 80% of birthing people can safely give birth with midwives in birth centers.

43
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,640
Yet there are no birth centers in the city of Detroit.

44
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:23,400
And we believe and I've seen in the years and years of my career that there is a real opportunity to leverage

45
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:33,260
community based midwifery to impact the challenges that we see in maternal and infant mortality and outcomes.

46
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:45,080
And on the national side, Birth center Equity Fund, we have in our country more than 400 birth centers, more than 400 freestanding birth centers,

47
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:54,230
which are homelike environments where midwives provide prenatal birth and postpartum care in the wellness model.

48
00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:06,380
There are more than 400 of these centers, yet very few, less than five percent are owned or led by Black, Indigenous or people of color.

49
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:16,580
So the majority of folks who have access to this model of care that we know improves outcomes, enhances the birth experience and lowers costs,

50
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,640
are white, cis-gender, educated, upper class women.

51
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:36,710
And that is something that myself and my co-founders and co-directors in these endeavors have devoted our careers, at this point, to changing.

52
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:46,490
And so I invite you to check out the videos that are linked to these slides to learn more about both of these efforts.

53
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:54,470
And I share them with you so that you have a sense of my perspective on population

54
00:07:54,470 --> 00:08:05,130
health because it informs how I will approach our time together in FPHLP.

55
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:11,370
On teaching and pedagogy, I have been teaching for almost 20 years now,

56
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:22,140
which is funny to say. I started off teaching in women's studies, and have taught in women's studies at University of Michigan since 2004.

57
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:28,650
I moved in to teaching in public health at Wayne State University,

58
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:38,250
helping to develop and grow their undergraduate public health program and have taught and subbed in public health at University of Michigan.

59
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:51,900
So my teaching experience ranges from undergraduates to masters and public health students to medical residents and medical students as well.

60
00:08:51,900 --> 00:09:01,470
And I would say in terms of approach, teaching is a labor of love for me. At this point, it's no longer my full time work.

61
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:09,030
In fact, as a director of two start ups, my time is very stretched.

62
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:22,710
But I really enjoy teaching, and FPHLP is a  unique opportunity to spend time with, what I hope will be,

63
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:30,630
you know, our young public health, population health leaders of color in in the future,

64
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:42,110
and you are sorely and desperately needed. And so I choose to spend my time with you as a labor of love, as an opportunity to challenge you.

65
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:47,820
Right? And as an investment in our collective liberation.

66
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,820
I think that education and teaching for me, in public health and in women's studies,

67
00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:01,230
is not about imparting to you theory for the sake of theory, or discipline

68
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:09,300
knowledge for the sake of discipline knowledge, or what we have done for the sake of you doing the same things we've already done,

69
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:18,170
but teaching so that you can use what you know, what you see and what we've done to move well beyond it.

70
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:28,950
Right? And I'm sharing with you here, two questions that have guided my teaching and also my journey.

71
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:35,310
One, is how do women of color sustain a successful leadership journey?

72
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:40,380
Having worked in population health at varying levels of leadership,

73
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:51,720
you know, before my MBA and after my MBA. It is very challenging, as some of you may already have a sense of.

74
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,910
And as you may know, as you journey throughout your career.

75
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:02,880
Right? And so one of the things that I've heard about teaching is that we often teach

76
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,510
the things that we most need to learn or that we most wish that we had known.

77
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:14,460
And so the courses I teach right now, one of them is the leading feminism class,

78
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:26,760
and I pour into that class all that I wish I had had the opportunity to learn as a woman of color in women's studies with aspirations to lead.

79
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:37,230
And then second, and the question I think most strongly pertains to our work together, is how do we make our communities healthier,

80
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:50,850
stronger and more free? Right? Public health and population health work is not about building strong programs, and metrics, and research, and data.

81
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,490
That's not all it is about.

82
00:11:53,490 --> 00:12:06,660
I would assert to you that it is only ever valuable the extent to which it is used to make our communities stronger, healthier and more free.

83
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:13,110
And then finally, one of my favorite quotes you have here at the bottom,

84
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:19,590
which I think gives you a sense of where I sit in the world as it pertains to my work,

85
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:24,780
is that if it is the right thing to do, we have every right to do it.

86
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:31,260
And what we learn and see is that many of our systems, government, public health,

87
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:37,860
included, were built to perpetuate themselves and to standardize many things.

88
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:44,550
And when we are able to see objectively outside of systems that have value,

89
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:55,710
right, but when we're able to step outside and think critically, we understand that we have to think beyond them in order to build,

90
00:12:55,710 --> 00:13:05,700
innovate and grow in ways that make our communities healthier, stronger and more free.

91
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:11,430
And so on this time, this time right now,

92
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:27,630
you're learning about population health in pandemic, at a time when it's more important in the arc of civilization than it has ever been for us.

93
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:35,110
And I lift up here, words of Grace Lee Boggs,

94
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:50,140
who was a local Detroit labor civil rights community activist who says, "A revolution that is based on the idea of people

95
00:13:50,140 --> 00:14:00,760
exercising their creativity in the midst of devastation is one of the great historical contributions of humankind."

96
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:09,130
And to that end, questions I would have you consider as we begin our journey together is, you know,

97
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:24,560
what if, what if we came to realize our own potential, our collective power and our shared place in creating the world in which we want to live?

98
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,050
What new worlds would we dream?

99
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:39,040
And who would we have to be as leaders to bring those new worlds into being?

100
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:47,710
Early in the pandemic, activist and author Arundhati Roy wrote about the pandemic as portal,

101
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:58,960
and in her essay she said, "Another world is not only possible, she is on her way. And on a quiet day,

102
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:08,680
I can hear her breathing." And these words have guided my work in pandemic,

103
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:17,650
I don't think I said that Birth Center Equity Fund was created in the midst of pandemic, because we really realized and

104
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:29,200
understood that there was a deep inequity about who had access to safe birth actions in the pandemic, and who didn't.

105
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:35,770
Right? And so what new worlds do you hear breathing?

106
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:46,180
What is your investment in bringing them into being, and our population health leadership?

107
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:59,560
I really do think of all of you, right, as our leaders for a new world. That and another author that I love and admire,

108
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,940
Valerie Kaur, says, "We are a nation waiting to be born.

109
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:17,670
This is our great transit transition." And so you are learning about population health in a transitional and catalytic time.

110
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:28,730
And so my invitation to you in this catalytic transitional time is that you think critically about what you're learning,

111
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:43,610
that you not take what you learn and see at face value, but question that you be an architect and center your experience as you learn, and that you

112
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:54,010
have in mind and pursue an inquiry that has meaning for you in your life and in your career.

113
00:16:54,010 --> 00:17:06,950
And when you think about learning and this quote is from Bell Hooks, who I love, and the quote is about theory, and about theory,

114
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:13,670
she says, "It's not inherently healing, liberatory, or revolutionary. It fulfills this function

115
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:27,800
only when we ask that it do so." And this is true in so many areas, and it is true of public health and population health.

116
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:36,530
Right? That it is not inherently healing, liberatory, or revolutionary. It fulfills this function

117
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:44,768
only when we demand that it do so.
