1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:10,500
I don't think there's any reason not to do it.

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:24,600
But I think it's like this is what I finally get out of it.

3
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:35,459
And so my friends, you know, you're not just to be talking into a few announcements or you get started homework.

4
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:45,750
Three is due next week that went in for Thanksgiving and still working on grading exam doing homework to be.

5
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:57,840
Everybody. I went over the questions that you all had for last lecture.

6
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,080
Really? It really helped for me to hear them.

7
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,290
And it's a very wide range of questions from very specific questions to more broader picture questions.

8
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,439
And I don't have time to really go over all the questions. I wanted to bring out a few bigger picture themes,

9
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:23,640
but I do want to get in because I think if you want you have if you want to ask you the subject questions,

10
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:34,110
you see me after class or office hours and find out some of these detailed questions that you have.

11
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:49,530
So one of the big one question that came over and over again is about some of the issues about how to address questions that Yohannes brought up,

12
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,020
and specifically about the wet market, specifically about bushmeat.

13
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:02,700
And clearly, there's a whole bigger picture social.

14
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,820
Structural change about how we address these things. They don't happen in isolation.

15
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:16,559
And part of the reason why I brought Yohannes is as an ecologist, I brought you interested in as an anthropologist,

16
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,000
that they all have their different perspectives, given their disappointment.

17
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:29,430
And clearly it's important that we think about this in a very cross-disciplinary manner, and that often doesn't happen.

18
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:38,040
So Your Highness, as an ecologist, think more in a more sophisticated manner with respect to the science of ecology and Jim Crow.

19
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,990
So more about the social factors.

20
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:51,210
But so you just have to take that into consideration when you're hearing different perspectives coming from different disciplines.

21
00:02:51,900 --> 00:03:02,280
And, you know, so whole question about, well, let's just stop that worst market where markets from happening and let's get people to stop eating.

22
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,179
Bushmeat is similar in my area, which is water and sanitation,

23
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:15,090
where I talk about how uptake of filters are different depending on the technology, depending on how usable it is.

24
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,850
And the microbiologists always respond. We just get them to drink the filtered water, like what was the problem?

25
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,910
And so I mentioned this, I think in Jim Crow after June 1st lecture.

26
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:45,240
One of the ways forward really is to be teaching these topics in in disciplines like epidemiology, teaching with social science perspectives.

27
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,990
Because when when you're out in the field, when you're working, the tendency is to do what you're comfortable with.

28
00:03:52,110 --> 00:04:00,210
So if you're a microbiologist, the tendency is to work in the area and making up a filter more efficient.

29
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,270
And that's that's where you stop.

30
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:12,780
And it's only until people are appreciating the different disciplines, you actually get people to start thinking about cross-disciplinary activities.

31
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,810
So I really advocate of incorporating these ideas into curriculum.

32
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:27,420
Another big question was about that. This is a very daunting problem that is being produced.

33
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:35,370
It's being presented to you with respect to conservation, biology and public health.

34
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:47,850
And I do think that no one person is going to solve this problem, but we all can address the problem at different levels.

35
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,649
They're addressing the problems of climate change. How do we address climate change?

36
00:04:52,650 --> 00:05:01,049
And that's happening as we speak in Egypt. There is trying to address the social, political,

37
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,970
economic conditions and there's trying to address the public health issues that are

38
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,200
happening at a community level and trying to improve resilience and adaptation.

39
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:17,820
So I think what we can do is pick the areas that we really want to focus on and move in that direction.

40
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:29,219
And the hope is that moving and having people address different this problem at different levels will move towards the solution.

41
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:38,220
But it is very daunting to think about and have people like Your Highness and Jim present this issue.

42
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:53,469
Okay. So with that. Any other questions on the topics or logistics in the course of this course?

43
00:05:53,470 --> 00:06:02,020
So now we're at the center of the last third of the course ending on Antimicrobial Resistance Day,

44
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,940
and then the remaining lectures are just going to be different.

45
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,410
Transmission systems are going to be dealing with sexually transmitted infections.

46
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:18,910
Respiratory transmitted infections, vector borne disease and then fecal oral.

47
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,650
So in next next four years.

48
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:29,110
Job so that's the that's the content of the last third of the course.

49
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:36,950
So anti-microbial resistance. And as you see, we're going to be talking about antibiotic resistance.

50
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,290
That's going to be the focus of this lecture in this course.

51
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,759
And that's really the bulk of the problem is in the antibiotic resistance,

52
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:55,510
and that is focusing on bacteria and its resistance to antibiotics is a complicated problem.

53
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:04,450
And I'm introducing you to mechanisms and mechanisms of resistance, factors that contribute to the emergence of resistance,

54
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:11,800
looking at development, resistance through treatment, the spread of resistance through transmission.

55
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:22,670
And also a little bit about how. Transmission can occur between bacteria as well as among the process population.

56
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:28,130
So this is really an introduction to all these areas which are very complicated.

57
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:37,670
But just so you get a sense of what the issues are in this field that is started with

58
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:44,540
this infographic just highlights that this is a huge problem in the world right now.

59
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:55,850
And we see ranging from hospital acquired infections and sea death and the increasing problem

60
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:01,790
that's and mortality that's occurring in hospitals due to this opportunistic pathogen.

61
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:12,589
Mersa has been in the in the media on and off for a long time, started as as a hospital acquired infection.

62
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:24,620
But now community acquired infection of methadone resistant staph aureus is huge and multidrug resistance is also a big deal

63
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:32,690
where we're running into a situation where our first line antibiotics are working or second line antibiotics aren't working.

64
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:40,220
Moving into the third line right now, we talked a little bit about that in prior lectures.

65
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:53,060
So it's a big, big deal right now is to deal with and one of the leading areas of interest that the NIH has with respect to funding research,

66
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:08,420
this just list and just shows you that there's a lot of resistant organisms that are a concern and they're ranging from concerning threats,

67
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,730
serious threats, urgent threats. The urgent threats are ones in which these are third line.

68
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:24,529
You know, these these bacteria resistance to almost always antibiotics that we have around treat so huge

69
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:31,969
deal just to give a sense of what we're talking about with respect to antimicrobial agents.

70
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:42,380
They kill microbes. We've got this class of pharmaceuticals, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-parasitic, antifungal.

71
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:49,310
We also there's non-pharmaceutical interventions, disinfectants.

72
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,520
So this occurs in our water treatment plants, antiseptics.

73
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,120
We have a lot of use of alcohol.

74
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:08,510
And now with companies like Persil, it's being sold and marketed to be used all the time throughout.

75
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:23,420
In all sorts of different contexts, but initially started in the hospital and then we had physical means of killing agents, radiation dissipation.

76
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,639
So in this lecture, as I mentioned,

77
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:34,100
we're going to focus on antibiotic resistance because it's by far the biggest issue and problem that we're facing right now.

78
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:47,139
So just a little history. So our Alexander Fleming discovers antibiotics serendipitously by just when he's growing.

79
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:57,700
This is bacteria. He's noticing that there is fungal contamination and it was killing the bacteria and he was able to identify that fungus.

80
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:04,570
And this is where we derive penicillin from as the causal agent that was killing the bacteria.

81
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:15,850
And since then the bacteria was isolated and successfully used in the early forties is really the beginning of our use of antibiotics.

82
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:26,530
So the issue of antibiotic resistance was a concern even of Fleming at the very beginning.

83
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:34,299
And this is his Nobel Prize, a quote from his Nobel Prize lecture that time may come when penicillin can be brought by.

84
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:42,280
Anyone can be bought by anyone in the shops. Then there is the danger that the ignorant man will easily under dose himself,

85
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:47,020
and by exposing his microbes, non-lethal quantities of drugs make them resistant.

86
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,729
So there's this appreciation for antibiotic resistance.

87
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:58,190
And the upcoming problems was understood by Fleming back in day for use.

88
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:07,660
So let's just start by thinking about what to how antibiotics actually kill bacteria.

89
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,210
And there's just three main mechanisms in which they do that.

90
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,690
One is they interfere with cell wall synthesis.

91
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:26,450
And then these these are based these are a list of antibiotics, including penicillin here, which operate with this in this mechanism.

92
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,990
So interfering with cell wall synthesis. Second, interfering with nucleic acid synthesis.

93
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:39,620
Again, here we see that different antibiotics take advantage of this mechanism.

94
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,450
Killing bacteria in the last was interfering with protein synthesis.

95
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:54,460
And so again I was. Antibiotics that operate under this mechanism.

96
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:03,559
So first thing to talk about before we move on is just to be clear.

97
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,080
And for everyone to appreciate the fact that antibiotics save lives,

98
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:14,780
that we're all concerned about the inappropriate use of antibiotics and the advent of antibiotic resistance.

99
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:22,610
But we also want to be very clear that antibiotics are are still saving many lives.

100
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:34,880
This is just showing how the death rate due to bacterial illness decreased dramatically from 1930 2000 to go before antibiotics.

101
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:41,060
You know, bacterial infections were many. Bacterial infections that we take for granted now were life threatening.

102
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:48,440
And so it's still the case that no access or delays to access to antibiotics kill more people than antibiotic resistance.

103
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,840
So we want to always keep that in mind and that in perspective when we're talking about antibiotic resistance,

104
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:03,410
this shows this ecologic data showing gains by antibiotics sort of globally.

105
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,430
So this is, you know, different countries.

106
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:15,330
And with respect to increasing access to antibiotics on the x axis and then deaths due to pneumonia on the Y axis,

107
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:25,320
we see this decreasing trend with increasing access and just some evidence towards this fact that the importance of antibiotics.

108
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:34,889
We're also seeing. Increased deaths due to antibiotic resistance at the same time.

109
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:41,760
And this is, again, showing this trend of deaths due to.

110
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:52,070
Except this from individuals that are getting antibiotic resistant infections.

111
00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:05,190
And another important. Statistic and metric to look at is just how quickly antibiotic resistance developed.

112
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:13,679
After the introduction of antibiotics. You see, in the early years, there were there was quite a number of years,

113
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:22,680
decades even or multiple decades where after the introduction of antibiotic, we see we don't see any resistance.

114
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:32,290
But when you look down here, we're seeing antibiotic resistance occurring, you know, just after the introduction of the new antibiotic.

115
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:39,510
And so that's obviously a big concern that these antibiotic resistance are occurring right away,

116
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:45,240
suggesting that we need to do something and more appropriately dealing with.

117
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:57,230
The use of antibiotics. So now thinking about the mechanisms that bacteria use to become resistant.

118
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,880
There's four main classes of mechanisms.

119
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:17,540
So one is called efflux. That is basically the bacteria evolves to be able to actually push the antibiotics out of out of its its cell.

120
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:30,290
But also there are other mechanisms in which the bacteria prevent the antibiotic from even even entering into and

121
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:41,310
therefore limiting the amount of the bacteria modified at target so that the antibiotic no longer can recognize.

122
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:50,460
So in this case, interrupting DNA synthesis no longer recognizes a target and then becomes ineffective.

123
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:59,180
And last is the bacteria can make the drug ineffective by inactivating it.

124
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:10,840
So three broad classes in which bacteria evolve to become resistant to antibiotics.

125
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:19,810
And one thing to also keep in mind is antibiotics are something that's found in

126
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:28,360
nature so that bacteria has evolved to protect itself from these antibiotics.

127
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:36,460
Prior to prior to our introduction of antibiotics and our use of antibiotics in humans and animals.

128
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,270
So these mechanisms are old mechanisms that they developed.

129
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:46,960
And so it's important to appreciate the fact that this is not a new phenomenon.

130
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:57,310
Antibiotic resistance. So how antibiotic resistance emerges and how it spreads.

131
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:05,230
The first is de novo emergence and just the fact that antibiotics are are mutating

132
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,180
continuously and the ones that are going to be resistant to an antibiotic,

133
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:20,890
either being used in a medical setting, farming setting, or even just, again, in in nature,

134
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:32,350
the one the mutations that will successfully resist these antibiotics are going to be evolve.

135
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:41,680
And so the de novo emergence is an important thing that again happens in nature tends to happen to antibiotics like in TB,

136
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,640
where you're giving an antibiotic, you have to give the antibiotic for a long period of time.

137
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,820
That gives time for this de novo resistance to occur as opposed to when you're giving.

138
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:02,370
In terror, pathogens have to have a much shorter time in which by which the antibiotic needs to be applied.

139
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:15,140
So the second is selection. So once you see, once you get a few antibiotic resistance bacteria that stay in your gut.

140
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:21,350
And that could be because you ingested them through antibiotic resistance, you know,

141
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:28,130
antibiotic resistance better in animals or because they do novo emerge within your gut.

142
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:43,129
In either case, when antibiotics are applied, they kill all this except the bacteria, leaving their resistant bacteria to then grow unimpeded.

143
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:50,840
There's no competition anymore for them, and they're selected in your gut, for instance.

144
00:19:53,540 --> 00:20:04,550
Third way in which resistance spreads is through the fact that for many resistant genes and many bacteria.

145
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:13,930
Bacteria can exchange mobile genetic elements and they can acquire resistant genes from other microbes.

146
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:23,760
This is called horizontal gene transfer. And this is, we think, an important mechanism of spread, though.

147
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,430
You know, we're still there's still a lot of uncertainty and there's still a lot of research in this area.

148
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:38,470
Very hard, very easy to show, relatively easy to show in the lab, much harder to show the evidence of this and the importance of this in populations.

149
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:49,610
But these are these are the mechanisms, primary mechanisms, in which we think about how antibiotic resistance emerges and spreads.

150
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,360
So. This spread can occur through humans and animals.

151
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,970
So again, either through de novo emergence or selection.

152
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:17,280
Within animals or within humans, antibiotic resistance can can grow and within within the guts of animals and within the guts of humans,

153
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:27,809
there's going to be no human cycle on that that occurs with the use of antibiotics for medical use.

154
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:34,680
And that was going to cause increased antibiotic resistance and increased potential for transmission.

155
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,850
And then it happens in this animal cycle, too. And farms and of course,

156
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:47,129
we have most of the time in the US setting our exposure to these resistant genes and these resistant

157
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:55,890
bacteria come from consuming animal products in more rural settings in low and middle income settings.

158
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:04,260
There's direct exposure to the animals also that can cause this this spillover of resistance from animals to humans and then spread.

159
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,889
And the other important piece that again is a part of ongoing research to better

160
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:18,540
understand the impact of this is that there's lots of antibiotics that are resulting.

161
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,079
In the environment through contamination,

162
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:36,030
through either species from animals that get into go from get into the crops and then runoff into water to the basically to the use of

163
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:47,740
antibiotics that are then shed by humans or the antibiotics just being dumped into the environment being that they expire of the urine users.

164
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,810
And so you get a huge amount of environmental contamination of antibiotics,

165
00:22:52,440 --> 00:23:00,960
again on lots of ongoing research to better understand the impact of that with respect to the spread of antibiotics in populations.

166
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:10,250
So in addition to contaminating the environment, in addition to the selection that occurs, everything.

167
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:16,310
Goods. The spread of antibiotic resistance occurs just through the standard.

168
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:25,000
Transmission pathways that occur in, for instance, fecal oral transmission, sexual transmission, indirect contact.

169
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:32,799
So once you select for antibiotic resistance, now, depending on how strong these transmission pathways are,

170
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,190
will determine how much spread you're going to get in a population.

171
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:45,340
And then travel another day, another big aspect of spread, global spread of antibiotic resistance.

172
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:55,900
So you may again and that could be out to talk that Laura Baumann gave on outbreaks showing how you know you start with.

173
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:04,720
Getting somebody getting infected by eating a burrito in Ann Arbor and you wind up going all the way to Arizona to show find where the source is

174
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:17,830
really illustrates the fact that not just pathogen resistant genes and resistant bacteria can spread regionally and globally quite easily nowadays.

175
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:31,540
So a lot of this spread with respect to humans are all about the over use and

176
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:37,860
misuse of antibiotics within the clinical setting and outpatient setting.

177
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:45,390
So one statistic here is 80 to 90% of human antibiotic use occurs in outpatient settings, 50% of all.

178
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:53,880
Outpatient antibiotic use is unnecessary and appropriate with respect to how much they're giving and how long they're giving the antibiotic.

179
00:24:53,890 --> 00:25:07,890
And there's a lot of reasons for that, and there's a lot of tension with respect to the clinician who is sees their role as

180
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,790
protecting their patient and doing everything they can to protect their patient.

181
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:23,760
And the consequence of. Using antibiotics only when they don't need to be used with respect to the spread, societal spread of antibiotics.

182
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:31,780
This over a misuse occurs again in the in the agricultural setting where antibiotics are used.

183
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:46,240
To try to control, but also as growth promoters to get bigger and animals that basically provide more income for farmers.

184
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:58,130
So this is a map showing this that the use of antibiotics in livestock and just the increased sales, antibiotics,

185
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:09,470
sales in meat and poultry production and that that's occurring is now dwarfing the amount of antibiotics using using in the medical field.

186
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:13,250
So it's a huge amount of antibiotics that are being used in agricultural settings.

187
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:26,790
Again. Also this factsheet showing how much antibiotics are being dumped into the environment through wastewater.

188
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:36,520
Wastewater where wastewater treatment plants are designed to remove these necessarily any of these pharmaceuticals.

189
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:41,770
Typically the antibiotics. So.

190
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:55,540
So we see a lot of movement of antibiotic resistance through agricultural settings, in clinical settings within the bacteria.

191
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:02,549
I'm going to mention this horizontal gene transfer so that many bacteria have these plasmids.

192
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:18,300
These plasmids are our genetic elements and that are outside the chromosomal DNA that the bacteria has.

193
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:25,170
And these genetic elements which can carry resistance genes can.

194
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,280
Our mobile, they can move from bacteria to bacteria.

195
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:39,130
And specifically, there are these integrins that are that are on the plasmids that actually carry multiple resistant genes.

196
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:46,080
And this is we're learning more and more about the importance of these integrations in spreading multiple genes.

197
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:55,470
So you can once a bacteria has this integration in place in a plasmid, it basically attracts as a magnet.

198
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:00,810
Lots of different antibiotic resistant genes that then it can move to other bacteria.

199
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:12,570
This is kind of a schematic that just shows basically how a bacteria can move through different mechanisms, resistant genes.

200
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:16,450
From the movement from one bacteria to another.

201
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:27,459
And so we've seen this increase in integrins and other markers reported in large scale farming in developed nations.

202
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:33,610
And we again appreciate the importance of these integrations and the selection

203
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:38,800
of integrations and bacteria to promote the spread of antibiotic resistance.

204
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:45,669
So to highlight this question,

205
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:54,850
I wanted to give a little overview of some work we did in Ecuador to illustrate the importance

206
00:28:54,850 --> 00:29:01,690
of these integrations and the importance of horizontal spread in chickens and poultry farming.

207
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:08,170
And the reason why we chose to look at this in Ecuador is that there's been an increasing

208
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:18,729
number of small farm operations that are being created as development projects.

209
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:25,180
This illustrates how, you know, Bill Gates thinks that raising chickens would solve a huge problem.

210
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:34,050
And so it's been this idea that. Raising chickens is a great way, economic way to create these micro industries.

211
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:45,360
The issue is that that these these farming chickens often include the use of antibiotics and feed as growth

212
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:52,980
promoters and also prophylactically as treating disease and treating patients against disease and treatment.

213
00:29:53,220 --> 00:30:00,330
So to prevent disease coming into a flock of chickens.

214
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:12,880
So. We don't really we haven't really studied this issue because in most of the studies have been in large CFOs, these huge farming operations.

215
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,200
With respect to the impact of spread of antibiotic resistance.

216
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:26,559
But when you look at the numbers of chickens being raised in total globally in these small scale farming settings,

217
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:33,760
it's a huge amount of antibiotics being used. Huge amount of animal resistance being created.

218
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:40,750
And so the question was how what what kind of an impact that has on resistance in these communities?

219
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:51,580
So looking at. Looking at fecal samples from humans, from production chickens.

220
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,370
Those are chickens that are farmed by communities, and they're usually grown in coops.

221
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:03,629
And then fecal samples from household chickens. These are what we would call free range chickens.

222
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:13,030
Chickens are just that. They are just eating scraps of food and are not being presented with antibiotics as a comparison group.

223
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,120
Basically looked at.

224
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:29,850
So again, comparing our production chickens with household chickens with humans that are both associated with production chickens,

225
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:34,200
that is, they are they are farming.

226
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:44,620
Compared with those humans that are only associated with household birds or chickens that are free range, they're not given antibiotics.

227
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,210
So basically looked at these three groups to compare.

228
00:31:50,240 --> 00:32:01,459
So the first. Thing that we've found is elevated antimicrobial resistance levels in production chickens.

229
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:10,130
So the production chickens that were again being fed antibiotics as growth promoters had much higher levels of integrins

230
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:19,730
and resistant genes compared to those households that compared to the household chickens that were receiving antibiotics.

231
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:25,280
And you could see that phenotypic early on different all the different antibiotics

232
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:30,080
that the resistance associated with each of these individual antibiotics,

233
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:36,500
again, much more elevated antibiotic resistance in production chickens versus household chickens,

234
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,310
even in the same in the same communities or adjacent communities.

235
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:48,030
And a key thing here is that these integrins are magnets for resistance genes.

236
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:55,650
And so once a chicken. Or a bacteria in a chicken as selected for an integration.

237
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,310
It may you may see resistance associated with that.

238
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:10,520
Those bacteria in these chickens independent of the actual antibiotics that is being it's being fed through the feed.

239
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:27,920
So we also see these elevated levels of resistance in humans and those associated with production chickens.

240
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,550
Higher levels than those not associated with production chickens.

241
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:39,510
So clearly there is there's a association there. And we also think we look molecularly.

242
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:52,770
We see that the antibiotic resistance, this is for a particular resistant gene cortex, which is what we call an extended spectrum beta lactamase.

243
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,030
But just think of this as a particular gene.

244
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:07,950
We see that the humans that we collect the samples from very closely connected to the resistance we're seeing in the chickens.

245
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:23,460
Just this just really just illustrates, again, the fact the complexity of this with respect to integrations as one exposure,

246
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:32,260
whether or not a bacteria has a neuron and whether or not the chicken is associated with production is attraction

247
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:41,470
chicken or a household chicken with three three different groups of reactions depending on the antibiotic.

248
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:52,390
So in a group, one antibiotic, if the bacteria if the chicken has bacteria with the integration,

249
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:59,560
they have huge amounts of antibiotic resistance to this particular sulfa antibiotic.

250
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:09,760
Without the integration, there's some increase with respect to farming, but not nearly the same increase with respect to the integration.

251
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:19,260
So basically, the integration is the most important factor with respect to this class of antibiotics in another group of antibiotics.

252
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:30,070
It's it's actually additive. So if you have if you're presented with an integration, you have increased antibiotic resistance.

253
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,370
And if you're presented with that integration and are in a, you know,

254
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,350
production chicken, you have an additive increased risk of antibiotic resistance.

255
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:47,590
And the third group is synergistic that really to see this and resistance.

256
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:55,940
A chicken needs to have bacteria that both. They're both production chickens and they present electrons.

257
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:02,089
So I. Not going into the detail of the different mechanisms.

258
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:08,870
But just to illustrate that this the mechanisms behind antibiotic resistance are complicated.

259
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:16,640
And because they're complicated, we see a lot of different kinds of content starting mechanisms such as.

260
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:23,810
You release the antibiotic pressure, you may or may not see a decrease in antibiotic resistance.

261
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:28,160
And so and we see this in many, many cases.

262
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,430
The other last big piece of.

263
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:46,889
The finding here was that. If we compared household chickens that were in communities where there were production, chicken production,

264
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:56,310
farming happening with household chickens where there wasn't production chickens in coops occurring,

265
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:05,909
we see that there is more antibiotic resistance in those household chickens that are in communities

266
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,750
where there's farming compared to those household chickens where there wasn't farming.

267
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:14,040
But this shows some evidence of environmental transmission that's occurring.

268
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:19,440
That is, these production chickens and household chickens are never in contact with each other.

269
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:25,380
The production chickens are always in coops, and the household chickens are roaming in households.

270
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:32,970
And so that's suggesting that there's some environmental transmission that's occurring in these in these communities.

271
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,360
So one of the big take home messages here is that.

272
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:58,310
These a lot of these bacteria are one way in which they're adapting to being exposed to a lot of antibiotics is to express these integrantes.

273
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:08,060
And these interactions are ones in which they're basically protecting the bacteria from a broad spectrum of antibiotics.

274
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:14,959
So what's happening in these production in the in the feed is that the companies are

275
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,430
using different antibiotics depending on what the cheapest antibiotic is on the market.

276
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:26,840
So these chickens are seeing not just tetracycline, they're seeing a wide range of antibiotics.

277
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:31,580
And for the bacteria to protect themselves from a wide range of antibiotics.

278
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:42,840
The best thing they can do is, you know, develop these or upload these into grants, which then become magnets for multiple drug resistance.

279
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:48,760
And so. Suggesting that it's not just the volume of antibiotics being used,

280
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:58,510
but also the fact that broad spectrum antibiotic use is occurring in these farms and occurring also in large scale farming,

281
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:04,479
too, with because of the market is driving, you know, the cheapest antibiotic is what they're going to use.

282
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,450
And so they're going to use lots of different antibiotics in in their farm.

283
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,160
And just just to emphasize, again,

284
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:25,330
what this highlights is really the tension between the economic development of these small scale farming enterprises

285
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:32,560
and micro industries and the public health consequences of developing and spreading antibiotic resistance.

286
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:46,049
So. These next slides are kind of just showing you that there's and giving you a little

287
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:52,380
bit of detail in the wide range of antibiotic resistance that we're seeing globally.

288
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:58,780
Mersa methicillin resistant staph. Aureus is a is a huge problem.

289
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:06,999
I mentioned that it's caused a huge amount of deaths and it was highlighted not that long ago about how

290
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:15,120
at the point where it was causing more deaths than HIV in the midst of the HIV epidemic and under.

291
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,320
And it was underappreciated at that time.

292
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:27,040
And one of the concerns is that it's moving out of health care systems and the community acquired Mersa is increasing.

293
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,710
And so that's a big concern.

294
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,160
Resistant organism have no big concern.

295
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:47,850
See, there's another one. I mentioned that before. Again, this this can be life threatening in the medical setting.

296
00:40:47,850 --> 00:41:01,130
It's an opportunistic pathogen. But when you when antibiotics are being delivered to patients, their gut is basically making your both you know,

297
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:06,840
you're killing up the pathogen, but also you're killing off a lot of of your gut microbiome.

298
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:14,040
Giving room for the C diff to actually grow, infect and grow and cause a lot of pathology.

299
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:28,290
Vancomycin resistant enterococcus another big hospital acquired infection causing one of mentality and then carbapenem resistant bacteria.

300
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:42,250
A.C. is one of these. Third line antibiotic resistant bacteria that is causing a lot of deaths due to the fact that

301
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:49,900
we're just not actually able to treat these resistant bugs effectively when people are infected.

302
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:56,940
Just to emphasize that there are important.

303
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:04,630
Microbial resistance in fungi, also, not just in bacteria.

304
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:11,620
And candida auris is a rising concern in health care facilities.

305
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:18,420
And then in the sexually transmitted disease area, gonorrhea.

306
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:24,610
And antibiotic resistance. Gonorrhea is a huge concern right now.

307
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:31,450
And this is. Pictorial here emphasizes and illustrates.

308
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:35,560
How would you know?

309
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:43,390
Back in the thirties the introduction of sulfa drugs to treat to treat gonorrhea,

310
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:55,509
and then the subsequent resistance and how this resistance to penicillin and then to

311
00:42:55,510 --> 00:43:00,840
fluoroquinolones and then to some of these third line antibiotics have occurred,

312
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:11,990
a cross between the 1932 2015. So again, just this specific example of how as time moves on,

313
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:19,370
bacteria becomes resistant to first line and second line and then even sometimes third line antibiotics.

314
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:24,670
Tuberculosis is a huge, huge problem.

315
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:32,980
And one of the problems that is making it harder and harder to treat, but multi-drug resistant, multidrug resistant TB,

316
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:46,120
where the infection is not responding to some of the main antibiotics that are being used to treat TB.

317
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:54,700
Even more concerning is what they're calling what we call extensively drug resistant TB, XDR,

318
00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:02,090
TB, which is now resistant to even more of the antibiotics that we have for treating TB.

319
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,790
And as we talked about.

320
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:18,600
In an early election, there's less and less economic motivation for companies to keep pharmaceutical companies to keep developing more antibiotics.

321
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,140
And it's becoming harder and harder to actually do that development.

322
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:31,290
And so as they're as these bacteria are becoming resistant to the sweet as antibiotics,

323
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:39,120
we're running into huge problems with respect to being able to treat TB, which required antibiotics.

324
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:46,590
Huge, huge killer still. And the mortality plummeted with the use of antibiotics.

325
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:56,520
The concern now is that we you know, we're moving into this pre-antibiotic era of not being able to treat these diseases.

326
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:05,100
So how do we prevent and contain antimicrobial resistance?

327
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:10,110
One way is to improve diagnosis and prescription practices.

328
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,330
A lot of times what happens is. Again.

329
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:25,790
Physicians come in. A patient comes in. A physician doesn't want to or decides not to actually try and diagnose the problem once,

330
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:32,299
maybe through symptoms as soon as it's potentially bacterial and prescribes

331
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:37,190
antibiotics before knowing whether or not it's a bacterial or a viral pathogen.

332
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:43,390
So improving that turnaround time of day, you know,

333
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:52,220
being able to diagnose a bacterial versus viral infection is one important area that people are working on,

334
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:59,510
reducing the microbial use in animals, in animal husbandry, in fish farming and agriculture.

335
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:12,800
Another way we can prevent resistance and there's big movements towards this decreasing that huge high density farming is one way to do that.

336
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:25,460
Development of new antimicrobials. Again, we talked about the limitations that that guarantee access to essential medicine to ensure quality.

337
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:35,890
Making sure that everyone has. Access to medicines when they need it, and again, that it's appropriately prescribed.

338
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:49,540
Then improving surveillance of these antimicrobial resistance bacteria better that we understand what's the

339
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:56,380
prevalence of them in different communities which can help physicians inappropriately prescribing medication.

340
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:06,890
So. This guy moves into our discussion.

341
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:21,740
Part of the part where we're going to focus on emergence, transmission and optimizing antibiotic use is based on this paper in 2016 by Holmes.

342
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:31,100
And I'm going to switch basically I have this same text right here.

343
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:42,870
So. Just orient everybody to emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

344
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:53,299
The natural phenomenon we talked about that antibiotic resistant selection has been driven by antimicrobial exposure in the health care system.

345
00:47:53,300 --> 00:48:03,940
In the in agriculture and environment, transmission is affected by hospital conditions, sanitation, access to clean water, travel and mitigation.

346
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:08,030
So we talked about the fact that once emerged,

347
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:15,530
antimicrobial resistance spreads through our traditional transmission pathways that we talked about before.

348
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:25,280
Strategies to reduce AMR by removing selective pressure alone rely upon resistance, imparting a fitness course.

349
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,489
I talked a little bit about this and in fact, not always a parent.

350
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:35,750
That is. Just by reducing and removing the antibiotic pressure.

351
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:44,930
So one example is Europe outlawed this particular set of antibiotics in agricultural settings.

352
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:54,950
But we did not see that decrease in antibiotic resistant bacteria in the in the animals setting.

353
00:48:55,340 --> 00:49:05,420
And so it kind of talks about the complexities of antimicrobial resistance and the complexities of the different kinds of medication practices.

354
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:15,620
So for the discussion, basically, we talked about emergence, talk about transmission and a little bit and talked about antibiotic use.

355
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:22,790
So very specific questions associated with each that I'd like different groups to discuss.

356
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,260
What does resistance and what does resistance emerge?

357
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,650
Why does resistance emerge within a microorganism?

358
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:34,940
Why does antimicrobial resistance emerge at the individual level?

359
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,840
And then also, why does it emerge at the population level?

360
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:46,160
So Group one will focus on Group one, and two will focus on this emerging question.

361
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:52,340
And then three and four will focus on this transmission question.

362
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,080
So how did the transmission of resistance occur between microorganisms?

363
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:04,160
Talk about that? And how does it how does transmission occur from within?

364
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:08,750
What's the role of animals and the environment in driving this transmission?

365
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,980
So that will be three and four. And in five and six we'll talk about optimizing antibiotic use.

366
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:26,690
How should we use and preserve the effectiveness of the way resistance in humans and in animals that be five and six?

367
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:33,369
And we'll throw because we have seven, but there are maybe seven.

368
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:36,880
We'll work on this transmission question also.

369
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:43,100
Got any questions?

370
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:53,450
The idea here is to try and take what I presented in the lecture and apply it to fighting the emergence transmission antibiotic use.

371
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:08,290
I guess my one.

372
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:19,600
Oh, yeah.

373
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:30,330
It's very shaky. I don't want to tell you.

374
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:35,550
Really? Like. All right.

375
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:49,900
Yeah, I. I don't even want to think about that.

376
00:51:54,710 --> 00:52:08,180
You know, I have a feeling that something I wrote my freshman year seems not to.

377
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:19,550
We had our great moments. I haven't had time to write to myself.

378
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,800
I feel like it would be best for you. Yeah.

379
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:36,780
I guess there is something strange in our thing, which is how many thousands of dollars I would have to sift through the same internet searches.

380
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:51,130
Oh, yeah. That is actually genetic coding.

381
00:52:55,490 --> 00:53:09,040
That's right. I was going to ask you something about that after you got it done.

382
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:09,890
Finally.

383
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:54,180
I'm just typing and I just wanted to say, you know, that's all I think was she was trying to figure out how to pay for everything that's like,

384
00:53:54,180 --> 00:54:05,180
you know, you're asking me, I don't have to tell them.

385
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:09,410
You know, I'm like, I respect you.

386
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:26,280
I'm so sorry. I put too much coverage on the economy.

387
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:35,160
I was like, Really? I lost my God, you know?

388
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:46,890
But I'll be okay. I'm better.

389
00:54:46,920 --> 00:55:08,340
They have to pay what really happened to this country because it's not like I'm going out about in a way where I'm your DNA anymore.

390
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:17,400
She's a journalist. Amazing U.S.A.

391
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:29,399
It's not like I don't know.

392
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:52,670
I just, you know, it's a good question. I mean, I still think, wow, I'm so sorry, but it's like a young lady.

393
00:55:52,710 --> 00:56:17,750
Nice clothes. Sounds like she's like, oh, they're actually going to ask you about my friend and you know, you're going to prison.

394
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:30,040
You have to have like these parties are in South America.

395
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:40,860
First of all, I think it's one thing to do.

396
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:57,620
I mean, if you think about not coming, it is likely to be out of your mind.

397
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:29,240
I think in this specific case, this time, it's like the business finance ministers who, you know, protesting against the university system.

398
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:39,750
So it's like we have to go, I think like the mining industry.

399
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:48,880
I think that's what I want people to know about know.

400
00:57:49,850 --> 00:58:06,530
So I think that's part of I don't care if you want to grow up.

401
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:39,550
Yeah. Like this isn't going to work. Last year was the last time I saw a word from our side on an asset class.

402
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,860
Why do you resign?

403
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:59,470
Work. I came to my house because I thought this was my desire.

404
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:13,950
Like I said, you know, I need you as well, I think.

405
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:22,370
I don't know you all for go to have and I say to be like, oh, my God.

406
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:28,540
Oh, geez. I was going to say, I'm not going to do it. I don't know.

407
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:39,280
I can't say I'm a little concerned. So definitely a little concerned about getting replacement power.

408
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:50,320
So let's try to figure that out.

409
00:59:51,040 --> 01:00:13,920
I know when I did it with one of my people that I used to be able to reach as many as 100 000.

410
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:24,940
That's what I want to get done by people like you.

411
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:43,120
Me before. It does not work. Yes, it's still making activities sell by some basis.

412
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:55,570
I was thinking, know I'm coming with you.

413
01:00:55,570 --> 01:01:12,220
I got to know who I was.

414
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:29,050
Yeah, that's good. I was just going to say something.

415
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:49,600
But you are. You're doing great. Yeah, you know, I don't know.

416
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:55,300
Oh, yeah.

417
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:33,950
Oh, yeah. I think. I think she was really powerful in the back of my mind.

418
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:45,720
Isolated situations like this.

419
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:59,230
I think it's going to be a lot of the time.

420
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:09,340
I don't know how much I know are going to be.

421
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,610
Two days of five outside the hospital.

422
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:21,800
I'm going to have you know.

423
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:27,770
I know. I know.

424
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:56,660
I think it's it's hard to see I can't see my parents like but I feel bad.

425
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:27,500
But I just have I just have always thought that it would be like if it takes like three or four times, I like to have kids.

426
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:40,430
So I just decided to get the hospital to get exactly what I was thinking about.

427
01:04:40,510 --> 01:05:01,460
So I just asked, this is like, do you have any way to do this?

428
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:15,950
I think it actually means that you're not going to get out of your Spotify headspace, like, whatever.

429
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:20,260
Yeah, like, oh, this might go away.

430
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:37,250
I said, Oh, yeah, so it's not going to work.

431
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:42,080
I think it's good they're going to start cracking down in this area.

432
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:48,920
I got excited and I'm sure it's like they're going to start cracking down because they realized I was like,

433
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:57,390
Oh, I think they're going to start crying when I watch that.

434
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:15,590
And I also think that really, you know, I think I'm working on it.

435
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:24,410
That's right. Yeah. I will tell you what I think.

436
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:41,660
Like, I think it's like at the time it was more like, okay, so let's regroup and and report back.

437
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:47,270
So let's start with Group one and on Emergence.

438
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:59,719
Okay. So for the first one, we talked about resistance emerging and a microorganism basically has an evolutionary survival response or due to

439
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:07,220
natural selection pressures and microorganisms developed and over mutations rapidly due to their rapid rate of division.

440
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:16,880
And these mutations can spread between bacteria through horizontal gene transfer and are selected for by selective pressure applied by antibiotic use.

441
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:24,169
And then for the second one, at the individual human level, obviously the use, misuse,

442
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:33,680
overuse of antibiotics and bacteria evolve over time, just naturally random mutation and.

443
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:40,120
That's all for the second one. The population level.

444
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:46,960
Again, the overuse of antibiotics and the those organisms can spread between people and animals.

445
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:53,800
I think you talked a little bit about antibiotics being disposed of and then they can enter the environment that way.

446
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:59,710
Yeah. Yeah. All.

447
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:09,190
The distinction between the two is that there's some de novo emergence happening that could happen in the environment.

448
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:12,520
We don't actually know that much about that. It could happen in a chicken.

449
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:19,220
It could happen in. Once it happens, then, for instance, humans can get it just through ingestion.

450
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:25,850
And so I think that's an important piece to realize, is that it's not like a de novo.

451
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,829
Emergencies that was happening in the human and it's but that it's the selection pressure

452
01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:41,100
of antibiotics that takes what is a minority strain in your gut and maybe not doing much.

453
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:46,110
And all of a sudden it has a selective advantage to grow because you've killed off everything else.

454
01:08:47,610 --> 01:08:56,710
Good group to do anything. And for the first question, it pretty much said the exact same thing.

455
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:59,830
On the second question, in addition to what they said,

456
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:05,170
we also talked about like inappropriate dosing and how like if you don't kill off all the bacteria,

457
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:11,200
you're increasing the selective pressure and then vice versa, like if you are overusing it,

458
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:16,870
then were likely maybe to like shut it into the wastewater systems and environment.

459
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:24,630
And then like the horizontal gene transfer that can occur in the gut for for not killing off all the bacteria.

460
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:32,520
The third question we talked about environmental uptake through agricultural runoff and wastewater runoff.

461
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:43,499
We also talked about like overuse of prophylaxis in agriculture and also the fecal oral route,

462
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:52,110
how that can contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria through like poor sanitation, contaminated food sources.

463
01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:59,760
Yeah. That's a major part in vaccine. Overlaps with the transmission question.

464
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:05,220
But yes, there certainly is a way in which that spread happens at the population level.

465
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:15,090
But then the emergence at the population level is more about you're exposed to antibiotics.

466
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:23,780
The. Even though it's both antibiotics and antibiotic resistance in the environment that.

467
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:35,920
Anything else to add? So we moved three in transmission.

468
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:46,810
So for how does transmission of resistance occur between microorganisms?

469
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:55,350
We have horizontal gene transfer so that plasmids carry resistance genes and their mobile so they can move from bacteria to bacteria.

470
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:59,050
So that's usually that transmission occurs through contact runs.

471
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:03,790
For how does human and human to human transmission drive resistance?

472
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:09,040
We have that transmission of antimicrobial resistant bacteria as such pathogens

473
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:15,850
from decreased prevalence of infection with antimicrobial resistant pathogen.

474
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:23,270
For what is the role of animals in the environment and driving transmission of resistance?

475
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:36,130
We have. That. Antibiotic use in animals can drive both directly and indirectly in curbing

476
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:42,809
resistance by consumption of animal products that are used with antibiotics,

477
01:11:42,810 --> 01:11:47,250
as well as runoff into the environment, which is the environmental component.

478
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:52,500
And then is emergence of the resistance reversible?

479
01:11:52,740 --> 01:12:02,850
Technically, yes, in the sense that if you can destroy resistant pathogen cells before they spread through horizontal transfer.

480
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:10,050
Yes, but in a practical sense, unless you have like the world's best surveillance system, not necessarily feasible in that sense.

481
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:19,590
So preventative measures to reduce spread is more likely or to prevent it from emerging in the first place is more.

482
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:27,680
Plausible. Right. Right. Good. One thing I didn't mention is this.

483
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:38,129
There's you know, there's this idea that chickens have chicken bacteria and humans have human bacteria,

484
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:46,710
and that is that chicken e coli may not be able to establish itself in a human kind necessarily,

485
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:53,880
but the combination of the fact that you ingest this bacteria, even transiently,

486
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:59,070
and then there's horizontal gene transfer to transfer it to bacteria that are

487
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:07,200
well-adapted to the human gut is one way in which that spread can effectively occur.

488
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:15,930
It doesn't require necessarily that the bacteria from a chicken is established in a cell very long, nor the transiently.

489
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:24,640
It's so great for a lot media.

490
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:31,400
We said the same things at the same points, but for before we kind of talked about how we didn't think the emergence for the

491
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:35,580
emergence of resistance was reversible because it's kind of like competition.

492
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:44,680
So if we come up with a drug or or something else to combat these antimicrobial resistant bacteria,

493
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:50,510
they're just going to adapt and find new ways to evade that. So it's just like a constant competition with that.

494
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:52,129
Yeah.

495
01:13:52,130 --> 01:14:01,070
One thing that's interesting is like if you actually look at humans and chickens and tetracycline, it's just everybody has tetracycline resistance.

496
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:07,880
There's some and and a lot of it is because there's so much natural exposure to.

497
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:16,920
Resistant bacteria in E coli that are just resistant because there's so much tetracycline in nature.

498
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:25,200
It's a drug that's quickly become not really very usable in humans.

499
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:32,189
Good. So.

500
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:41,519
Yeah. So the question of. Resistance versus the ability to reverse resistance is really in a lot of unknown territory,

501
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,030
uncharted territory, because, again, with respect to these integrations,

502
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:52,980
if all of a sudden, you know, integration may have have attracted resistance with three genes,

503
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:58,640
there's no real reason for it to drop one and not another.

504
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:03,870
So unless there's a way in which the bacteria benefits from losing the whole integration,

505
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:07,679
it's not going to necessarily just drop tetracycline and not assault the drug.

506
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:13,719
And so understanding, which is way beyond the scope of this course,

507
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:21,450
better saying the biology of each one of these mechanisms goes a long way to understand what how,

508
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:27,020
what's reversible or in what way will these these antibiotic resistant key reversible?

509
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:34,110
And again, we're not ever trying to drive this to zero because this is just a natural phenomenon.

510
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:38,610
We just need to figure out ways in which we can get it to a manageable level.

511
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:46,590
So switching to antibiotic use, i.

512
01:15:51,110 --> 01:16:02,930
We talked about increasing or not increasing improving diagnosis to be more precise or accurate prescription of antibiotics,

513
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:12,440
increasing the diversity of drugs and drug targets for different microbes, and potentially using antibiotics with other drugs.

514
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:16,580
So be less dependent on antibiotics.

515
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:21,020
That was for humans and then for animals.

516
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:29,509
We talked about improving conditions that the animals are living in more space for the animals to live and breathe.

517
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:39,380
So the disease spread is cut down and reducing the amount of antimicrobials used in husbandry to be used to cure illness, not prevent it.

518
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:52,549
Great. Yes. I didn't actually emphasize the rotation. That's a big way in which people are working at malaria medication.

519
01:16:52,550 --> 01:17:03,340
Actually decided not to use the same medication for too long and have this rotation was one way to minimize resistance and not just minimized.

520
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:08,520
I mean, the emphasis here, again, is delaying the onset of resistance.

521
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,720
So the time it takes is is also a huge.

522
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:19,880
Make huge benefit and progress with respect to addressing antimicrobial resistance.

523
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:33,260
Six. Okay. So we had some similar points, some things that were different.

524
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:40,280
Ah, we talked about increasing medical student and Christian education and implanting

525
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:48,379
antimicrobial stewardship programs which involve collaboration between the physicians,

526
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:54,140
pharmacists and infection prevention as to make sure appropriate antimicrobials are being prescribed,

527
01:17:56,210 --> 01:18:02,330
and then making sure that the patients understand their role in taking their antibiotics,

528
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:08,360
making sure that you can finish them and not start like other groups have talked about.

529
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:17,260
And we talked about introducing a policy to reduce antibiotic use for growth purposes and

530
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:24,110
hopes with that one requiring veterinary diagnosis and prescription for antibiotic use.

531
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,900
And the same with prophylaxis as well,

532
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:36,440
increasing awareness for environmental contamination and to introduce more requirements for controlling contaminated animal waste.

533
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:46,190
Great. And then less one time just using targeted antibiotics, not broad spectrum when possible.

534
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:50,510
Right. That's important. Sorry, I think.

535
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:57,750
I mean, one important regulation could be about how dense farms can be denser.

536
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:01,540
The farms, the more disease beds, you're going to have them more.

537
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:04,540
Indeed, you're going to have to worry about expansion. That's a good.

538
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:13,430
One good meditation practice is to kind of regulate on how dense a palm can actually be.

539
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:19,000
That's great. And I really forgot about group seven.

540
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,590
You were on transmission, right? Do you have anything to add on?

541
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:29,019
They covered majority of our premise. Everything that we said was kind of funny.

542
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:33,580
Looking at our points. It was basically everything they talked about. I do have a question, though, maybe.

543
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:38,139
Okay. I guess, how do they test for and is it it doesn't seem like it would be easy to test

544
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:44,750
for resistance against any sort of bacteria like or specifically in bacteria.

545
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:50,350
How do they test for that? How do you test for resistance? So they have these varied I mean, you could do it.

546
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:59,290
Phenotypically You can basically do it by there is these kits and basically you isolate a bacteria and you grow it in this.
