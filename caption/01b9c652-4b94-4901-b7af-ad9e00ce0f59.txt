1
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:18,590
Good morning, everyone. I want to just go ahead and start class with just a couple of logistics.

2
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,000
First off, not just in this class, but one or two students have reached out to me.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,800
But I know, you know, more broadly across the school and campus, people are managing right.

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,320
Sniffles Not feeling well. People, you know, testing positive, that type of stuff.

5
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,210
I just kind of want to reiterate the same message that we started with on the first day of class.

6
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:44,020
Absolutely. If you're not feeling well, don't don't come to class.

7
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,230
I have things set up with the Panopto recordings. They seem to be going well.

8
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:53,090
They're legible, you know, in terms of the audio and so forth.

9
00:00:53,090 --> 00:01:00,890
And then communication. I just want to kind of re-emphasize that reach out to me, say, hey, and you know, again,

10
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,510
not because, oh, my gosh, I'm tired and it's eight thirty is a really, really class.

11
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:13,250
I don't want to comment, but, you know, for genuine reasons. Absolutely. Just shoot me an email to give me a heads up, say, hey, I'm not feeling well.

12
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,360
I won't be in class today.

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:23,600
I'll remind you, you know, please go ahead and watch the Panopto reporting and then I'm happy to follow up if you've got any questions from that.

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:34,340
I'm watching the recording and what you feel like you might have missed or might not press from class any any questions regarding that or actually,

15
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,800
I can turn it around. Any information you can share with me to help help the class like things maybe you're

16
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,510
learning from your other classes or just from social circles or whatever to folks?

17
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:49,670
I don't know. The folks know others that are not feeling well.

18
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:56,510
Uh, testing positive. I had people talking about like this person is hospitalized.

19
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:01,760
Yeah, ok. OK. Yeah, it's you know, it's unfortunate.

20
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,700
It's kind of where we're at in this phase of the pandemic. There's vaccine requirements, right.

21
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,190
For the campus community. Um, but even with that right.

22
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:21,830
The virus is able to be transmitted and people become infected, hopefully without symptoms.

23
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:29,120
But there are definitely cases where people are symptomatic. So anyway, I just was as long as we have the communication going back and forth,

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,220
I don't see any problems in terms of the class and your ability to to do well.

25
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,670
And, you know, I know I emphasize the participation part.

26
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,240
You know, I'm not taking attendance rate in the class.

27
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,580
I'm not keeping track of, you know, how many classes you were here, weren't here, how many questions you answered.

28
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:56,060
He didn't answer it. That's not to that level. Um, the second logistic is this is kind of good news for you is today we're going to talk

29
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,470
about chemical exposures and that'll be the last time for a couple of class period.

30
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:06,950
So you'll have to listen to me talking the whole time. And it wasn't really by plan.

31
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:12,380
It just kind of sort it out this way with people's availability is the next three class sessions.

32
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,910
We have guest lectures, some of my colleagues from Environmental Health Sciences,

33
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:25,940
Professor NEITZEL on next Tuesday, Professor Meeker on Thursday, and then Professor Lay on the following Tuesday.

34
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,340
So, yes, that's perhaps the good news from your perspective.

35
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,710
But I just wanted to I kind of again, going back to the first class,

36
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:42,050
I put out like a little bit of a heads up that you're probably just now getting used to the flow of this class.

37
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:52,490
Right, with me being up here, how much I talk nonstop combined with when I kind of prompt you for ideas or responses.

38
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,780
Right. To different things and expect it to be different.

39
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,780
Right. So each of these instructors is going to have kind of a different classroom.

40
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:09,300
Some of them might be much more interactive and be reaching out to you. Please engage and respond as much as possible.

41
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,390
Others might just like talk the whole time.

42
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:21,710
And don't don't don't hesitate to to raise your hand and interrupt if you if you do have a question or need some clarification anyway,

43
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:25,880
just just kind of a gentle reminder on that. All three of them are fantastic.

44
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,490
So I expect to be a huge, huge benefit to you.

45
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:42,020
Any questions in terms of the class, the schedule, other logistics before we move on to chemical exposures?

46
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:59,560
OK, sounds good. My going on there.

47
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:10,030
All right, so we I think it was going back to that first class again, we talked about the number of chemicals that are in US commerce.

48
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:15,370
Right. And I think we ended up somewhere around eighty thousand, eighty five thousand, something like that.

49
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:25,990
Huge, huge number. Right. And we're concerned about them in terms of exposure, primarily human exposure.

50
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,360
And how do we approach this?

51
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:37,420
How do you approach 85000 chemicals, some sort of perspective that makes any sense or some sort of organizational capacity?

52
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:48,580
So there's a set of not written in stone, but kind of practical options or classification schemes for these chemicals.

53
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,650
And, you know, hopefully by the end of this period and going forward,

54
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:59,320
you'll just become more aware of the different factors that relate to how we recognize

55
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,050
and then evaluate these chemical exposures and how they impact risk to our health.

56
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:17,480
And most of this material, again, just to kind of remind you, those readings comes from the Chapter 11, from the levy text that's on canvas.

57
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:37,250
I did a quick water break here, so getting a handle on these chemical exposures or we're trying to.

58
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:43,280
There's there's several different kind of classification schemes or ways that we can approach this.

59
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,610
I'll step through them here just as a matter of introduction,

60
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,600
but then we'll take a few minutes to go through each of them and talk about some examples

61
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:57,260
for how this approach might work for these different classifications might be implemented.

62
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:07,700
So one is, by the nature of the chemicals, just at a very basic level, are the organic chemicals or the inorganic.

63
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,870
And just that distinction alone gives us a starting point.

64
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:20,990
So it might be the chemical structure, its functionality, whether we're talking about elements like trace metals, for example,

65
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:30,030
or complex chemical compounds, we might classify chemical exposures based on the source like where where they're coming from.

66
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:37,190
Right. And we talked about, for example, natural sources versus anthropogenic sources.

67
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:45,980
We might classify them by the medium. So where as people, we encounter certain types of chemicals.

68
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:52,580
So going back to our our environment, our exposure pathways and our our potential roots of exposure.

69
00:07:52,580 --> 00:08:05,240
Right. So we might classify chemicals by those that we encounter in the air or through water or through ingestion by manner of use.

70
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:11,240
So and we'll talk about some examples, but by classification of people.

71
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:22,940
So certain groups of people and how they might use or interact with chemicals might be a way to approach it by the mechanism of action.

72
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:31,340
So now kind of getting to the toxicity component that both the target and the time frame of toxicity

73
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:38,480
might be a way to to classify chemicals that specific to kind of direct human interactions.

74
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:44,240
We might classify them by how chemicals behave in the environment,

75
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,810
what characteristics they have more broadly in different environments or microenvironments.

76
00:08:50,810 --> 00:09:00,680
Are they persistent, right. Versus do they break down these bioaccumulate, for example, how reactive are they?

77
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,290
And then the last game on here is by their physical chemical properties.

78
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:13,460
So are they a gas in the air or are they an aerosol or a particle?

79
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:21,680
What's the polarity in solubility, for example, the reactivity and the volatility and so forth.

80
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,340
So let's go ahead.

81
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:32,030
We'll take a minute and just kind of step through each of these classification schemes for chemical exposures and discuss some examples for each.

82
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:41,380
So we'll go ahead and just kind of start at the top and go through the list by looking at by nature.

83
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:48,310
So when we talk about organic chemicals and again, this is basic stuff, when we talk about an organic chemical,

84
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,510
it's got to have at least one carbon atom and usually at least one hydrogen

85
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:58,960
atom to be considered a member of this enormous class of organic chemicals.

86
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:08,350
The simplest organic compounds is methane. And then in terms of its property, it usually exists as a gas.

87
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:14,920
So let's go ahead and focus on methane as an example and break it down a little bit.

88
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,330
Looking at some of these different characteristics in terms of its structure,

89
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:31,090
it's an alkan more specifically and Allapattah hydrocarbon in terms of its sources and come naturally from out of the earth.

90
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:39,040
The Earth's crust comes from animals. Right, to go to over here of of some cows that comes from landfills.

91
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,880
Right. That's an example.

92
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:51,280
Kind of an anthropogenic source of methane in terms of the medium that we might find methane or be concerned about it in soil as well as in air.

93
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:57,650
And again, because in terms of its physical chemical properties, it exists as a gas at ambient conditions.

94
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:08,890
And so we're mostly going to find it in the air in terms of its uses, its fuel used for cooking and heating.

95
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:16,330
Its toxic mechanism is for the most part, as a simple exeunt.

96
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,820
Target organ is perhaps not completely clear.

97
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,350
It's time course is usually short, right?

98
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:33,880
So from an exposure perspective, we're we're concerned about a short term exposure in terms of environmental properties.

99
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,330
Methane is characterized as a greenhouse gas, right.

100
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:47,950
So indirectly for direct human exposure, it can impact human and ecosystem health through its role as a greenhouse gas.

101
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:55,870
It's it's a precursor for chemical reactions that form ozone, which is a whole other problem, ozone,

102
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:03,880
gas in the atmosphere in terms of exposure and respiratory problems, in terms of physical chemical properties.

103
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,610
We've hit on a couple of these. It exists as a gas at ambient conditions.

104
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,240
It's non polar. It's hydrophobic. Right.

105
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:24,130
Which means it doesn't like water. It's inert, but yet flammable and highly volatile in contrast.

106
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:31,300
Right. So that was an example of an organic chemical, a chemical that we'd be concerned about from an exposure perspective.

107
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:40,450
Here's an example of an inorganic chemical. Right. And at the most basic level, inorganic chemicals lack carbon and hydrogen.

108
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:46,720
They can be elements. So individual elements, they can also be compounds.

109
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:53,470
And then a classic example of an inorganic chemical with interest from an exposure perspective is left.

110
00:12:53,470 --> 00:13:01,450
Right. And I think we have yeah. Let's go through some of the characteristics here of lead.

111
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:10,630
We might be concerned about it as in its elemental state or as a salt or inorganic metallic in terms of its sources.

112
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:16,760
It used to be purposely added to gasoline. That was a huge issue going back a couple of decades.

113
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:25,900
It continues to be a problem in old paint, in older homes as well as older plumbing.

114
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:34,840
In terms of the mediums of concern for chemical exposure to lead, we're concerned about soil, water, air.

115
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,280
Its use is again, we mentioned it was purposely added to fuels,

116
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:47,890
added to paint that's used in and sardars cosmetics in terms of coloring car batteries.

117
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:58,630
Numerous examples here in terms of toxic mechanisms, central nervous system, target organ brain,

118
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:04,390
bone marrow, peripheral nervous system terms of a time course in contrast to methane,

119
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:14,680
which we're looking at kind of short acute exposures for pollutants like lead, we're mostly concerned about longer term and chronic exposures.

120
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,460
And there's a reference here on the slide to Halflife.

121
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:28,030
And we'll talk about Half-Light here in a few minutes. In terms of its environmental problems, it's persistent and relatively ubiquitous,

122
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:34,750
which means it's it's found in lots and lots of places in terms of its properties.

123
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,290
And its physical state is at ambient conditions.

124
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:49,370
It typically is a solid for. It's airborne, it's an aerosol or particle face, it's insoluble in water, at least four elemental led,

125
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:57,350
whereas salts and other lead compounds can be soluble, inorganic blood is generally non volatile.

126
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:07,380
Again, it's in that solid phase and NBA conditions. All right, so that was that was an example of nature as a classification scheme.

127
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:14,760
Any questions? OK, good. So let's go ahead and move on to source as a classification scheme.

128
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:25,440
Right. So natural sources or biogenic meaning another word,

129
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:38,610
we are concerned about natural sources of chemical exposures in food and water in the atmosphere and trees are a good example.

130
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:47,100
And again, kind of leaning on my background or on air quality issues are pining that gets emitted from trees is

131
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:53,250
another precursor that reacts in the atmosphere through different chemical reactions to form ozone,

132
00:15:53,250 --> 00:16:05,700
gas and secondary aerosol particles, different fungi that contribute to odors, aflatoxin,

133
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:11,070
uh, different bacteria and don't toxins that are present in different insects.

134
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:21,180
These are actually quite natural, right, for animals in terms of terrestrial processes, uh, forest fires.

135
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:29,610
This is something that's in the news and we've been beginning to discuss on a more regular basis because you can't avoid it.

136
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:42,030
The forest fires end up being a huge source of many chemicals that are, for the most part, natural in origin.

137
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:50,500
Volcanos is kind of an obvious example, things like dust storms.

138
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:57,400
And then so I talked about the painting from the trees up here are the moldy peanuts.

139
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,820
So what's with that image?

140
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:13,480
So Aspergillus Flatus produces a micro toxin called aflatoxin be one of the most toxic, naturally occurring compound when it comes to moldy peanuts.

141
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:20,610
The rule is don't eat them. OK, uh.

142
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:28,920
So and then shifting from kind of natural sources or examples of natural sources to anthropogenic right are the ones that are synthetic,

143
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,300
that are for the most part produced by us as people.

144
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:45,570
So many industrial processes and products that are manufactured really too many to list things like mining and smelting

145
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:56,640
are long term sources of heavy metals that are now kind of ubiquitous throughout the atmosphere and our ecosystems.

146
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,330
The burning of fuels, especially fossil fuels. Right. Coal, it historically is a big one.

147
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:14,310
And what's produced through that process? CEO, CO2, Volatile Organic Compounds, S02, NOx.

148
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,060
It's a very, very long list.

149
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:26,030
A major, major contributor to many pollutants through the atmosphere as an environmental pathway, also a huge contributor to climate change.

150
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:31,260
Right. Greenhouse gases, smog, acid rain, various.

151
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:37,530
Talk to this and then, you know, that's kind of looking at the industrial products and processes,

152
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:47,040
energy production, but then shifting to consumer products, things like metals, bisphenol A, phthalates, parabens.

153
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,900
We're actually going to finish the class, period, watching a video.

154
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:57,240
This is another thing that I try to bring to the class as much as possible to break up you having to listen to me.

155
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,650
We can listen to some other people short ten, 15 minute videos.

156
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,060
But there's a really interesting one that kind of ties into today's class really well.

157
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,650
It's kind of an applied example of chemical exposures.

158
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:22,170
So I had a question previously on both sides said it was Mercury that I'm taking about the 30s and they want to burn off gas for the mercury.

159
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:39,840
Yeah, great. Great question. So with Mercury, it's it's a unique metal in that it can actually exist at a as a gas, as a vapor at ambient conditions.

160
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:49,710
And so I guess regardless of whether the source of the mercury is natural or anthropogenic, it can be present in soils.

161
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:56,970
And so trees, as part of their uptake of nutrients from the soil, pretty much take up whatever is there.

162
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:06,690
And so that includes mercury. And through a pretty interesting process where transpiration, trees breathing.

163
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,640
Right. Essentially, they actually release that mercury as vapor.

164
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,190
But anyway, there's a lot of mercury that's stored in leaves and so forth,

165
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:24,930
so that when during wildfires or forest fires, much of that mercury is also released.

166
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:37,740
Good question. Any other. Yeah, there's that one.

167
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:46,470
All right, so let's go ahead and move on to, uh, classifying chemicals by media.

168
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,050
So we might focus on exposure, right? Right.

169
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:59,340
This is something that's relatively tidy, we kind of went through the four different routes of exposure, ingestion being one.

170
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:04,920
Right. So we might classify chemicals that are present in food.

171
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:10,650
This might be things like in seafood. Again, mercury is a relevant example.

172
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:26,550
Different meats through livestock, through produce, fruits and vegetables from pesticide applications might be looking at things through water.

173
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:35,550
We've had already kind of lots of examples through air and then also through soil.

174
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:45,060
And then kind of going through, uh, there are so many for us to consider when we look at exposure pathways,

175
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:55,620
one being solvents, adhesives, glue's paints, dyes, coatings, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides.

176
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:04,350
And again, this is geared more towards, uh, kind of consumer products or industrial products that are manufactured purposely.

177
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:15,450
And then it through their application might be a way to kind of characterize and classify those types of chemicals.

178
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:25,860
Shifting gears to classifying chemicals by use and in order to best understand this, we need to clarify something.

179
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:35,550
We need to clarify and understand the difference between toxicity of chemical exposures and and hazardous chemical exposures as a hazard.

180
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:40,260
And so it is pretty well defined here on the slide. So for toxicity,

181
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:46,620
it can be considered an intrinsic property of a substance and it's evaluated with respect to a

182
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:54,750
target organism or site within an organism and the timeframe over which the toxic effect occurs,

183
00:22:54,750 --> 00:23:03,480
whereas a hazard is a function of that toxicity and the nature and intensity of exposure.

184
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:13,230
So a highly toxic material can actually represent a low hazard if there's a little or no potential exposure to that chemical.

185
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:20,820
So that's a really important distinction to use. And you'll hear those terms kind of thrown around, right?

186
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,540
Oh, it's a it's a chemical toxin. Oh, it's a it's a chemical hazard.

187
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:37,350
And like, it's kind of the same thing is really not. All right, so getting a little further into this by use as a classification scheme,

188
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:48,000
uh, conditions of use, so if it involves grinding, spraying, heating and so forth,

189
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,740
proximity to those processes, again, coming back to the physical state, whether something's a solid,

190
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:04,740
a liquid or just the gas or vapor, the form of it, if it's a finely divided solid.

191
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:10,890
We talked about particle size. Right. And what's respirable, what's inhalable and what's not.

192
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:19,800
And so a couple of things here at the bottom. We really need to consider the manner in which a material is being used in order to do

193
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:26,760
more to properly assess its potential for and its root of exposure for assessing a hazard.

194
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:34,260
And then importantly, and this is kind of like a veering a little bit off to the side from today's lecture on chemical hazards.

195
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:43,470
But more broadly, exposure assessment really needs to take place before you can move on to risk assessment.

196
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:47,760
And this just kind of related to the difference between toxicity and hazard.

197
00:24:47,760 --> 00:25:01,280
The toxicity is specific to just the chemical itself, but how hazardous it is brings in other factors in addition to the toxicity information.

198
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:08,550
Let's go ahead and shift now to mechanisms of action.

199
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:34,640
Speaking neurotoxicity.

200
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:47,660
So we might classify chemical exposures based on mechanisms of action, so chemicals that are, for example, cholinesterase inhibitors.

201
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:55,130
This includes organophosphate pesticides as well as carbon made pesticides.

202
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:59,690
We talked about methane being basically in asphyxiate so that there's a whole

203
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:05,330
class of chemicals that would fall into that category as simple as fixin's.

204
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:10,670
They might be irritants, they might be neuro toxicants.

205
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:19,100
So different ways of carcinogens, different ways to classify chemicals based on their mechanism of action.

206
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:34,550
In terms of adverse impact on human health, we might very definitively assign different chemicals by their impact on target organ sites.

207
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:38,060
For example, for lungs, we'd be concerned about asbestos.

208
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:53,450
We mentioned ozone, gas, silica for labor as a target organ site, aromatic amines, nitrogen compounds, arsenic in terms of central nervous system.

209
00:26:53,450 --> 00:27:04,610
And our brains were concerned about mercury, various volatile organic compounds in terms of our blood where things may end up residing.

210
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:14,600
We've discussed lead, zinc, benzene, so forth, various chemicals that we're concerned about with regards to skin,

211
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:23,920
those for our kidneys, cadmium and arsenic and then reproductive organs.

212
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:39,640
All right, so now moving on to our last two in terms of chemical classification, go ahead and start with environmental properties.

213
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:47,980
So there's a whole class of compounds that are classified as persistent organic pollutants,

214
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:54,730
so A, we've already kind of said defined them as organic, right, to abide by nature.

215
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,530
They're organic.

216
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:09,190
But beyond that, these are chemicals that generally don't break down and basically get recycled and recycled throughout various spheres,

217
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:17,200
different spheres of our ecosystem, through the terrestrial environment, through aquatic environments, through the atmosphere.

218
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:24,430
And so they just continue to move around, but we never actually get rid of them.

219
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:30,860
Heavy metals is absolutely a group of chemicals that we're concerned about.

220
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:36,670
It can be classified by their environmental properties, greenhouse gases.

221
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:41,860
Right. Is another kind of environmental property characterization.

222
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:52,000
Anything that contributes to a warming of the Earth's atmosphere, carbon dioxide, methane, so forth.

223
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,840
And we talked about a couple of examples of chemicals that produce ozone.

224
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:01,960
Right. So that might be one way to classify based on their environmental properties as they serve as precursors,

225
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:13,180
even though they themselves may not be terribly harmful in terms of direct exposure to people.

226
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:21,460
What they produce or what they contribute then causes it downstream adverse impacts so similar to greenhouse gases.

227
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,510
So there's ozone producers, which we're concerned about,

228
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:33,310
the lower layers of the atmosphere right where where we live and work and play along the surface of the earth.

229
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:38,170
In contrast to that, we actually want ozone further up in the atmosphere,

230
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:45,610
in the stratosphere where it served as a protective layer to filter out harmful ultraviolet light.

231
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:50,980
So there are different chemicals that are classified as ozone depleting rates

232
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,390
so that when released they may be inert in lower levels of the atmosphere.

233
00:29:55,390 --> 00:30:04,360
But once they get high enough up into the stratosphere, those chemicals are exposed to different wavelengths of light from the sun,

234
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:15,040
which triggers photochemical or light based atmospheric reactions that then lead to depletion of the ozone in the stratosphere.

235
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:26,140
And then those that are like acid rain producers to sulfur dioxide emissions and nitrogen oxide emissions would fit into that category.

236
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:32,230
Any questions? All right.

237
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:49,030
And then moving on to our last scheme is physical chemical properties, so there's within the air we're concerned about whether something is a gas,

238
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:57,580
a vapor or an aerosol based on that property is going to impact how it behaves within that environmental pathway.

239
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:06,670
Right. And it's going to be an important characteristic to understand what the potential hazard is in terms of exposure to people.

240
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:10,390
Similarly, in water is the chemical ionic.

241
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:17,450
Is it neutral? Does it dissolve or is it suspended for four soils again?

242
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:21,470
Is it a gas or a solid? Is it bioavailable?

243
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:26,500
This ends up being really important. General characteristics, right?

244
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,240
Is it a metal versus is it organic compound inorganic? What's its reactivity?

245
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:38,980
Its volatility, its solubility? Is it radioactive? Is it alive?

246
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:47,320
And of course, toxicity. Things like h ionic strength, these partitioning.

247
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:54,100
So some chemicals actually easily move between phases.

248
00:31:54,100 --> 00:32:03,170
So you might have chemicals in a certain form that exist to the gas, but then it can transition into a particulate or a solid and vice versa.

249
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:07,870
It can exist in a solid, but then it can volatilized into a gas.

250
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:13,180
These are important characteristics to know and understand in order to be able to

251
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:22,030
predict where and when a particular chemical might be a risk for for exposure.

252
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:30,340
All right, so I promised we would touch on this and, oh, the slide doesn't look right.

253
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,970
What is this? Does anybody have the PowerPoint pulled out by chance?

254
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:40,150
Does it look like that in the PowerPoint, too? Oh, good. OK, excellent. Uh, yeah.

255
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:52,480
So this very simplified equation here, uh, illustrates what it's meant by biological haploid.

256
00:32:52,480 --> 00:33:05,650
Right. So it describes the reduction in body burden of a chemical pollutant according to first order elimination kinetics.

257
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:21,520
So this is the key information actually down here where we have the amount of material remaining at time t since the exposure ended.

258
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,660
So you're exposed. There's some uptake in our body.

259
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,190
And then how long does it last in our body once the exposure is done?

260
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:48,730
And half life is an expression of how long it takes for that pollutant to be removed from our body, and it's usually expressed in units of per time.

261
00:33:48,730 --> 00:34:00,640
So we have like grams per kilogram of body weight per time, for example, per hour.

262
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:08,590
So this is really important information to know about chemicals there, biological Hathway,

263
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:19,630
and it's really informative for them how we approach assessing exposure, where we would be concerned about particular chemicals in relation to this.

264
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:26,530
So two different kind of contrasting examples for chemicals with long half lives.

265
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:33,850
There's a tendency for that chemical, especially upon repeated exposure to accumulate in the body.

266
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:40,720
Right. So that the long term average exposure from an exposure assessment perspective is probably

267
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:48,340
a better indicator of what impact there might be or risk for adverse health effects.

268
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:57,580
Kind of. In contrast, compounds with a short Half-Life don't really accumulate in our bodies.

269
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:05,080
They are metabolized or otherwise quickly eliminated through processes.

270
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:12,130
And so it's really short term changes in concentrations or in exposure would be more

271
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:19,420
relevant to be able to characterize and understand in terms of potential toxic effects.

272
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:27,500
And so in those cases, we would have to measure it on a short term timescale.

273
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:36,080
Any questions about the concept of halflife? All right.

274
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:44,900
Let's go. We're cruising through that. Let's go ahead and shift gears, and I'm going to have us watch this video.

275
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:51,470
I did a quick little you got a question or a question about how sure I was be wrong.

276
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:56,210
But this is very the. Let's take a look here.

277
00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:02,980
At issue and tell lies dormant until you burn that had been exposed.

278
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:09,530
So that sense to be a long term or short short term reside certainly long term.

279
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:14,240
But then what is exposed by the short term impact?

280
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,260
Yeah, and that's that's a great question. And it complicates things.

281
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:26,420
Right. But yeah, in terms of its definition, it's really the burden within our bodies.

282
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,410
And and it's not the only example where where that's complicated.

283
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:37,760
Right. Where things, uh, different chemicals can be can be stored and, uh,

284
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:49,100
through different stages of life or diagonally or whatever it is over time when exposure when you start looking at like a target organ,

285
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:55,580
for example, or the impact on health symptomatically can still change.

286
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:01,010
Right. Even without new exposures taking place.

287
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:07,190
Great question. But for the most part, you have and we're looking at halflife as a characteristic.

288
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:14,840
It's it's one it's in our body. And how long is it retained and not not looking too much further beyond that.

289
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:24,800
Any other questions that we thought was a great one? All right.

290
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,490
So, yeah, I want to have us take a few minutes and watch this video.

291
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:33,710
I think it's maybe 15, 20 minutes long.

292
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:44,660
It's a TED talk. And it's Dr. Arlene Blum who directs the Green Science Policy Institute.

293
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:56,300
She's talking about policy and mitigation and intervention, but she's, I think, pretty much a biochemist and a scientist and a researcher.

294
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:07,850
And so she's talking about her research related to classifications of chemicals, large groups of chemicals and their impact on our health.

295
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:16,250
And I tend to talk quite a bit in my examples about industrial processes.

296
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:24,050
Right. As as sources of contaminants, especially chemicals at risk for for exposure and impact on health.

297
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:32,660
This is a great example. More around consumer products and where we might be exposed to different different chemicals.

298
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,530
So I'll go ahead and pull that up and play it.

299
00:38:36,530 --> 00:39:12,240
I did a quick test before class. I think our our tech is ready in the classroom in terms of sound, out of the speakers and so forth.

300
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:20,040
I am a chemist and a mountain climber and the executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute in Berkeley,

301
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:26,340
California, and honored to be a board member for the Plastic Pollution Coalition.

302
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:31,680
And I want to tell you about yet another problem about plastic,

303
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:38,190
something that's not so well known, is extremely threatening to our health and well-being,

304
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:50,700
and that is the toxic flame retardants used in plastic and foam in our furniture, our electronics and other common everyday products.

305
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:55,770
But the good news is that this is a problem that we can solve.

306
00:39:55,770 --> 00:40:02,370
So let me ask you, how many of you believe if a chemical is in your toothpaste or your shampoo,

307
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:10,230
someone is making sure that that chemical that there are no cancer causing or hazardous chemicals in those products?

308
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:14,400
How many think somebody is paying attention?

309
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,700
Not very many people here knowledge knowledgeable audience and how many think that there can be chemicals in

310
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:28,800
everyday products that are known to cause serious harm and no one has the authority to do anything about it.

311
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,220
You are very knowledgeable and you're right.

312
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:44,790
The sad fact is in America, foods, drugs and pesticides are regulated before they go into products and for all other chemicals, there's no regulation.

313
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:52,290
So we can know that there are serious problems with a chemical and they can end up in our consumer products.

314
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:56,370
I'm a chemist. I study molecules called organo halogens.

315
00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:02,580
Organo means carbon halogens or bromine fluorine chlorine iodine.

316
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:09,620
The bond between carbon and a halogen is a very, very strong bond, very long lived.

317
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:19,110
So organo halogens go into our bodies. They stay for weeks, months, years, the rest of our lives, and they can cause health problems.

318
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:32,820
An example of Nagano halogen is this ad from the 50s of DDT wallpaper.

319
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,740
The pesticide DDT is in Marcano halogen.

320
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:41,040
A number of the pesticides like DDT that were banned in the 80s.

321
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:50,190
And this mother thinks she's doing a good deed for her daughter by putting DDT wallpaper in the nursery, protecting her from mosquitoes.

322
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:55,410
But what she doesn't know is the new research result from UC Berkeley that young

323
00:41:55,410 --> 00:42:03,660
girls exposed to DETI high levels have a five times greater risk of breast cancer.

324
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:08,640
These girls were exposed in the 50s and 60s. Now, decades later,

325
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:22,230
we have this research result in the same chemical family as DDT and the organo halogen pesticides are the organo halogen flame retardants,

326
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:25,650
their chemical cousins. In some cases they're the same thing.

327
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:32,220
Pesticides and flame retardants are the same molecules. So I first got interested in flame retardants.

328
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:40,260
Back in the 70s, I heard about a flame retardant called brominated Tristes that was being used in all kids pajamas.

329
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:46,800
In those days, five to 10 percent of the weight of the pajamas was this organo halogen flame retardant.

330
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,790
We tested it. We found it was a mutagen. It changed.

331
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:55,260
The DNA of living organisms was likely to cause cancer.

332
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:01,710
We found a child who never wore interest's pajamas, which wasn't so easy, put her in his pajamas.

333
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:06,510
The next morning, there were Trist breakdown products in her urine.

334
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:12,240
That means that chemicals go into our bodies from our clothing just as though we were eating them.

335
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,120
But there's no regulation from the government.

336
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:25,890
So being a scientist, we wrote a paper in science, a lead article we called for to stop the use of Tristes in kids pajamas.

337
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:38,410
And that was January 1977. Three months later, the Consumer Product Safety Commission banned Trist.

338
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:43,510
So if any of you were kids in the 70s and 80s, some of you were, you only worked just for a year or two.

339
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:50,980
Sounds like a good idea. So when brominated Trescott got band, what do you think the substitute was?

340
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:57,040
We always like to keep our industrial processes similar. Similar the substitute with chlorinated Tristes.

341
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,610
So we did more studies, coronate trips with the mutagen.

342
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:05,210
We wrote another paper. It was also removed from kids' pajamas.

343
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:13,390
But the sad news is today chlorinate interest is back in our furniture from it's in baby

344
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:19,900
products at levels up to 10 percent of the weight of foam in our furniture and baby products.

345
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:29,800
And why is that? Because of a unique California furniture flammability standard called Technical Bulletin one one seven.

346
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:38,680
And I ask you to remember that when you go home, look under your chair at the center cushion of your couch and you may see him notice,

347
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:46,690
like the one on the slide that your couch or your chair complies with technical bulletin one one seven.

348
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:52,810
And that means it's very likely to be treated with an organo halogen flame retardant.

349
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:59,840
So what are the health problems with these chemicals where there's a whole industry of scientists studying these chemicals?

350
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:04,780
Hundreds of scientists get together at meetings, present peer reviewed papers.

351
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:11,570
And what they have found in animal studies is these chemicals are endocrine disruptors.

352
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:21,970
They cause scrambling of brain development, hyperactivity, neurological impairments, their reproductive toxins in both males and females.

353
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:30,100
So males have lower sperm counts, females have lower ovarian follicle follicles, takes longer to become pregnant.

354
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:36,550
They impact thyroid levels and they cause cancer. This is in many, many hundreds of animal studies.

355
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:42,010
And now, sadly enough, in the last couple of years, refinding human studies with the same result.

356
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:48,100
And it's pretty unusual to find human health results on chemicals that are industrial.

357
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:57,550
We are exposed to so many chemicals, we move around a lot, but usually it's just industrial chemicals like Gustus where we can find health results.

358
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:00,820
But because these flame retardants were used at our furniture,

359
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:06,940
since the standard was passed in the 70s and used at levels of five percent of the way to the farm,

360
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:13,180
so we can have pounds of these, again, halogen flame retardants in our homes,

361
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:18,520
we are finding in humans, not surprisingly, very similar results as in animals.

362
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:25,060
So a new study at UC Berkeley showed that women with higher levels take twice as long to become pregnant.

363
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:33,670
A Columbia University study showed that infants at birth having higher levels have four to six less IQ points at age four.

364
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:43,150
So. So how did the chemicals get into us?

365
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:47,320
Their semi volatile? They migrate out of products. They're heavy.

366
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:53,500
They drop into dust. We have dust on our hands, maybe eat a French fry.

367
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:58,210
They go into our bodies and they stay there lipophilic, fat loving.

368
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:03,040
So they stay in our fat. They stay in breast milk. Sadly enough,

369
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:09,790
a number of studies show that children have three to four times the level of their mothers because they get the same level as their mother.

370
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:14,950
Through the placenta, they get a second dose from breast milk.

371
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:18,760
American mothers breast milk has record levels of flame retardants,

372
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:24,340
and then toddlers with hand-to-mouth behavior get more flame retardants in their bodies.

373
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:32,260
And this is at the time of reproductive and brain development time where you do not want exposure to such chemicals.

374
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:36,220
The highest levels are in cats because they're in the dust. They like their fur.

375
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,900
They have levels one hundred to a thousand times higher than humans. So that's my cat.

376
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:46,340
Midnight and midnight went from being a 15 pound cat to a five pound cat.

377
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:50,500
The vet diagnosed hypothyroid disease had that disease had never existed.

378
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:58,270
And there was now a mysterious epidemic of hypothyroid disease. I thought it was a chemical and I thought, that's interesting.

379
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:08,770
Pentair that flame retardant we have used by the panta was used 98 percent of the use was in mostly California and in North America,

380
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:13,180
other places where furniture manufacturers followed the California standard.

381
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:18,250
I thought, I wonder if it could be Pantech because it causes thyroid problems in mice,

382
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:24,700
rats, kestrels, frogs and tenter workers have higher incidences of thyroid problems.

383
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:33,280
So we sent a sample of our house Dust and Midnight's Blood to a veterinary epidemiologist in Illinois.

384
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,210
The results came back that our house dust and with.

385
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:42,480
Blood with the highest level they've ever measured in this toxic flame retardant,

386
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:51,130
not because it was an Illinois study and we lived in California, so I checked my furniture and everything in my house was five percent Panopto.

387
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:55,860
So that's my couch. And you see it went into the dumpster.

388
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:07,830
But where is away? There are studies that show pentathletes, leaches out of landfills and dust with Panopto ends up in sewage treatment plants.

389
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:17,880
And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration did a study looking for Panta around our coast and found that everywhere there were cities,

390
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:23,340
there were high levels of Mahanta in sediments and bivalves, which is the bottom of the marine food chain.

391
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:30,090
So it builds up from the seven bivalves to the small fish, the large fish bioaccumulate.

392
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:38,550
So when it comes to chemicals like Panta, where one world there are high levels at the North Pole in the South Pole because of the currents.

393
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:45,150
When you look in animals, you see it in Tasmanian devils near the South Pole, polar bears near the North Pole.

394
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:53,640
98 percent of this chemical was used in North America primarily to meet our California furniture flammability standard.

395
00:49:53,640 --> 00:50:00,960
Killer whales have very high levels. The highest levels ever recorded are marine mammals off the coast of California.

396
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:07,290
A recent paper on killer whales was entitled Flame Retardant Killer Whales because their levels are so high.

397
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:14,250
Killer whales do not need flame retardants. So is there a fire safety benefit?

398
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:18,540
And the answer is no. Can you believe that?

399
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:26,820
So the graph on the left, if you compare some them in blue with out of flame retardant and the one with red on the right with the flame retardant,

400
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:32,170
it takes three more seconds. The flame retardant makes your foam burn three seconds more slowly.

401
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:36,360
You get three more seconds. But then there's fire toxicity.

402
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:45,720
When you compare with and without flame retardant, you get twice as much smoke, six times as much carbon monoxide and 90 times as much.

403
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,730
What do you think kills you in a fire?

404
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:55,590
You're in a hotel room, you smell smoke, you open the door, there's smoke close to the door, you die, carbon monoxide gets you.

405
00:50:55,590 --> 00:51:00,450
So this is what we get for putting content in our furniture. So we don't want this right.

406
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:05,430
Let's change the law. So for four years, I have supported our group.

407
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:12,990
Green Science Policy Institute has supported legislation in Sacramento for a flammability standard that would provide more fire safety,

408
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:14,880
a flammability standard for fabric,

409
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:23,520
because what burns first fabric that would not use toxic chemicals and the result was a marketing campaign from the chemical industry.

410
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,990
Maybe some of you remember full page ads in the papers, radio, TV,

411
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:38,220
glossy mailers all paid for by a front group called Californians for Fire Safety, who are the three companies that manufacture the chemicals.

412
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:44,550
Now, this might sound a little discouraging, but I don't seem discouraged because we've actually had many, many successes.

413
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:53,940
It's only three companies. They can change their business model, move to greener chemicals, use biomimicry and find other kinds of flame retardants.

414
00:51:53,940 --> 00:52:02,100
On some of our successes is there was going to be a similar flammability standard for pillows, mattress covers, those memory phones we all love.

415
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:05,100
All of those are going to have to resist a candle flame.

416
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:11,730
But when we brought good science into the decision process at the last minute, the standard was suspended.

417
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:21,680
So your pillows, your memory foam, they're all safe. Another important area is green building.

418
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:28,040
You may not realize this, but the materials that often make green buildings energy efficient are plastic

419
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:32,900
installations that are treated with some of the most toxic flame retardants.

420
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:38,060
And that when green builders know about this, they can make other choices.

421
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:46,400
A friend in Berkeley, an architect, had designed the supposedly the greenest visitor center ever in Yosemite Valley.

422
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:52,790
It was going to be covered in polystyrene, which is a plastic insulation with one of the worst flame retardants.

423
00:52:52,790 --> 00:53:00,690
He heard about the problem and instead he substituted mineral water, which is fired with assaulted rock for the plastic polystyrene.

424
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:06,900
And that's our new visitor center in Yosemite. So now you're supposed to hear something new.

425
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:11,420
I'm going to share with you something that nobody knows. It's the result of a new study we've done.

426
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:18,320
We've looked at 100 baby products. And the bad news is that 80 of them have toxic flame retardants.

427
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,700
The nursing Kallo with the organic cotton cover is 10 percent chlorinated.

428
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:27,740
Tristes, a third of these products have chlorinated Tristes in them.

429
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:31,370
But with this information, parents can make different choices.

430
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:33,380
Our papers going to be peer reviewed.

431
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:40,370
It's going to come out in a few months and we hope this will reach parents just the way the children from the information reach parents.

432
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:51,480
They'll demand safer products. And I actually feel optimistic that children can be safe both in their pajamas and sitting on couches.

433
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:56,480
So I think the toxic chemical problem is solvable with information.

434
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,130
Consumers can make better choices. Builders and architects can make better choices.

435
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:09,410
We can support new regulations that will give us more fire safety without toxicity and very important.

436
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:11,870
Right now in D.C.,

437
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:21,590
we have legislation for chemical reform to give our government the authority to protect us not only from toxic flame retardants in plastics,

438
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:27,100
but from a whole range of toxic chemicals that are adversely impacting our health.

439
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:31,730
So I think this is a moment that we can succeed and we can have a healthier world.

440
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:55,690
Thank you. All right, so great, Tejon, right?

441
00:54:55,690 --> 00:55:03,640
Super important, super informative, highly relevant to this class, but even well beyond this class,

442
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:10,540
they wanted to spend a few minutes reflecting on the video from two different perspectives.

443
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:17,740
First, let's go ahead and start with with today's lecture and what many of the things that she she talked about in that,

444
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:20,380
you know, relatively brief TED talk.

445
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:27,640
And once we finish that, we can actually talk about the topic of the video, which is also, you know, pretty important.

446
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:33,520
So I'm going to step through each of these and prompt you, uh,

447
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:41,170
to identify where in the video you recall her kind of addressing it from a chemical classification scheme.

448
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:55,590
So starting up here at the top, by nature, did she speak about the chemical of concern in terms of nature as a scheme?

449
00:55:55,590 --> 00:56:01,410
She did what was what did she used to classify it, intelligence and yeah,

450
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:11,340
so she I think Organo halogens was what she started with as a as a chemical classifications doing so by the nature of the chemical.

451
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:15,510
What about my source anthropogenic. Absolutely right.

452
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:25,890
So she talked about chemicals being manufactured, produce to be used as flame retardants and so forth, the industries that kind of promote this.

453
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:36,220
What about buying medium? And yeah, so she she talked very specifically about how people are exposed,

454
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:42,400
what that route of exposure is, and it's primarily through ingestion, right.

455
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,600
The the example of the children's pajamas. Right.

456
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:52,750
This is stuff that it's like something is 10 percent like body weight.

457
00:56:52,750 --> 00:57:01,420
That's it just blows my mind, right. That you have, you know, a garment or a piece of furniture or whatever it is recovering.

458
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:06,400
And by weight, it's 10 percent this this toxic flame retardant chemical.

459
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:14,890
Wow. Right. So, you know, it's not just necessarily that the child is like, you know, sucking on the pajamas or chewing on them or something.

460
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:18,200
It's that it comes off and it's all over in the bedding. Right.

461
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,160
So as the child rolls around and sleeps, it's on everything.

462
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:33,390
And so as they especially as they put their hands to their mouths, uh, what about my manner of of use, its mothers and children.

463
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:40,630
Right. So she did a really great job of like speaking specifically to like kind of who's the the subpopulation

464
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:48,370
that we're concerned about with regards to exposure and how are they interacting with these products.

465
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:56,850
What about the mechanism of action? They kind of lot of detractors.

466
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:01,470
Yeah, she talked very specifically about endocrine disruptors. That's a great example.

467
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:10,800
Were there any other Shadowlands the agenda? Right. So she talked about the cancer causing capacity of these flame retardants.

468
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:22,930
Excellent. What about by which you classify things based on their environmental properties, like how they behave in the environment?

469
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:31,820
It kind of starts out here first cumulate, so bioaccumulate ratio's, he talked about, I think it was towards the end of the video, right,

470
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:37,580
that no one had done these tests on coastal environments and found it the present

471
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:42,770
in the sediment and in the bivalves and then bio accumulating up the food chain.

472
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:51,200
Yeah, lipophilic. Lipophilic, right. So she talked about the fat soluble characteristics of them.

473
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:57,310
And then did you have one child? She OK, same answer. Any other.

474
00:58:57,310 --> 00:59:13,340
All right, great. And then the last one, did you talk about physical chemical properties, uh, these chemicals?

475
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:20,080
He went to great voice, but I don't know. That was that's a good one.

476
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:29,120
Yeah, absolutely. When she at the end, when she's talking about the the candle flame standard and when they're burned.

477
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:33,140
Right. That they're they're producing a set that leads to exposure. Yeah.

478
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:43,740
She said right. So related to combustion, the production of the soot also produced in the CO2.

479
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:48,390
I'm sorry, CEO. All right, great.

480
00:59:48,390 --> 01:00:00,130
So I again, for many reasons, it's it's a great video, but it just in my mind, it just struck me as being totally relevant.

481
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:06,750
Right. A great example. Just within 15 minutes of a real world application of kind of highlighting all

482
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:11,490
of these different approaches in terms of chemical classification schemes. All right.

483
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:23,310
Now, let's shift gears and talk actually for a few minutes about the video itself so I can give a couple of updates.

484
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:28,380
The lecture is from 2011, so it's a little bit dated.

485
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:33,330
So the updates are, for the most part, good.

486
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:47,670
The work that she was mentioning there at the end did lead to an update of that standard in 2013 that became effective at the beginning of 2015.

487
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:58,230
And then even better news in 2018, these products were banned in California.

488
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:02,310
It became effective at the beginning of last year. Twenty, twenty.

489
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:15,270
So these flame retardants are now regulated in their presence, specific to baby products, to furniture and so forth.

490
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:22,980
You have question standards, but it's one hundred seventeen like California.

491
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:31,170
Yes. So it's actually modified so that the 117 was amended and updated and they just end the year.

492
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:40,460
So it was to 2017. 2013 was the first update and now the current one is 117 deaths.

493
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:48,690
Twenty eighteen, which is the one that describes that these are now banned in these particular consumer products.

494
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:52,260
So they're banned just in California. Excellent question.

495
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:57,000
So that was where I was going to go next. So she she kind of hinted I'm not sure if people caught it.

496
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:03,540
She didn't believe her at that point. But California.

497
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:14,280
Right. And there was a rational basis behind establishing this T 179 standard in the first place was from a fire safety perspective.

498
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:20,400
Right. That, hey, this stuff burns. People get trapped in their homes, people die.

499
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,520
You know, fire safety is a real issue.

500
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:33,900
And so by applying a flame retardant to many of these consumer products, especially those that are used at home, especially around children.

501
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:42,370
Right. The whole pajama thing, um, that we could save lives, that less people would die from fires.

502
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:45,990
And California is really big right now.

503
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:52,110
I don't know. It's like 40 million people, right. As a population. So from an industry perspective,

504
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:58,650
it often costs more for a company to make just the furniture to sell in California

505
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:03,390
versus making the furniture to sell throughout the rest of the country.

506
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:12,840
Right. Or, you know, children's pajamas, like you name it. So much of the industry adopted California's ruling as part of the process.

507
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:27,220
And so throughout much of the country, these became like the norm, having many of our products with with flame retardants applied to them.

508
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:37,840
Uh. There's only a couple of states that really even begin to address it at their own state level,

509
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:42,190
think Massachusetts is on its way to addressing it currently.

510
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:47,680
Um, but for the most part, the hope is that it's going to slowly unwind.

511
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:57,070
Right. That has an industry if you make furniture, if you make children pajamas, et cetera, that, you know, now they're banned in California.

512
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:04,180
So let's, uh, not not apply them in our our manufacturing process at all.

513
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:10,060
Um, to address your question, I'm trying to remember the dead.

514
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:17,260
OK, OK. Uh, let's see what else do they want to put any questions that folks have,

515
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:26,720
anything that struck you or comments from the video that you want to share or a book called Over and touch on something like that.

516
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:35,230
Or was there a lot of it like the early reason there was a lot of try Jambos and push for that kind of based on junk science where,

517
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:44,380
you know, the doctor worked with the Bromine Association or gave some kind of strange conflict of interest, which basically falsified some.

518
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:50,290
I mean, there are definitely horrible stories of fires and kids, all kind of stuff.

519
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:57,790
But they actually went to Congress and invented some statistics and lot of stories about like kids burning to death,

520
01:04:57,790 --> 01:05:01,480
which is obviously very and which kind of pushed the beginning.

521
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:08,890
And it kind of goes to show, like all the trade associations, like the biggest goal they could possibly have to get,

522
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:18,880
like they're basically mandated purchasing contract law by saying, like, hey, we had a product being divisive at state level.

523
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:24,820
Okay. This sounds like the broken industry, particularly, I guess, because, like you mentioned, there's like four companies.

524
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:35,260
But what happens in terms of not being so complicated and so crazy that like I mean, like the patients who are just like,

525
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:42,220
sure, they get money, but they're also everything that's wrong with someone playing.

526
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:45,700
Yeah, yeah, no, absolutely, and this is, you know, great point.

527
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:50,230
Thank you so much, Josh and I.

528
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:57,400
I do want to interject as much relevant application of this stuff we're talking about in class.

529
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,850
I will not stop doing that, you know, throughout the whole course of the semester.

530
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:07,000
That's the reason for the exposure, science and the news. Right. And where I can and lectures, I'll try to interject.

531
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,290
Right. We're learning the nuts and bolts of things, but what are some of the issues?

532
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:18,940
And very quickly, I think I mentioned on the first day of class that we're talking about exposure, science.

533
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:22,480
Much of the work is identifying bad stuff. Right.

534
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:30,640
That has adverse impacts on people, but a big part of exposure science is coming up with solutions.

535
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,220
Right. And we'll we'll talk about this as we go through the semester.

536
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:41,830
What are the opportunities to either get rid of the sources of the of the agents or the stressors in the first place?

537
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:49,690
But if that's not possible, somewhere along that exposure science model, how do we prevent exposure from taking place?

538
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:55,970
And there are various, you know, mitigation opportunities throughout. And so I want to try to bring this up.

539
01:06:55,970 --> 01:07:03,700
So so policies of standards, policy and regulation or a huge part, that's not the focus of this course.

540
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,310
I actually teach a course on environmental health and policy.

541
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:12,040
So if this stuff is interesting to you, it's a winter term advertising for my classes already.

542
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:18,460
It's a winter term course to credits Tuesday, early afternoons.

543
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:24,250
But anyway, it's I'm very passionate about it. I do this work on on air quality and health.

544
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:34,420
Right. But the whole purpose is to be able to identify opportunities for improving mitigation and reducing exposures.

545
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:39,610
And this is really kind of the theme of all of what we do with an exposure science.

546
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:45,800
And you see it clearly in this in this video through Dr. Bloom's efforts.

547
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:51,090
Any other comments or questions about this? I have a comment.

548
01:07:51,090 --> 01:08:05,510
Yeah, even now, if you trying to buy pajamas for kids and specifically a nightgown, you cannot find an organic cotton nightgown for any age.

549
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:12,530
And unless it's on Etsy and somebody made it by hand. But anything that's sold through, like a commercial outlet,

550
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:20,270
you can't because what I read is that they still require these flame retardants to be and I don't know what they're using now,

551
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:25,580
but for like a set, like a top and a bottom, you can and that's because they're fitted clothing.

552
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:31,400
So that somehow meets flame retardant standards, I guess put forward.

553
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:40,340
But just I mean, probably what she said, would you just replace bromine with chlorine or some similar substitution and.

554
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:45,230
That's what they've done, I guess I haven't looked into it that much. Yeah, thank you, Melissa.

555
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:51,800
That's a great a great comment. And it is that's and it's not just in this instance.

556
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:56,180
I mean, she actually kind of prefaced her statement by saying, like, as we usually do.

557
01:08:56,180 --> 01:09:01,070
Right. As a society, we don't make a huge leap when we're trying to come up with a solution.

558
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:03,480
We just barely can modify what we have. Right.

559
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:11,390
Like let's keep it with the known as much as possible and modify it as as little as possible as as an alternative.

560
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:17,480
And this is absolutely the case with this. Right. And it's continuing to evolve.

561
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:28,580
It's also challenging to manage because most of what's produced doesn't it is not within the U.S. rights to a lot of the you know,

562
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:34,340
the mass production of clothing and so forth is coming from from other countries.

563
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:43,970
And so where it's made and distributed is not just, you know, coming to the U.S. So there are there are other factors involved there.

564
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:49,550
It's one thing to talk about an industry that's producing something within the U.S. preprimary,

565
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:55,550
just primarily being distributed within the U.S. It really changes the dynamics.

566
01:09:55,550 --> 01:10:04,400
And an international environmental health policy is hugely fascinating and hugely frustrating at the same time,

567
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:10,310
because these types of issues are everywhere. Great, great comment.

568
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:23,430
Thank you so much. So exposure of a consumer bought a good or like the planet itself, where there's like people slaving away stuff.

569
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:32,700
Excellent, excellent question. So Caitlin is asking and I was reminded I should be repeating things into the microphone, repeating questions,

570
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:39,240
because I don't think it picks up from you all for people that are watching the recordings.

571
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:47,880
So great question. So we're not just concerned about consumers right in this story.

572
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:56,820
We're concerned about the workplace. So if you think if we think I definitely think 10 percent, you know,

573
01:10:56,820 --> 01:11:03,690
in children's pajamas by weight is a huge amount of a chemical flame retardant to be exposed to.

574
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:08,740
The child wears those pajamas for X number of hours per day.

575
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:16,830
The residues in the bedding remains for who knows how many days before it's washed or whatever.

576
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:26,100
What about the workers that manufacture this stuff, distribute this stuff, handle this stuff as as an occupation for very,

577
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:39,000
very long time periods and at almost in almost all cases occupationally in occupational settings, at much higher concentrations of exposure.

578
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,660
Fantastic question. And yes, we would absolutely be concerned.

579
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:50,220
Right. For if you work in the furniture industry and you're on a production floor.

580
01:11:50,220 --> 01:12:03,600
Right. Applying this stuff, I mean, it actually happens that simply so huge opportunities for exposure to very, very high concentrations.

581
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:10,450
Any other thoughts? Try to think of any other background that I know about the topic that I can fill you in on.

582
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:16,500
There's one this is kind of a I don't know.

583
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:30,960
It's amazing to me. It's really a side note. But there was actually a study in Sweden back in, I don't know, even the 1970s.

584
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:41,850
And it was it characterized the number of fires from television sets.

585
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:49,290
And somehow there was like in Sweden, apparently there was a high number of fires caused from television sets.

586
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:57,810
And that was the genesis of treating electronics with with fire retardant chemicals.

587
01:12:57,810 --> 01:13:06,240
So, you know, all of your laptops are phones. You know, this desktop here, they're all laden with with fire retardant.

588
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:12,810
And and so this was the related to electronics, consumer electronics.

589
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:20,340
It was basically that single study that came out of Sweden that got the ball rolling and hay industries and so forth.

590
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:26,790
And we need to make all this stuff and we need to apply it. You know, years later, after after analyzing it,

591
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:33,720
the study was actually seen as an anomaly when you compared the rate of television sets in Sweden during

592
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:38,520
these particular time period and then looked more broadly at not just other countries in Europe,

593
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:46,800
but, you know, other continents. It wasn't happening. So it was kind of coming back to like Jostens examples, a little bit of a farce, really.

594
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:52,740
It was some convenient data for somebody to to kind of make a lot of money, an opportunity to profit.

595
01:13:52,740 --> 01:14:01,320
And so we now we still have flame retardants throughout many of our consumer electronic products that could

596
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:08,790
go wrong with that kind of burn cigaret companies kind of involved in making cigarets from everybody else.

597
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:12,210
Sure. Yeah, great point.

598
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:23,100
Josh is mentioning cigarets in the tobacco industry that perhaps rightly or perhaps accurately was was blamed for some number of fires.

599
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:28,680
Right. For burning cigaret. And so if you can point to something else, you know, that's that's the problem.

600
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:37,990
Hey, that that's a convenient, convenient observation.

601
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:48,750
Any other comments or questions? All right, well, I think that was that was it for my agenda for getting through material today.

602
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:55,020
Yeah, we're we're done early again. Uh, thank you so much for your attention, your engagement.

603
01:14:55,020 --> 01:15:04,426
Have a great rest of your Thursday and have a nice weekend.
