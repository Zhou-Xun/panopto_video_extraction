1
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,831
Call a company investing in pharmaceutical
research, we'd call them a sucker.

2
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:47,140
Knowledge is a public good.

3
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,454
Even if a company is good
at keeping its secrets,

4
00:04:49,454 --> 00:04:53,240
a competitor could analyze a pill and
figure out what's in it.

5
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,743
This creates an incentive to hope
somebody else invests in R&D,

6
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:58,851
while you wait to steal the successes.

7
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,986
Similarly, small countries have
an incentive to negotiate low prices,

8
00:05:03,986 --> 00:05:07,740
while free riding on research
done in large countries.

9
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,476
Therefore, the public good nature of
knowledge reduces incentives to invest in

10
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:14,851
R&D, leading to too few discoveries.

11
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,477
A patent is a legal barrier to entry that
creates monopoly power for the holder,

12
00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:23,540
restoring incentives to invest in R&D.

13
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,904
So adding a second source of
market failure, monopoly power,

14
00:05:26,904 --> 00:05:31,282
mitigates the potential damage from the
first source of market failure the public

15
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:32,751
good nature of knowledge.

16
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,000
In this case,
monopoly power might not be bad.

17
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,240
Our monopolist villain turns into a hero.

18
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,936
However, the high resulting prices reduce
use below the socially optimal level.

19
00:05:44,936 --> 00:05:47,705
Pills can be produced at
low marginal cost, but

20
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:50,761
are marked up by the profit
maximizing monopolist.

21
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,229
The second market failure
helped mitigate the first, but

22
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,731
it created a problem of its own
under use of the valuable drug.

23
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:02,310
Our hero again turns into a villain.

24
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,600
Enter another economic villain.

25
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,361
Insurance making care seem artificially
cheap, thereby inducing moral hazard.

26
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,644
But wait, the monopolist has
made care too expensive,

27
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:17,340
and uninsured consumers would
use the drug too little.

28
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,860
Insurance offsets the monopoly markup, and

29
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,234
may bring the patients out of pocket price
more in line with marginal cost, and

30
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:28,161
actually get us closer to the socially
optimal level of consumption.

31
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,640
So three market failures
can be better than two.

32
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,320
We have, however, created a world in which
insurance premiums will need to be high to

33
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,040
pay the monopolist high prices.

34
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,324
Insurance often uses tiered co-pays for
drugs to preserve

35
00:06:43,324 --> 00:06:48,261
incentives to use generics when available,
and limit the damage from higher premiums.
