1
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,840
And then for the purposes of the recording, I'll just go ahead and bring us up to speed.

2
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:23,019
So we've been trying for the last 25 minutes or so to get Professor Julia online over Zoom, and I'm not sure what's going on.

3
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:32,560
I hope he's okay, but he hasn't been able to join. So full disclosure, I haven't like prepared myself to present Olivier's slides.

4
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,370
We're also kind of 25 minutes behind schedule,

5
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,989
so I will plan to give a little bit of an overview and hit on some of the major

6
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:46,540
themes and maybe some of the more impressive stuff that he's has going on with this.

7
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:55,450
I know that he had a couple of opportunities where he wanted to break out groups that have people work on kind of like problems and then come back.

8
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:01,359
We'll probably pass over those. But if it's something that you want to do outside of class.

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:08,920
Right, and we can I'm sure we can loop Professor Julie back in if we wanted to have any kind of clarification on that.

10
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:18,400
So yeah, so Olivier has done some really cool work around looking at chemical contaminants in

11
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,480
personal care products and actually he's expanded it into two lots of things air pollution,

12
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:32,320
food ingestion and so forth has some unique approaches to it.

13
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,379
So in terms of the competencies, you know,

14
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:44,830
understanding the potential threats of not just the regulated chemicals and like cakes that are on the labels that are intended to be in the product,

15
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:53,380
but those that are also kind of unregulated and not on on the list, at least here in the US,

16
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:01,990
understanding the differences between a producer emitter perspective and a receptor perspective.

17
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:10,150
So we'll talk about that, what that means and how we might approach prioritizing and ultimately mitigating those exposures.

18
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,120
Knowing the basics on how to assess exposure to chemicals in consumer products.

19
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:25,180
Uh, know what the exposure zone is, at least how we define it and why it's an important approach.

20
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:34,450
And then I think we talked a little bit earlier in the class about we contrasted kind of the US

21
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:41,260
approach to regulating chemicals and products and and how that's handled in the European Union.

22
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,450
So we'll talk a little bit more about which hopefully we'll get to all of this.

23
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,520
Uh, so yeah, so he was going to prompt you with some questions to kind of get you going.

24
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,570
I know in class you've already, you've already answered this questions correctly, like three or four times now.

25
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,030
How many chemicals are there? Uh, what was an 85,000 or something?

26
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:07,899
How many of those are registered? Olivier is going to tell you much less than that total, right?

27
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,560
Only a very, very small fraction. And then why?

28
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:18,880
And the point is that there's better ways to do this, and it's not being done very well in this country for sure.

29
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,969
Uh, just kind of starting off with a news article.

30
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:32,110
This one was from a couple of years ago, but you all have presented these articles before us just as part of our S in the news.

31
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:39,579
Right? A great example of one of these chemicals that's purposely put into consumer products.

32
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,710
Right. And that's created all kinds of problems now as a legacy contaminant.

33
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:51,580
Uh, and then it's not only, you know, are we seeing these things that our environment,

34
00:03:52,300 --> 00:04:00,280
they're measured if you take blood samples, right, or other biomarker samples, a lot of these contaminants are there.

35
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:08,020
Uh, this one is referencing triclosan that it was, is used in antibacterial soaps.

36
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:25,160
And then this is looking at, uh, plasticizers and cosmetics and phthalates as a class of compounds that is found in urine.

37
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,510
Uh, and then, you know, differences in and age groups, right?

38
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:38,270
So for the cosmetics, you know, it's mostly, uh, appear in older people, whereas in plasticizers,

39
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:47,210
which are common components of a lot of like plastic toys that children are playing with or even the pacifiers, things like this.

40
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,690
Uh, so it's much more of a fact that at a younger age.

41
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,200
So a little bit of of a historical context.

42
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,780
So back in the 1960s, in the 1970s,

43
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:15,070
the problem there was a problem of identifying what was an acceptable intake of of a carcinogen or a cancer potentially cancer causing compounds.

44
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:25,450
And it was it was avoided at that point by just prohibiting carcinogens in the commerce whenever that was possible.

45
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:34,330
There was something called the Delaney Clause of Food Additive Amendments 1958,

46
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:43,240
and it basically wasn't possible to specify what was a safe level of a carcinogen.

47
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,830
So the the option then was to just simply ban it.

48
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:57,310
It's not allowed. But this started to become problematic when large number numbers of new carcinogens.

49
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,630
Right. So we didn't really know much about them.

50
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:11,680
There wasn't like this huge toxicity database of information available, uh, started to become, uh, widely dispersed in commercial products.

51
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,250
And we learn about them much longer after the fact.

52
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:22,660
Right. So now they're all out there. So that simply just kind of banning them and keeping them out of products didn't work.

53
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,930
Uh. Let's see. So how do I identify which chemical product combinations are problematic?

54
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,330
Uh oh. And how to reduce and replace them with better alternatives.

55
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:46,340
So Olivier kind of talks about these two different approaches and emitter perspective.

56
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,140
Right. So kind of like from the from the source versus a receptor perspective.

57
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:58,220
So where that contaminant eventually ends up and mostly is in Australia from a human exposure perspective.

58
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:10,680
So one way is looking at the emitters and Olivier saw a ton of work on this in an area of study called Lifecycle Assessment of Products.

59
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:17,389
And it's effective way to be able to potentially reduce what those impacts of products

60
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:22,790
are and then identify what possible alternative chemicals that might be less impactful.

61
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,690
It could be replaced as part of that production.

62
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:34,940
So it might involve or allow for comparative ranking right between different products and different systems,

63
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:46,670
the relative impact of a product function, uh, this kind of emitter producer perspective of kg in over kg and minute.

64
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:55,050
And it's when we're looking at it from from an emitter perspective, you're starting with the product, right?

65
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:01,470
And then following it. It might be in the air or might be in the water, it might be in the soil.

66
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:07,230
It might be in food. Right. It might be in carpet, electronics, whatever it is.

67
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:19,830
And then it's broadening out further to multiple receptions across like a bride abroad population risk assessment,

68
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,850
which we'll talk about in this class in a couple of class periods more specifically, uh,

69
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:30,420
is kind of the area of study from a risk sector perspective when we look at an issue.

70
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,990
So this is starting with people, right?

71
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,200
It's not starting with the emitter and then following all the way through.

72
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,380
And then where does it eventually reach people?

73
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:48,060
Starting with people and asking the question, is the population safe and then kind of working backwards?

74
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,840
Uh, so risk assessment predicts the risk related to the particular substance and its uses,

75
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:01,559
and so allows us to answer the question or at least address the question is it safe or given some populations?

76
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:09,570
Right. We might identify who's most susceptible within a broader population, and we might estimate from this process,

77
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,590
uh, like a milligrams per kg per day of exposure on an, on an individual.

78
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,150
So we're looking at an individual receptor, right?

79
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:27,250
It might be a single person, but it's looking at a cumulative assessment of, you know,

80
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:34,020
multiple products, uh, and multiple emissions sources kind of funneling down to this single receptor.

81
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:40,620
So it's two very different perspectives, the emitter perspective and the receptor perspective.

82
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:52,479
And this is Olivia's concept of an intake fraction, which I've seen him present this previously,

83
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,190
and at this point he would be animating quite a bit and grabbing things on the

84
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,690
slide and moving them all over the place and going through various scenarios.

85
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,750
But the concept here is,

86
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:14,200
and this is work that Olivia has really helped to define in the field and even some of the nomenklatura the concept of an intake fraction.

87
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,850
So it's we, if we can quantify, you know,

88
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:32,950
the mass emitted of a contaminant and then a way to quantify our exposure is to characterize the math as actually taken out of that total.

89
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,020
So we have an intake fraction.

90
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:43,490
And you know, it's we're looking at all of these routes of exposure right through our skin, through inhalation, through ingestion.

91
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:58,020
So for, uh, this is some example analyzes looking at the different number of compounds and intake fractions and you know,

92
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:06,670
kind of highlighting in this case the inhalation ends up being quite, quite dominant in terms of the different routes of exposure.

93
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:16,180
Uh, this example here. And this is the one where he would have walked you all the way through and have you calculate things.

94
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,300
But just to be able to understand what the variables are that come into this range that we have,

95
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:32,810
we're looking at an indoor intake fraction and asking us to think about and it's actually not how we use a different one uh,

96
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,500
from what that he would, but you know,

97
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:41,530
we've talked about in class from an exposure assessment if we have personal monitors here in the classroom that we can always do right,

98
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:47,020
that might allow us to assess our exposure. Uh, that's burdensome.

99
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,070
It's perhaps resource intensive. All we have available is a single area monitor.

100
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:55,960
We put it you're in the closet in the front of the classroom, and that serves as a surrogate of our exposure.

101
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,270
So Olivier would have us walk through, make sure this isn't him.

102
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:16,420
Olivier would have us walk through and consider all of the variables that would allow us to estimate

103
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:23,200
what our exposure might be from an intake fraction perspective without having a personal monitor,

104
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,260
without having an area monitor and so forth.

105
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:36,370
So if we have an idea of what a concentration is of a certain contaminant, and then we factor in,

106
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:42,000
you know, the volume of this room, we have information on the air exchange rates, right.

107
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,620
So there are some ventilation ducts up here in the ceiling.

108
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:53,169
And actually, as part of the COVID pandemic, this school building for sure, and many others have increased by the ventilation rate.

109
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:59,050
Right. As a, as a measure of safety. Um, and taking all of these things into account,

110
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:07,240
we can actually determine the intake fraction of a chemical and we have an idea of what its concentration is,

111
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,340
what we've actually taken in based on the volume, based on the air exchange rate and so forth.

112
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:20,259
Uh, I think I've actually shown you this slide or something that looks similar to it,

113
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,510
and I don't recall exactly what Olivier's point was or that you would be making of it.

114
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:33,770
But this is looking at global burden of disease data and deaths per 1000 people up here at the top.

115
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,470
Ambient particulate matter is huge.

116
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,740
So this is looking specifically at environmental risks in terms of goal burden of disease and then household air pollution.

117
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:47,170
Right. And that kind of goes back to that previous slide showing how important inhalation is as a route of exposure.

118
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,820
And this is one of the reasons why is that these these contaminants have a huge impact on health.

119
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:58,360
And then we get down to water and sanitation and washing.

120
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,750
So just kind of highlighting what some of the important environmental risks are in terms of global burden of disease.

121
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,920
Um, with handwashing though is like lack of handwashing.

122
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:17,290
Yes. Right. Yeah. How and how right. How important it is in terms of impact on mortality.

123
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:30,090
And then again, this is looking a little bit more at and a particular study of the influence of

124
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:37,090
biomarker derived exposure doses and where it ends up being most important.

125
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,100
And I'm not going to focus in on all these age groups or gender,

126
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:48,810
but in kind of consumer and industrial settings, this is, I think, is focused on pesticides.

127
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:58,660
Yeah. This is kind of getting back to that, uh, that trickle of sand, uh, ruling that is,

128
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:08,410
has removed it from antibacterial soap and actually is anyone familiar with it with the triclosan story in antibacterial soaps?

129
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:19,360
Anyone want to tell the story? The only thing I know about it and I think it's like a that was found to be carcinogenic.

130
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,410
I think it could be endocrine disrupting, not carcinogenic.

131
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:31,509
I can't remember which one, but basically we were using it because it's really good at killing a lot of things.

132
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:41,410
And so surprise, it also brings us. And yeah, we took it out of soap because we had to weigh the risk between.

133
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:54,670
Or the FDA had to weigh the risks between preventing illness through bacteria or viruses, whatever, and the carcinogenic or undercooked or saccharine.

134
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,450
Absolutely. Could I see your hand going up? So be it.

135
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:04,920
Thank you. Thanks, Kate. That's a nice summary. So, yeah, so there is concern about triclosan.

136
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:14,290
Um, and then it actually turned out that after it had been in the soap products for several years and it was highly marketed,

137
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,570
I don't know if folks remember lots of people were buying it, right?

138
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:21,040
Oh, it was. It's not just soap. It's antibacterial soap.

139
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,640
Right. So much better because like Kate said, it's you know, it has the kind of germ killing properties.

140
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:34,480
And then you have through the FDA's analysis, they issued a rule this is back in 2016.

141
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,970
And I think it's maybe about the middle of the text here.

142
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:42,279
Companies will no longer be able to market antibacterial washes with these ingredients because

143
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:48,280
manufacturers did not demonstrate the ingredients are both safe for long term use and importantly,

144
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:55,210
or that they're even more effective than plain soap and water and prevention, preventing illness and the spread of certain infections.

145
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:04,420
And this is what has borne out, is that studies that have assessed it show that washing hands with just plain so without triclosan and as an

146
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:12,489
antibacterial ingredient are shown to be equally as effective at cleaning and preventing the spread of infection.

147
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:19,960
So there was really no point in having these chemicals in and like Kate mentioned, that risk benefit analysis.

148
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:29,379
All right. So this is where Olivia would be launching into some of his work about how to assess exposures.

149
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,730
But we have lots of different chemical product combinations.

150
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,610
Right. Uh, this is,

151
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:45,430
this has been a challenge and actually probably the major advancement in environmental health sciences over the last maybe ten years or so.

152
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:51,610
So, and a lot of regulation is actually still bound by law.

153
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:58,030
You all know that I focus on air quality issues, the Clean Air Act by law through the legislation.

154
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:11,300
Uh. Requires EPA to evaluate pollutants on an individual basis to determine how harmful they are on an individual basis,

155
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:20,600
and then set regulations to be protective of public health. I believe the reality is we're exposed to all of these points at the same time.

156
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:28,520
Right. So, you know, the multivariable component of this grows exponentially.

157
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,240
Like if you just talk about outdoor air pollution and compare it to consumer products.

158
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:39,319
There's so much in these liberties come up with some really cool approaches on how to assess

159
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,930
exposure and when we know that we have all of these numerous chemicals and products.

160
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:48,170
Numerous products. Right. That they might reside in.

161
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,299
So let's see. I'm going to read this Washington bulletin. So far,

162
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:04,300
many product oriented exposure assessment accounts mostly for indirect environmental exposure and not direct exposure of consumers to products during.

163
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,990
And so the aim of this objective,

164
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:16,180
using these anti-corruption to consistently model the far field in near field exposure to chemicals in consumer products.

165
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,790
Define and calculate a metric that accounts for the near field exposure rate.

166
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:31,119
So this is this product intake fraction, how much is taken in over the total and then determine exposure for multiple products,

167
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:39,010
chemical combinations that can be compared with independent toxicity bio assays.

168
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:48,360
And then again, this is where he's got this really cool slide where he'd be grabbing and moving these all over the place.

169
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:57,690
Uh, and I'm not sure if he doesn't actually use like an example contaminant, but if you recall this,

170
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:03,060
this intake fraction is right, the mass taken in over the mass in the product.

171
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:11,370
But it's, uh, the, the modeling approach allows us to look at these, our field environmental departments.

172
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:15,160
Right. How much is an air, water, soil?

173
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,330
In this particular example, he's considering things like wastewater treatment plants, landfills.

174
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:33,209
So these are things that might be kind of a community based, uh, location or a spatial context and then the near field, right?

175
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,110
So this is stuff that ends up being, um, you know, much more personal.

176
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:45,210
So the, the food and beverages that we ingest, what we might apply to our skin, for example,

177
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:53,340
what's in our, our microenvironment right from air or uh, skin contact and so forth.

178
00:20:54,930 --> 00:21:02,850
And then again, uh, considering all of those rounds of exposure, whether it's through skin contact,

179
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:10,860
through inhalation or through ingestion, and so we know how much or we can quantify or estimate how much product,

180
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,230
how much chemical in product is emitted in the first place,

181
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:25,590
and then estimate how much has been taken in by us as receptors and then determine its intake fraction.

182
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,890
Uh, and I think you just kind of go see we can trust a couple of different ones here.

183
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,570
We talked about hand soap and sanitizer, another, you know,

184
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:46,990
problematic consumer product exploring whether carpeting or hard surfaces just as a take away.

185
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,330
And kind of back to the question of like, what do I tell my sister who, you know, has any baby?

186
00:21:53,860 --> 00:22:02,800
The older products are that generally the safer they are because new products are basically in gas.

187
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:10,389
So I don't know if anybody's bought it usually ends up being I don't like inexpensive furniture that requires some assembly.

188
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,290
Right. So something like the press, two particle boards or something, it's not made out of real wood.

189
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,360
And you take it out of the box and you put it together and it gives off the really strong odor.

190
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:26,500
Or if you've been anywhere where, you know, new carpeting has been laid down or even new cardboard, you kind of get this odor.

191
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,000
So over the course of a couple of years, those products are degassing,

192
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,020
like the volatile components that are within the product party gas and into that very, very near field environment.

193
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,170
So the exposures are generally higher.

194
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:50,290
So yeah, so the old house, you know, the old building, whatever it is, it hasn't been recently refurbished or updated for the most part.

195
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:55,030
It's going to have lower exposures for many of these consumer products.

196
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:05,320
Skip through this slide. Yeah.

197
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,430
So this is you know, we kind of talked a little bit before class about this,

198
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:14,350
but he's kind of going through here and looking at different examples and how you can begin to quantify

199
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:19,630
some of these things in the in the chemical product and how they're used in various scenarios.

200
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:30,249
So we talked about shampoo, right? Um, body lotion, um, and specific chemicals of concern here and for children, right.

201
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:36,690
We've talked about pacifiers and again with those plasticizers that are in that, you know, soft whatever, spongy, uh,

202
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:46,419
kind of thing that's using a pacifier here and flooring and how that you can kind of determine how much of

203
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:55,480
the work is in the product to begin with and then begin to define how much can be taken up by a receptor.

204
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:06,340
Uh, talking through some dermal uptake models here, but using the same principles.

205
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:23,629
This one is focusing in on a couple of different. These are the chemicals that are in the products that he was laying out.

206
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:27,110
So like the shampoo of perfumes. This is a really interesting one.

207
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:34,940
Right. Because one of the one of the nice things that I've heard Olivia talk about in previous lectures kind of introducing the

208
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:43,130
concept is and it's a little bit of a dig at people like me that measure all that stuff right in the environment is,

209
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:49,490
you know, his contention is we don't need all these fancy expensive instruments to let us know they're being exposed to something.

210
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:56,059
We have our own personal monitor. It's located right here and in the middle of our face, you know,

211
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:05,600
he points to his note and his contention is this is the case for for many products, not not for all contaminants.

212
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,270
Some things are don't actually give off a scent, right.

213
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:19,010
So they can't be detected. But his contention is, if you can smell it, that means that the concentrations are really high.

214
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:26,420
And that's a reason for you to be concerned. Right. We're all exposed to things at very low levels that we can't detect with our senses.

215
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:34,640
But if there's enough of it present that you can smell it, that's telling you that you're being exposed at a significant concentration.

216
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,400
And so this is the case with everything, right?

217
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:45,930
Uh, shampoos, you know, you open the bottle once has a scent that's given up, the soap you put on, the lotion you put on.

218
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,730
And in most cases they're intended to be there.

219
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:58,100
Right. The the the marketing is that it's oh, it's this fresh scent or this flowery scent or whatever it is, the mint.

220
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:04,480
He said, that's making you feel like the product is it's kind of good for you or something, right.

221
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:08,300
To use a lemon. That is a sign. Yes, absolutely.

222
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:17,240
And so, you know, they're added to products on purpose, but they're they're not naturally derived.

223
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,830
It's not like somebody for the most part, it's not like someone took a flower and kind of ground it up.

224
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:29,569
And that's why the shampoos is nice. It's chemicals that are added in different mixtures to kind of create an artificial scent.

225
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,750
So the result is that we're exposed to all of these chemicals.

226
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:38,950
And we saw this, the perfume I was kind of getting back to this this this one is, is particularly interesting, right?

227
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:44,240
Because perfume is used or cologne or whatever.

228
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,360
Right? Uh, to give off a nice smell.

229
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:51,710
That's the whole point. And so we apply it to ourselves. So it's volatile in nature.

230
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:56,270
And I mean, you've all probably been in a room,

231
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:01,640
you get into an elevator or even just walking past someone and you get a pretty, pretty strong wind, right?

232
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:05,960
Like, wow, that person wearing a lot of perfume or cologne or whatever.

233
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,510
So your your sensor detected that you were just exposed to a relatively high

234
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:15,649
concentration of the chemicals that are in that perfume that are purposely there,

235
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:19,600
that they're being given off. Imagine the person, right?

236
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,550
The person who is who has it applied to themselves.

237
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:29,900
And that's being given off like directly in their breathing zone the entire time that they're, I guess, wearing the perfume.

238
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,360
It doesn't last forever. It's volatile.

239
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:41,150
Eventually, uh, it it all vocalizes and that it's, there's no longer any left on the skin, although some might have been absorbed in the first place.

240
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:48,650
But just, you know, really interesting, uh, concepts here and I can't remember where it is.

241
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:57,800
Yes, perfect. That was always in my mind. So we have this great example of body lotion and handle ocean and so forth.

242
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:02,150
And, you know, presumably he got he had a bottle of lotion.

243
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:07,670
He probably would if he was here, he would have one in class and be passing it around and asking someone to read off the ingredients.

244
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,380
And it looks something like this, right? A long list of all kinds of things.

245
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:17,090
Uh, alcohols, glycerin, uh, different parabens.

246
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,620
Um, uh, parabens. Those are not good.

247
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,730
Uh, and then you ask the question why?

248
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:31,790
Why there all these products need to be here. And then he has this great kind of a promotion.

249
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:38,690
Uh, apparently is his personal use or solution to moisturizing skin using coconut oil?

250
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:44,809
And I think he has, you know, the back of the jar of coconut oil.

251
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:55,580
Here's what it reads. You know, at the top, perfect for frying or a stain as it's a virtually color was and tasteless with a high heat potential.

252
00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:03,170
Again what would that part of the rest of that word is the great butter substitute in baking.

253
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:08,840
And then here at the bottom, an excellent skin moisturizer, lip balm or hair treatment.

254
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,290
And then, yeah. What's the ingredient of coconut oil?

255
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,640
It's organic coconut oil, not a. A lot of additives.

256
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:20,400
Right. And apparently it works very well.

257
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:32,610
Um, my spouse makes soaps at home, and I know that coconut oil is like, a huge, uh, ingredient is mass of the ingredient of kind of natural soaps.

258
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:41,639
So anyway, if you are, you know, again, kind of like some personal mitigation efforts, if you're a big user of lotions and moisturizers,

259
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,490
which again, it's especially as it gets colder and drier with our weather, it's a need.

260
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,160
If you haven't yet, maybe check out the coconut oil. Anyone have any kind of personal I don't know.

261
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,190
Uses experiences with this type of stuff they want to share?

262
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:08,790
For when I had like more time for grad school, I made my own out of, like with shea butter and coconut oil together because it just ingredients.

263
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:23,760
Yeah. I mean, you can buy the sense if you were like in a in little vials, maybe you can buy scents that are like naturally derived or essential oils.

264
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:29,880
That's that's right. And you can also I mean, you dictate how much is added as well.

265
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,850
Yeah. So you have like a lot. It gives you a lot of control over like what's in your products.

266
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,560
Absolutely. Great, great example.

267
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:50,370
I think one reason I've been raising my hand so much is because I follow this YouTuber named Lab Muffin Beauty and she's a like a cosmetic chemist.

268
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:57,449
And so she, like, talks about why like things like satirical alcohol are used in cosmetic things and

269
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:02,400
how like sometimes there are actual benefits to using these like lab created.

270
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:11,600
Products versus natural ones, because you mentioned the essential oils and like things like lavender oil, well, it smells really nice.

271
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,870
Has also been shown to be endocrine disruptor.

272
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:21,110
Even though it's like naturally derived, it doesn't necessarily mean it's better for you than something else.

273
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,320
So she kind of talks about that and breaks all of those things down.

274
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:32,720
But yeah, like I was just looking at this like some of these things like part like are really.

275
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:43,339
Like. What am I trying to say? Like, kind of confusing, obviously, the way they phrase them.

276
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:48,530
And so they can be really scary. And I think there's a lot of people who are just like, oh, chemicals are so bad.

277
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:57,170
But like some of them, like I recently got a tattoo and like those, like American Dermatological Academy, like,

278
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:01,520
suggests that you do use things with material alcohol in it over something like coconut

279
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:06,100
oil because of the ways that they've shown that it's better for healing things.

280
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:11,570
Okay. Okay. Yeah. And I'm getting a good takeaway that that's worth reading,

281
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,260
emphasizing in your comments stated earlier in the class, we characterize different types of sources.

282
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:24,500
Right. And we basically have to reject sources, which is anything having to do with like human activities,

283
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,040
which would be like manufactured chemicals and also natural sources.

284
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:34,190
Right. And the reason that we classify natural sources is because there are things that are that exist in nature.

285
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:39,870
Right. That have nothing to do with human activities and anything that we would call organic.

286
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:44,030
Right. Or that's grown or that exist naturally.

287
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:51,590
We would still classify it as a source, right? Depending on whether it has the potential to be harmful and good.

288
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:58,759
A good takeaway is that not everything, you know, natural is necessarily, you know, good for us, right?

289
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:06,910
That there are known, um, you know, very lethal toxins that are naturally occurring, that are very harmful to us.

290
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,200
That that I see another hand going up over here. Okay.

291
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:20,480
Yeah. What are you looking at? Like some of the, some of the things in those things are they're on purpose because they,

292
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,000
like, maintain moisture and they attract moisture from the air onto your body.

293
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:32,030
And I like some of the things that are lotions you can by yourself, like you can.

294
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,900
I have like a gallon of glycerin at home. It's for glycerin.

295
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:44,480
And you can just like you can make your own lotion, like without parabens, for example, or like, um,

296
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:54,050
the preservatives or the things that make sure that the, the fragrance is like it stays attached to the lotion.

297
00:33:54,620 --> 00:34:01,129
And there's that to, you know, thank you so much for sharing.

298
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:09,830
And and the I'm glad you mentioned the preservatives because this is in so many products, including even as we go into food products.

299
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,870
It's it's the the reason why it's there in the first place.

300
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,610
And, yes, those chemicals can be harmful to us,

301
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:26,620
but it's it's mostly just to ensure a shelf life of a product and that the functionality of the product for food is,

302
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,959
you know, keeping it a little spoil. But even.

303
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,470
Right. Like you're talking about how, you know,

304
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:42,200
retaining the product that is able to be shipped and transported and sold and allowed to sit on a shelf for significant amount of time.

305
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:48,410
Whereas if you're, you know, you're making it for yourself at home, there's no reason to add preservatives.

306
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:55,460
You know what your own use timeframe. All right, cool.

307
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,520
Thank you so much for joining. And let's see to talking about this study.

308
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,690
High throughput exposure and risks of alternative assessments of chemicals and tweets.

309
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:11,680
So some work that Olivier has done around this, focusing on kids toys.

310
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:17,970
Oh, yeah. This is this is pretty impressive. I don't think we.

311
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:23,930
We need to do the math. Uh, but, uh, a single toy, I think.

312
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:27,940
Does he go through in the slide? Uh, no. Yes, there it is.

313
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:41,260
Okay. Uh, a single toy, uh, for, like, a 400 is about 400 kilograms of, um, chemicals and a doll.

314
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:52,780
But then poses the question, you know, how many kilograms of plastic are children exposed to per year?

315
00:35:53,700 --> 00:36:00,970
Uh, and, you know, the, the take home message or the punch line is in the law.

316
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:09,340
So I think he kind of, kind of goes through a calculation here to estimate, uh, using some economic data and other considerations.

317
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,530
So this was from the year 2018 in the US.

318
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:24,920
Uh, for, for toys uses the word consumption, but it's basically like, you know, how many toys kids have basically or use, uh.

319
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:32,410
Uh, it's about $467 spend per child per year.

320
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:46,540
Holy cow. That's a lot. But okay. Um, and then, you know, using some other data, it's about $14 per kilogram of toy.

321
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:52,829
Right. And again, it's, it's, we know that like most of the mass of the toys are like these plastics, right?

322
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,470
And so forth.

323
00:36:54,250 --> 00:37:07,360
Um, and then kind of furthering on, with some calculations, the total amount of toys per year ends up being about 33 kilograms per child per year.

324
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:17,420
And then kind of like ratios that down and says, okay, the fraction of what's truly plastic in those toys is maybe a little more than half or so.

325
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:24,820
So then the total amount of plastic toys purchased per child per year is about 18 kilograms.

326
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:33,999
And then estimating like what's the kind of average or typical use, use like shelf life on which you want to call it,

327
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,299
of a toy like in a child's room or playroom or whatever you want for years so that they kind of accumulate.

328
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:45,940
Right and kind of maybe maintain this static level because about 55 kilograms of plastic toys,

329
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,890
uh, in the room of a child on average, that's kind of a lot.

330
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:56,170
And then I'm not going to able to go through all of this very kind of launches and,

331
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:02,510
and talks about some of the more complicated aspects of, again, kind of getting back to intake fraction, you know,

332
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:09,880
the amount of chemical per toys, uh, considering hard plastics, soft plastics, foam plastics,

333
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:17,020
all of these different additives that are utilized in children's toys and the various different combinations.

334
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:25,120
And you know, their model here is looking at around 350 unique substances, um, and just three different toy types.

335
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,110
But there are nine orders of magnitude of variation and all of the possible considerations here.

336
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:37,329
And then kind of getting back and going through the, the intake fraction analysis.

337
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:40,220
So this is where you would be having you kind of work through, right?

338
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:45,730
Taking some numbers and plugging them in and seeing what you come up with for calculating it.

339
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:54,130
Uh, this is back to looking at a very specific example of people that are in the chemical, in flooring.

340
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:02,349
And again, this is the concern is new flooring that's laid and where the concentrations are high and it's volatile and it's being emitted.

341
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:07,720
So we're determining the product and take production through the right of inhalation by phenol.

342
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:16,480
Doesn't imply that more is admitted over time or as it gets older.

343
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:31,060
Total. Yes, accumulative right. But is the rate of organization and like the, the existing concentration goes down over time.

344
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:39,190
Uh, looking at loading and toy products, population of first order transfer,

345
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:48,100
looking at a 15 year time frame rate and the different so volatile ization that what people are exposed to through inhalation.

346
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,089
This is a really relevant example, right?

347
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:58,510
When you're talking about toys, you talk about children, you know, babies, toddlers, they spend a ton of time on the floor.

348
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:05,709
Right. So their own we talked about in The Activity Diaries, you know,

349
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:13,270
what are what are the behavior related aspects of small children that allows them to come into contact with various chemicals?

350
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:16,300
Right. For the most part, those even if we're in close.

351
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,710
Proximity of the adult to these toys. We're probably not touching on them a whole lot.

352
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:26,950
If we are, we're probably not putting our hands to our mouth and we're certainly not putting like the toys in our mouth for kids.

353
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,610
Totally different story right there on the floor.

354
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:38,319
So even if they don't have the toys in their hands or the toys in their mouth, every place that the toys have been right.

355
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:46,300
And the chemicals from them, you know, they're crawling around on the floor and still just by putting their arms to their mouth are being exposed.

356
00:40:49,950 --> 00:41:00,029
Okay. So it's going to this is looking at the near field exposures as well as those far field exposures and just kind of aspects.

357
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:09,330
How about this approach? Right. Kind of going back to the Clean Air Act example of we do all this research to estimate

358
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:15,210
what is the health effect of particulate matter and how do we regulate particulate matter,

359
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:25,500
which is a single human at a time, kind of disregarding that we're exposed to a lot of other things in addition to just particulate matter.

360
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:36,070
And so, you know, the intake fraction approach here that Olivier and his collaborators have proposed basically allow a high throughput screening rate.

361
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:43,880
You just kind of wait to collect all of this data, put it into this model, and you can basically run it through and identify,

362
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:50,650
you know, which which chemicals should you be most concerned about based on their intake fraction, right?

363
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:58,980
Which ones are accumulating in the highest amounts in people and kind of work backwards from that perspective.

364
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:18,490
Using kind of a matrix approach. So, you know, sticking with that toys,

365
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:28,150
they kind of developed like a toys hazard index animal to kind of quantify

366
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:34,959
exposure and toxicity roles per exposure out and the risk driven by plasticizers,

367
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,250
which are mainly presented in plastic toys.

368
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,500
And then, you know, based on this, based on these intake fractions,

369
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:58,950
you and knowing something about the toxicity of a potential of a particular chemical, you can basically come up with what should be.

370
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,500
You can answer the question of what should be the maximum acceptable chemical in toys.

371
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:10,080
Right. Based on this kind of screening mechanism.

372
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,730
And are you utilizing these intake fractions?

373
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:31,959
One. Also, it was one thing model evaluation of experimental ingredients in the region.

374
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:40,390
Right. Okay. So we're looking at lots of different chemical groups and again, lots of different potential materials.

375
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:48,820
And then here is plugging is is is of course, the of 74 on environmental impact.

376
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:55,120
That's a bit confusing to a lot of this and quantitative aspects.

377
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:58,329
Uh oh. Okay. So I have a few minutes left.

378
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:04,780
I wanted to hit on the concept of the ozone was actually heard of the term other than looking at the title on campus.

379
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:09,040
Okay, cool. Yeah.

380
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:20,930
So this is, you know, another kind of concept where oh and he's plugging is another course multi sustainable foods and products that can be too.

381
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:30,610
Uh, so, you know, basically saying if you tell me when and where you live and where, uh,

382
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:39,980
what you consumed and what you eat, uh, that you can basically create this picture of, of, of what you are, right?

383
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:47,170
From a chemical, uh, perspective. Is this, is this his story?

384
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,650
Not this has got to be someone else's story. I think that's just really okay.

385
00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:05,199
Yeah. Uh, so, yeah. So let's see, um, so over 6700 food items of the US diet.

386
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:11,240
Oh, yeah. This was some really cool word. Uh, this is relatively recent years.

387
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,300
Yeah. Who's heard the hotdog story from Olivia? You agree?

388
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:26,770
Uh, yeah. So where they did this really cool analysis looking at, you know,

389
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:32,920
not just kind of the harmful exposure side of things that are that are negative impacts,

390
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:37,480
but also looking at what might mitigate those negative impacts.

391
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:50,650
And so whether it's behaviors or kind of beneficial exposures, um, and quantifying in minutes of light gained like lost, right.

392
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:55,870
So I know that he gives this, this example of biking.

393
00:45:55,870 --> 00:46:02,859
Olivia is a big biker and bikes to work, bikes to campus, uh, pretty much year round.

394
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:08,380
So for those of you that are worried about this now and like some of these people are really hard core, that's not me.

395
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:14,409
I will walk in and of course, no problem. But I'm not ready to get on a bike in the winter.

396
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:17,740
But anyway, Olivia, he goes to his own personal example is like, okay, well,

397
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:24,939
there's an air concentration of different pollutants that I'm exposed to biking and I biking with a higher respiratory rate.

398
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:32,560
Right. So I'm, I'm breathing more of it in and I can quantify how many minutes of life I've lost from riding my bike to work and back.

399
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:38,160
But that's that's partially mitigated by the beneficial exercise, right.

400
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:46,630
That he's doing in benefit of his health so that he's he's basically gaining minutes of life for each day that he bikes to work.

401
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:50,290
And so looking at this from from all different perspectives, yeah.

402
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:57,370
So there, you know, this is kind of utilizing that concept of these and taking it all together and quantifying it all.

403
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:03,640
So they incorporated over 6700 food items in kind of US based diet.

404
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,919
Yeah. So here's the famous hot dog, one hot dog per day.

405
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,510
For those of you that hot dogs,

406
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:24,310
35 minutes of life lost or hot dog that the time very good but then to contrast that right one serving of nuts you're gaining 25 minutes,

407
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:40,520
you know, so kind of going through some more uh, your field and far field exposures, some estimations.

408
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:47,950
So it's kind of some resources or, you know, not trying to recreate that.

409
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:55,360
We all are concerned about something. There are actually resources out there that we can go to and do do some scraping and do some estimating.

410
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:02,500
One is the comp talks dashboard that is part of EPA's website.

411
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:12,100
So you can basically pull up a specific chemical that exists in US commerce like formaldehyde and get a ton of

412
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:20,320
information about it so that we actually have an idea of what the what the potential risks or concerns are.

413
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:30,190
There's over 750,000 chemicals that are included within the tax database.

414
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:38,510
So again, this is kind of like a screenshot. But, you know, all of the different chemical properties of each of these.

415
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:57,290
This is particularly for, for people, uh, but uh, uh, chemical functions and training and its different components and then reach.

416
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:01,669
And I think we introduced this previously. Um, but, you know,

417
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:10,940
part of it is kind of like digging on how poorly we do things in the U.S. in terms of regulating chemicals in many of these consumer products.

418
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:15,050
And there's a very different perspective that's utilized in Europe,

419
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:19,460
stands for the registration, evaluation, authorization and registration of chemicals.

420
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,780
And, you know,

421
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:36,440
because there's we know there's limited information on the hazards of risk to not only to people between environment and reach actually requires,

422
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:44,960
uh, manufacturers of chemicals utilized in consumer products to demonstrate their safety.

423
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:52,340
Right. PRIORE Right. So like in the U.S., we try them out and we distribute them widely and they get used for 20 years.

424
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:59,330
And then we learn after the fact that went, wow, that was a bad idea, because now all we've all been exposed and it causes,

425
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:03,980
you know, whatever case, it's an endocrine disruptor or it has this harmful impact.

426
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:09,110
And in the European Union, they've been taking a very different approach to this.

427
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:18,490
Uh, yeah, it's kind of going to I won't step through each of it specifically, but there's some very formalized steps, you know,

428
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:24,139
kind of working through that acronym where it first needs to be registered within

429
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:28,880
the system and needs to be evaluated over the course of a couple of years,

430
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:36,650
but that needs to actually be authorized. And then clarification on what the restrictions are of its of its use.

431
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:45,760
Kind of advertising information on how you can go out there to the European Chemicals

432
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:52,060
Agency and find information on all of those registered chemicals and their data set.

433
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:59,500
It's a little bit more about those on air and how it's find.

434
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:05,410
This is from a particular publication that Olivier is fond of.

435
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:13,450
It states the exposure is composed of every exposure to which individual is subjected from conception to death.

436
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:19,210
Therefore, it requires consideration of both the nature of these exposures and their changes over time.

437
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:28,930
The use of description. Three broad categories of knowledge and the exposures may be considered internal, specific, external, and generally external.

438
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:41,340
Walking through a little bit of the conceptual framework here of how we can do some high throughput exposure analysis.

439
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:51,360
And then it kind of getting back to the point that we can predict someone's exposure based on looking at this completely cumulative lifetime,

440
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:55,890
you know, from conception to death, cumulative exposure.

441
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:04,850
So it was part of his study. And maybe this is where he actually goes through some of these specific examples.

442
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:08,420
It. And that's the end.

443
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:15,560
So apologies for not even coming close to do covering this as well.

444
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:26,840
So Julia, I would have, I will reach out company and, uh, and see what might be possible in terms of all that.

445
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:33,799
But with that, any questions and they don't even have to be questions for me.

446
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,480
They can kind of be like how Kate started the clock. It can be questions for Olivier.

447
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,420
Can we kind of like ask for him on anything?

448
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:54,610
All right. Well, again, apologies for the just not being able to get to Libya,

449
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:08,760
but have a wonderful afternoon for for those of you that have a couple of days to have exams in the afternoon, because otherwise every day is.
