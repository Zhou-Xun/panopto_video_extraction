1
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,630
Next up, we're going to spend a moment thinking about what happens with continuous exposures.

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:22,459
So here I'm presenting distributions of PCV levels as our exposure among people who have

3
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,470
been classified as with and without the disease otherwise known as controls or cases.

4
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,180
Separately, what you can see is that in the true population,

5
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:45,410
what we see is that people without the disease or control population have a 0.005 lower mean p level than those who did get the disease or our cases.

6
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,140
Now, in the event that we have an inaccurate exposure measure.

7
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:58,070
Let's just say our measure systematically reads to high by 0.001 micrograms per liter,

8
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:05,000
but it reads too high in the same way in both groups, which is what we're showing in the bottom left graphic.

9
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:14,660
Then our mean difference between cases and controls, which again is our association of interest, is actually going to be unaffected.

10
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:23,270
We would similarly see no difference in the magnitude of our association of interest or the mean difference between the cases and controls.

11
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,640
If the cases and controls had equally accurate data,

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,780
but they had less precise measures of exposure as shown by the widening of the distributions on the bottom right graphic.

13
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,850
Now, admittedly, there will be a loss of power in that scenario, making it harder to detect any differences between populations.

14
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,400
Now, here what I want you to see as that we effectively get a similar answer.

15
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:58,580
If now, instead of having non differential measurement error in our exposure, we have non differential measurement error in our outcome.

16
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:06,620
Looking at this, what we can see is that the mean differences in our outcome between the groups of exposed and unexposed,

17
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:12,500
which is really our association of interest, is on impacted by the non differential misclassification.

18
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,360
So filling in one more box. Now, looking at continuous outcome and exposure data,

19
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:28,510
what we see is that when we have non differential misclassification in these scenarios, we have no bias in the mean differences.

20
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,440
So you may notice that we have one more box to work through.

21
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:40,840
What is that for? Well, this is the one that I've left aside for special cases where the directionality of the bias is unpredictable,

22
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,440
even though we have non differential misclassification.

23
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:56,470
Now, for example, we're going to imagine that instead of classifying our PC status into high and low, we're classifying PC into high, medium and low.

24
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:04,600
Now here, what I have shown for you is the odds ratio between the high and low group and the medium and low group.

25
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,250
Now, I want to add one more table for you.

26
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:18,190
If we misclassify 50% of our high exposure individuals and now call them low individuals, even though they're not.

27
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:29,200
What you can see is that the high versus low group as well as the medium versus low group associations are both biased towards the null.

28
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:38,770
In other words, the associations that we observe under misclassification of this multi-category exposure are closer to one than the truth.

29
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,840
Now, this likely seems familiar, and you're saying, why are you still talking? Can't we finish the video already?

30
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,520
I want to just add one more set of boxes for you.

31
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:57,490
In this scenario, we misclassify 50% of our high exposure group now as the medium group as opposed to the low group.

32
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:07,840
And what we see is that when we compare high exposure individuals to low exposure individuals, we see the same odds ratio as the truth.

33
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,820
And now the medium versus too low exposure group has an odds ratio that's biased to large.

34
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,080
In this case, it is away from one or away from the null.

35
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,860
This suggests that errors in Multi-Category groups can actually introduce bias in any direction.

36
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:37,270
Finally, the last scenario I want to talk about is how, even though you might have non differential errors in your exposure and your outcome,

37
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,170
there are errors that also happen in your confounders.

38
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:47,740
When you have errors in your confounders or you have correlated errors between these different groups,

39
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,910
you can introduce bias also in unpredictable directions.

40
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,570
So with that, we wrap up this particular video and fill out our final box,

41
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,240
as you recall, and our special cases of multi-category exposures of our outcome.

42
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:10,000
Or when we have errors and our confounders, we can experience bias in any direction.
