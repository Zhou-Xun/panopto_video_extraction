1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:13,950
OK, so in this segments, we're going to move on to inferential statistics and we're going to do a multivariate analysis and multivariate,

2
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,710
as we mentioned earlier on, were analyzed in more than two variables.

3
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:24,890
In the prior segments we did descriptive statistics and that's when we were mostly looking at,

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:30,210
you know, our measures of central tendency as well as measures of spread.

5
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,790
And we we also did a bivariate analysis just to show you how we could analyze

6
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,890
two variables a bivariate analysis isn't necessarily descriptive statistics.

7
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,010
But I did that to show you how we're working with two variables.

8
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:52,140
So with an inferential statistics, what I have there is that to demonstrate inferential statistics,

9
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,960
we will be using a data set from the Sleuth2 package called E x 1029.

10
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,210
So this is again, my R student interface and down here.

11
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:10,920
This is where I have the packages that I've installed and what I like to do first I like to use the help function

12
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,990
this allows me to view the documentation for the particular dataset that I'm working with.

13
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:23,580
And the View Command, you saw that earlier on. It allows me to view my data set in a tabular format like an Excel format.

14
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:31,380
Right. So let's look quickly at the HELP Command. Let's do the HELP command to see the documentation.

15
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:40,480
OK, so this dataset contains weekly wages in 1987 for a sample of over 2500 males.

16
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,020
Again, pay attention to the key terms sample.

17
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:52,770
It means that we didn't get data from the entire population, but we're assuming that this is representative of the United States population, males.

18
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,900
And so they're between the ages of 18 and 70. They work full time.

19
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,760
It also has the data set contains their years of education.

20
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,040
Years of experience, and then indicate a variable for whether they were black.

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,980
An indicator variable for whether they worked in or near a city.

22
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:17,750
And a code for the region in the United States where they worked. So I like looking at this

23
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,710
documentation because it shows me the variables in my dataset that I'm going to be working with.

24
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:28,950
And you can see I have a couple and right off the bat I see that this is called wage and race.

25
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:35,190
So my first question was, how does your race influence your wage?

26
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,960
We can also say income for the purpose of this conversation. Does it influence your earnings?

27
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,870
Right. Again, let's put everything in perspective. This data was collected in 1987 so

28
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,620
I'm pretty sure that there has been policies.

29
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:56,700
You know, there's been discussions, there've been discussions about the wage gap and things of that nature.

30
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,810
So it's not so much to talk about. Oh my God, this group earn more.

31
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,520
But just to show you how we analyzed data using different variables.

32
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:15,560
Right. So if I go back to. In this sort of like, view right here, it shows me all my observations over 2500.

33
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,250
I have eight columns, which means that I have eight variables.

34
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,680
Right. So let's go back to our file.

35
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,910
We looked at our data set. We viewed it. We looked at the documentation.

36
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:37,190
Another thing that we can do is to check for missing values, because with some procedures, we have to disregard or ignore the missing values.

37
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:45,620
And this is the function that I would use. That's the code. And it's telling me that is false for all the variables that we have no missing values.

38
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:55,630
Now, another thing is that. If you see, if you go back to the variable that they giving me for race is black, which is not very intuitive.

39
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:03,550
I prefer to work with a variable called race. And then I can say give it to different level so I can say black or non black.

40
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:09,070
Right. So what we can do is that we can define our own variables. So I'm going to define a new variable.

41
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:14,770
I'm going to call it race, but it's going to be based on what they gave me initially for

42
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:25,140
for black right. So if I run that. It's gonna give them my new variable and I can see how well it aligns with what I had originally.

43
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:33,330
So  originally they gave me black as the indicator variable for race, but I define my own variable and I can see

44
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:42,270
OK, black is aligned with what's Yes. None black is aligned with what was no for black originally and an inferential statistics

45
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:52,620
we also start off by generating summary statistics to see, you know, the spread of our data, to see, you know, our measures of central tendency.

46
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,650
So we're doing this wage by race.

47
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:04,110
And race is essentially saying whether you're black or non black, it's going to tell us, you know, what the wages were.

48
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:10,380
So I can see that the mean for non blacks were the mean was higher than that for blacks.

49
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,090
The median was also higher. The maximum was also higher, was much higher

50
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:22,950
but this could be due to it's outliers right. So it's good to do summary statistics, to have a quick snapshot of your data.

51
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:30,690
I can also do a density plot. Right, because a density plot is going to tell me whether or not it's symmetrical so I can

52
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:37,350
determine what statistical test to use. So im doing a density plot of wage by race

53
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:45,080
and it's going to show me what the curve looks like for, you know, for my two groups, whether you're black or non black.

54
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,120
And right off the bat, you can see how skewed this is for the nonblacks is highly skewed.

55
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,830
A lot of outliers.

56
00:05:52,830 --> 00:06:04,290
So what we can do since this would most naturally violate the assumptions of normality for doing my regression, we can transform wage.

57
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:12,810
We can do a lot with transformation of wage. And this is the code that I'm using right here so I can transform that variable.

58
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:17,760
And let's see what we have here. That was done.

59
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,400
Now we can do a new density plot with a transformed variable.

60
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,660
And looking at this, you can see this looks a lot more symmetrical.

61
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:37,920
So with this transformation, I can go ahead and start conducting, by my analysis, specifically to do a regression.

62
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:44,910
Now, from the summary statistics earlier on, there appears to be a relationship between rate, wage and race.

63
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:50,760
We will create a multivariable model to see if this association can be explained by other factors.

64
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:59,330
What do I mean? If I go back here, I can see that the median for nonblacks, the median wage is much higher than that of blacks.

65
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:09,340
The mean, it's also higher. I did not do a bivariate analysis and I could have done that, but sort of skipped that test because

66
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,650
like I said, I can assume that, you know, let's assume that this is significant.

67
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:21,410
We're going to say we're going gonna see if that could possibly be explained by all the variables in our data.

68
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:29,320
Right. It is possible that nonblacks basically earn more because they're more educated.

69
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,120
Right. It is possible that they earn more because they have more years of experience.

70
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,380
Right. So there are other factors that could explain this association.

71
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:44,090
We're going to test this statistically if these other factors explain why the

72
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:51,450
nonblacks in our sample have higher wages than the black participants now.

73
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,540
Now let's go and do our regression.

74
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:01,090
This is an example of a multivariate analysis, multiverse because I have several variables

75
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:06,310
I have more than two variables. My outcome variable is log.wage

76
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:12,060
And that's the wage variable that I transform because it was so skewed initially, the distribution was very skewed

77
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,790
so I had to transform it. Lm means linear model

78
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:20,860
that's just still the function for running a regression.

79
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,730
And what I'm doing, I have race race is my main predictor,

80
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:30,430
right, and wages my outcome. I'm adding these all the variables I'm controlling for them.

81
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:38,170
I want to see if they explain the association that I'm seeing. What I have in this step is to get a summary of my regression.

82
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:43,570
To get a summary of my results and I'm also requesting the confidence intervals because the

83
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:50,170
confidence interval is the band within which I'm certain that my my outcome,

84
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:57,080
my my results lies in. Right. So let's run this. All right.

85
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,690
So the things we need to pay attention to with this, and I have interpretation later on,

86
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:08,900
we're looking at our main predictor, our main prediction is race and the Pr right here

87
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:16,130
this represents my P value. I can see right off the bat that my P value is two times ten to the minus sixteen.

88
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,760
This is less than .05 because

89
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,100
We start out by setting .05 as our alpha level,

90
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:35,510
even though I didn't say it. But so even in the presence of these other these other control variables, these covariates,

91
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:42,590
we can see that or association between race and our outcome, which was wage, is still significant.

92
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:47,690
But let's try to interpret this. Let's explain this in plain language.

93
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:56,600
So because I took the log of wage earlier on, I would have to exponentiation my my estimate.

94
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,090
What I mean by estimate. I have to exponentiation this number right here.

95
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,760
So this is my coefficient that I'm going to exponentiation,

96
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:11,390
I'm going to get Exponent and then I also have to exponentiate my my confidence interval.

97
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,470
This is my confidence interval right here, my 95 percent confidence interval.

98
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,480
I have exponentiate these values as well. And that's because I took a log of wage earlier on.

99
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,340
So let's do this. I wrote the code earlier on, obviously, to save time.

100
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,810
So if we run this. So it's given me my value.

101
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:36,800
So 1.26 is my estimate for race, specifically nonblack.

102
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,340
And then 1.23 to 1.29 is my 95 percent confidence interval.

103
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:51,760
How to interpret this? So we can say that being nonblack is associated with a 26 percent greater income

104
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,320
controlling for education, experience SMSA and region.

105
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,730
If SMSA makes no sense to you. It's right here. They tell you what it means.

106
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:06,770
It's an indicator for whether the person words words in or near a city.

107
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:13,460
So again, this study was conducted back in 1987, I think.

108
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:23,210
So the whole point is to show you how we can analyze separate variables, how we can analyze our own data to make it meaningful to us,

109
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:29,780
how we can operationalize statistical concepts and concepts and quantitative research.

110
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:39,240
And as public health researchers, as public health students, these factors in the grand scheme of things, they tie into your socio economic status.

111
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,180
So it's still relevant in the discussion of health outcomes.

112
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:50,960
But again, it's not so much to show you, you know, how race influenced your income back then,

113
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:57,170
but its to show you how you can analyze your variables, how you can make data analysis meaningful to you.

114
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:03,500
So earlier on, I showed you the Web sites on the PowerPoint, you see where you can download R,

115
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:09,290
and you can practice and everything will suddenly start makes making more sense.

116
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:15,760
The more you practice. So that's it for this segment, and thank you.
