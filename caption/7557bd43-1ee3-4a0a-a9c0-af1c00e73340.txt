1
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:19,800
Okay. Good morning, everyone. We are going to start our today's lecture.

2
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,390
I hope that what a great weekend. We have a new student.

3
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:31,940
Welcome. And today is the first day that we are going to have an interim presentation.

4
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:40,740
Then the way that this is going to work is going to lecture the first half of the class to introduce the topic.

5
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:47,430
Also some additional information and then the second half student would be present.

6
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,980
I will discuss the will lead the discussion based on the in the guide that I posted on campus.

7
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:02,700
Any questions so far about the class, about the readings of the homework, everything clear.

8
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:15,270
Then we are going to start today. We are going to talk about what is the type of evidence that we have about the diet of our ancestors.

9
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:28,530
What are also we are going to discuss well, what look like that diet now based on the evidence that we have from archeological remains?

10
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:36,900
This is a general trend of the diet of our ancestors.

11
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:47,280
You see that this is these time scale improvements of around seven, 6 million use in the past to the present,

12
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:59,640
because this time was when the what this upper separation divergence between our ancestors on the evolutionary line leading to the chimpanzee,

13
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:08,240
to the mother chimpanzee. Then around that time, based on what we know, also with comparison with our chimpanzee,

14
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,989
you feel that the diet of our ancestors was mostly based on plant based, was less plant based.

15
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:26,760
Diet was a very generalized diet, more likely similar to that one of our current chimpanzees now we are one then to also to discuss

16
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:34,170
to date our couple of millions of years after that with our evolution with that early hominins.

17
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,200
Like after we take this, for example,

18
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:48,300
it seemed that it was achieved from this type of generalized plant based diet to a more harder and abrasive, also plant based diet.

19
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,500
And we are going to discover what is the kind of area that we have for that.

20
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,490
The model is in about 2 million, so use.

21
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:09,390
Well, in the past when our ancestors started to use fire or stone as tool tools, there was an increase of meat eating.

22
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:20,430
We would see how that changed the body morphology of our ancestors and also what is the type of evidence that we have before that.

23
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:36,740
I just want to clarify here it's not exactly clear was what that time when of what ancestor they started to use the fire most likely.

24
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:46,729
Yes. Copying randomly. Maybe there was a lightning or maybe it was fired in the forest.

25
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:52,200
They they just they need maybe a piece of wood that was being burned.

26
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,270
And to use that, the domestication of the fire is in.

27
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:05,010
That happened later during the evolution maybe around 1 million use the past the multi-day video that we have about that the domestication of fire.

28
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:17,920
And then very resilient evolution, wind, the origin of agriculture and also the domestication of animals.

29
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,899
Our diet become more monotonous and more energy.

30
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:30,280
Drink. Then this is just our overall trend of about the evolution of the diet.

31
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:44,499
Now you remember these these people who tend to hold meetings and you have to remind you, you put together before you would approve it morally,

32
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:54,520
then you would see what the hominins that were eating a marginalized plant diet or they were eating maybe goat meat.

33
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:03,489
Then here, that one individual that you see here, most likely they are our love for our first ancestor,

34
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:14,230
that they started to use tools of fire, the Homo erectus, and that maybe the Homo habilis were the first one to start using fire and tools.

35
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:25,879
Now in the papers that you read, there was all this criticism about the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and early thing.

36
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,750
Then I just wanted to show you this big jaw, this field of men.

37
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,380
Then you can have an idea what these different ages they represent.

38
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:39,050
Now, the Paleolithic. These are usually called the Stone Age.

39
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:49,030
E to hold a from almost re medium what you do you see the past with the oriental homo.

40
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,670
I mean habilis up to more or less.

41
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,760
I will say ah, around 24 or 20,000 using the pass.

42
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,590
Then this is all, all this is brain prehistory in the Paleolithic.

43
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:12,530
There wasn't much creature at that time. We don't have historical evidence about that or not only we have archeological evidence.

44
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,010
Then you can see that the Paleolithic is ah, in time.

45
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,920
These are huge period of time. More than 2 million of years.

46
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,310
Then you can imagine how that diet was changing over that time.

47
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,830
In one of our lectures, I think at the end of the term,

48
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:39,190
we will discuss what people now called the Paleo diet, whether that is really about the diet with it,

49
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:49,700
that is good for the health, but that by looking at the whole range of time, you will see that there was a unique diet during the Paleolithic.

50
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:56,870
Anyone, whether you think you are looking at a huge period of time, more than 2 million so years.

51
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:08,820
Do you think that the idea was constant saying about that, you know, most likely, you know, most likely what's changed?

52
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:15,400
And also, you can imagine that it was a geographic variation even during that time.

53
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:27,430
Now, the other age of prehistory is what we call the Mesolithic, is a short period of time after the end of the Paleolithic.

54
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:35,410
It may be are around the time or the origin of the agriculture of the Neolithic.

55
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,590
It starts with the origin of agriculture, the first human societies,

56
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:49,569
and then what we call now in the in this will now we have more historical evidence.

57
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:59,410
We have the first Bible, the scriptures of writing, but now our focus is going to be in the type of the idea of our ancestors during the Paleolithic.

58
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:08,920
Now, during this class, I want for you to think about these theories.

59
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,270
When we talk about diet, you have to think again.

60
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:20,020
In natural selection, there was competition for resources not only between individuals,

61
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:28,090
but I think just about all the wheat within and between species that is going to determine that feeding behavior.

62
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,820
Now, I'm I'm on primates. We know or too that diet is not uniform.

63
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,920
We even now seeing in human societies, high ranking individuals usually have better access to resources.

64
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:50,410
Bless you then. And you see that consideration when we talk about the diet of our ancestors.

65
00:08:52,600 --> 00:09:00,520
We need to keep in mind that even within our group of our ancestors, maybe diet was not uniform.

66
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,740
Uniform maybe are the birth ranking that we know.

67
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,460
For example, now in chimpanzee that is rank ranking of alpha individual.

68
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,850
Maybe they have a access to food or other type of resources.

69
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,549
We will discuss that.

70
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:23,080
There were other geographic by regional resources and also we will discuss what is the type of evidence that we have about ancient diets.

71
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,780
In this part of the lecture, I'm going to go a little bit slow because I want to show you some of the evidence that we have.

72
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,100
You think genetics of or how our diets are changed over time.

73
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:44,830
Then if you have any question, please stop. Ma'am, any time. This is a little bit more I biology.

74
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,310
Then please let me know you have any question at once.

75
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,810
Now, this is the table of the genetic code.

76
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:59,680
Remember that our DNA, our genome, that information to make proteins,

77
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:06,909
that protein that are going to control your heart cells are the columns are

78
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:12,069
just three nucleotides and they are as if five different type of amino acids.

79
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,280
Remember that in the protein we have different type of amino acids.

80
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:24,360
This idea that you don't need to remember this, other than that, the different type of amino acid.

81
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,940
But for our class today, I want to just to point this out,

82
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:35,240
there are three specific columns that they are called a stop columns because they tell us that

83
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,490
they want to finish the formation of the protein when they're really producing proteins,

84
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,380
using the RNA, the messenger RNA in the reverse forms.

85
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,110
Then when we have any of these three columns, then the the production of that protein is stopped.

86
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:58,500
Da da da stop signal. Now, remember how da genetic information flow in our where cell.

87
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,470
We have that DNA in that nucleus.

88
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:12,870
Use that as a template, that messenger RNA form, and then that is going to serve as a template for the formation of a protein.

89
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,209
Then we have yet on is more protein. Yes.

90
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:27,030
Using the information of your name decided that we are actually serving glutamic acid 3 to 5 volumes carrying glutamic RC downstream.

91
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,110
But then we have the the is the PR and there is a similar protein.

92
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,400
You see you had an example.

93
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:50,010
Now, as you know, during the duplication of our DNA in the cell, it's possible that we are going to have mistakes and this is what we call mutations.

94
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,639
They are different type of mutations.

95
00:11:53,640 --> 00:12:03,390
I just want to to look in these for because it is going to be important for our discussion today why is called silent mutation sighted?

96
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,260
Because there is no change in the protein sequence. There is no effect.

97
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:18,140
Then here we have a change of DNA and a small segment and then there is going to be a mutation in these a procedure to copy.

98
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,810
Remember this, it just happened by chance. Loading duplication of that DNA is just a single mutation.

99
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:38,190
But you see because amino acid they can be CO for more than one triplet or nucleotide then that the

100
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:45,950
sequence of the protein in the same you see that in the original K was three valine proline tyrosine.

101
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,910
Oh and you'll see that the sequence and after the mutation nothing.

102
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:56,520
Then these are what we call a silent mutation. Then most likely they are going, they are not going to have any phenotypic effect.

103
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:09,030
Now they are all mutations that are called missense imitations missense because there is a change in the amino acid.

104
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:27,300
Then again we have our mutation. Now this C is going to be mutated to A, but now the amino acid proline is going to be substituted by thrown in.

105
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:35,880
Then we are going to have a change of that. I mean, on that protein amino acid secret, what do you think the effect of this type of mutations?

106
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:42,959
Let's say that is a change from the amino acid. Any guess about how this is going to affect the phenotype of that function?

107
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:53,880
The protein B will drastically change the phenotype get because gender phenotype and also it will depend that that type of the amino acid,

108
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,470
they change because of amino acid. They have similar biochemical features.

109
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,260
They have similar biochemical features. Maybe it's not as strong, but it could be strong.

110
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:15,780
Changes now are very severe mutations, what we call that known since mutations and this is not very severe.

111
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:23,540
Now we have a mutation, but the mutation, what is going to introduce Johan is double.

112
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,150
Then as a consequence, we are going to have a shorter protein than normal.

113
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,560
You'll see that the ordinal protein we have for amino acids in this one, we have only three.

114
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:49,030
Now the bam when the wing sorry where where in the sequence the mutation happens is going to be the effect.

115
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,690
You can imagine it happens at the very beginning with the protein.

116
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,380
Then we are going to have a very poor protein, most likely without function.

117
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,660
Then the event that happens that that area may be is no way to be and a strong effect.

118
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,240
But usually these nonsense mutation, they have a very strong phenotypic effect.

119
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:18,430
And the other type of mutation is what we call either in therapy or deletion.

120
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,920
And what's happened is that we can lose nucleotides during duplication.

121
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:31,510
Then in this example, we lose two nucleotides.

122
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,150
I remember because the amino acids, they are called in triplets or nucleotides.

123
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:42,820
Then we could change the whole sequence of amino acid after the after the mutation.

124
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,150
Physically, just repeat what you said. But these that group, what's it called?

125
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:55,150
Yes. These are in general, these are called frame chief mutations.

126
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:01,850
Fringe mutations. I don't know.

127
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:07,100
And the idea is that, um, remember the amino acid?

128
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,790
They are co in triplets of nucleotides. Mm hmm.

129
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,660
Now, you remove or add one or two.

130
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:22,280
Exactly what if? Completely. Now eat you up three or multiple of three things.

131
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,400
Going to add amino acid, but want to keep the same frame.

132
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,640
But also these are very typical. You'll see that the the sequence of amino acids is going to change.

133
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:43,860
Okay. Just keep this in mind that what I'm talking about, these are molecular mechanisms because in the human genome,

134
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:51,060
we observe these type of mutations that give us evidence about change of our diet in the past.

135
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:58,170
Now, that is a protein, the myosin heavy chain 16 protein.

136
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:13,470
This protein is produced in the in the muscle, in non-human primates, in domestic artery muscles, in non-human primates.

137
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:21,150
However, in humans, then by non-human primates, I mean that chimpanzee, gorilla,

138
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,840
orangutan or that or other primates supporting primate, but not humans.

139
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:39,500
However, in humans, we don't produce these these protein well, these that food protein because that is the initial remote.

140
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:45,690
Remember the said removal of two base pairs in that gene for this protein.

141
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:54,540
Then it is quite possible that that loss of function of these protein, remember this protein is expressed in domestic auto animals.

142
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:04,860
Then it is possible that that lead to an is molar mass Victorian motoring humans compared to non-human primates.

143
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:12,080
Veronica, does this here.

144
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,390
The motor in our mandible. Oh, okay. Yeah.

145
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:25,399
All right. And sorry. Protease inhibitors, you might need this.

146
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:31,700
The full protein is not produced in humans due to a two base pairs deletion as a lame insulin.

147
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,520
You that in the in the in the next in this next slide.

148
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:47,840
Now this is the sequence of that gene comparison you can see remember these are the different nucleotide and here in this are these later

149
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:58,250
they simulated here they represent amino acids that different amino acids as comparison we have this is a sequence from another human.

150
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,500
Now these are more than the human is.

151
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:09,410
They are DNA remains from an archeological site in Montana.

152
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:17,179
I think the estimation is that these humans leave at about 12 to 13000 years.

153
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:24,770
In the past, although we have sequenced from the now dental remember that we're now we're able

154
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,370
to sequence that movement that are not visible from that any following these.

155
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,910
So they're hominins related to us.

156
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,630
Now if you compare the sequence of that chimpanzee with that with as you see

157
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:45,889
our sequence or there are homonyms that these two nucleotide here that these

158
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:52,160
see and this ape that is present in chimpanzee is lost in humans and other

159
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,700
hominids as a consequence is going to change the sequence of the mean amino acid

160
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:03,829
up here in this position where it went to have an is double column that is

161
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,040
not only a friendship mutation is going to change that sequence with them in

162
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,739
life but also is going to introduce as a consequence we are went to our planet

163
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,040
stopped column and therefore we are going to have that short term protein.

164
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,570
Those are not functional in humans now.

165
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:32,490
A thorough we know known human the full sequence.

166
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:43,800
Apparently know that human that we have you know Diebold researchers are not putting out into London so I'm all quarantined leaving humans.

167
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:48,270
We have these two deletion. We don't have this full protein now.

168
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,480
Then this question if we during the evolution of went on Saturday lost this protein,

169
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:10,170
you can imagine that maybe there was a disadvantage for that because then we don't have this is of more false to to the weird heart food.

170
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:18,780
Not that question we how these mutation what fixated by fixated I mean that reaches 100% frequency

171
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:28,109
doesn't mean fixated that is that this mutation has a frequency of 100% in more population.

172
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:39,360
That is not yet that is not the other value meaning that presence that what why you can imagine that having weaker more muscles,

173
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:48,100
you can have some harmful effects. Mm hmm. Then which other?

174
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,339
What I'm trying to ask you is I see how this happened.

175
00:21:53,340 --> 00:22:02,790
How do how these mutations in our 100% present in humans through our through our diet, because we don't we don't require such a large, like jaw.

176
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:07,530
And we don't you know, the process of mastication is like much smaller.

177
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,159
Exactly. Compared to themselves. It's 100%.

178
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,550
So that because of.

179
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:23,900
Like did this mutation occur for our shift in a diet or because of the shift?

180
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,600
Yeah, that's a great that's a great question.

181
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:34,489
But with observation, when these mutations happen, not remember, mutations are random mutations that are random.

182
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:39,799
They are just happening. Natural selection is not looking at the future and say, okay,

183
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,770
I'm going to introduce imitation for people that are going to to have for food in the future.

184
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:51,860
Now then, because the mutation is now 100% present in humans,

185
00:22:51,860 --> 00:23:01,010
then we can maybe think that maybe the mutation just by Johns Hopkins around the same time that we started to use fabulous tools

186
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:14,420
that then we didn't need is this throw more protein like your to eat now what other evidence that we have now using some estimates

187
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:21,139
if that deletion of the gene in that we're combining the initial meaning that line leading to humans and remember I just want

188
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:33,920
to go back here if this mutation what happened some point around here interesting some point here about 2.4 million so usable.

189
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:48,010
Now. The earliest evidence for cooking behavior in Aware during our evolution is about 1.9 million.

190
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:58,060
We're using that. But now these mutations seem to happen before evidence of cooking now.

191
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:05,820
But this is the earliest evidence in diabetes that we have right now is quite possible that we were using cooking even before that.

192
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:10,890
What ancestor were using cooking before that? Yeah. Maybe even talk rationally.

193
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:19,000
But if they weren't using cooking in in of frequency,

194
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:32,469
then maybe this mutation was able to remain in our genome and their domestication or failure that the more are for food,

195
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:41,500
for some food then that Mediterranean point to be fixed in our in our brain also expanded when.

196
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:48,280
Yes. Yeah. So maybe had it moved down for exactly our own descent.

197
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,579
Tiny.

198
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:59,020
Also remember our brain was getting bigger then and this is very common in evolution only for brain on your back that what we have got evolution.

199
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:07,300
Yeah. So without traits can change at the same time doing exactly what brain is going to to occupy more size,

200
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:13,300
you know what is is called then you can imagine that we're going to have lots of reduction jobs.

201
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,340
Question.

202
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:29,960
No, it's quite interesting how how looking in our genome, we can also have some kind of evidence of change if in our diet you put in the past.

203
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:42,350
Professor, I just I just want to bring on the table based on my my study that we have been upgraded a few times, which like virus is one way in.

204
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,710
Almost all of us right now got public takeover at least once.

205
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:54,380
So is is there will be changing of something and rewritten and for all that's what you're saying 100% or something sufficiently frequent.

206
00:25:54,450 --> 00:26:01,730
David Halberstam president mean in more humans now be remember mutations are random.

207
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:09,370
We all are happening every time. I know, but the what I'm talking about is intentional of.

208
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,030
They're looking this or or that type of evidence came from other genes.

209
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:20,120
They are this two gene that does that to our 64 and thus to our 6062.

210
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:25,820
They call for receptors in that plume or for bitter taste.

211
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:34,000
Now also what is quite interesting is that we don't have these receptors, humans, we don't have the protectors.

212
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,690
Wow. They are only operating our game in non-human primates.

213
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:49,890
Now and again this is looking at DNA sequence comparing chimpanzee that first line modern humans.

214
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:58,500
These are the added remains, archeological remains from Montana from about 12,000 years in the past, Neanderthal and Denisovan.

215
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:09,660
Now you'll see that in chimpanzee. That sequence here above for that are 62 genes comparing to the other hominin to hominins.

216
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,470
There is a deletion of two nucleotides.

217
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:25,360
As a consequence, we are going to have on his column here that the A.G. said, stop calling you,

218
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:34,640
and then we are going to have a court that pretends nonfunctional and nothing happens for us to ask for.

219
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,470
There is deletion and we are going to have hugging and a stop column.

220
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,050
Therefore, an unfortunate protein. Yes.

221
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:50,760
Professor, I read the paper saying that the paper the better.

222
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,680
And in nature, some are poisoning.

223
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,959
Yep. So they taste it and they know what to do when taking it.

224
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,640
But for us, for some reason, some the bitter remedies.

225
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,570
Like a cream deliberately. Yeah. And this and then that. That's a good observation.

226
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,160
We could. Let me ask you this question.

227
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:14,360
Okay. First, because they are totally Denisovans.

228
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:22,890
So they have this mutation. They have a religion that is in that this mutation happens about 600,000 in the past.

229
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:28,360
Remember, that was more or less that time when I where they are 10,000 other humans diverge.

230
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,210
Now, if we don't have these be their receptors,

231
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:45,270
then that means that we are not going to taste the molecules that were that are that were binding to those protectors.

232
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:51,660
Now, what are the advantages of that? They say we don't taste beta for that particular food.

233
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:59,180
Then we enter, we end of eating more like, you know, the bitters as should be medicines like dandelion,

234
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:04,510
the greens and brussel sprouts or something like that. Yeah. Yet they may be still I think.

235
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:09,630
Still we don't know what are the, the, the molecule that were targeted by the receptors.

236
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,650
But you can imagine the one advantage you don't have,

237
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:25,080
you don't having the BW say today I went to eat more food however they are degrees to what are the risks poison poisons because

238
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:35,220
maybe maybe that food what we are taste about what like the receptor was poisoned we don't know yet but this is also a risk.

239
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:39,600
But then we have bigger brains to find out which ones poisons.

240
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:43,290
Yeah, we can learn. We come there together, we can live there.

241
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:47,300
And in France we can tell me that knowledge to our offspring.

242
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:58,649
Okay, now, now, regarding the change of dietary preferences, then in humans and only in humans,

243
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:03,600
also in primates, we know that there is a balance between conservatism,

244
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:13,470
meaning that we dealt with what we know that is safe water with novelty or but we know that we can they risk to eat new foods.

245
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:21,970
Now imagine happening this in the past because now we know with or with food that poison and with our time dangerous now

246
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:30,650
under certain ecological conditions imagine is capacity of food in certain period of time then I will insist on needed

247
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:41,950
to take those risk on there is this what we call food denial phobia that is that being wary on your food and if feel

248
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:48,060
that also is common among humans and also non-human primates meaning that we tend to eat what we know that is safe.

249
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:57,020
When he won. We should remember that all happened in social groups.

250
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:02,320
I went on say they were seen as social, organic, social individuals.

251
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,150
They may be the affect on your food flow to have a social component.

252
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:14,100
Even this is happening in nonhuman primates that new foods are more likely to be eating.

253
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:22,830
Others in that group provided that food also using non-human primates.

254
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:30,540
We know that some foods are more easily affected. These are high in sugar, for example, for that immediate palatability.

255
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:41,370
And this is true that you know that this behavior is higher in younger groups that tend to be more risky behavior.

256
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:55,739
They may be we don't know that maybe during evolution rather younger subjects where the one day thing you put some interesting analytic sample of

257
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:10,760
of a signature of genomic evolution showing our dietary chip eating that gene for the amylase that egg and white one gene that go for the amylase.

258
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:16,410
I mean, they seem that is responsible for the digestion of the starch.

259
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:26,200
Starches are a major dietary component of modern humans. Insect and population can be up to 70% of caloric intake.

260
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,610
What is quite interesting is that we modern humans have multiple copies of the gene.

261
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:39,250
You know what you know? Multiple copies. Yes, we imagine that we have the gene, but we have it in copies.

262
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:45,460
Exactly. Repeat it. What do you think? Is that just in kissing deletion?

263
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:51,520
Yeah, but remember, there are a major component of our diet is starch.

264
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:57,400
Oh, then you can imagine that if we are eating more starch, we're going to have more copies of the gene.

265
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:02,589
See? And in fact, this is what we observe.

266
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:06,790
And this is data from human subpopulations in red.

267
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:15,850
We have in the real world from a grown up population with low starch diet and in gray,

268
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,360
we have individual well-trained population with a high starch value.

269
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:31,330
Whether you observe this in this graph that the histogram shifted to the right or the people eating high starch, they have more copies of that gene.

270
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:37,270
And in fact, you see here the medium for the high starch population, that median of copies is seven.

271
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,220
And for that always starch is just five. Refers to the starch.

272
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,630
You're talking milling grain. You talk about grains.

273
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,540
Yes. Complex, complex carbohydrates. Yes.

274
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,850
See, the animals don't eat so much of those. But we do.

275
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,450
We will start to agriculture. Yeah. Then what do you think?

276
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:10,460
What? Actually the weather. How do you think? Our ancestors, they say now, then how they need soil, even after uptake.

277
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,720
Would they forge or what?

278
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:19,360
What do you think about the copies of eating? Do they have more than many copies?

279
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:24,100
No. In fact, this is what we observe. This is comparing this graph.

280
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,920
What would it show you?

281
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:36,010
That moment of God you see up here, if you go, they say without copy so that you then see the Montana remains again and the other tree.

282
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:42,310
Here they are, more humans. And you'll see that we have different copy thing in modern humans.

283
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:48,650
However, these apps in Indonesia all are not really under color because they were not eating a starch oil.

284
00:34:48,790 --> 00:35:02,620
They were not eating the amount of start eating today. Then you see another example of all of how our genome also is changing to adapt to our diets,

285
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:07,510
because there's a comparing assuming that between you and me,

286
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:14,950
and if somebody just tried to do the low starch diet and over within the timeframe of our lifetime.

287
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,599
Well, I have less actually. I think not.

288
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:24,460
I think what will happen is that, you know, our our our own lifetime.

289
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:34,540
But if we let's say you start with high starch diet more and more and more and more, then because these mutations are going to happen by chance,

290
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:41,109
then it's possible that we are going to have a subject with a high number of copies that maybe is going to be more likely to

291
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:48,780
pass those copies to the next generation than what looks eventually achieved in the number of copies after some genetics.

292
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:53,770
See. Justin, thanks. Okay, then again, what?

293
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,960
When do you think this increase in the number of copies having been there during human evolution?

294
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:09,580
Well, recent or recent baking may be a reason because it related to the use of starch.

295
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,600
And in fact, if that is about 10,000 using the pass model at that time, both the original [INAUDIBLE] cloture.

296
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:26,970
Western so far. Okay. Now, this part is based on the evidence, on the readings.

297
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:42,120
Then before our break, I want to introduce you then in the second part again, I want to have that discussion lead by the student.

298
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,680
But I want to to introduce here some of the topics.

299
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:55,040
Now, what are the type of evidence that we use to try to reconstruct energy diets?

300
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,880
They are two different approaches. One are what we call the indirect approaches.

301
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:08,940
For example, the morphology, the phase that these mandible or archeological remains are,

302
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:13,880
the direct approaches that that dental macro wear and also the stable isotope.

303
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:27,360
I think you read in one of the papers in the paper, you saw the finger and you see the morphological evidence from the absolute ridiculous africanus.

304
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:35,310
This is the panther, people say, and the Homo habilis. Now you have to look in the morphology.

305
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:42,510
What kind of food you what you think, what eating this different of our ancestors.

306
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:50,090
Let's say they are full of bitterness Africans. Do you?

307
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:54,190
Okay, you have it here. So.

308
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,910
So if cutting. Yep. And some for grinding.

309
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:10,070
Mhm. Oh the thing I know cities do they have the point that they do now.

310
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:15,250
These what. Oh yeah. How many people they have gone to.

311
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,680
The jury did it last year. Just a job. 828.

312
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:24,680
Do not, I don't know. Five, six, seven. You know, I don't know how many they 32.

313
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:33,340
But I think there was a change and I think that table that what that was that these you know 32 and there's around.

314
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:47,950
Yeah between that they compare with that chimpanzee that kind of thing they they they got smaller less I would say more flat flatter.

315
00:38:48,290 --> 00:39:00,199
Uh, now based on this evidence, initially people postulated that it was achieved from the, from soft food that was eaten for the antelope.

316
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:05,270
It was African, for example. They bought fruit, maybe some young leaf.

317
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:15,680
But you compare to the to the soil of I wouldn't say to the pound wrapper say you see that is bulkier than people proposed.

318
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:22,490
Um with the backdrop of was eating more hard foods like nuts seeds sodium.

319
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:26,370
And then we had the hobo I mean they started to use tool fire.

320
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:34,219
You see the we have smaller morphology than people who did that.

321
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:40,350
Maybe the homo idea. What? Eating a more bite by Ed Foods professor.

322
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:45,319
Mm hmm. We have. We have also studied to two teeth.

323
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:53,750
Teeth, but. Mm hmm. Well, how come we are advised to pull the wisdom to sell us for?

324
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,080
Because people say to pull them out. Got them pulled out.

325
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:57,710
Yeah.

326
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:07,130
Because they usually I think they don't get that because they it by design or if it's just a little bit smaller, you know, because I find them useful.

327
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:11,380
Well, like I haven't had mine removed because all my teeth are really small,

328
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:18,500
but for a lot of people I know they hit they hit the nerve before they buy more modern diet.

329
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:25,640
We don't chew as hard, therefore our jaw is not as extended and they it makes the teeth crooked.

330
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,850
And that's why the the big business to straighten itself.

331
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:34,420
But then some of us had to get the back pulled out. Okay, let's continue.

332
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,280
Okay. Are limitations a limitation of these of values, use of morphological evidence,

333
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:46,339
that morphology, that morphology only is telling us where the hominins are,

334
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,230
what ancestor were capable of eating,

335
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:57,500
not the actual food that is okay by looking in the in the now my volumes okay they weren't able to eat that but we're not sure.

336
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:04,250
I mean, they were actually eating that. Also, we know that face morphology is in or that type of selection.

337
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:09,170
For example, sexual selection that may be was not completely related to eating to food.

338
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:14,569
Also is evidence that genetic drift can affect face morphology.

339
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:18,070
We can have changes on the face morphology during evolution. Yeah.

340
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,070
Due to our genetic drift now are so important.

341
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:27,530
This is important. Is this in one of your papers? If we look in the making, aware of that teeth,

342
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:40,430
then we can see where there are what ancestors they were eating heart food or soft food because this type of microbe were different.

343
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:45,320
They are eating heart food that we have this type of microwave that we call complex.

344
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:52,340
If they were eating soft, we had this that type of microbe where they scored simple or isotropic.

345
00:41:53,570 --> 00:42:06,560
Now, the problem with this source or the problem with this type of imitation of evidence is that micro where or that these is the emperor,

346
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:14,750
you change over time. You should know what our own lifetime then can reflect only that diet,

347
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:20,930
feel that maybe last weeks of life, because this is changing over in our lifetime,

348
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:32,299
then the evidence that we have from from our data remains is only reflects what that particular individual was eating during that.

349
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,620
I would note that of this week, last one week? No, maybe days.

350
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:41,390
Weeks. But your plan is not reflecting the whole life diet.

351
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:47,560
But it but but if we start to eat soft and we started decayed become like that

352
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,300
then also looking in that type of microwave from the frame of our ancestor,

353
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:57,380
you'll see that there is a huge operation in the exascale here we.

354
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:05,010
That complexity. Remember the complex represent heart and thus the import represents of by.

355
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:16,050
You'll see here that even for the band troubles robust of support to it only higher not unseat with her heart used by relational complexity.

356
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:25,920
For all that, we seem less variation. But what this microwave is telling us is that it is activated by racial values.

357
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:36,170
And this is an imitation that I was telling you before, that dental macro, where if fleeting, it changes our own lifetime.

358
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:42,720
Our lifetime only represents days or weeks or night before this.

359
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:50,300
Okay. We're fine. How we doing?

360
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:55,490
Okay. Okay. This is. This is interesting. I'm going to add that stable isotope.

361
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:04,730
You know, they naturally, the elements they have, even in hydro isotope, depending on the number of neutrons,

362
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:15,590
neutrons in that in the nucleus, now that we can measure and we have these isotopes in different proportions in nature.

363
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:25,100
The important thing for our purposes is that we can measure that ratio with the different isotopes and they are going to reflect dilute,

364
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:31,700
they means blend. That is a particular ratio that we call the Delta 13 Z value.

365
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:41,870
That gives us an indication of the relative proportion of plant three or C four that we are eating.

366
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:51,260
Hmm. This is the way that people calculate these issues and it's dander from our fossil record.

367
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:56,660
But what important for our purposes the higher this value.

368
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,620
The the budget is bad.

369
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:07,070
You represent more diet in C4 plants.

370
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:11,389
See, for now, what do you know what I see?

371
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:17,810
Three, three, four plants. Would you say to stay there when the cedar is higher?

372
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:24,200
Yes. The value that the 13 C value is higher represent a dollar richer.

373
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,390
You can see four plants. See if we don't, I. I'm not sure about the plants.

374
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,030
Anyone? Yes. Yes. Ah, that.

375
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:42,499
That depends on the type of photo field they see that they're using, that they see three plants and they are also three,

376
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:51,860
because that first molecule that they use to fix carbon is a molecule with three carbons and I see four, they use four carbons.

377
00:45:52,730 --> 00:46:00,740
Now the C3 plants are the most frequent in the world.

378
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:06,620
I think they represent about 80. 85% of all the plants in the world are three.

379
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,690
Here you have some example like a rice, sunflower or cherries.

380
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:23,270
They are the most common in the world. However, during photosynthesis they have this hole where they do water, what they call for the respiration.

381
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:30,620
They they lose oxygen. Therefore, they are not quite yet acted to very warm climate.

382
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:39,170
Then the C4 plant, they are locked to a strong sunlight and they are mostly tropical grasses.

383
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:49,700
The corn is one of them for only subsidy for plant course are hard to digest and are very aware and want to talk about that.

384
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:54,470
See that plants? They are mostly soft succulents and they are very uncommon.

385
00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:00,650
So I feel that he had there are some example that they thought that things you value

386
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:06,170
you see for example for city plants these value is low tend to be more negative.

387
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:16,550
For example, wheat, rice, beans, most of the fruit and vegetable and C4 plants corn, sugarcane, sorghum.

388
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:30,260
The the other isotope that we used to measure dilute that nitrogen will yield that delta 14 and value.

389
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,079
The higher this value,

390
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:40,549
the important point they want to make is that the higher this value is going to give us an indication that trophic level carnivores,

391
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:54,020
they tend to have a higher value, that herbivores and also people that eat a lot of marine food, seafood, they tend to have a higher N14 value.

392
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,410
And this is an example of these values. Here we have, for example, carnivores.

393
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:14,610
This in the animal organism, you see that the higher the trophic level, the higher the N14 value carnivore.

394
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:18,420
They tend to have a higher value for these the 15.

395
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:24,490
Do they have to be fish, you told? No, not any other organism.

396
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,750
I'm giving you the example of kind of more human. Yeah, we can make good using humans.

397
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:37,750
And so the blue whales are all the algae, even though they are almost as big as the killer whales right there.

398
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:43,120
Yeah, but they say that exactly that this carnivore, that they hide the carnivore, they have a higher value of these.

399
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:51,580
But blue whales and vegetarians know the, you know, dying humans, kids that are breast feeding.

400
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:57,190
How far what? How do you think these are? Value humans for babies are breast feeding.

401
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:03,000
All right. So who is higher? They have the value they have.

402
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:06,460
Is that usually the value that we observe for carnivores? Wow.

403
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,670
Now, these are then we can use this type.

404
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:17,920
Now we can measure these values, for example, impulse using archeological remains in bones.

405
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:27,520
We have access to one for ideological sites. We can measure these and also we can measuring in using sample more samples.

406
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:31,120
Then this is an example of some results.

407
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,710
This is from the floppy disk with Africanus, floppy, durable stuff.

408
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:40,840
And here we have that. For example, here of that they are implicitly for plants.

409
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:46,320
And here we have horses that they eat mortality for plants.

410
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:52,480
You'll see that that the diet is highly enriched in C4 plants.

411
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,320
The the diet is going to be this value question.

412
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,980
How do you think that this body will more human being with their society?

413
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,010
See through. See through. Hi. This is for high sugar.

414
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:17,879
I guess it matters what parts of the country. Let's say that you with, says city professor.

415
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,120
We eat the animals that eat a lot of seafood because they all want go.

416
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:26,190
A lot of them are growing. Not growing, but corn fed.

417
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:30,170
Yeah. What does that mean yet? Exactly.

418
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:35,040
Right in the right direction. It is. I feel like it's like sugar.

419
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:39,990
Yeah. We eat a lot of corn. Exactly.

420
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:44,190
Exactly. Right there. Eventually. Mostly with a lot of corn.

421
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:48,060
I'm sorry. Yes.

422
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,460
I read this paper that even if we compared the body, for example,

423
00:50:53,460 --> 00:51:00,840
compared to agriculture societies, that they eat corn, he in more societies, much higher.

424
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,900
That's true. And this is this is how I change over time.

425
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:13,650
This is based on bombs of remains from archeological sites or historical science sites.

426
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:23,310
You see, this is used in the past. You'll see that during the past 3000 years, in the past 2000, 1000, the these body was small.

427
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:31,050
They were mostly based on military plans. However, in their society on the increase of corn.

428
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:40,950
Hmm. Either directly or indirectly. Now we have these high values for society like Amish.

429
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:46,320
And they don't really feed their house with the cause, do they?

430
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:51,080
You see in those people probably have more C3 the could be depends on where they are,

431
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:56,040
what type of plants they are eating or their animals they are eating.

432
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:01,020
How monico you probably question you know we haven't measured these.

433
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:06,959
Yeah. Because ah okay about but also they eat corn directly.

434
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:16,140
Korea these up is partly a staple so but GMO or not but I think now with GMO now is become GM now becoming GMO.

435
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:22,430
I see. Now I'm going to finish this part.

436
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,969
Okay. This election result of these three values,

437
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:34,730
comparing our dividend of our ancestors here to live our our ancestors, they were eating more fatty plants.

438
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:40,760
And to that right are the ones that were eating more C3 plants, not the other way around.

439
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:41,660
To the left.

440
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:53,510
To the left that they represent C3 plants here too, that if and to the right of our ancestors, they were getting C4 plants, more C4 plants.

441
00:52:55,370 --> 00:53:01,070
Then also you see the end up as it was about racial and ethnic problems that our we're eating.

442
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:08,840
Now remember that C3 are the more common type of plant in nature.

443
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:25,920
Now I'll and this paper is one model that you read and this is an archeological remain from the I think it's in Israel.

444
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:36,690
They found this archeological site is from the lower middle Paleolithic around maybe a hundred thousand years in the past.

445
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:40,200
This is another thing that we're going to discuss,

446
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:49,290
because most of all of the archeological evidence of past diets depends on what we are able to find,

447
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:55,770
what is able to remain during all this time to be done.

448
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:07,560
Now we found it. Now you can imagine, as you can imagine, what are the most likely remains to do that we are going to find.

449
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:14,830
The remaining bombs that it's called.

450
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:23,350
Exactly. Bomb from animals. And then maybe that is going to introduce a bias in our our knowledge of what?

451
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:29,290
Because because that's what is more easy, easier to talk to, to be preserved during time.

452
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:34,540
But is it? But it could be. That was not the only thing that they were eating.

453
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:38,500
Maybe was not the most common type of food that they were eating.

454
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:47,110
Now that these results were quite interesting because they found these archeological sites from almost 300,000 years in the past.

455
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:52,060
And what they found was a huge by racial or plant based diet.

456
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:58,930
They were this is a very lucky finding because plant one way they were preserving this site.

457
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:05,650
And you see here. Yes. If we look in that in that in that figurine, that graph to the right,

458
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:13,420
you'll see that different type of of plant based food that they found fruit, not seed.

459
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:18,490
These feel as though they are underground aspirational organs.

460
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:22,450
They are these bigger roots are reaching in starches.

461
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:33,790
For example, the you know, the the yucca yucca, Utah, I think they call it cassava and certain.

462
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:43,479
These are ruled as a very real vegetable, except that these are ruled by BP.

463
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,350
Refined starches is very is is very popular.

464
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:53,559
Now, do you think Costa Rica, other people, that routine is like a terrible soup.

465
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,980
And then also they are wet, unsafe.

466
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:01,300
So they were for eating these underground to or against reaching and starches.

467
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:09,020
And you see that you variation also there was about reaching or during seasonal

468
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:14,889
time because they were able to 25 different type of plant they would be

469
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:19,990
full of wet ancestor where heat in the in the also winter spring and summer of

470
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:26,050
we as back of spring and summer we found more variation of plant by steel.

471
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:31,330
You know, during the winter there was a lot variation of plant based diet.

472
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:35,590
In this particular you can remain burning. So they do a lot of like.

473
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:42,250
Like how many? You should be involved.

474
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:51,160
But do they be sort of like seasonality? Like the fact that our diets naturally fluctuate in how much of.

475
00:56:54,890 --> 00:57:01,400
Yet. I don't know whether in this paper that the problem is done again with these type of studies,

476
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:07,010
teaching archeological remains that we don't know even we've found these.

477
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,900
That's that's it's evident that they were eating that.

478
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:17,840
But we don't know that individual variation in which amount they were eating these then we don't know the.

479
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:25,590
For example, we want to know they weren't eating enough macronutrients and we somehow we support them with this type of feeding,

480
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:41,870
even given that information. Now, what what is telling us this type of result is that there is they wouldn't eating in by region plant and

481
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:48,440
if that were for the day it wasn't only protein based I mean not all animal based also was a plant based.

482
00:57:52,610 --> 00:58:01,100
No. You have to finish my part. Then I want to discuss this in Lake.

483
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:05,440
Lady Lake. When talking about what? Now people call you Daddy.

484
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:12,670
But please keep asking yourself what kind of evidence we have to reconstruct the

485
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:16,970
diet in the past and the limitations that we have for that type of evidence.

486
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:23,800
Mostly we need archeological evidence, then archeological evidence, yes.

487
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:30,900
By the nature of the evidence is going to be biased through bone is good that that remains then,

488
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:34,430
but therefore is going to be biased towards the protein based diet.

489
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:40,430
However, the results from this last paper that we were discussing there is hardly citing Israel.

490
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:50,150
So yes, I wish bluntly too. Now this site is located in the Middle East, a Lebanese quarter Levantine corridor.

491
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:52,820
I'm most likely to remember when our ancestors,

492
00:58:53,120 --> 00:59:01,790
where it were leaving Africa to the rest of the world that were most likely that region with the water they passed to go to other parts.

493
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:07,820
Then we don't know. I think the paper they mentioned that they don't know for how long.

494
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:14,990
We're not set to leave in that place because you can imagine that maybe it was a temporary stop in the migration,

495
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:19,490
or maybe they were a group that lived there for many years. We don't know that type of evidence.

496
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:29,600
But still, what I want to point out is that there is not a single Paleolithic diet before there because we have a huge range of time,

497
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:33,620
we have a huge geographic variation and also added.

498
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:39,950
So what we have are evidence of the region base plan based W.

499
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:53,300
Question. Okay then let's do 5 minutes break before we start the second part of the class.

500
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:10,944
To. But to be, I think because on record we bring you the lecture.
