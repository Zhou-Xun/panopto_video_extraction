1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:15,790
OK. Harumi.

2
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:24,640
OK. Oh, sorry about that, but I don't think is going to be like that, but you have to figure it out again.

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,680
So welcome. Is HMG 600 the health services system?

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,790
That's not right yet. HP 600, the health services system.

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:47,470
Welcome, everyone. I'm really happy to see you all here after you, since to some extent so and I think for many of you,

6
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:54,550
this is like your only person was so good that you've been talking to each other quite a lot.

7
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,450
That's one of the great things that'll be the case in this class,

8
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:07,840
that we get to actually talk in person with other people in your class with your needs, as well as me and Denise Anthony.

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,760
Welcome. So today we're going to be just doing some introductions.

10
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:18,940
We're going to go through the syllabus. We're going to talk about what we're doing here and why we're here.

11
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:24,670
And that's about it. And hopefully, you know, we've tested out the technology,

12
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:33,310
but we hope that this is going to continue to work throughout the semester before we get started.

13
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,260
Some of you heard this acknowledgment.

14
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:44,620
I think it's really important to start the semester acknowledging the land that we're on in the history of this land.

15
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:50,200
And this is the acknowledgment of the contributions of the indigenous people,

16
00:01:50,200 --> 00:02:02,110
which is essentially that the contribution of the land on which the University of Michigan sits and and lots of all of the state of Michigan, really.

17
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:12,160
So you might have heard this in other classes, the way that you da'wah that Bottom-Up Boto a dominations made the largest single gift

18
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,430
to the University of Michigan early in its history that established this campus,

19
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:30,610
among other things. And so we acknowledge that gift and the ongoing contribution of the Anishinaabe people to the university.

20
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:36,250
So today, just a brief overview of what we're going to do.

21
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:44,680
We're going to start out by talking sort of why we're here, why we're here in this class, why we're here,

22
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:53,560
why you're here for the programs that you're in and you're in a variety of programs and

23
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:01,900
why that's going to how we're going to think about that for our class for the semester.

24
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,380
We're going to go through the course canvass site.

25
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:14,260
That's going to be the core thing we're going to do today to just go over the syllabus, some of the requirements and expectations for this class,

26
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:23,290
some important notes about how we'll interact with each other and expectations, the assignments, etc.

27
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:32,500
I'm going to talk just a little bit about the mountain teams and how we're going to try to use teams this year in the class.

28
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:45,430
And then we'll talk a little bit about health services just to get, you know, get us thinking and ready for the semester.

29
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:54,460
And what I didn't put on there is before we do all of this is I want to just do some welcome with all of you.

30
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:06,940
So you've been filling out the slides, is it?

31
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:13,180
Do you remember this year that you've been doing this, what did you think that was just for me?

32
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,220
I mean, it is, but it's also for all of you.

33
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,540
And so what I want to do is just really quickly go through these.

34
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,840
And so when your name comes up, stand up.

35
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:38,350
I got to do it and they will tell us your name if you try to speak.

36
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:50,350
And we should remind you of this back and forth and back. Sometimes we'll slow down here across the desks and the slide will be up there.

37
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:58,390
So just say just something really brief where you're from. But then whether it's the book or the movie or something you want to say about that.

38
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:08,690
So this is not health care. This is not how this is not, you know, being a part of it and you know what you're talking about in anyway.

39
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:16,980
This is just something to share about yourself. And you get a lot of great recommendations for books and shows and podcasts.

40
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:24,280
And so it's a lot of fun. This is me.

41
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:34,570
Did he seem to be from kind of a little town in the middle of Pennsylvania near Penn State, if anybody knows where that is?

42
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:42,880
I read the Committed by that Time Wind, which is the sequel to The Sympathizer.

43
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:56,230
Both books are great. I highly recommend about the Vietnam War and then the the consequences, the aftermath of that.

44
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:01,420
I watched White Lotus, I think it's on HBO. It's kind of a silly show.

45
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:08,650
It's about privilege, though, in all these ways. White privilege, male privilege, class privilege.

46
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:15,730
And I watch a lot of Red Sox baseball, so I'm a big fan and they're kind of not doing so well these days.

47
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,620
So I'm feeling a little worried about that. So that's me.

48
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,740
We have our great GSCI. Hello, everyone.

49
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,580
And I'm from Columbus, Ohio.

50
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:36,910
And the book that I recommended was Professional Troublemaker The Verifier Renewably Love Be.

51
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:48,340
I don't know if they're really great, but if you're interested in how you move here because you have a great recommendation.

52
00:06:48,340 --> 00:07:05,830
I met my grandfather and I was trying to pound 74.

53
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:15,690
This moment. I'm you're saying folks are being deceived?

54
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:23,780
It's true. I'm sorry, I feel for the Tigers, John.

55
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:29,590
I want I'm drawn from, you know, the world.

56
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:37,080
The one result would be. Well, I think there's a few other.

57
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:45,600
The one day in here, Katie, Katie and I grew up in Tucson, Arizona.

58
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:52,410
I lived in our world for over 10 years. So I consider myself to be from here now.

59
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:58,300
And the book that I recommended. Let's start from the beginning. I just started it in the summer.

60
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:07,250
And it's basically about I used to tell me that. You know.

61
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:21,960
Shabana, my name from the last movie I worked with or docu series, I guess is the last year and it's about.

62
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:32,690
Carmel, Indiana, is a suburb about 30 to 40.

63
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:38,900
Don't look after them and everyone in the northeast or the.

64
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:50,930
One of the from The Sopranos about organized crime and yet.

65
00:08:50,930 --> 00:09:05,510
Great mate, you go by great, I'm going to try to learn names, and so one thing that if you haven't seen it yet and this guy made it out of me.

66
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:12,050
Look at that. Is there something called the name coach where people put their.

67
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:19,340
I think you just basically say your name and people will be able to hear how you say your name.

68
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:28,430
So we try to say them correctly. And this is a person whose name isn't up there.

69
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:47,990
OK. I Frauenkirche, the last book I read.

70
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:58,490
Very interesting. He's going to be a little harder on the last word on this one.

71
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:05,480
All three of them on the line with us and on the show.

72
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:13,400
Better call Saul right after the show and it's great.

73
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:19,130
So something you're also learning is way things you have that you can talk to your peers about,

74
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:26,560
like people who love better call Saul or read read the book, Christine.

75
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,050
I agree 100 percent. I'm a small town called for like an hour.

76
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:42,590
I know my name is you know, it's great for males and females, three and four percent for reading on college campuses.

77
00:10:42,590 --> 00:11:01,610
Thank you, Sridhar. Well, you know, look, I'm sorry about that, I don't know what.

78
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:12,480
That's the best right for some people, Patika.

79
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:30,480
This coming alive, your. Basically, the guys with three guys.

80
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,670
So for those of you not from Michigan like me, when people talk about where they are from in Michigan,

81
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:41,910
I don't really know exactly what they're talking about either. I'm working for for the Michigan people.

82
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:49,140
Then that's how you connect to it. So but if you're one of those who like it, don't know where those places are, it's OK.

83
00:11:49,140 --> 00:12:07,030
You'll you'll start to learn. I don't know if I lost.

84
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:25,240
They have every. And you will read a lot to tell Clara.

85
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:45,330
Where I from? I chose to write about what is called memorial, and it's about geriatric care and wages and benefits and also.

86
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:50,780
I don't want to mess up in about 30 minutes from here,

87
00:12:50,780 --> 00:13:01,830
so I show everyone airline up at American nations and it's this great report about what sort of life and the.

88
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:12,900
Political. Very, very warm, very, very.

89
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:27,260
Lots of lot sorry, lots of cooks out there, so we might do a potluck or something would be a real.

90
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:36,810
Thank you. I got an update at.

91
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:43,770
Right, and it looks like a two.

92
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,400
And you will be sorry about before you went for the.

93
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:56,910
And finally, the. Fact.

94
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:04,230
I did you all here in our.

95
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:13,200
Race. Our world is.

96
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:42,170
Oh, my theory goes for everybody. Paul. For the last I was before the fateful fearful for the safety of the pope,

97
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:52,010
but then we thought about it and what happened in this town that they thought about the TV show.

98
00:14:52,010 --> 00:15:05,810
Few hours. Weird, but it was the only way that they ever had it here that they didn't feel like that was coming out.

99
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:29,280
But I. I've been watching. It's great and I know which team you support.

100
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:40,120
But. It's a great show.

101
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:49,140
I agree it's hard to watch it because.

102
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:58,510
Go to 123, go by.

103
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:07,370
The last of. Oh, OK.

104
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:23,830
You. But yes, I think.

105
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:31,550
Thank you. I'm trying to become.

106
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:38,270
So you don't remember me having to just go ahead?

107
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:42,620
At first I thought we were going to do very well here.

108
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:53,320
So I went for halfway to. I do think, as I might, that.

109
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,930
Yeah, it's good.

110
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:11,130
There are lots of good health health care books in here, but also lots of good fiction and nonfiction history, it's really a great list.

111
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:29,240
I would like to do what? When you think about it, I like being in one of those.

112
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:56,360
Hi. It's welcome for the.

113
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:05,520
Well, actually, it's not a documentary about horses and how we got.

114
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:30,470
Both parties have a meeting today. It's interesting to see how that.

115
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:43,680
And also. And I think that's based on a book it.

116
00:18:43,680 --> 00:19:01,740
Yeah, yeah. Michigan last year lost, but I am married and I know that.

117
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:12,750
Hey, you guys, come on, look, I'm the book I on this untampered because I really want to read this of my lawyer superimportant and every the woman

118
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:21,030
is a really good job of life stories for boys and things throughout her life and accept the limitations based on my.

119
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:26,810
Things like that and when to get access to everything, family that I want to show what's going on.

120
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:38,520
Your I would look for a. It's really, really good. I would have been talking about a great.

121
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:48,270
So I was actually born and raised in Poland, but I've lived in London and much right now is the office complex.

122
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:52,380
I'm sure you have heard about that. So it was great.

123
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,280
So, yeah, this is the show, not the book. Did you read the book?

124
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:07,960
I left her. OK. Do they want to keep.

125
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:19,140
I mean, I thought for you, I mean, I think was pretty funny with it doesn't really from.

126
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:28,980
I have a great. I.

127
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:44,410
For a lot more people off the boat, that front of or blogging about explicitly racist health policy and local governments.

128
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:50,630
And then you show that I love having been talking with you about this Formula One, right to survive.

129
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,320
How do you not care about parties at all?

130
00:20:53,320 --> 00:21:01,980
And I think on this show, like it's a documentary that would be the driver to understand two years of work with all the racing and every.

131
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:08,860
Money on hand, that was always the if you want to watch.

132
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:17,930
It's funny, my husband has been watching the show, he's in like season two and, you know, I haven't seen it.

133
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:37,690
People, the problem in our graduate. But.

134
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:49,210
Thank you. It sounds interesting. Jerry Brown, Swain's.

135
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:54,610
And. And you sort of.

136
00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:01,490
Hero status. Mark, this is this is.

137
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:14,450
The radicals and the place so. This was like a boxer meeting and an audio book, and she's an alarm and of the program,

138
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:23,910
so we often have her show up at some point and the book is outstanding.

139
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:31,630
Hi, everyone, I'm sorry, I'm been saying this very in a recent book I read the we should have and it's

140
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:39,250
really interesting but and very relevant to the events of the past few years.

141
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:50,080
I just read The Vanishing Have To, and I loved it. I be one I'm proud about an hour, 45 minutes from here.

142
00:22:50,080 --> 00:23:14,130
I recently lost someone on that plane and I was to.

143
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:43,240
Here you are. A.

144
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:51,010
I didn't know that. I just.

145
00:23:51,010 --> 00:24:14,020
Individual, but it is not like.

146
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:23,390
We are taking your questions here on.

147
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:31,650
Where is. On.

148
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:45,310
So kind of a noir, too pretty dark and slow, but good.

149
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:52,210
All the time and my to.

150
00:24:52,210 --> 00:25:01,340
When you got married, mortifyingly and a I I your life would be.

151
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:09,470
Of companies and. And I think devil in the white cities about Chicago, right?

152
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:42,400
Yep. But.

153
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:58,870
Thanks, yeah. Lots of you are reading kind of serious emotional fiction and everyone simply can't have any idea what I would love be.

154
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:07,330
I just finished my technical people, so I'd like to see the light hearted quake, but I think it's probably more than 300 pages.

155
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:17,490
But I know so little that it gives a nice look into what the like of autism.

156
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:25,500
Kate. I was born in Ethiopia.

157
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:34,290
Unabashedly. You've got to watch.

158
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:55,750
Big shot, really. I really like that literally not so much not here, but I got out of the office and I was only starting to get.

159
00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:04,640
Heidi, for us in the Seattle I was with you, I never imagined that the army, which is.

160
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:11,460
That tries to get his children. Would be the best to go to.

161
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:31,940
Pretty interesting way. I love watching football and I love.

162
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:43,170
I am from Chicago and basically I was.

163
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:54,200
Based on. Not only how it affects society.

164
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:15,150
Go sociology, I'm a sociologist by training. I didn't question.

165
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:35,540
Chattanooga. On Shutter Island, a little harder to watch.

166
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:49,770
I love the fact that. Is it scary or just suspense?

167
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:56,080
By the way. It looks scary to me.

168
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:09,720
I never saw a. I I didn't here and they're not here right now, and I hated by.

169
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:19,470
Basically, for them, for the purpose of I was born in Adelaide and regularly just happened to be three sorry and great education,

170
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:27,130
but she really the in and. So it's a really interesting.

171
00:29:27,130 --> 00:30:00,240
I've read that this summer, too, I that was great. Cindy.

172
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:17,460
M.J. It's interesting.

173
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:23,920
Hi, I'm Margaret to. I disagree with Paul.

174
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:29,930
You can expect to belong to the free world and anybody who trying to about.

175
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:33,340
And it's really very photogrammetry doing so.

176
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:57,220
Yeah. OK.

177
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:06,350
Yes, there's a couple of educated people I've written books, you know, I.

178
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:17,550
And you will find that story.

179
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:32,790
Finally. I want to wish you good luck to all of my until and stood on the part of the president, the region.

180
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:40,750
It's a bit tougher for the North Carolina.

181
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:52,450
Oh, I know Dimple is not here today recommending the TV show Silicon Valley and Arpita could not be here today either.

182
00:31:52,450 --> 00:32:06,470
So social network, probably lots of people have heard of. And another book about.

183
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:43,710
And I think that be a. That you have been walking years by people like.

184
00:32:43,710 --> 00:33:05,550
The. The.

185
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:37,210
Dr. Is it?

186
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:47,290
A little bit of.

187
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:55,360
OK, thank you. Yeah, is that one day, one day on A.M., you think?

188
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:10,230
Yeah. This idea of. Do you want to go to the big guys?

189
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:27,930
I want to go with the. I hate to tell you the office is a classic more.

190
00:34:27,930 --> 00:35:31,960
Are. But after. And it's.

191
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:43,650
Interesting. I have heard a lot about it five years later.

192
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:50,160
It's a feel good story about how your father.

193
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,480
Why? To deny. I gave it to you out of high quality.

194
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:12,770
I want to read your mind reading some of these you could just put into a list for at the end of the semester, you can go back to the list.

195
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:19,750
I'm more comfortable year. We don't have a for.

196
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,340
Again,

197
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:32,890
there's a lot of folks who are seriously worried about a woman of a high school girl who lived with her uncle and just how she lives in the suburb,

198
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:42,320
and then she went. So all about how to survive.

199
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:53,290
Great. I'm from Michigan and I'm now away from here for.

200
00:36:53,290 --> 00:37:00,160
What level of control was the story on 500 feet?

201
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,720
Well, I think that was made into a movie, too, wasn't it?

202
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, this is Catherine.

203
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:20,750
I mean, I read a book like that.

204
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:26,080
After I heard that from the guy that.

205
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:49,150
About. Everyone in south of Michigan show that I started watching with Great.

206
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:54,920
They had described it kind of like a psychological thriller.

207
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:04,110
So for me, if you have.

208
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:14,570
Everyone I knew that I could see Iowa, I just read like a lot of fun, so I really like this one.

209
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:21,460
I just looked and then I definitely shouldn't stay on the show work there, but I can't do.

210
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:41,390
Right now, good bye. I mean, you can finish it and with all a nice.

211
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:52,350
And I. I love that after the first.

212
00:38:52,350 --> 00:39:12,510
And the last movie I was. You know what, I want to say that a great.

213
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:24,020
I mean, you know what my daughter would think about the whole.

214
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:29,560
Good primary health care, and it's about all about the.

215
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:37,370
The pastor of the Catholic Church, but great, but.

216
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:43,080
I feel like you may as well be that daddy died.

217
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,760
His wife is now preparing for that to happen.

218
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,760
Oh, so the Super Bowl is a great story to talk about.

219
00:39:51,760 --> 00:40:06,910
How great. Well, have you watched the video of that of my life watching?

220
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:13,930
So your drive will take you where you want to go, but just not in the same five year plan as you expect,

221
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:28,760
or we can put put these together and make make a new story.

222
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:37,930
We always like that, I think are you going to give us some more?

223
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:51,000
It's a great thing that. One of them is like.

224
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:04,710
Was it trying to take something good from both of those is that is worth?

225
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:23,850
That's a hard effort, but I appreciate that. And I voted against that very simple development.

226
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:30,780
So if it doesn't look like they're going to.

227
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,940
Yeah, this that's, I think, the most popular book, right? The Vanishing Half now.

228
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:43,430
Yes, it's great. Oh, hi, my name is Harry, also from Southeast Michigan.

229
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:54,660
And so I've been recently watching The Godfather. The Godfather of Harlem is based on a true story of a crime boss in New York around the 50s or 60s.

230
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,680
I highly recommend it talks about, obviously, the work, but also the like.

231
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:06,040
How many is involved with, like, some of the things. Society like racism, politics.

232
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:17,420
This is on my list because I love Forest Whitaker, too, so you recommend.

233
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:28,200
Shall be enough outside now they come here one which can judge right now.

234
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:33,560
His most recent book is called Penthouse.

235
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:43,460
It is hard to watch, but the delightfully. The reason for that is that I live in.

236
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:50,600
I spent a lot of time watching the birds and everything will be about.

237
00:42:50,600 --> 00:43:13,690
At times like this, I feel like. I mean, we're pretty tired of Charlotte, North Carolina, but it's always in Concord, which is roughly like.

238
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:25,870
Usually I find the part that is great, but I was. I have a friend who is.

239
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:31,790
We'll watch what happens, it's going to be.

240
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:40,770
It provides better, but I think so I see Dr. People again here.

241
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:48,640
I'm a sports fan. I want you to come here so big for your world.

242
00:43:48,640 --> 00:44:05,740
Right, be fair, but I love.

243
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:14,110
And I had a. Just.

244
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:40,500
You want to. A long time ago, 043, so to speak.

245
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:47,270
Oh, boy. So this poor.

246
00:44:47,270 --> 00:45:00,690
All briefly, one reason I like the first.

247
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:09,130
Realizable. I was going to be like everybody else for.

248
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:52,400
Hmm. Thank you. So I welcome my.

249
00:45:52,400 --> 00:46:08,600
When he goes to space. Interview for.

250
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:40,440
It's a your show because it's. That the second animated show, I think I realized.

251
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:49,080
I went to see a very simple. It's historical fiction.

252
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:58,620
Mom and dad will be outside the door, and I hope you like this whole area.

253
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:10,150
I love to hear your also hilarious. You.

254
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:20,230
Time. That's like your.

255
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:39,750
I said, I think I like Earth, but I'm not going to play for.

256
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:49,230
Yikes. I mean, I am not afraid to afraid.

257
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:53,920
The rest of the world, immigration.

258
00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:00,470
Frustration, honestly. I was 12 years ago, was using my free time.

259
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:11,160
Few more questions for Al. OK, that looks like do we have yes, some people.

260
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:17,310
Hi, everyone. My name is David.

261
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:20,250
Challenges in my life, I just became a character.

262
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:27,240
My mother had major surgery, but in all honesty, I didn't start catching up with anything until this morning.

263
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:32,250
I didn't realize something was different, but I agree. I am from Canada.

264
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:35,140
The last book I read was The Nordic Heritage Everything.

265
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:45,660
It was a really interesting look at living politically, socially and, of course, health care and.

266
00:48:45,660 --> 00:49:07,250
Thank you and no worries. Yes, good morning, David.

267
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:22,630
The world of. I mean, for anybody who is out and locked up, I think.

268
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:34,130
Rebecca. Oh.

269
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:43,080
But. Oh.

270
00:49:43,080 --> 00:50:00,170
Please go back and tell them I love you.

271
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:05,030
OK. OK. My name is Tom, I am from Bolivia.

272
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:09,370
Thank you. Yeah, let's go.

273
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:20,940
Right. All right then we will talk about Hillary, but also.

274
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:48,380
That's very good. Michael. So this is another.

275
00:50:48,380 --> 00:51:00,680
So I hope so everyone who didn't do it, I'll have you add them so that we have your actual record and people can go back.

276
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:21,640
We got somebody else. I know, you know, I used.

277
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:35,060
Yes. OK, great.

278
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:39,320
Well, welcome, everyone, and thank you for for doing that.

279
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:45,620
I know that feels like a long time to sit and listen to everyone, but I don't know about you.

280
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:51,690
But when was the last time you spoke in front of other people that you began with?

281
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:54,080
A little month.

282
00:51:54,080 --> 00:52:03,820
So now we've all done it, which means you'll continue to do it throughout the semester because that's what we need to have everybody here participate.

283
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:10,070
And you'll get lots of time to talk together. But we're also going to be talking to each other.

284
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:15,650
So thank you for doing that. Plus, you got all those great recommendations. So I really did that.

285
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:22,730
So let's start, huh? So why we're here by coal everywhere is not working.

286
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:31,340
So I'm going to. I'm going to. Well, before we do this, you know, let's just call them.

287
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:40,110
What's the one issue that when you think about how you think about health care, what is what is it you are passionate about?

288
00:52:40,110 --> 00:53:01,620
About? Their assets equate to the sorry mental health costs of their health care outcomes, implementation of new,

289
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:13,050
better ways of practice, quality, quality of care, authority, accessibility, access.

290
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:20,530
Yes. Nation's health insurance costs.

291
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:27,870
Integration, integration, look like health I.T.

292
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:41,940
Efficiency, good, health care, workforce, workforce and burnout, innovation.

293
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:47,790
Wow, lots and lots of things, more collaboration in health care.

294
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:55,320
All of these things, believe it or not, in all of these ways, liberals want to talk about population,

295
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:05,970
health and the social determinants of health and health, equity and quality and cost and all of these things we talk about in this class.

296
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:09,090
So if you're somebody, where is everybody?

297
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:16,560
Or here's somebody where it's costs, where you're from anywhere in the nation, or all of the things that everyone said.

298
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:21,570
The good news is this class will touch on.

299
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:26,790
The bad news is the class will crush on that.

300
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:40,290
So this is a big survey of lots of important issues related to health services in the U.S. That means your issue is going to be covered,

301
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:53,400
but it means your issue is not going to get into the depth and richness and importance of that topic, probably at the level that you really want.

302
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,360
Now, that's very disappointing and a little frustrating,

303
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:10,830
but good news is that the next class that you take or in the future, you can really dig in on that issue in your programs,

304
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:19,170
in the Department of Health Management and Policy, in the School of Public Health and elsewhere, school, public policy, etc.

305
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:24,030
So that's just to get you ready for what we're going to do in this class.

306
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:34,950
This class has nine learning goals. If you know anything about education, that is way too many learning goals for one class.

307
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:47,250
But that's the expectation. That's why we're going to cover a lot of issues to give you that overview of the U.S. health services system.

308
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:51,810
We're going to talk about some of the history and current events of policies.

309
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:56,640
We're going to describe population health and talk about social determinants of health.

310
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:04,650
We're going to evaluate financing programs. We're going to talk about health care, organization and delivery.

311
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,530
We're going to talk about the professions and workforce.

312
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:15,960
And then we're going to talk about how financing workforce and organizations are connected to equity and quality and cost.

313
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,780
So we're going to try to tie some of these together.

314
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:27,150
We're going to talk about how health services in the U.S. are, how they stand up, how how we can evaluate them,

315
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:40,260
and how they compare briefly to a few other health systems around the world, typically other high income industrialized countries.

316
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:47,640
And finally, you are going to be in this class getting the opportunity to practice leadership,

317
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:58,320
communication, some writing and and working with teams that you will be assigned in the class.

318
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:06,190
So that's a lot the big overview to do that.

319
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:17,320
All right, something else, too, I think just keep in mind with the health services system, I think about it as the five keys, right?

320
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:29,320
You've got the people who survive these my patients that they might be health care workers who might be doctors, policy makers or insurers.

321
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:39,670
Right. In some cases, the people who are involved when we're talking about health and populations health, we can talk about providers.

322
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:44,140
So then we're talking about doctors and nurses and other technicians.

323
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:50,920
We're also talking about health care organizations like hospitals and health systems.

324
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:55,780
We're going to talk about payers who pays for health care.

325
00:57:55,780 --> 00:58:00,070
People do, but also insurers do. And governments do.

326
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:03,890
And states do. And employers do. So how?

327
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:10,660
Who are the payers and how does that work? Well, the top, of course, a lot about policies that matter.

328
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:17,560
And then we'll talk to about practices. How is health care delivered?

329
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:27,940
How does that delivery affect outcomes? What is its relationship to health overall population health and individual health?

330
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:36,790
So it's, again, to keep in mind that the breadth and the complexity that we're going to be talking about when we're

331
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:43,240
talking about any one of these important issues that you will identify sort of the five P's,

332
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:50,560
you don't really have to write that down in your you'll you have the slides available, but it's just something to keep in mind.

333
00:58:50,560 --> 00:59:02,980
OK, let's look at the canvas page, the Canada site, which you've all I think seen have access to.

334
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:08,770
There's a lot of material here will go through, but something is always broken.

335
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:17,350
We've already had few people. This doesn't work. That will continue to be the case throughout the semester despite my Atkinsons best efforts.

336
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:21,590
So please just shoot us an e-mail and say that's not working.

337
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:28,630
You can't get access. This isn't available. Sometimes you need to remind me to make sure I've posted the slides.

338
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:32,630
I will typically post them. I'll try to post them right before class.

339
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:40,060
They'll always be available after class. So, you know, we'll try to make it work.

340
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:49,330
The entire syllabus is here. And believe it or not, since we're in person, I actually made the first copies of the syllabus.

341
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:54,130
You can take one if you want it. If you don't want it.

342
00:59:54,130 --> 01:00:03,540
Yeah, it's all available on the website.

343
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:12,780
Start passing them around. There's one for everyone. If you want it, I'm somebody who actually likes people sometimes.

344
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:24,930
So the weekly schedule, the readings are all in here.

345
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:54,930
Been over in the. Yes.

346
01:00:54,930 --> 01:01:02,400
So we've already talked about the learning goals and that's going to click here, it's how that connects to thank you.

347
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:12,900
The competencies that are part of the majesté and the MPH program, which have competencies from the accreditation,

348
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:21,630
the materials and requirements, all the reading materials that you will need for this class or all on the parasite.

349
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:34,200
So you won't need to go anywhere. There is a great little textbook that we're using by Thomas Bodenheimer and Grumbach,

350
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:39,270
whose first name I can't remember, but you can access it through the link in the canvas site.

351
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:44,100
It's available through the Michigan library. So you don't need the physical book.

352
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:51,810
It's a it's a nice little text if you have any interest in buying a text, but you don't need that.

353
01:01:51,810 --> 01:02:00,450
You also the readings should all be available from any one of the page links.

354
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:03,630
So here this is the Bodenheimer and Grumbach book.

355
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:12,900
If you click on this or you go to Chapter two, you definitely will need to be with your University of Michigan.

356
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:17,490
So if you're your Google account or something else, you won't be able to access that.

357
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:30,600
So keep that in mind. One other place that readings are available, if you get stuck or something isn't working,

358
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:42,660
another place to check is in this philes button and you'll see a folder there called Readings,

359
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:49,200
and they're all listed there by the last name of the first author.

360
01:02:49,200 --> 01:03:04,090
So keep that in mind if you need to find a reading, but also you can send us an email.

361
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:14,440
So the list of assignments is it's on a page in the physical paper copy.

362
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:19,870
It's also in the assignments you will see in canvas.

363
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:28,780
And here's a list of them by due date, organized by due date, not by component, as they are in the paper copy.

364
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:37,990
So if you want to just kind of have an idea of each of the assignments and when they might be, do you'll note a few of them say in class,

365
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:46,510
which means there's not anything for you to do ahead of class, it something to do with your team in class.

366
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:54,300
So. Let's see.

367
01:03:54,300 --> 01:04:08,130
Some important notes, so this environment that we are in is that we will be working together as a community to produce inclusive environments.

368
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:16,010
Everyone has important contributions made. We will all learn from everyone's contribution.

369
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:20,160
So that's going to be a responsibility for you and for me.

370
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,970
And so I want you to be aware of that.

371
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:31,410
We'll be talking about that a little bit about how we work with our teams, how we talk to each other and interact.

372
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:36,690
But so that is an important value for the class.

373
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:40,830
Also, everyone learns in different ways. We have different needs.

374
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:45,700
We have different ways that we learn best. So think about that for yourself.

375
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:51,180
If anyone has something that they think is important for you to know about your learning,

376
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:57,100
about ways that help support you in your learning, please come and talk to me.

377
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:02,640
Let me know how we can make the class work best for you.

378
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:11,220
And we will. I will certainly work to help accommodate what you need to try to make that happen.

379
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:21,360
Every semester. Some people are participating in religious activities or observations that might be they have in this class.

380
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:24,780
Please just let me know about that.

381
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:32,520
And so we can make sure if it's a day where there might be a team activity, you might need to have an alternative assignment.

382
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:42,510
But that is something that is, of course, I know people will be participating in and then overall.

383
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:51,090
So we're back for hate's and you're sort of whole having these hybrid experiences in the classroom.

384
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:57,420
Sometimes you're the online. Sometimes I for the first day, you know,

385
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:09,130
yesterday I was in my office for the first time in eight months from nine a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and it's I went home completely exhausted.

386
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:18,870
And so you are probably having that experience, too, and the switching from right here and meeting tons of new people.

387
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:22,950
And you're in a new place and and then you have to be online.

388
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:33,980
It's it's a lot. So you guys take care of yourself, what you need all the basics.

389
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:38,190
So, you know, sometimes that will sound a little like your mother.

390
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:43,930
I'm sorry about that. But, you know, the.

391
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:52,420
Drink water to care for yourself, but take care of yourself also emotionally when you need a break.

392
01:06:52,420 --> 01:07:07,060
Try to recognize that, make sure your your attending to that and then recognize that everyone else is dealing with important things in their lives.

393
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:10,970
Elizabeth, thank you for sharing with your tax day. Something going on.

394
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:19,180
This is happening all the time for everyone. So we'll try to be patient and kind to ourselves,

395
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:33,790
but to each other and share that in this class will be important for us in making that community that we are all looking for.

396
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:46,080
OK, so some of what we're going to be doing in the class, I see if I can go back to.

397
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:54,610
Just on that note is when we are in the classroom in general, but also when you are in school,

398
01:07:54,610 --> 01:08:00,120
means you're going to be meeting new people and learning from each other.

399
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:08,340
And so we are all should be thinking about and somewhat recognizing our individual

400
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:13,590
experiences often lead us to make assumptions about how the world works,

401
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:18,120
what's good, what's bad, and how those people do things.

402
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:22,020
Or everyone knows this, those kinds of assumptions.

403
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:29,340
We want to try to become more aware of and recognize that as well as you do me and

404
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:36,750
my experience that it necessarily has to do with your experience or someone else's.

405
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:42,120
So do keeping that in mind more consciously. You all know that.

406
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:50,820
We all know it and yet and we take it for granted, it slips into the hands of the unconscious.

407
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:58,860
And that's really how we get to unconscious bias and those kinds of things that we're trying to get at some of my more.

408
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:09,960
When we are interacting with each other, we can be open to learning and hearing from each other.

409
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:21,090
So being aware of our assumptions, being open and sharing responsibility to be participating in a team.

410
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:25,500
So those are some of the core values that I want us all to have.

411
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,030
But there are lots of things you can think of.

412
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:40,380
So you both work in teams grew out of the education or in all kinds of ways, in jobs, in sports and other kinds of activities.

413
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:55,500
People get into performing arts, etc. So what do you think are some other kinds of ideas for what makes that team work really well together?

414
01:09:55,500 --> 01:10:23,770
A collaboration with. OK, start from an assumption I that they don't see any threat, but people have good intentions, but we all make mistakes.

415
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:32,140
And so it's important to say what if something someone said you disagree with disagreement.

416
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:43,600
It doesn't mean we're all in agreement. Absolutely not. But it does mean that we will try to be honest and respectful and that sort through it.

417
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:55,030
That's a great one. Assuming that the other person has good intentions but really hasn't thought through how you think about that or to that idea.

418
01:10:55,030 --> 01:11:00,600
Another one. We have some.

419
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:10,860
Karen. Great accountability for yourself and for others.

420
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:21,410
So that means if you're having a tough time because there's a personal crisis for you and you haven't been able to do something with your obligations,

421
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:28,930
do you let people know that that's at least the minimum requirement that you have to be accountable,

422
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:35,780
saying, hey, I'm real sorry, I'm not going to be able to make the meeting or I wasn't able to get that done and

423
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:45,070
then work together to to address that because life happens for all of us is good.

424
01:11:45,070 --> 01:12:03,030
It's important to be as a communicator, of course. Absolutely uniquely your own needs and your ideas and listen to.

425
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:12,390
OK, so community expectations your own and then be willing to adjust as people share their expectations with you.

426
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:26,310
And you probably won't work for the group with find, you know, you feel like you.

427
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:35,700
That's right. So great a signing sort of a role in your work with a group throughout the semester.

428
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:41,310
And so the idea is that some of those roles will rotate.

429
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:47,760
So the idea in is not to get the work done as fast as possible, believe it or not.

430
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:56,550
A lot of it as you'll see it. And it's also not to have the work done by the person who already knows how to do it and then the other people have it.

431
01:12:56,550 --> 01:13:01,100
Just get to use that. It's to actually work together.

432
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:13,920
And so that everyone wants what is being asked for and the people for the for the assignment and the other.

433
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:23,910
These are all really, really good. So we try to.

434
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:35,440
Pretty ready when when others make good contributions to the group, you guys are all here because you're amazing students and you're going to go.

435
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:41,580
Thank goodness you're here to help so many of those problems that we talked about

436
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:46,890
that we care about in health care and in population health and public health.

437
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:53,990
So we need that. But you're recognized that you are with amazing people to see.

438
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:56,910
You are amazing and your fears are true.

439
01:13:56,910 --> 01:14:07,800
And so we recognize you as someone else to contribute something I think can all can can end up making you feel really good, too.

440
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:13,320
So thank you for all of those really good comments.

441
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:26,620
And we are about out of time. I'm going to pause for questions about the scale of this.

442
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:33,020
To clarify. So.

443
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:38,620
And three. Yeah, for that's why.

444
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:44,130
So if the readings, if they are signed for nine to graduate,

445
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:58,680
you should come to class and there are a lot of good things and a few of them are going to be complex that try to be a mix of academic articles.

446
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:08,460
But also, I mean, lots of people one day and students in my class are just like this writing.

447
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:16,590
So make sure you're giving yourself enough time for me so you can tell you really quickly scanned.

448
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:25,980
But others will be talking about many of the classes will have some discussion, questions that can help you if you are going to read you like yours.

449
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:34,530
And I think that's going to give you a clue about what we're going to try to talk about in the class.

450
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:46,080
Somebody asked me if we're going to start today by just doing a moment of kind of reflection, what I call a check in.

451
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:57,780
And last year we did it. People just go get a check on Zoom, zoom you right into the discussion board.

452
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:01,950
And it's just it's somebody already said, well, I do that now.

453
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:12,480
The idea is that it's important to help us all collectively focus in on the class and that we talk about that.

454
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:16,320
Well, how does all this new stuff I'm learning connect to this class?

455
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:21,510
So it's just a moment and it's just a brief observation, is not, I suppose,

456
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:27,450
to read a paragraph in to have these thoughts that you've been developing over time?

457
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:38,820
It's sort of like, wow, I heard this on the news. And you think about what you talked about last lecture or something like that public comment.

458
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:44,730
So allow you to have your computers or your phones.

459
01:16:44,730 --> 01:16:49,740
If you if you simply don't have that, that's OK. You don't have to have that much.

460
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:55,830
And still, sometimes we'll ask people to go we just prior to the beginning of class.

461
01:16:55,830 --> 01:17:05,300
But that's how we'll get started each each class.

462
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:13,030
Not all assignments are alive yet. We will be talking about those ahead of time, though, posted on campus.

463
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:19,460
So if you see something in the syllabus that is not you know, you can't see it on campus yet.

464
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:33,930
Don't panic. It'll be there. The questions.

465
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:53,750
Yes, sorry, he's going to. Yes, it is available on this on the oxidase, see?

466
01:17:53,750 --> 01:18:08,080
The interest survey and this link here, the intro slide, will take you to this Google folder where you can make a copy and in Adamsville.

467
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:12,150
Thank you. OK, great.

468
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:18,007
Thanks, everyone. See you on Thursday.
