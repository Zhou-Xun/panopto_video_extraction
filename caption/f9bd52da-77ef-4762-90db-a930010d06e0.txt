1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,360
Okay, now let's imagine you're
writing a policy advocacy brief to be

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,780
circulated among stakeholders in whatever
topic it is that you care about.

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,570
So this is a written document,

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,730
that's explicitly designed to advocate for
a particular policy.

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,990
It might be an internal policy
within an organization, or

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,920
it might be you're sending
this up to Capitol Hill,

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,266
because you wanna change
the regulations for the whole country.

8
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:40,460
So, same questions, who,
who are we reaching?

9
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,060
Well, ultimately we're trying
to reach policy makers, right?

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,500
The people who are gonna
change the policies.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,090
But there's lots of other people who
are involved in this process, right?

12
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,792
So there's the policy makers and
then there's the staff who help them,

13
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:57,437
who organize the information.

14
00:00:57,437 --> 00:00:59,497
And Many times when we're writing,

15
00:00:59,497 --> 00:01:04,760
we're as much writing to the staff
as we are to the policy maker.

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,700
But again, remember,
we can't just think about the target.

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,040
We have to also think about
who else needs to see or

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,820
interact with our communications.

19
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,990
So sometimes, this policy brief
is gonna be read by, let's say,

20
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,710
other advocacy organizations.

21
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,500
Maybe they're for
the same policy we're for, and so

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,450
we wanna think about alluding
to potential collaborations.

23
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:35,670
Maybe they're opposing this policy and
we need to cut off their

24
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,070
perspective with some
good counter arguments.

25
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,950
Either way,
being conscious of it is important.

26
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,240
In policy context you have
to think about the press.

27
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,510
You have to think about the journalist.

28
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,480
How can this gonna play out,
if your policy brief

29
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,600
landed in the hands of somebody from the
Washington Post, or from a local paper.

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,450
And we also need to think about
community members, or patients,

31
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,820
or others stakeholders who are affected
by the whatever those policy is, right?

32
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:10,490
If you're talking about medicare policy,
patients are another stakeholder group.

33
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:16,440
No matter how accurate your policy brief
is, if it looks or reads confusingly or

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,290
even worse offensively towards patients,
you're gonna have a problem.

35
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,640
So, second, context.

36
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,700
Where are they gonna
interact with this brief.

37
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,770
It's a paper brief, great.

38
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,550
So we're not worrying about oral
presentation, but is this delivered by

39
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:41,610
mail, or is this being handed directly
to the person that needs to read it.

40
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,820
And is this a moment when the issue
is already on their mind?

41
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,770
Right, let's say this bill
is a bill on congress, and

42
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,570
it's coming up for a vote and
this issue is already on their minds.

43
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,800
Or are you writing this brief because
you wanna get their attention?

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,140
They're not thinking about it, but
you want them to be thinking about it.

45
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,760
Why do they care?

46
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,982
Why is this important?

47
00:03:06,982 --> 00:03:10,732
I mean, let's be honest,
in an advocacy context,

48
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:15,120
many times your target audiences
may not yet care about it.

49
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,980
That's your goal, you're trying
to get them to care about it.

50
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,830
But you know what?

51
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,870
Sometimes when we think about it, we can
fit what we're trying to communicate

52
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,260
to people's identities or values, right?

53
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,700
If this is about, let's say,
preventing environmental contamination,

54
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:39,720
if someone sees themselves as a protector
of the environment, you can connect

55
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:46,210
your policy, the points you're trying
to advocate for, to that identity.

56
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,370
Let's say somebody else really
cares about efficiency,

57
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,300
they wanna make sure that
we're not wasting resources.

58
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,890
How does your advocacy connect
to that idea of efficiency and

59
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:02,220
being intentional about
seeing how do you connect

60
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:08,190
to the idea,
can help you make your message clearer.

61
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,510
What's my goal?

62
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,120
Well, obviously in one sense,
my goal is straightforward.

63
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,900
I want to support my
intended policy action.

64
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,290
That's the whole point of a police brief.

65
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,420
But, is that by raising attention?

66
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,330
Am I making a specific ask for resources?

67
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,634
Am I asking to build for collaboration?

68
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:34,277
Build a long term relationship with
whoever it is I'm trying to reach out to.

69
00:04:34,277 --> 00:04:36,906
You're gonna write it differently.

70
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:40,940
And what are the barriers
in this kind of context?

71
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,170
Probably the most important barrier
in this context is the diversity

72
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,670
of the audiences, right?

73
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,690
When we went through all of
those different audiences,

74
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:55,140
policy makers versus staff versus
patients versus journalists,

75
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,900
could have really
different knowledge base.

76
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,920
So, thinking about how do you
need to adjust for those,

77
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,180
how much detail to put in or not put in,
is gonna be one of the biggest challenges.

78
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,458
And again, in a policy brief context,

79
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:14,511
usually you're talking about with people
whose time constraints are really severe.

80
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:19,884
Attention is the most
critical resource they have.

81
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:23,147
So, you wanna get to the point,
you want to make it really clear, so

82
00:05:23,147 --> 00:05:27,093
that they don't have to
spend too much time on it.
