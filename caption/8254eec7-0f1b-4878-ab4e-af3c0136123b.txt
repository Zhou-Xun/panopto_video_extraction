1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:08,860
And the. You have to upload your presents and then I.

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,960
Can I hook up here or do you? I don't know how you can woke up.

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,640
I didn't want to disturb you because I know you have that. Yeah, that's a good question.

4
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,980
Oh, I. I'm not sure if you can email me or I can.

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,209
I can show. Okay, sure. We can do that. Or you know how to do that.

6
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,560
I'm not sure. Why don't you just email me quickly?

7
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:37,180
Okay. Will do. And. Or you could.

8
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:43,990
Yeah, probably would. Sorry.

9
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:51,610
And I didn't mean to hurt her.

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,870
Yeah. Yeah. All Unless you know how to.

11
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,020
I really haven't learned to do my word with you.

12
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,500
I don't know. Everything is here. Is this what you talk up?

13
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,830
This is a us. Yeah, I. I was wondering how you think it will work.

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,470
Okay. Yeah. Okay. If you have the other end of the USB c.

15
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,420
The HDMI. Should be here somewhere.

16
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,560
Here. Looks at this. This is it.

17
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,120
Yeah. Okay. Some people do that. You.

18
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,890
Okay. Good. Why are you collecting that kind of stuff?

19
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,810
I already three and a year.

20
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,710
Two years ago, you weren't in this class, right? Right.

21
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,480
It was, I think winter when it was 2020.

22
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,500
Yeah. When you talk. Yeah. Winter 2020. That was the pandemic.

23
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:13,920
It was. Oh yeah. I was in this class and now he's pursuing a lot of, you know, working at this sort of job currently.

24
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:23,280
And they're also going to starting med school, medical school starting next July, next July, start in medical school.

25
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:34,770
So and he did this to work through to undergraduate to research cause I even don't remember the course number,

26
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:43,709
but why it's called advanced writing right and one's work so he took this are doing is probably helps

27
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:56,690
the junior year and uh the course like the addition of new and then he got to a very interesting the

28
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:08,290
you know back some people using the new technology and and we uh we decided to do a research course on

29
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:18,270
here we have the research car and did for credit but publishes the paper in a special issue anthrax.

30
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:26,190
And um, so yeah after the publication I got different offers and.

31
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,340
It's including this big company.

32
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:38,920
It wants us to use some of your python that's going to email it to your kids.

33
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,040
Yes, it is. It doesn't work. It's not working.

34
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:47,560
Okay. We'll get.

35
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:08,310
Thank you for coming. Yeah, I know you are so busy with work, so to be.

36
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,830
I have not. So you told me.

37
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,760
See you this morning. Was it this morning's?

38
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,880
Yeah, that was central. If you get you.

39
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:35,040
You know, I'm waiting on this alone, so that's not working.

40
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:41,810
Yeah, I just. I suppose. I don't know what to say.

41
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:48,480
There is some here. Nice place that you.

42
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:57,690
Yeah. Is that. Let's try that.

43
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,390
Oh, those I know.

44
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,430
I didn't do it. Oh, maybe.

45
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:32,230
That's. Tested.

46
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,630
How to do so and connected to the computer now.

47
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,970
Yeah. Oh, you know. Have you done this before? Connecting via HDMI?

48
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,570
I haven't done that. But let me check for the window settings.

49
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:57,910
What we can do, we extended. Where you'll be able to see.

50
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,970
But we're still seeing this this desktop. Oh, yeah.

51
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,150
Not seeing this second screen.

52
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:15,329
Is that yours? No, no. Oh, no.

53
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,200
I'm doing something wrong. I have to redo.

54
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:41,770
Now you have to remember. Yeah. So we're seeing this screen instead of mice with your character's suit, right?

55
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:48,040
I don't think I know where this is, where this tells you so.

56
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:54,610
I have to see. It's just. I don't know in my life that is sort I'm connected to.

57
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,440
Australia's. Okay.

58
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,660
Here we go. So we can be working now? Yeah, I just sent.

59
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,210
Oh, you sent me? No, I need to go to email.

60
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:20,470
Yeah, you know, you should. But, you know, not.

61
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:35,170
Yet. There. That's another good.

62
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:54,950
There will be. Perfect for you.

63
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,490
Yeah, you have to do good. Okay.

64
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:05,090
We. Our technology is so good.

65
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,610
And presenting the audience so cool. Now that's where it will come from.

66
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,670
Okay. Now let's hear.

67
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,780
Let's talk. And thank you so much for making.

68
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:29,150
Hello, everyone. My name is Blaine. I was in this class in winter 2020 as an undergrad student.

69
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:35,060
Um, how many of you are undergrads? That's a pretty good chunk of the class.

70
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,829
This half. I see. Okay. So, yeah, I took the class in.

71
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:47,000
In winter of 2020, and then as such. Yeah, it really was with the transition and zoom and everything.

72
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,890
Um, and then Dr. Young was gracious to let me into her lab,

73
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:58,580
and I started on a project kind of connected to the work that Addison was telling you all about before.

74
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:07,790
Um, so today we're going to talk about my study on computational methods in tuberculosis vaccine research.

75
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:17,780
And we can start off this is a great title because it is an award for physical communication of vaccines, you know?

76
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,940
I think we need to communicate.

77
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:30,170
Okay, so maybe this is it. So I don't know how much you guys have talked about the disease in this class or in your other public health courses.

78
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:43,850
Um, but it's, it's primarily a pulmonary disease and intracellular bacterial infection, so it doesn't just affect the lungs, but that's the primary.

79
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,300
So it can really affect any part of your body.

80
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:54,680
Um, and then what we often think of tuberculosis is the active infection.

81
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,900
Um, this is what you see. A lot of media represents tuberculosis.

82
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,549
You'll see it's a coughing. Um, they call it consumption.

83
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,210
That's because your body kind of wastes away as the disease progresses.

84
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:13,610
Um, and that's active tuberculosis, but we also have latent tuberculosis,

85
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:21,410
and that's the case where you have the disease in your body, but your body is containing the bacteria.

86
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,150
And so you can exist without any disease state.

87
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,839
But you have the, the bacteria in your body.

88
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:38,300
And at any point, depending on your immune combatants, the bacteria could reactivate and you could develop an active state of tuberculosis.

89
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,220
All right. So let's talk a little bit about the global burden of of this disease.

90
00:10:48,920 --> 00:11:00,190
Um, so it's an ancient disease, and it really began to flourish with the advent of agriculture and even more with industrialization.

91
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:11,350
So as people have kind of come together and started to live in more densely populated communities, we really started to see tuberculosis flourish.

92
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:21,620
Um, so as you see here, it peaked in the 18th and 19th century in Europe and North America, where we were having urbanization.

93
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,410
And as I wrote here, a third of all deaths in Western Europe at this time were attributable to spiritualists.

94
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,560
So it's a ridiculously prevalent disease at that point in time.

95
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:44,770
Today, it's far less common, especially in the global north, in developed nations.

96
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:51,870
We see it far less because we have good surveillance systems, we have good treatment.

97
00:11:51,880 --> 00:12:01,120
We have all these things that allow us to contain the disease and prevent its spread in the global south in less developed nations.

98
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:07,630
That is not the case. So we see a lot of tuberculosis still present.

99
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:16,150
And as you see on the slide, 1.5 million people annually lose their life to tuberculosis.

100
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:22,060
And for scale, that's about as many lives were lost in the first year of the coronavirus pandemic.

101
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:30,790
Um, I was really surprised to learn that between a quarter and a third of the global population has a latent infection.

102
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:40,930
And as I stated, this isn't so much a problem in developed nations as in developing nations.

103
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:48,640
So if we think about places like South Asia or especially the southern nations of Africa,

104
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:58,300
there is a very great presence of latent tuberculosis infection, such that a third to a quarter of the global population has this.

105
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:12,920
And as I read up here, it's quite the issue because especially with as I move on to as we think about things like HIV having this

106
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:21,650
great pool of latent disease that presents this problem as it can synergize with other diseases like HIV.

107
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:34,130
Or as we see, COVID 19 resources were diverted to surveillance of COVID 19 and treatment of COVID 19.

108
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:39,980
And so for the first time in a long time, tuberculosis numbers are going up.

109
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:45,050
So this is actively a problem, actively a problem in the space of global health.

110
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:58,380
So in 2015, I'm sure I remember in my public health class we talked about the Sustainable Development Goals pretty often.

111
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:12,120
In 2015, the U.N., they developed this goal that we would reduce tuberculosis incidence and mortality by 80 and 90%, respectively.

112
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,960
It's quite the ambitious goal. And even prior to COVID, we were not on track to achieve that.

113
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:28,230
Since COVID, we have been set back even further. The main obstacle here is the lack of an effective vaccine.

114
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:35,160
So does anyone know what the the TB vaccine, the only one licensed TB vaccine is?

115
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:40,379
Have you guys discussed that at all? BCG.

116
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,030
Right. So we have BCG. It's really antiquated technology.

117
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:52,080
It was developed in 1921. And even today, it is the world's most.

118
00:14:53,430 --> 00:15:00,880
Use vaccine. Which is very interesting considering it's its date.

119
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,850
But, um. And. Let's see.

120
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,980
So BCG, it's not the most effective vaccine that we have.

121
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:19,190
It's reasonably effective when you consider infant populations and it has variable efficacy in that population.

122
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,450
But as you think about adults, the efficacy quickly drops off.

123
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:28,790
So BCG does reasonably well to prevent primary tuberculosis infection,

124
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:37,040
but it does a very poor job in preventing reactivation of tuberculosis, especially in adults.

125
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:45,510
So kind of a point of trivia here. The U.S. does not use the BCG vaccine.

126
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,000
Does anyone have any thoughts as to why this is the case?

127
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,240
Yeah. Because. Exactly.

128
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,250
Yeah. So have you guys seen skin testing?

129
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:04,140
So if you work in healthcare, you probably had a tuberculosis skin test.

130
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:12,060
So we we prefer this method of surveillance rather than using vaccines as a method of prevention.

131
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:19,830
So our screening methods, we've determined are more effective than this vaccine as limited efficacy.

132
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:31,790
Okay. So in light of the deficiencies of this BCG vaccine,

133
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:43,340
and it is now imperative that we develop a vaccine that can not only prevent primary tuberculosis infection more effectively than BCG,

134
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:50,330
but also that we develop a vaccine that can prevent the reactivation of latent tuberculosis.

135
00:16:51,500 --> 00:17:00,320
So recently there have been some efforts to develop subunit vaccines, and there's there's some success.

136
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:07,640
Most of these are paired with BCG. Either they're administered at the same time or in succession with BCG.

137
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,260
And there's reasonable amount of success we're seeing.

138
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:18,410
I think it was like 54% efficacy is is the figure that I presented in my paper

139
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:26,570
more recently where they're developing what they call multi-stage vaccines.

140
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,910
And these are vaccines with multiple different antigens in them.

141
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,720
So some of them will be targeted toward the virulence of tuberculosis.

142
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:40,010
Others will be targeted more toward the latency of tuberculosis,

143
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:54,200
which would be antigens that are related to a response to a low oxygen state within the granuloma, which is where the TB cells exist within the body.

144
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:04,580
So the thought here is that, is that by including antigens related to both the virulence and the latency of tuberculosis,

145
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:11,570
we can prevent both primary tuberculosis and post primary tuberculosis in a way that BCG has not been able to do.

146
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:19,700
And this takes us to my study. So we kind of enter this niche here trying to.

147
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:34,049
Discover antigens that that can fill this role of not only creating an immune response toward the virulent pathways of tuberculosis,

148
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:39,450
but also the pathways related to tuberculosis latency within the body.

149
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:53,220
So to identify MTB proteins suitable for a subunit TB vaccine that prevents reactivation of TB and is effective in all populations.

150
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,980
So really what we're trying to do is fill the gap where BCG leads us off.

151
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:11,910
Okay. So as a as I talked about, we're using computational methods here, something that I was not familiar with at all prior to Edison's talk.

152
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:16,500
I'm assuming that I heard a pretty similar talk to what he did today.

153
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:23,790
Yeah. Okay. So I expressed my interest to Dr. Young, and she got me connected with with Edison here.

154
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,990
And I think he was telling you earlier today about vaccine and, um,

155
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:34,920
and this is a machine learning, reverse vaccinology tool to identify protective antigens.

156
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:40,800
Lots of jargon in that. So we can kind of break that down machine learning.

157
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:47,250
What we have there is we're effectively training computers to recognize patterns.

158
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:58,230
Um, so if we think about facial recognition, what this looks like is you give a computer a lot of pictures of the face and tell it, this is a face.

159
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,210
So then it can kind of understand what the distinct features of a face are.

160
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:10,560
So when you present it with new pictures, it can say This is a face or this is not a face based on its training material.

161
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:18,820
And instead of providing pictures with faces, we provided primary sequences of amino acids.

162
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,270
So we we tell vaccine animal that we know that this is a protective antigen.

163
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:31,260
We know that these amino acids in this order works as a protective antigen for this organism.

164
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,080
And so we train it on all of the known protective antigens.

165
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:45,540
And then the thought is that when we provide it novel antigens, it can tell us whether they're likely to be protective antigens or not.

166
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,360
And then we also talk about reverse vaccinology here.

167
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,730
So traditionally, you guys have probably seen this this phrasing here.

168
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,919
So isolate, inactivate, inject in reverse vaccinology.

169
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:10,830
What we start with is we're thinking about the entire proteome, the entire genome of whatever organism we're thinking about.

170
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:17,190
So rather than kind of just throwing everything at the wall and hoping something sticks,

171
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:23,880
we're trying to intelligently select antigens that will operate in a protective fashion.

172
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:32,130
So I just talked about some benefits of that here. So reverse vaccinology methods are going to be faster than your traditional methods.

173
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:41,100
We saw that with the COVID vaccine, this was the fastest vaccine ever developed thanks to these reverse vaccinology techniques.

174
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:47,879
We're going to vaccinology also allows you to identify protective antigens

175
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,190
that you probably couldn't otherwise identify with those traditional methods,

176
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:58,799
because in reverse vaccinology, you can look at the entire proteome, some proteins,

177
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,420
especially those that are intracellular rather than presenting on the cell surface.

178
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:10,680
You probably wouldn't find you wouldn't use in that traditional sense.

179
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,560
But when you look at the whole genome, you can consider every every possible protein.

180
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:26,280
And then two other points. Reverse vaccinology is safer, safer working with computers than working with live pathogens.

181
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,610
And finally, it's more cost effective because rather than operating a lab, you're operating a computer.

182
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,130
And then finally, protective antigens. That's the last term up here.

183
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:48,700
So most obviously, these are just proteins that allow the immune system to recognize that pathogen and to respond to it.

184
00:22:52,230 --> 00:23:06,630
Okay. So from here with backside, Mel in hand, we took the genome of MTB, we used a reference genome called H 37 RV and put that into vaccine animal.

185
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,360
And this gave us a protein tenacity score for each of these proteins.

186
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,710
So that was essentially a percentile rank.

187
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:27,570
And using past validation, Alison could talk more about this issue for kitchens.

188
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:31,300
Oh, he did. Okay. Okay. Perfect. Great. Great.

189
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:39,719
So we we have a cutoff. I think it was like 91%, 91st percentile, effectively.

190
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,400
It was something around there.

191
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:52,320
And Edison determined that this was the most efficient cut off for capturing all of the actual protective antigen as well,

192
00:23:52,620 --> 00:24:01,230
leaving out as few as possible. So we ended up with 238 proteins with scores meeting that selected threshold.

193
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:08,010
And so from there, this is still too many proteins to present to study in a laboratory setting.

194
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:14,340
So we had to refine our list a little bit further. And so we did that with two different filters.

195
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,640
So the first filter was looking at proteins involved in the biological processes of TB.

196
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:27,630
So these were either, as I talked about before, involving the virulence of the disease,

197
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:37,750
things that help it grow and in fact and destroy the tissue it's operating in, and also proteins related to the latency of TB.

198
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:42,930
And so proteins that allow it to survive in the harsh conditions of the granuloma.

199
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:53,760
So we, we selected those proteins and then we also considered proteins belonging to the protein families of already known protective antigens.

200
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:03,990
So to do that, we, we looked at, I think it was like 20 some proteins are already known to be protective antigens in TV.

201
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,190
And we considered the family that those proteins belong to.

202
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:16,560
And then we selected all the other proteins that belong to those families and also fell in our protagonist do threshold.

203
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:24,510
Um, and the rationale for that, that filter was that as these proteins are genetically related,

204
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,450
their, their structure and their function is also going to be similar.

205
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,190
And so it's within reason to expect that they might also be protective antigens.

206
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:43,560
So with these two filters, we arrived at 82 proteins, which is still too many to study in that laboratory setting.

207
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:49,020
Um, so we had to move on for a final refinement.

208
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:56,130
And as I was talking about the BCG vaccine, it's kind of patchy in its efficacy.

209
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,910
So depending on what population it is applied to, it might be more or less effective.

210
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:10,680
And that's because different populations around the world have different, different appeals for the MHC.

211
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:21,210
And so we want to have protective antigens that apply broadly to to as many people as possible.

212
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:32,419
All right. So what we considered, we considered promiscuous epitopes and a promiscuous epitope is an epitope that binds to.

213
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,050
So an epitope that is like a segment of an antigen.

214
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:45,230
So a promiscuous epitope is one of those epitopes that binds to a large number of different alleles of the MHC.

215
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:57,979
So after after this filter, we arrived at 16 proteins that first met our protagonist threshold using vaccine.

216
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:04,580
And now that either had a biological function that related to the virulence or

217
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:10,910
latency of MTB or belong to a family of an already known protective antigen.

218
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:16,130
And that had a large number of promiscuous epitopes.

219
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,400
And so we expected to have a broad population coverage.

220
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,380
And here here's just a figure from my paper, kind of just a general workflow.

221
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,870
So starting at the top, the entire proteome has 3900 proteins.

222
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,320
We narrowed that down to 238 using back side.

223
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:41,400
And now after removing the 24 already known protective antigens, we arrived at 214.

224
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,520
And then this is all the stuff I just discussed and we ended up with with 16

225
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,350
proteins in the end that we reported as most likely to be protected antigens.

226
00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:02,560
So now we can kind of consider big picture questions related to my study and how we're going to move forward.

227
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,530
So reverse vaccinology cannot operate on its own accord.

228
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:18,700
It has to complement traditional vaccinology because you can't just say that you can just pump something

229
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:24,069
into vaccine and get a good progenitor B score and assume that it's going to be a good protective antigen.

230
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,130
You have to validate your findings in the laboratory setting.

231
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:37,780
So reverse vaccinology is a very powerful tool for all the reasons that I discussed before, but only when it complements traditional vaccinology.

232
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:50,420
So steps going forward, what we would have to do with these 16 protected antigens or prospective protective antigens that my study reported,

233
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,920
we'd have to study them in a laboratory setting. We'd have to see if they actually do confer immunity of any sort.

234
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:09,110
And then from there, you if you do find positive results, if if we are producing an immune response,

235
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:15,440
then perhaps you could move on to on to that clinical trials stage.

236
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,810
And that is the summary of my research that I put together.

237
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:26,210
I have some time for questions if any of you have questions and otherwise.

238
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:31,570
Thanks for. Thanks for listening. She's.

239
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:43,250
Of course, one of those sympathies is based on the reference to strength, maybe a kind of hope for others.

240
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:55,700
Nancy, do you want to show a little bit of what you are doing, some of your friends work, by the way, we introduce you to some her.

241
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,070
So I'm using I've selected five of the.

242
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:14,400
Out of the 16 scooter down. Based upon either the ever increasing promiscuity or the biological processes that they're involved in.

243
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:25,340
And I'm going to do a sequence. Variation and I guess a variation analysis based on sequences from all the different lineages.

244
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,740
Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex from.

245
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:39,680
I guess if geographical. But we're basically shooting.

246
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:47,350
From around the. To assess like population coverage.

247
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:57,090
Okay. Very cool. Kind of because of the mentions of the two population diversity.

248
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:07,800
Mhm. Uh. Remembers his finger one use MPB different genetically distributed worldwide to a different city.

249
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:15,420
And then he also has another figure show the distribution for MHC class.

250
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:22,739
So MPB uh is not one of the most variable capacity.

251
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:30,390
More challenge ones of course. HIV as we know, flu also all the time, but still.

252
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:36,330
So I think what they're trying to do is to follow up for your work.

253
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,880
You identified those 16 protein with the vaccine potential.

254
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:45,299
But the one the question, of course,

255
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:56,280
that you may still want to further narrow down and the he mentioned to looking for more conservative antigen so that you don't have to you know,

256
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:07,460
worry about the memory with one strain in order to vaccinate one particular subpopulation or reference.

257
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:16,320
Uh that's a immunity induced the can remember rectangles is a new U strength so.

258
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:28,610
This work is meant to study genetic variation in HPV population or in these antigens.

259
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:37,100
This six antigens with vaccine potential in the broad the natural population have got past.

260
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:45,799
Then after that, you will want to also look at the genetic variation of the pathogen.

261
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,090
How does the variation impact the importance of epitopes?

262
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,770
That's a pretty important role of the immune response.

263
00:32:54,770 --> 00:33:00,290
So at some point he's what you have done with this.

264
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:08,150
Maybe you can hear a little bit about the population. Diversity in general wants to do it.

265
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,860
And I had I put a presentation there.

266
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:27,379
That's what I used to talk about, because today I could talk and talk really good together very well, show you an example using those tools.

267
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:37,580
So I didn't really talk about I used to, as you know, I talk about the TB vaccine, but I thought today is the perfect for you to do in this together.

268
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:47,600
But I think the next thing is when we heard from Exxon talking about the cancer antigen,

269
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,450
trying to find the this is the based on the functional potency potential variants relevance.

270
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:02,540
What's the plan has done is to identify those and also you do the epitope prediction

271
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:11,270
for that among these 16 proteins you generate some we're having you know,

272
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:25,249
more epitopes for both T-cell A and B cell to some more having more epitopes for, um, T-cell epitopes.

273
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:30,800
Some have more B cells. Some have more promiscuous.

274
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:37,580
If it works for both. So but this is the base on our reference track.

275
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:41,600
The genome blends work input.

276
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:50,270
It's based on a reference. But we know the natural population may vary in this antigen, in this important attribute.

277
00:34:50,750 --> 00:35:04,040
So next. Mm hmm. So we sort of could to further narrow down, you highlight the next steps for, you know, the animal studies,

278
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:13,969
in vitro immunological studies and the clinical trials of the the work that medicine's trying to

279
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:24,740
do is to further narrow down this 16 antigens based on this computational computational method.

280
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:36,140
This stuff, I guess, is a sequence where we identify those with less genetic variation across the different genetic lineage.

281
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,840
By the way, I think some of you have to study molecular epidemiology.

282
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:52,050
You must have learned the importance for genotyping like previous hospital.

283
00:35:52,880 --> 00:36:02,840
You talk about sort of therapy. You want to talk about MTB this genetic diversity like a hominid lineage and how that.

284
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:06,800
I don't care. This is our discussants. This.

285
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:15,290
Okay. So it was always very variable because they figured out that it did have quite a.

286
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:23,160
I think there are ten identified ones, but seven official ones.

287
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:38,730
In Year one in India, Oceanic mostly used to in East Asia, which includes the Beijing, which is also mostly in Africa.

288
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:45,060
And then you have three, which is is African India.

289
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:54,000
Which is also mostly in India and Africa. And then you have lineage for which is your American, which is more varied.

290
00:36:54,210 --> 00:37:03,280
Or I guess around the world you have five and six, which are mycobacterium African subtypes, one and.

291
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:08,520
Which are mostly in West Africa or an immigrant population.

292
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,650
And then when you're children is exclusively. Thank you.

293
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:19,060
Sorry to put you up there.

294
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:23,270
You couldn't because it wouldn't burn with the talking. Remind me.

295
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:29,959
Maybe we should follow up with this cousin to extend a follow up to a few minutes on this.

296
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:35,090
Since it's like a serious. I hope it's still computational.

297
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,230
Let's start now today. We used to have to sequence.

298
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,800
We have to collect the structure to our own sequence.

299
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:48,050
But today there are so many initiatives consortium.

300
00:37:48,470 --> 00:38:00,160
And I just wanted the, you know, NPV general, the center of the database where you could read it,

301
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:06,290
access to hundreds of thousands of empty V hold sequence.

302
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,410
Then you can no matter what you study.

303
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:22,180
In what context, if you want to look at particular gene variation, you could produce that we used to have to get down computationally,

304
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:27,710
you know, with the availability of the whole genome sequence of database.

305
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:37,450
You could give this a sequence from work once for a person to give them genetic lineages.

306
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:46,489
Then you could study the classic sequence analyzes, describes variations of variation,

307
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:54,370
could be just simple nucleotides or aging without any impact on the amino acids.

308
00:38:54,380 --> 00:39:03,440
And it could also be just one sequence super agent could relate to a stop code and can kind of truncate.

309
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:10,910
The kitchen lost several hundred amino acids that demonstrated so.

310
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:16,130
So it's interesting so I think this is to further narrow down.

311
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:28,250
For animal studies clinical studies and the do you do how do you do this select you select the subset.

312
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:34,100
I think that talking about this really gets to what we try to the methodology.

313
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:45,560
We try to then discuss what you know, how you pick up the genes because of you prioritize.

314
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:55,180
Here we have a 16 lab report has reported and you try to prioritize some of the genes.

315
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,650
How do you select the quick here? Okay.

316
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:14,460
So one of them was eight, which is part of the people which has been established, has protected antigens and it has the most MHC epitopes.

317
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:26,090
And then for the other one, we selected two because they had they were involved in a large variety of biological.

318
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:33,400
And then. I think the two of the other ones were also based on.

319
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:48,950
And so one study informed the design. And sometimes I have to tell you, when you go to experiment,

320
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:57,940
to talk to experiments that you analyze is all of this computation as it has to be, of course, findings in nature.

321
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,120
But this is more productive use.

322
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:13,360
If you just do one and you have this population concept, right, you have the whole genome for all the genes, you do this research.

323
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,200
This is a lot of ideas and save.

324
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:27,130
And the Watson plan actually did it to the whole region with 3900 some open region frame narrowed down to 100 something 8087.

325
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:33,830
So and finally 16. So this is the any experiment so it would not be possible.

326
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:50,900
So two way computation of the study could very productively generate some data that could inform the design much more resource,

327
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:54,640
demanding experiments and clinical research.

328
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:57,740
You see the relationship now? Yeah.

329
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:06,680
As the plan mentioned, it's not meant to replace the or this experimental study.

330
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:18,620
Instead, we try to inform the design so that those the resource demanding laboratory work,

331
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:27,769
animal work or can, you know, be focused on some antigens that we can share.

332
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:32,600
And in this case you are looking the general way to search.

333
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:37,450
And in those experiments work comes to that kind of work.

334
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:44,580
Right. So I think this is I think it's not today's talk for this discussion.

335
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:49,610
It's not for me to you memorize all that. I thought every time I was amazed.

336
00:42:49,610 --> 00:43:02,680
ALL Oh, that's it. It's to see how the difference that this works together and to enhance sloppiness here for each other and stuff for the patient.

337
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:16,220
So I think this is a very useful and of course in support plan, this is a oh, oh a lab.

338
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,750
And I'm so glad to have you here.

339
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:26,730
And of course, you. I didn't.

340
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:35,940
Nancy. Also, thank you for sharing your your work.

341
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:41,310
And so we didn't have hope. How many strengths have you been able to fund?

342
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:48,070
No. And I have.

343
00:43:51,300 --> 00:44:04,410
So she's trying to go into those publicly available database to identify, pull out the whole genome sequence of empty string.

344
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:16,740
That's hopefully the collection that this eventually will make where represents all the different genetic and genetic lineages.

345
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,210
I, I will find another time to tell you the story.

346
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:30,990
I have always believed that if, you know, traditional teaching o tb is caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis,

347
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:44,490
very few people probably think about the different strain who have or different language who have a different ability of virus transmissibility.

348
00:44:46,950 --> 00:45:00,899
Genes. That's the until we stop the molecular epidemiology and the we realize some strain and despite what's related to a

349
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:15,660
patient with highly infectious disease but it didn't get spread while other strains seemed to be easily spread.

350
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:24,720
This was a study I was involved back in 1998 where you open.

351
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:31,400
And so at that time we had to demonstrate.

352
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:37,920
It was a study in the center of a centers in a homeless population.

353
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:50,370
We saw 190 some cases and the one strep cause, one quarter of the cases in the homeless population there.

354
00:45:51,390 --> 00:46:04,680
While the strain, the patients that carry the strain also frequents the homeless soup kitchen or shelter.

355
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:10,420
And we also had like across the street for TB disease,

356
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:26,100
we have a patient and culture in a pizza post and the largest cluster caused by one strain involved a one quarter of the about 200 cases.

357
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:38,040
So that does tell us the genetic variation is has the implication for varied virulence.

358
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:43,799
Of course, we also have the difference in impact on the back.

359
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:54,880
So you want to attack those highly for virulence and very, very, you know, transmissible.

360
00:46:55,590 --> 00:47:04,559
And the we that's the study was really into that then I after that I did I had quite a

361
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:13,469
base with the study genetic burden and clinical relevant genetic variation of strain.

362
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:21,420
So then that concept, what's really interesting is after we identify that portion,

363
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:33,540
larger proportion of homeless populations of disease and I would collaborate with the immunologist and went to to invade your study you

364
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:44,580
told us Ignatius and this macrophages studies and they showed that we had the H seven search which is the reference strength you use.

365
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:54,390
We also have another spleen that's caused a lot of the skin has the conversion means the infection but didn't cause really many

366
00:47:55,290 --> 00:48:08,069
people broke down infection people in other words in infectious disease not so always you quick to has the genes for virulence.

367
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:20,910
This is not quite the same concept in molecular epidemiologists like a one isolates that cause larger proportion of people.

368
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:28,290
But the exposure exposed the people had covered the skin has shown that.

369
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,980
Translation, but not many people got sick,

370
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:46,580
so they did this study in vitro and there were some volunteers and they found this highly infectious, this homeless population.

371
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:59,630
That was the Beijing family. You mentioned just a mention which has invaded, spread all over, very successful in terms of transmission.

372
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:11,570
And so that's a long story. And I think when you talk about this next step, what it reminds me of is the ongoing work.

373
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:19,940
And then that work will come back to what you talk about, you know, animal studies in virtual.

374
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:26,290
Experiments, studies. Does that make sense?

375
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:33,250
You see all this? This is why I think it's good to learn that computation.

376
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:43,960
And another thing is that here we are, public health professionals who care for patients and also epidemiologists.

377
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:49,240
I want to also show you another thing is the population concept.

378
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,529
The the the also studied the complete.

379
00:49:53,530 --> 00:50:00,490
The paper is on canvas. I post. Go to read the entire paper of their work.

380
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,720
You will find the project very interesting.

381
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,100
The difference of filtering and the screening.

382
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:19,300
Uh. How? One of the sense I remember years ago when I went to Keystone Symposium and the,

383
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:33,670
a lot of experiments the scientists everyone was for 71 antigen with the potential for vaccine or drugs or diagnostics

384
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:43,120
that's a I'm someone who also has a epidemiology background while I'm also interested in laboratory antigen identification.

385
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:51,010
I just so I asked them if they know whatever they claim can be diagnostics antigen for that.

386
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:54,730
Do you know how that's a variable in the population?

387
00:50:55,390 --> 00:51:04,020
Well, there there were like 600 to some posters probably really.

388
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,100
Everyone is talking about something different.

389
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:16,960
That's why I think of today the possibility to use computational methods that really allow us to address those questions.

390
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,860
Otherwise, we have to hope.

391
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:24,660
Thank you. Thank you so much. Any questions?

392
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:36,910
I I think that just the sort of this I will find another time to talk about some other aspects like you mentioned, the BCG.

393
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:49,910
Despite the hundreds of years you the youth we still it's not the idea why and

394
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:57,580
I want to show some story about the PCR vaccine and a lot of lessons learned,

395
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,709
not just what can be vaccine in general. So we will find out another time to talk.

396
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:08,050
Maybe next week will move the HIV further because it seems like.

397
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:12,760
Yes, okay. Thank you for coming.

398
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:24,910
And to say for every of you know, some of them even 3 hours concentrated before this one and they truly are interested in the cross.

399
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:43,540
I really appreciate that. Aggressive. So I have to go to weekends I where I will have for the presentation next year is great.

400
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:51,160
Thank you so was so glad to see you and I will go back.

401
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:55,240
Oh sure. I just came back into college.

402
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:59,600
I tell you about that. Yeah.

403
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:07,250
And I really don't know, but.

404
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:16,980
Oh, no, no, no, no, it's not.

405
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:20,110
Not that.

406
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:31,540
I'm sorry. I just wanted to be sure.

407
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:35,170
Absolutely. Nancy, sorry.

408
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:39,640
I didn't appreciate this before. And.

409
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:49,639
Yeah, and I think that your plan has a lot more hands on experience with epitope prediction, population coverage.

410
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:59,350
And once you hopefully have got to that point, maybe, you know, I think we had.

411
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:05,889
Yeah, yeah. And if you have any issues hang ups with it, it's kind of confusing.

412
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:09,310
So yeah, so are and that kind of thing.

413
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:14,320
I was not at all when I started today's lecture I think made more sense.

414
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:18,249
Or is most that relevance to your work?

415
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:22,120
I didn't give you only your true. Yeah.

416
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,580
Yeah. I hope it's helpful. Yeah. Good.

417
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:31,170
So I'll reach out. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good.

418
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:34,950
