1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,310
Princess Di was in the building when.

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:33,040
One. I'm going to miss the whole explanation of our final products, but I'm just going to guess it's time to get started.

3
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,130
Okay. Welcome to your discussion for November 14th.

4
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,780
The plan for today is to review quiz number ten and complete engage learning number eight.

5
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,910
So we will jump right into Quiz ten. Question one.

6
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:58,329
Parents of children who were born with birth defects may be more likely to remember any drugs or

7
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:04,600
exposures that occurred during pregnancy than parents of children born without birth defects.

8
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,870
This is an example of recall bias.

9
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:18,320
This is because parents of controls are more likely to inaccurately recall the past exposure when compared to parents of cases.

10
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:32,630
The odds ratio over population was calculated from the table below to be 2.33 according to the other table.

11
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,080
What direction is the bias in the observed results? Calculating this odds ratio,

12
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:54,870
you can see that this is biased away from the null because it will come out to 5.25 as that is greater than 2.33 and the no value of 1.0.

13
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,090
The observed odds ratio is biased away from the null value that got bigger.

14
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:11,490
So further away from one. Individuals who are exposed are more likely to be lost to follow up and have their outcome be unobserved.

15
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:19,490
This is an example of selection bias. As people who are exposed are more likely to be lost.

16
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:29,300
To follow up, it is selection bias. A study that is internally valid is able to draw the correct conclusions from the study.

17
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,780
A study that is externally valid is generalizable to the source population.

18
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:49,280
Selecting your study population to be representative of the source population makes the results of a randomized controlled trial more generalizable.

19
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,240
This is true because the more similar our study population is to our source population,

20
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,610
the more likely our intervention will have a similar effect in the source population.

21
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:11,390
Non differential measurement of error or misclassification usually biases results toward the null.

22
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,400
You see less of an effect, so it is closer to the no value.

23
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,240
The association between self-reported frequency of sunburns and melanoma was

24
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:32,480
examined in a recent study when questioned after after the diagnosis of melanoma.

25
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:37,520
Some women with melanoma may have exaggerated their frequency of sunburn,

26
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:43,910
especially if they were concerned that sun exposure was a reason they got melanoma.

27
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:53,180
This is an example of differential misclassification because one group is more likely to remember the exposure and accurately.

28
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:05,899
Selection bias can occur and what types of study design selection bias can occur in all of these study designs case control,

29
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:18,520
prospective cohort or retrospective cohort? Selection bias can occur in a case control study when controls are more likely than the source population,

30
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:25,000
also known as the base population, to be included in the study if they have been exposed.

31
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:38,440
And that is true. Cruise control studies are more susceptible to information, bias and exposure than prospective cohort studies.

32
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:51,170
This is because the cases may be more likely to recall the exposure happening at a higher rate than the controls,

33
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,229
which may be kind of fuzzy on the past,

34
00:04:54,230 --> 00:05:02,810
especially if cases things are biased prior to you asking the question, thinking that this definitely caused their condition.

35
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:11,720
And now for engaged learning, which you can find under this week on canvas or assignments,

36
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:18,260
we will work on that for the rest of the period and it will be due 30 minutes after class.

37
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:26,030
But we can go over it if everyone gets done. And that is basically all for the moment.

38
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,874
So you can work on that. Think. We are looking at this picture.

39
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:48,282
A team of investigators within a limited budget decided they would like to investigate the relationship between hypertension,

40
00:05:48,302 --> 00:05:52,621
high blood pressure and the risk of myocardial infarction.

41
00:05:52,622 --> 00:06:00,751
Heart attacks. With a cohort study, they decided to collect self-reported hypertension by a questionnaire,

42
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:04,232
rather than conduct measurements of blood pressure on all participants,

43
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:10,322
they also needed to cut some corners on their definition of myocardial infarction.

44
00:06:12,002 --> 00:06:18,002
Today, we will explore the impacts of the resulting measurement error of the exposure and outcomes on their findings.

45
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:28,622
The two by two table below shows the truth for both the exposure, hypertension and the outcome myocardial infarction.

46
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:36,272
So 4600 people truly had hypertension and truly had a heart attack.

47
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:46,432
And 16,550 truly had hypertension and no heart attack or no hypertension.

48
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:54,531
3710 had a heart attack and four no hypertension.

49
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:57,682
18,550 did not have a heart attack.

50
00:06:58,642 --> 00:07:08,462
So for number one, constructed a new two by two table, assuming that 40% of people with true hypertension will report that they have not.

51
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:19,612
So they really have it, but they say they don't. And for this, you assume that people without hypertension correctly report that status.

52
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:28,821
So the first, you can see that 40% of the people with true hypertension report none.

53
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:36,622
So only 60% of this 4600 will remain in cell age with three hypertension.

54
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:42,712
And the true outcome is yes.

55
00:07:54,272 --> 00:08:00,812
This leaves 40% of those to move down here to the no hypertension category that way.

56
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:12,712
So 40% of this 4600 have moved down here to make it 5550 with no hypertension.

57
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:25,302
Who had a heart attack? The same was true for the hypertension category for people who did not have a myocardial infarction.

58
00:08:25,302 --> 00:08:32,412
So only 60% of the SRI hypertension people remain in cell B,

59
00:08:34,452 --> 00:08:45,342
40% of those moved down and you end up with a total of 25,170 who say they have no hypertension and did not have a heart attack.

60
00:08:50,642 --> 00:08:54,301
Drawing the arrows between the cells to reflect this migration.

61
00:08:54,302 --> 00:09:00,782
You can see they both move downward from the hypertension to no hypertension category.

62
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:04,892
So a two cell C and cell B, t, cell D.

63
00:09:07,682 --> 00:09:15,692
But you can see that the totals do not change in the myocardial infarction and no myocardial infarction category as a total.

64
00:09:18,302 --> 00:09:25,172
That means this is non differential because the error is the same among those with and without myocardial infarction,

65
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:36,902
which is our outcome of interest. And given the movement between cells and the fact that the risk ratio within this classification is 1.20.

66
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:44,192
Trying to explain the differences in the observed risk ratio versus the true risk ratio,

67
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:55,412
this new risk ratio is lower than the true risk ratio and biased toward the null, which you can see as it's lower and closer to one.

68
00:09:57,092 --> 00:10:04,052
Because while the incidence in the exposed does not change, the incidence in the unexposed gets larger.

69
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:12,332
And remember that hypertension or your exposed and no hypertension are your unexposed categories.

70
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:17,732
And people have moved from exposed to unexposed.

71
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:28,982
In another scenario, the investigators retrospectively obtain medical records on all participants with myocardial infarction,

72
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:39,572
allowing them to accurately assign hypertension status for these individuals using blood pressure measurements used recorded in the medical record.

73
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:46,562
That means that they know the true hypertension status, so there is no misclassification of that.

74
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:52,262
No such review was conducted for people without myocardial infarction.

75
00:10:53,162 --> 00:11:01,922
So investigators must rely on self-report with which 40% of people with true hypertension report no hypertension.

76
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:07,982
As you can see this category with the people who had myocardial infarctions.

77
00:11:09,272 --> 00:11:19,502
This is the truth over here. But for no myocardial infarction, you still have the same misclassification as before.

78
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:29,582
So 40% of the people with hypertension and no myocardial infarction have moved down to the no hypertension category.

79
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:40,552
And drawing arrows. You can see that only cell be to cell D is happening in this table.

80
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:50,152
This is a differential measurement error because it is not equal and the participants with and without myocardial infarction.

81
00:11:54,702 --> 00:12:01,092
Given the movement between cells and the fact that the risk ratio with this classification is 2.46.

82
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:06,582
Try to explain the differences in the observed and true risk ratio.

83
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:14,682
This risk ratio is much larger than the trigger association, which we saw before was in the one.

84
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:25,091
In this scenario, only people without a myocardial infarction are moving between exposure groups,

85
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:32,142
with people switching to the no hypertension group from the hypertension group with misclassification.

86
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:35,772
Some participants, as I said, would move from cell B to cell D.

87
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:41,082
Thus the result is biased away from the null. So it gets larger.

88
00:12:41,382 --> 00:13:00,602
Effect is exaggerated. Now let's envision a scenario where exposure is measured without error, but there is misclassification of the outcome.

89
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:08,192
The investigators base their definition of the myocardial infarction on symptoms and EKG findings,

90
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:16,472
but no cardiac biomarkers were available as such, 20% of the myocardial infarction cases are missed.

91
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:19,832
For those with and without hypertension.

92
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:35,912
So you can see here that you're removing 20% of the 40 620% of 3710 to the, you know, myocardial infarction category for the outcome.

93
00:13:40,842 --> 00:13:48,732
And the arrows between cells showed movement from A to C or A to B and C to D,

94
00:13:51,072 --> 00:13:58,602
which also moves the total of the new myocardial infarction category O as the

95
00:13:58,602 --> 00:14:02,682
same misclassification is occurring among those with and without hypertension.

96
00:14:03,252 --> 00:14:06,462
This is also not differential misclassification.

97
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:19,392
Given the movement between cells and the fact that the risk ratio for this scenario with misclassification is 1.30,

98
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:24,642
try to explain the differences in the observed versus true risk ratio.

99
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:33,312
Since there are equal percentages of persons moving from the disease to non disease groups among the exposed and unexposed.

100
00:14:34,032 --> 00:14:41,952
There is no effect on the ratio since both numerators are multiplied by the same value while the denominators do not change.

101
00:14:43,122 --> 00:14:46,272
If you scroll up for a second just to see the errors again. Yes. Thank you.

102
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:56,752
That's perfect. For this one.

103
00:14:56,752 --> 00:15:01,732
You're just moving people between categories of the outcome, which is myocardial infarction.

104
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:06,292
I think you.

105
00:15:12,492 --> 00:15:20,202
Finally imagine that a blood test provides information on myocardial infarction that provides information on

106
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:28,362
myocardial infarction was available for persons with hypertension since they were part of an established CVD clinic.

107
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,802
Cardiovascular disease clinic would be more clear there.

108
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:38,352
As a result, there is no misclassification of the outcome among hypertensive.

109
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:45,642
But 20% of myocardial infarction cases are still mis for non hypertensive,

110
00:15:46,872 --> 00:15:55,092
creating a two by two table for this misclassification of the outcome so that only for the no hypertension people,

111
00:15:56,052 --> 00:16:04,152
you are taking 20% of this 3710 and moving them to the no myocardial infarction category.

112
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:13,472
Drawing arrows to see this in motion.

113
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:28,382
You're basically just moving cell C over to Selby, which also shifts the total and the outcome categories towards normal myocardial infarction.

114
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:36,512
This sense you're only doing one of the exposure categories.

115
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:44,432
This is a differential misclassification because the error is different among those with and without hypertension.

116
00:16:46,232 --> 00:16:53,342
In this scenario of differential misclassification of the outcome, your risk ratio is much larger than the true.

117
00:16:57,422 --> 00:17:04,282
Given the movement between cells and the fact that the relative risk for the misclassified data is 1.63,

118
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:09,992
try to explain the differences in the observed versus the true risk ratio.

119
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:19,142
With misclassification, some participants would move from cell C to cell be, which you can see here seems 30.

120
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:30,762
The result will be biased away from the norm, which inflates the risk ratio and exaggerates your relationship.

121
00:17:32,472 --> 00:17:38,291
It can also be seen mathematically using your formula as forward for narrative incidence.

122
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:45,252
Among the exposed is unchanged in this scenario and that would be the story here.

123
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:52,482
The cumulative incidence in the unexposed is too low.

124
00:17:54,102 --> 00:17:56,592
Thus we see an inflation of the risk ratio.

125
00:18:11,912 --> 00:18:21,872
And you can see that 80% of this 3710 divided by that number will make this denominator as a whole smaller.

126
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:29,962
So the numerator, which is the truth, will become relatively larger and in point in this case.

127
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:39,732
And that is all. Yes.

128
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:52,302
And which one? Thank you.

129
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:53,502
No problem.
