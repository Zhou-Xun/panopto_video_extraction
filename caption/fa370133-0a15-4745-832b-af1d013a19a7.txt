1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:09,940
Now, given that, I wouldn't want to say to the guy, you know, this is just the start of the next thing.

2
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,200
You guys want to do it.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,370
You guys want to talk about the clues at the beginning of class or at the end of class together you're going to get in trouble.

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,950
Okay. Well, I guess it makes sense. Think.

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,880
All right. So quiz number one on Thursday.

6
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,720
Like I said. I didn't call anybody.

7
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,910
That's a little story for you. Yeah, sure.

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:59,380
All right. So those of you who weren't here on Thursday, I kind of finally settled in on how we're going to do this.

9
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:05,260
It'll be online. And once you sign in, you have a set amount of time to finish it.

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,580
It's currently set default 39 class time. We have 80 minutes.

11
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,080
I could probably go to 90 minutes of people to people like in for 10 minutes.

12
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,780
Okay. And the other thing, because it is online, I can't really control what you can and cannot access.

13
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:33,950
So you can use your notes. But, you know, just know that if you don't if you're not familiar with the notes going in, you're going to run out of time.

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,520
Because there are, you know, a fair, fair amount of questions.

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,709
So I highly encourage at least getting to know the notes, maybe not as much memorization, but recognizing,

16
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:51,260
you know, the various topics where things are I think would help immensely with the studying.

17
00:01:52,250 --> 00:02:02,990
A lot of multiple choice than I have some matching rank ordering and then a series of short answer.

18
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:11,590
There may be some basic calculations along the lines of what we've done in class for exposure.

19
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,770
That pretty much gives you a sense of the types of question.

20
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,640
Any questions for me?

21
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:32,000
Have you considered a change in time to to just basically are giving like a bigger window to take the exam if it's a problem for people?

22
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,840
I could we could probably do that. You know,

23
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,830
my only thing is just make sure you're not with other people from the class

24
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:45,020
when you take it that that's beyond the scope of what we're attending here.

25
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:53,680
But does that help to give? I mean, it has to be kind of I don't want to go like into the weekend or anything.

26
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,010
All right. What would people say?

27
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:02,590
What would be helpful? I need to hold it right there.

28
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,020
For example, the master's exam and some of those are having his opening.

29
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,740
He's making it available like for 24 or 48 hours.

30
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,070
But then you have to get what he started. You got to finish it with him.

31
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,410
Yeah, I can do that again. My only thing is just don't you got to work.

32
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,450
Work on your own. That's the main thing. I don't if you've taken it before, somebody else don't talk about it.

33
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:34,570
But other than that, yeah, I can. I can be flexible. Um, I'll change the parameters and, but personally, I like taking it alone because I,

34
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,080
if I'm taking a class, then what else they really want is attention. Yeah, right, right.

35
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,430
Unless there are people that want to take it in here.

36
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,620
But if you're given more of a broader window, I'm guessing that wouldn't be a people's first choice.

37
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,139
Is it really better Internet connection at home or something? Okay. Okay.

38
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:00,410
I can I can change the parameters for that and I'll send an announcement just reiterating that what those are.

39
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,170
Any other questions? Concerns.

40
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,630
Is there a heavy focus on like the readings, too? I wouldn't say heavy, no.

41
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:22,040
I could say that. And then, you know, if you know, I think if you've paid attention in class, not everything is going to be straight from the notes,

42
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,120
but at least everything that has been discussed openly in the class that's on her.

43
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:34,650
But much of it does come in. A lot of. Other questions.

44
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:47,020
Okay. We'll see how it goes. You know, COVID kind of changed the way we do things, some things for the better.

45
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,420
And I think, you know, the way we do some of this, I think is it it could be more user friendly,

46
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,810
but if there's issues like, you know, after you take it.

47
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,480
You know, pre-COVID, it is all paper, pencil in the classroom.

48
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,430
Pencils down. Kind of not. I don't teach a class back then, but I've heard stories.

49
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,480
After so many other questions.

50
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,490
All right. Think of anything. If we have time at the end, we can talk some more about it.

51
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:26,220
So today. So, so far in the class, we've given a background on some of the fundamentals of the Department of Exposure,

52
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,900
Science and Chemical Hazards, Risk Assessment, etc.

53
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:39,120
Now we're going to go into a lot of the rest of the class talks about the more technical aspects of how do we go about evaluating what we have.

54
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:49,049
So it stays kind of an intro to some of those methodologies with a focus on comparing the two units that we have left in the future,

55
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,780
one being occupational, the other being environmental.

56
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:58,230
So starting next week, we can start our deep dove into more of the technical occupational setting.

57
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,540
And then after that you can kind of go back up to the the environmental.

58
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,580
So today I'm just going to talk about some of the the basics, the kind of.

59
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:15,330
While this is applicable to both settings and will point out some of the main

60
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,160
differences are before we dove into each of those separately in the future.

61
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,950
So hierarchy of exposure, data differences, occupational and environmental or community.

62
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,160
Those are kind of interchangeable terms that for our purposes in this class.

63
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,680
Personal exposure assessment. And then we'll talk about a few hypothetical examples.

64
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,820
So we showed this previously in the hierarchy.

65
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:50,040
This was back, I think, a sort of lecture to science.

66
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:57,610
But talking about, you know, if you were all things equal, if you're able to choose how you want it,

67
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:03,510
exposure data, you typically would want it quantified personal measurement.

68
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,760
And we'll talk a little bit about the differences within that, you know, biomarkers versus an external measurement.

69
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:17,850
But this is typically what's thought of as the best. And then as you go down this list, more area type of measurements,

70
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,090
as close as you can get to where the action is, then you have quantified surrogates of exposure.

71
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:32,129
So that's something like, you know, combining how much people drink in water times the concentration of water versus

72
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:39,060
actually measuring what they're ingesting on site and so on and so forth.

73
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:46,320
So duration of living in a place and how far it is to a potential source, that's that's another one.

74
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,389
But that's not going to be typically as good. It's going to have more air further down.

75
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:57,690
We go on this list and then you're adding more uncertainty here on this next one.

76
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:04,440
Number six words again, residents location of duration, but less certainty about the source of the exposure.

77
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,770
And then finally, residence or employment in a more general.

78
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,480
Sons. So again, personal measurements.

79
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:27,650
Actual measurement in the area. And then you kind of left after that was more surrogate type measures of questionnaire data,

80
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:36,270
survey data for just based on location and other information you can gather on what's being produced emitted.

81
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:45,080
It's like that. So here's our methods we introduced before.

82
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,010
We have direct and indirect methods.

83
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:56,720
And as we talked about in the first week, you know, some of this is dictated by what your what your goals are.

84
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,890
We talk about retrospective studies, prospective studies and current studies.

85
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,680
So, you know, if you're looking at a retrospective study, the direct methods a lot of times are off the table,

86
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,290
seeing what prospective or future assessments for risk purposes.

87
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:16,880
A lot of times you can't take direct measurements, so you're left with some of these indirect methods.

88
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:27,080
But direct methods are used a lot for occupational, which we talk about environmental as well,

89
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:38,570
both risk epidemiology purposes and for exposure science in and of itself to help understand the mechanisms of exposure to features of cancer.

90
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,040
Oops. Okay.

91
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:52,000
So again, starting to differentiate between occupational and community or environmental, the overarching principles are typically the same.

92
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:59,450
You know, you have a chemical agent or it could be biological or physical, and you're trying to quantify that in some media,

93
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:05,840
you know, could be air, water, soil, dust, whatever it might be food, but they might differ in their approaches.

94
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,600
And we're going to try to, you know, to this part a little bit before we dove into more detail.

95
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:17,510
So, you know, if you're on a worksite and asbestos, you know, asbestos is a concern,

96
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:23,180
you're going to roll up in this kit that you bought at Home Depot. I hope not, because we don't know.

97
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,300
You know, a lot of these are sketchy at best, right?

98
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,799
I haven't looked into a lot of these much the radon ones are pretty good because you

99
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,970
have to send it into a certified lab after living it out in your home for a while.

100
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,060
For those of you not from around here, radon can be quite high in this area is you never know.

101
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,440
I was in one house here that had was above the EPA limit.

102
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:52,190
My current house is just below the EPA limit. But the radon is a concern for steel monitors.

103
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,810
You know, they got that pretty well figured out in my house. They're incorporated with the smoke detectors.

104
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,950
But again, there's a lot of nuance to how good a method is and when it should or shouldn't be applied.

105
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,840
But, you know, this one, I've never tested out.

106
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,520
You know, if you're in an occupational setting or you're working in a consulting firm and you're really concerned about asbestos,

107
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,720
you want to have the best methods available for that application.

108
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:26,470
And I don't think that's it. So just a review of our rules of entry and how they apply to these different settings.

109
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,570
So place information is a lot of times the biggest concern, and that's how a lot of the standards are set.

110
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:37,600
So as we mentioned, but you can also have a lot of skin and skin exposure as well.

111
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:43,100
It's much more difficult to define, hasn't been as involved as much as it probably should have been.

112
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:48,070
And a lot of the risk assessment and standards setting. And then finally ingestion.

113
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,630
There are there have been stories of just as being a major contributor.

114
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,410
People working a lot with their hands and doing, you know, poor hygiene habits in the workplace.

115
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:06,330
But in general, that's how it goes. Community, on the other hand, depends a lot on what's going on.

116
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:13,510
You can see all kinds of different examples of inhalation being the major ingestion or dermal.

117
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:19,900
Sometimes it's all three are equally, almost equally contributing to the exposure.

118
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,630
Oh, Professor, we want to talk about air pollution.

119
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,710
Of course, it's a big one.

120
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:35,130
Ambient air pollution and as well as indoor indoor air quality is also highly variable and a concern that sometimes gets overlooked.

121
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,360
Ingestion, of course, food, drinking water, soil.

122
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:49,960
I'd say also house dust is big for a lot of indoor chemicals and then for thermal as well.

123
00:12:50,620 --> 00:13:00,330
Many different scenarios. And this song will come back when we talk about how do you approach sampling,

124
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:10,680
knowing a lot of this information is extremely useful to selecting how to go about quantifying things in the workplace for pathways usually short,

125
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:17,420
simple, direct and easy to identify, you know where each of interest is coming from.

126
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,320
Usually it's a process.

127
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:26,460
You know, what chemicals are coming into the facility, how they're used, how they're exposed of, and you can pinpoint what's going on.

128
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,100
And that exposure can be to depend a lot on, you know, is there ventilation?

129
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:40,640
Is there. Other things going on, personal protective equipment that would reduce or increase one's exposure.

130
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,299
So that's usually pretty straightforward in the workplace.

131
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:49,670
Not always good, but mostly once again in the community. We talk about some of these agents.

132
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,180
It can be wide open. You have no idea maybe where it's coming from.

133
00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:00,650
The source could be many, many different sources of the same chemical or same type of things like that.

134
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,940
And we've shown this, this figure over an example.

135
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:15,770
You know, we had we would previously we had the hazardous waste site here, but we'll have an example today where we're talking about LED smelting.

136
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,370
Last time it was Coke. If we look at Coke last week.

137
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,520
You know, the furnace? Yeah. Yeah.

138
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:36,950
It's like we said, it's a lot of combustion byproducts and heavy metals from coal turning coal into coke for various industrial purposes.

139
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,350
Exposure levels, magnitude and range, as you might expect in the workplace.

140
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:50,979
If you're working directly with hazardous chemicals, one times those levels are going to be much higher than in community settings.

141
00:14:50,980 --> 00:15:00,010
However, you know, we have many examples of disasters that have occurred where exposure levels were high community level and community settings.

142
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,820
And then when linking to toxicology, toxicology studies, especially historically,

143
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:12,370
very as we talk about very high levels of dose typically administered.

144
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:21,400
So they have a better chance of seeing an effect. So versus what you might see in a community setting, very low levels.

145
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,000
You'd have to, you know, increase the number of animals used.

146
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,160
Immensely to be able to see a significant increase in an effect that.

147
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:39,390
No. So that's a constant sort of double edged sword there when comparing against epidemiology and and.

148
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:52,750
Toxicology. But a lot of times the good toxicology studies will show you say what their dose levels are and also.

149
00:15:54,270 --> 00:16:01,230
Tell you what that means with regards to real life exposures and what times they'll be able to say

150
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:08,580
this are medium dose levels similar to these levels that were found in an occupational setting,

151
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:18,310
something like that. Community exposure is usually much lower, even though something important to consider is your exposure is much,

152
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:24,560
much longer away from the workplace, workplace, you know, maybe 40, 50 hours a week.

153
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,520
Whereas at home, it can be much, much more than that.

154
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:36,320
Behavior patterns. Methodology.

155
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,140
So now that we're going to try to start quantifying exploiting roles in the workplace,

156
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:50,390
you have typically you might have more options at your disposal because you know where the people are.

157
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:58,430
You can take a measurement in real time unless it's a retrospective occupational epidemiologist, for example.

158
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,020
But a lot of times we'll have good documentation of how long they worked there,

159
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:09,140
what jobs they've had, what tasks within those jobs performed in pieces together.

160
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:20,240
Representativeness of the exposure. You know, a lot of activities are repetitive and workplaces, so that helps make things more consistent.

161
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:29,310
Again, getting out measuring can be easier, although give me a challenge if say you're a compliance officer in a compliance officer.

162
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:35,600
Nyasha I've heard a lot. When they try to go to workplaces, it's hard for them to gain access and they have to get, you know,

163
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:46,270
similar to like a search warrant or something too from the courts to be able to enter a workplace which is uncomfortable but but necessary sometimes.

164
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,169
And, you know, in a workplace, you can also more easily because you know that source,

165
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:57,980
you know how that pathway very well your measurement strategies can account for that.

166
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,930
Whereas in the community setting, again,

167
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:08,210
if you have to take measurements of every media that's possible in that pathway, it can become very burdensome.

168
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:18,520
So when deciding on the method, I'm guessing you've seen figures like this before in other classes.

169
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,120
So when it comes to, you know, taking a sample of a chemical exposure, you're trying to choose a method.

170
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:30,160
Which one you use, what you think would be the most desirable.

171
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,960
Bottom left. The bottom left.

172
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:39,970
Yeah, because it's accurate and it's also precise, accurate and precise.

173
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,990
So accuracy is how well it represents the truth, right?

174
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:50,260
And precise precision is how repeatable it is over and over again.

175
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,040
Which one would you say would be the second ranked? Either.

176
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:06,990
Top left. So you want to be accurate, accurate or unbiased, but maybe not as precise as.

177
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:17,270
Okay. Okay. Who agrees that anyone would vote for either of these two as number two?

178
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:27,410
I agree for the most part. Now, there are situations where if you have a method like this and you know this difference,

179
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,840
where then it might be desirable to do this and have a correction factor.

180
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:38,840
However, in a lot of cases, you don't know that difference. So yeah, you'd be back to square one.

181
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:45,620
But there are instances where if it's a very well-defined method and you know what that biases, it would give you a more precise.

182
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,610
And then with a correction factor, I might be able to do it.

183
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:57,530
And so it sounds like we all agree that on the top right here we have a imprecise and a biased method is probably not the best.

184
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:05,540
So, you know, each for each method, there's tons and tons of different methods for different media that we'll talk about.

185
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,410
All of them have an accuracy and a precision tied to them.

186
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:17,840
It's not always known it was advertised, but that, you know, that asbestos test off the shelf, you know, might look more like this.

187
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:27,000
You know, one of our more involved detail fields and it looks like others.

188
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:36,700
Okay. So let's do a little example of Jane and Jack.

189
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:45,340
So in this hypothetical example, Gene works in a smelter in California led smelter.

190
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:51,069
He went on the LED smelters. So they take the lead and they melted down.

191
00:20:51,070 --> 00:21:02,470
And so it could be used for other things, obviously a very dirty process and can create a lot of emissions both nearby and in the surrounding areas.

192
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:09,250
So Gene is actually working in the facility and we have Jack who lives in the community, community surrounding the smelter.

193
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,780
So how can we do personal exposure monitoring on these two individuals?

194
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:23,080
So without looking ahead, I'm going to have let's see, let's just kind of divide that room here as it makes sense.

195
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:34,920
Group one over here. Tell me in the workplace what kind of approaches you would use and group to over here in a community for Jack.

196
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:40,749
So this is Jane working in the facility and Jack is out in the community.

197
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:45,820
What kind of methods would you consider using to to try to measure?

198
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,380
Not to be detailed, but, General, I'll give you a couple of minutes.

199
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:59,210
Yeah. I mean, I guess you can like.

200
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:07,760
Yeah, sorry, but my, my method for finding workers like, you know, healthcare workers, you know, we're not sure about looking ahead in the numbers.

201
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,330
We're sure, but I think they're going to have to.

202
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:20,810
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I think it's like trying to learn a lot of different sources.

203
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:27,800
Yeah. You know, there's the whole process. But I think you have to you have to get more like variation and part of what's going know.

204
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:36,320
Yeah. Because you see those like pesticide things that they have like they put it on their skin or whatever and then they get like they're leaving.

205
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:44,000
It's very cold in different areas where they're away.

206
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:51,020
There's a problem in like your own address markers, um, I guess.

207
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,820
I mean, ingestion if like, you don't measure it like an individual shower.

208
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,020
Yeah, like, but in terms of yeah. For biomarker. Yeah. So similar to that where.

209
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,090
There seems to be like, Yeah, you guys are working. You guys are Jane.

210
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:17,760
This is Jack searching America. We're going to get back in the work place, usually where it's running on many distances.

211
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:23,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

212
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:27,010
You know, it's like I'm not.

213
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:37,020
I'm not so proud of it. I know you do, but I think it makes me a little different, you know?

214
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:42,660
Well, I just really feel like. Yeah, because usually it's taking information all the time.

215
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:50,240
So we go on vacation. Have.

216
00:23:52,520 --> 00:24:04,770
How much of it is right. Yeah. I don't know this to make. Another after another.

217
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,510
I think we will see more thought service.

218
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:17,660
And even where do they go? Backwards in one instance.

219
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:29,500
Oh, dear. But as for the kind of progress. Usually we're more likely with inquiries all day long when we get a person in town for.

220
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:38,930
It's just like how much, actually? Is it possible to do it right here on the ground, the prison?

221
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:50,670
Yeah, unfortunately, I think that there's a lot of here for things like that more.

222
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:57,880
Yeah. That's what I do for a reason. Let's go out 30 more seconds after there.

223
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,310
Well, it usually goes up in and so.

224
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:15,870
That's a good question. Yeah.

225
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:23,090
Okay, let's do that. Okay. Yeah, you do that.

226
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,360
Yeah. All right. Sounds like the ideas are rolling.

227
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:33,720
Everyone's thinking about their bios, dad exam and everything.

228
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:40,690
All right, so group one, what did you guys come up with? With some approaches that you might control for monitoring.

229
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,660
Yes. So I guess it's since it's like, oh,

230
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,309
like we're not sure if it's like vaporization or it's like more particulate by like since they're like smelting the light.

231
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:59,030
I mean, hazard is like a pathway of exposure as a inhalation and so like using maybe like their

232
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:04,079
face masks or like a product that's like how they're revered like kind of like sampling,

233
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:11,870
not like the filter or up or having like patches on like their skin or the clothing and uniforms like those three and like dermal patches

234
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:20,239
that they're using pesticide monitoring and then maybe like in within I think they mentioned this too because like in the workplace,

235
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,990
you can also have like sentinel and monitoring systems that kind of like make your body throughout the factory and

236
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:34,070
then also like testing the runoff water to see if that's going to be and that that gets more in to the environment.

237
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:41,000
Okay. Yeah, it sounds like you've covered a lot of what the the concerns of the issue with your with your pathways.

238
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:47,209
And as long as people are washing their hands before they eat their sandwich or spoke their cigarets.

239
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:54,480
Right. Yeah. And you know, there's food from the top 1%.

240
00:26:55,010 --> 00:27:06,650
And if you're using that method of testing the filter on their PPE, that wouldn't necessarily be testing their exposure because the PPE.

241
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:11,820
Filtering it out. Right. So how would you test it? And that sort of.

242
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,350
That's where the bio monitoring will come into play.

243
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:25,530
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. There's you know, there's depending on the age of this scenario, there may be ways to do the different points along the.

244
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:34,950
Continuum that we talked about, external exposure, internal dose, absorb dose, some of those things.

245
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:46,210
But yeah, the most common would be. What about crude to what you guys think of for the community.

246
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:57,640
He thought. Let's testing water quality so might be getting into the drinking water for the community.

247
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,900
Let's talk about how you just have to look at so much more.

248
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,070
Yeah. Um, so, like we talked about a lot of different types of testing,

249
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:10,959
but also just like how all of that would have to be done over time in multiple locations

250
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:18,070
and many different people and taking into account more potential like resorption exposure.

251
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,430
So it's kind of just a little bit more of everything. Yeah.

252
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:27,940
Okay, good. And that's kind of what you're hoping to get out of this this exercise.

253
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:34,790
Just, you know, it does. It's the same agent, same chemical, but it might look a lot different.

254
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:43,010
And resources used in one setting or another, you know, the effectiveness of that is going to be very different.

255
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:52,410
And for one, it's one of those small time media multi-year pathway, multi route contaminants.

256
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,290
You know, especially as I mentioned, once you get out in the community, you can be in a lot of different forms.

257
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,240
You have different places.

258
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:13,960
So in our hypothetical, no Jane, who's in the workplace had bloodletting levels and something called zinc to be tested in the blood,

259
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:21,819
by the way, as part of a surveillance program. And we'll talk a little bit about, again, this is just kind of introducing these concepts.

260
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,950
We're going to get into all of these in more detail.

261
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:32,650
But in order for us to have to make use of this, we need to get her consent to use these these records.

262
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,160
However, in our for. Lucky for us, she did provide content.

263
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:41,830
So we have something to go on without even doing any of our own testing.

264
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:47,350
For Jean Jacques, on the other hand. And the community has never had blood measured.

265
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:58,180
Terrified of needles. This is actually if you do field work, this is quite common and a downside to using some biomarkers.

266
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:04,330
So we have no biological to do that. So it's hypothetical.

267
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:11,170
So for a for Jane, because we do have this, we can compare those levels with recommended limits.

268
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,090
So blood on the whole is greater than 25 microgram per deciliter.

269
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:22,930
And what's considered a normal ZP, which is supposed to be 34, if you have that combination,

270
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:27,430
it's going to reflect exposure, recent exposure in the past 2 to 6 weeks.

271
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:36,250
If they're both high, it points to more chronic long term exposure and in this case, both her levels are higher.

272
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:43,090
And as you might expect, working in Wurtsmith, she's been exposed for a long period of time.

273
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,120
So we can compare that for remember, they're in California.

274
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:55,120
So California has its own OSHA program and their regulation is 40.

275
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:02,600
So she is below that. Okay.

276
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:11,959
So but these are still high. And one of the another downside to biomarkers is we know that she's exposed to a lot of blood,

277
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,840
but we don't necessarily know how it's how it's getting there. Right. We don't know where the source is.

278
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,160
So we don't know the route for the source.

279
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,490
But again, because it's a work place, we should be able to figure that out.

280
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:32,540
And we can also use what's called physiologically based pharmacokinetic models, PPK models, to estimate her airborne blood exposure.

281
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,310
So there are tables like this where through both sampling and modeling.

282
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:49,760
You can cross tabulate what your blood level is and expected airborne level if the inhalation is the primary exposure.

283
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:57,080
So for June we said it was 30 and there's a distribution here as with lot of exposure factors that we talked about.

284
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:11,510
She's at 30. So if we go by the the median or 50th percentile, that would equate to about 34 micrograms per cubic meter airborne concentration.

285
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:21,800
And what this does is, you know, if you use a table like this and because you haven't been able to take an air measurement yet for California,

286
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,700
does this trigger a surveillance program?

287
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:36,590
But what would you say if we took an air measurement and it came back as, say, five micrograms per cubic meter?

288
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:42,230
We know her brother is 30, but say you took an air measurement as only five.

289
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:49,030
What might that indicate? A correction factor.

290
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,080
Obviously I came through for the ground.

291
00:32:53,570 --> 00:33:04,870
Yeah, that's where it might indicate, you know, maybe there's a dermal or ingestion concern that we're not we're not seeing on first glance.

292
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:11,230
So that's why it's good to validate that these types of tables are useful,

293
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:16,330
but it's always good to be able to validate with actual data where possible.

294
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:29,150
So we'll talk more about this later in the semester. But PPK models are also sometimes referred to as tactical kinetic modeling.

295
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:40,670
You can kind of you can map what happens to a chemical once it gets in the body or is it distributed, stored or excreted and transformed.

296
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:47,090
And that can allow you, if it's well defined, to kind of back calculate certain things in some circumstances.

297
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:52,940
And that, for example, is how they equate a dose level in toxicology to an animal, you know,

298
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,680
based on a dose per milligram per day to an airborne occupational level through some of this type of model.

299
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:08,500
But again, we're just introducing these concepts today. So that's biomarkers.

300
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,770
So again, for a multi-year pathway,

301
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:21,490
multi route agent biomarkers is sometimes a good way to go for if you're concerned with what effect PPD has on that.

302
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,650
But what about personal monitoring aside from bio biomarkers?

303
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,469
So in this case, for a hypothetical, let's say the company measures time.

304
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:38,170
We had average concentrations of airborne light every six months using what we call personal air sampling policy.

305
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:45,160
And this is actually what Cal OSHA requires for places that have a certain above a certain action level of alert.

306
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:49,530
However, Jane herself has never worn one of these symptoms.

307
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:54,850
But we do find out that a number of people would retire.

308
00:34:55,630 --> 00:35:00,610
So that might help us there. Jack continues to be difficult.

309
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,590
He's also refusing to our narrow sample.

310
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:16,450
So and in because he's in the community you know it's we can't we can't make him part of, you know, worker health laws to do that.

311
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:21,910
So then we're left with other options that could run the gamut of a lot of different things.

312
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:29,890
But again, may not be as good if he got grants us access to his home, we could do some service testing, some air testing area samples.

313
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:40,960
But again, that that personal air measurement, as we'll see many times, is the most desirable because it does follow the person around.

314
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:53,309
So what we can do is take the data that's already been collected from coworkers of Jane among people that do similar

315
00:35:53,310 --> 00:36:01,290
work and take an average of those and use that as a as an estimate of Jane's airborne inhalation of exposure,

316
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:06,120
potentially. And then we can compare that to the car wash appeal.

317
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:13,560
So as we talked about last week, the permissible exposure limits are enforceable at the federal level.

318
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,560
What are the other things we could compare their level to? Pop quiz.

319
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,910
We talked about the plans for the House. The topic.

320
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,740
Yeah. So is S.H.I.E.L.D. usually more current, more health based?

321
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,030
A lot of times a good one to try to use.

322
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:47,310
And then Jack was. So for overall results.

323
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:53,220
So for the workplace scenario, we were able to get a measure of internal so of those.

324
00:36:54,310 --> 00:37:04,810
What the whole would. Um, and for certain well defined chemicals like blood, you can equate that to an estimate of one level.

325
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:15,100
And we were able to also get an average of coworkers three or four levels and take the average of that to estimate her airborne exposure.

326
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,560
And then as we talked about,

327
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:26,380
it'd be great to be able to compare those and make sure that we're confident that inhalation is is the main or only concern.

328
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:35,840
That kids and we'll talk about later in the semester more of the surrogate measures that could be used.

329
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,100
Direct measurements for the community setting this particular.

330
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,150
Hypothermia. So any questions thus far on lots of these approaches?

331
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:56,790
This was just, again, one hypothetical example. So now we're gonna go into a little bit more on the data.

332
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:04,409
So we're sitting collecting actual data now, but things we want to know in general are if we have access to data,

333
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:13,140
who collected the data, what data were collected, when was it collected, where, why and how?

334
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:18,690
So, you know, if you ever took a journalism class or something, I think that's what they tell you to ask.

335
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:22,410
We're asking the same things when we get our hands on some exposure data.

336
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:31,230
Who, what, when, where, why and how. So these can all.

337
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,190
Cause issues if they're not known or if there's something going on, we don't take it.

338
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:50,740
So one issue that we've touched on when we talked about sample size distribution is data distributions.

339
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:56,960
So a lot of natural phenomena do follow a bell shape calcium and normal distribution,

340
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:04,010
you know, and this comes into play for exposure monitoring as well.

341
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:10,940
So when we talk about, you know, an air sample pump, it's not exactly at a set flow rate at all times.

342
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:15,830
There's usually some random variation about a mean, a true mean that tends to be warm.

343
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,990
When we go to the lab, we measure how much chemical is on a collection media, like a filter or something that we've collected.

344
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:30,770
It's not always perfect. There's some random variation about a mean, and that tends to be normal as well.

345
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:37,970
But when we get into the actual exposure data itself, it tends to be like normal or skewed distribution.

346
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:46,190
And a few reasons for this one, you can't have a negative number for a concentration, right?

347
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,700
You can't be exposed to negative micrograms of work.

348
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:56,390
So you have this censoring right here and then this tail is caused by the things we've talked about.

349
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:02,719
You know, we're talking about frequency, magnitude, duration, and those are all multiplied by each other.

350
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,900
Once you start multiplying these factors through among many individuals or for a single person,

351
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:15,350
over time, you start to get some levels out here in the tails because of the multiplication effect.

352
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:23,319
So there's a few reasons why exposure data in many, I'd say most cases tend to fall.

353
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,590
There's a lot of normal distribution and that can be important for a number of reasons.

354
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:32,630
One is you need to know what the distribution is to provide the best summary of data.

355
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:44,390
So, you know, if you take a regular arithmetic mean of this, it's a good measure of the central tendency, right?

356
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,500
I mean, if you take in Harrisburg meaning of this one, it's going to be somewhere like here.

357
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:56,960
Is that a good representation of your central tendency? Not usually. So it's good to know what that data looks like.

358
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:05,690
And we'll talk more about that later as well. A lot of the statistical tests we do may have a normality assumption in some parametric.

359
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:11,810
So if your data are not normal and you're running parametric statistical tests, they're not going to be valid.

360
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,440
And then when we get to things like toxin that that and risk need to know what those distributions

361
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:24,620
of what to equate that and to set amount of risk per unit increase of of exposure for example.

362
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:32,330
So there's there's a number of reasons why you want to make sure you have the right distribution characterized.

363
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:38,750
Another really important consideration is something called the limit of detection.

364
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:46,640
Anybody familiar with this concept has done some exposure work or lab analytical work comes into play.

365
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:53,960
So for every method we have, there's going to be some extreme low level that we just can't measure.

366
00:41:54,830 --> 00:42:03,560
Everything has its limits, so that's where we call a limit of detection where non detects comes into play.

367
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:09,230
So these are things that are not accurately quantifiable by a given method,

368
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:15,110
but we know they're not going to be in a lot of cases, we're pretty sure they're not actually truly zero.

369
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:18,950
So that creates some issues when you go to making.

370
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:25,930
Doing statistical analysis and making inferences about the data.

371
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:31,600
So the deduction is the smallest amount with which an instrument and instrument measure.

372
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:37,390
There's also a method of detection which takes into account all of the steps along the way.

373
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:42,130
And that's for a lot of, you know, laboratory type measurements.

374
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:51,370
But we also have certain chemicals. We can have a direct reading instrument that will give you a, like, carbon monoxide.

375
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:55,840
But you can buy an instrument. They'll tell you exactly how much is in the air at that point.

376
00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:01,810
With Kobe, a lot of people are buying CO2 monitors to gauge how much airflow there is in a space.

377
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:07,390
That's an example of direct readings from those also have a limited detection,

378
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:15,890
sometimes called the threshold for which they're not going to give you a reading. But for a lot of the types of instruments we use, we can.

379
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,490
We can play around with some of the aspects of the sampling itself.

380
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:22,870
We can increase the duration.

381
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:28,600
We take a sample, the amount of volume we collect in our sample to try to make sure we do get detection, detected values.

382
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:36,370
Because there's nothing worse. You need to think about this before you go out and take measurements,

383
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:42,280
cause there's nothing worse than doing a ton of work to go out and collect a bunch of samples and you get your results back in there all.

384
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:45,340
You know, I detect it's like a huge waste of time.

385
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:52,000
I probably should have, you know, taken more steps to make sure we knew what we were doing in a more sensitive method.

386
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:57,460
Change our fieldwork protocols in a way that will make sure we have some sort of data to.

387
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:06,940
Tell us. So what do we expect more? Or we expect more non detects from blow measurements in an occupational or community setting?

388
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:17,440
Yep. Like we said, those tend to be lower, but it does become an issue in occupational settings as well because usually the lower the elbow do,

389
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:24,250
the more expensive MF that might be. So an occupation, if the levels are high enough, you might get away with a less expensive method.

390
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,740
But you want to make sure you couple the right method to the expected range of concentrations.

391
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:37,270
So some questions we ask ourselves. What time?

392
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:42,300
You know, it's usually best to do this before you start your your exposure assessment.

393
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:46,450
But knowing what is the limit of detection for a given method or instrument?

394
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,880
Then after you get your data, what proportion of data are below the limit of protection for this day?

395
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,510
What would we expect for it to be below?

396
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:04,290
What are the true values below the limit of detection? And then what can we do with those in our data analysis ability?

397
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,370
So here's two hypothetical moments of detection down here.

398
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,650
So we have one that's lower at two and another one in four, higher at four.

399
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,600
So it two, you're at least getting a sense of where that central tendency is, right?

400
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:23,430
You're getting more of that distribution so you won't be able to see anything here to the left.

401
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,670
So that one is a little more typical.

402
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:35,820
Hopefully, if you have some that might be, say, 20% or ten section of your samples for this one might be more like 60% below.

403
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:39,360
Elodie So just imagine you can't see anything to the left of that line.

404
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,860
You don't know what's going on, right? You don't know where that peak is.

405
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:47,249
You don't know what that distribution looks like. So that's a big difference.

406
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,140
So if you had to choose between these two methods,

407
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:57,180
you want to make sure you get the one that's going to accommodate more of your distribution if they're, you know, here or here.

408
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,430
And it doesn't really make a big difference. And that's that's another thing that cost my company.

409
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:14,080
So when we got to get our data back, say we have 20% of our values are below the remote detection in this example.

410
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,730
What do we do when we analyze the data to exclude it from the analysis?

411
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:26,740
If we just treat all the non detected zero, do we give them some arbitrary value like limited detection over two or over the square root of two?

412
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:33,760
Or do we just set as equal to the whole? I'll give you guys like a minute to talk among yourselves.

413
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:42,040
What do you think the the consequences of of choosing any of these four options would be for.

414
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:50,630
Your data analysis. What happens to your data if you exclude it?

415
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:54,530
Treated as zero just said all you're not to take, but it's a zero.

416
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:59,000
Some arbitrary value in between there or as equal to.

417
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,670
Ready. You all are confused. I'm picking that up.

418
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:11,830
What else can I tell you? All right, we'll just go through these one by one.

419
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:18,010
All right. What happens if we have this distribution and we just throw out all our attacks?

420
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:23,320
We want to report. I mean, that's what's going to happen to our creative bias.

421
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:31,710
That's right. In what way? Which direction? The higher the red, it's going to overestimate any sort of central tendency.

422
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:42,260
And. So you're for a meeting or meeting of that distribution of those samples to those that you're going to be inflating what it's telling you,

423
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:50,900
that could be good or bad. So the second one, what if we just set all the nine attacks at zero and then analyze the data?

424
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:59,080
Unless they are truly zero, which a lot of times we don't really believe they are.

425
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:06,420
You're going to underestimate all those parameters that you report out. What about Elodie?

426
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:16,400
Over a square root of two. That sounds random, right? So that's going to be setting arbitrarily everything equal to like this value right here.

427
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:26,500
Mr. Flick because we know that this will follow a roughly normal distribution besides that tail.

428
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:32,440
Is it reasonable to just kind of put it in that function and extend it?

429
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,300
That's a great question. Yeah.

430
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:46,540
So. So let's come back to that just a second. So this deal or screw two is going to, you know, serve all values equal to the same level here.

431
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:52,000
And that's actually an extremely common way people do it either over to or square to kind of try to

432
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:58,900
see where that the average of all the values under this level would be following this distribution.

433
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:05,530
So there's actually papers have been written on this and using simulation, depending on what this curve looks like.

434
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:11,300
Over to a four square. So it might give you a fairly accurate.

435
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:19,570
Central tendency estimate things like that. However, there are concerns with standard errors.

436
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:23,880
Once you go to doing some more sophisticated statistical analysis.

437
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,210
What about number four here? What if we could sit here?

438
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:38,310
What we said. All is equal. To what? That one. Do overs yet we're back to overestimating itself.

439
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,800
So that's not usually ideal either.

440
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:50,440
So of these, unless you have good reason to justify this one is the most common, but you have to be transparent about it.

441
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:56,770
Now the question of what about assigning value is so much more sophisticated and modern method

442
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:07,760
to do this is using imputation to assign different values of all of them that would follow this.

443
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:14,470
This is trapped, right? That will help give you more accurate standard errors in your analysis.

444
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:22,600
However, you know, if you using it for, you know, like epidemiological errors associated with an outcome, you just don't know.

445
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,930
You know, it's sort of arbitrary as well.

446
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:31,760
Like one might be assigned a greater value than another where you might not know if is truly just because of the other.

447
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:35,380
If they're both below that level of detection. So there's pros and cons of that method as well.

448
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:40,300
And it can be much more difficult to. It's less transparent and more.

449
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,850
Computationally intensive. So, again, you don't.

450
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:52,160
We'll come back to this later in the semester. Again, just kind of introduce you to some of the bigger concepts of.

451
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:59,130
Monitoring and data collection and analysis. And I think we talked about this.

452
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,490
Based on throughput measurements, this can make a difference.

453
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:11,549
So if it's a should compliance officer, for example, that might be you only have a certain amount of time.

454
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:12,480
They're there for a reason.

455
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:20,760
They might be looking for worst case sampling to do and thus might not be representative of the day to day of that operation.

456
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:28,950
On the other hand, if a company or a consultant on behalf of the company is doing the analysis, they might be seeking out best case.

457
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:35,350
They may be ignoring some of the jobs or or times where the exposure might be might be worse.

458
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:40,690
So, again, that may not be representative as well as a researcher, of course.

459
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:49,180
I have to say, ours are the best. But, you know, hopefully researchers doing this kind of work would take into account having the most representative,

460
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:54,600
the best methods available that are feasible for any given application.

461
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:04,250
Along the same lines. Why was the sampling performed if you if you come across a dataset for your particular.

462
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:14,580
Purpose. Again, if it's if it's there because of compliance, that might give you a different distribution and for other purposes.

463
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:25,950
Who and where was the sampling performed? Was it was it a truly a random sample of state workers or community members wasn't done systematically?

464
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:30,990
Or was it done on a selective basis for one reason or another, based on.

465
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,340
Who decided to participate.

466
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:42,610
When was it performed with the sampling so you could get tickets the same time of day every time or same day of the week to get some.

467
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:48,040
Non-representative in this way as well, that there are cyclical differences.

468
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:53,680
And then our sample size is also very important to be able to make statistical as

469
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,730
you tend to these have a certain amount of information to be able to do that.

470
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:01,980
So if you have one sample to go on, that's usually not ideal.

471
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:06,710
And there's statistical power considerations there.

472
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,040
So here's some things that can result in underestimation of monitored exposure.

473
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:23,180
Say, we want to, you know, there's litigation or epidemiology studies needs to define or estimate exposure levels 50 years ago.

474
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:33,200
Do you go up to the same job today and take some monitoring samples and just apply those to what was what happened 50 years ago?

475
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:41,240
A lot of processes have changed. A lot of. Circumstances have changed, luckily for the better in a lot of cases.

476
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:47,200
So you might be over us or underestimated previous levels by doing it.

477
00:53:49,400 --> 00:54:00,830
If, you know, if it's a compliance officer comes in, maybe things aren't represented because the employer comes out and does sampling.

478
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:03,840
Maybe the employees are behaving differently that.

479
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:15,790
We already covered that one. And as we talked about, we were discussing dose and those things, increased respirator inhalation rates,

480
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:21,520
increased conditions for skin absorption and things like that can can influence this as well.

481
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,340
Practices that can reduce results in older estimations.

482
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,990
So worst case sampling, again,

483
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:38,690
if it's a compliance officer using historic measurements to estimate current again because of those improvements in processes and.

484
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,100
Emissions self-selection by the employee.

485
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:50,480
So this gets into selection bias and then not noting things like PPE, which came up earlier.

486
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,760
Can also. So if you take a, you know, an air sample, we'll talk about what the personal sample looks like.

487
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:02,770
That person's wearing a respirator. It's going to get what's here, but not necessarily what they're breathing.

488
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:07,580
So that becomes an issue sometimes. Okay.

489
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:14,690
Switching gears slightly. So personal exposure from point sources can be very difficult if it's a one time thing.

490
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:20,360
So if you think about disaster, environmental disasters, huge amount of exposure,

491
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,740
but also a huge amount of variability, that's hard to capture that, especially after the fact.

492
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:27,139
So that could be that can be problematic,

493
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:33,830
even though those there's still some of these accidents that they're still learning from as far as health effects and risk.

494
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:40,280
But know that there's still a lot of error involved in trying to quantify exposure levels.

495
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:50,300
Things that are routine, more consistent over time are obviously more much easier to get a grasp of than trying to quantify.

496
00:55:55,630 --> 00:56:04,840
Things that might be fairly consistent but are going to differ, you know, throughout the day or day to day, month to month, year to year.

497
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:11,140
That can be tricky as well. So you might have a good grasp of what's possible,

498
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:21,850
but you have to combine it with human behavior and some other things like vehicle exhaust, pesticides, fish consumption, things like that.

499
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:33,129
And that's kind of like an our exercise with the community around the smelter, you know, you know, it's likely elevated exposure.

500
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:38,680
But for an individual, you have to take into account their how they interact with the space around them.

501
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:48,970
And those media. All right. Again, we're going to go much more in-depth on this in the upcoming months, but active sampling.

502
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:52,480
So this is where we are actively collecting a sample.

503
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,200
This is common for, let's say, more for air.

504
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:04,570
So you're pulling air through a pump and passing that air across some sort of sample.

505
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:09,970
Sample collection media that's usually a filter or some sort of sorbent material,

506
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:15,970
and then that can be either weighed or analyzed for a chemical to give you a mass.

507
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:25,680
So things we need to know is how much air is going through that sample and for how long to give us that denominator in there.

508
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:30,160
But again, we're going to come back to this is just a brief intro.

509
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:37,090
This is what a personal air sample might look like. There's a battery involved, a pump.

510
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:39,880
You have some tubing, and then you're your sample collection media.

511
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:49,030
A lot of times you are as close to the breathing zone as possible, but with limited detection issues, sometimes you need to collect a ton of air.

512
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:53,620
You talk about the ambient air quality there.

513
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:57,999
A lot of times, you know your sample there might be this big to be able to draw enough here.

514
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,280
So obviously you're not going to attach to a person or an area sample at that point.

515
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:13,310
There are direct reading instruments as well. This is very common in physical hazards for chemical hazards.

516
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:19,340
We'll talk about this later as well. But, you know, we mentioned carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, a range of other gases.

517
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,839
These are especially useful for detecting.

518
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:27,950
Very dangerous. Types of environments like.

519
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:33,310
Confined spaces and things like that, but they're going to be very specific to your character.

520
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:41,530
So it's not usually very. You can use it for a broad range of things a lot of times.

521
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,150
So they do exist for some things, but. But not for a lot of things.

522
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:48,969
And for this, you need to know, you know, it's going to spit out a number.

523
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:54,010
You have to know what's the averaging time, what's what's the calculation going on behind that number.

524
00:58:54,520 --> 00:59:00,910
And then, you know, how long it's been. So that's a direct reading.

525
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:09,700
There's also passive ways to monitor. This is where it's just using consent to create concentration, gradient diffusion to collect.

526
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:15,040
Well, a sample. So you guys, one of the groups mentioned patches.

527
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:21,070
You know, patches are used for dermal sample, but it could be potentially used for pure sampling as well.

528
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:26,080
This is also going to be highly dependent on specific chemicals in their properties.

529
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:33,740
But as we'll learn a couple of weeks. It is possible to do it this way.

530
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:40,460
And there's some pros and cons to this as well. And then back to buy one drink.

531
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,910
So we mentioned blood. That's a very common one. But there's a lot of other things to measure.

532
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:49,900
Blood and urine, the most common matrices to use there.

533
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:59,560
There there's some common ones alcohol, carbon monoxide, various chemicals of flame returns, etc.

534
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:03,430
And, you know, these are just some common ones.

535
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:11,410
We're always looking for new ways to measure things more accurately, depending on the purpose or whether you can get access to.

536
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:24,739
So. We'll come back to this as well. So one thing we need to clarify, though, is a biomarker is not obvious.

537
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:35,210
So we had our the first letter showed is that. Hierarchy of methods for biomarkers was the best, but you also need to know the circumstances.

538
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:43,970
There are scenarios where a biomarker may be misleading if you don't know how that is metabolized or what it represents time wise.

539
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,479
So this is an example of, you know, you have, say,

540
01:00:47,480 --> 01:01:00,680
a one time exposure here and then different fractions of blood or media give you a different sort of picture of what?

541
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:04,720
That means with regard to that experience.

542
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:14,560
So if you know that word and it's it's rapidly metabolized, it might get one picture of it and you're like, well, and then add up even further.

543
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:21,040
So you need to know, again, the tax code kinetics of the chemical to make use of a biomarker.

544
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:29,110
So that's just a warning that biomarkers are always the best in every scenario.

545
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:38,380
Oftentimes they are lot reliable. And then this is just again, we'll come back to this have some advantages and limitations.

546
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:44,380
Biomarkers, you know, in general, the all relative exposure measure of internal dose.

547
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:51,130
The downside is you don't know just what a biomarker where the source is coming from or what route.

548
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,670
And they also tend to be very expensive compared to some other methods.

549
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,230
So. Some of the main ones. I'm not going to read the slide.

550
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:06,510
Today. So another example.

551
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:11,880
So benzene is another toxic chemical that a lot of times we want to know how much somebody is exposed to.

552
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:17,550
And there's a lot of different methods to use. We have some that sampling.

553
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:20,800
There's both short term and long term hair samples.

554
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:24,840
You can do the one on the far left. There is a grab sample that you can take.

555
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:28,709
It represents right this second, what's in the air versus something like this.

556
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:30,450
You hook up to a pump over 8 hours.

557
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:40,080
This is a passive sampler that might be beneficial in the kind of scenario exhaled breath, urinary biomarker, blood biomarker.

558
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:44,190
So something like doesn't and you have a lot of options and for a given purpose

559
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:48,630
some might be better or make more sense or be more feasible than others,

560
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:53,450
depending on various factors. And we'll talk about some of those factors.

561
01:02:55,710 --> 01:03:04,530
All right. So that's it for today. I know the question you're wondering is how much of this lecture would be on the quiz right before?

562
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:10,630
I'd say more just general concepts not. Not detailed through the time.

563
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:15,070
I try not to have trivia in general on the exam because I mean, quiz.

564
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:22,870
You guys might. So for this lecture, specifically, interesting concepts.

565
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:34,060
Any questions? Again just trying to introduce the concept of monitoring, but due to.

566
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:41,340
Questions about the quiz you talk about during that time. All right, I'll change the parameters.

567
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:51,080
I'll send out a final reminder. And like I said, just try to be familiar with the notes to where things are and you're.

568
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:58,690
Well, I think you all do. All. Yeah, I think, you know.

569
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:03,740
So I guess the web service was pretty good.

570
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:05,990
Yeah, it was.
