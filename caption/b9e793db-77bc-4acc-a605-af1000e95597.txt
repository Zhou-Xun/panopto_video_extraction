1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:17,520
After. Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,250
So the house is kept. Thanks, John.

3
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:30,180
So we're going to do today is a very brief summary of stuff you already know because you all do the readings and listen to the podcast.

4
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:37,410
And then we're going to spend much of the day in a practical exercise that tends to mimic how agendas actually get set in politics.

5
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,200
And the exercise actually is a lot of fun and difficult in a good way.

6
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:50,370
So I'm going to go pretty quickly on the very short summary lecture and we'll try to get straight into it.

7
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,250
Content warning in case you didn't notice,

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,159
what today we're talking about is guns in specific the focusing events that get the attention of Americans on to gun violence,

9
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,930
which is not everyday stuff like the uniquely American crime category of murders committed by toddlers.

10
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,330
They get hold of a gun and accidentally kill somebody. It's a category of crime statistics that only America enjoys.

11
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,740
But it's specifically about with all these shootings.

12
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:20,450
I don't know if you remember that particular entry in the gasped the category of mass shootings in the United States.

13
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:26,900
But that was where a shooter came to school, basically locked himself into police, moved around outside for more than an hour.

14
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,310
Let's just say that with difficulty straightening out the police, a story about what actually happened.

15
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,980
There's been a lot of ghoulish stuff lately, but this was a particularly bad. What this means is that I get it.

16
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:46,280
If this is emotional context, we're going to be talking about doing what you like in the very to say professional registers of professional policy,

17
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,840
entrepreneurs, politicians, the media, media slogan, if it bleeds, it leads.

18
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:58,250
I didn't make that up. So if this hits emotional this way, step out for a moment or something.

19
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:05,690
Okay. What? Our objectives today apply to multiple streams framework in order to get better at political analysis in two sets.

20
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,820
One is to get better political analysis.

21
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:13,130
It's a great framework, and it's one of the few things that I have some confidence some of you will retain in ten years.

22
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,810
By the way, that's not a knock on us. There's plenty of studies where people are taking medication.

23
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:25,520
And it's also important because this is in many ways the dominant theory of politics that you'll find in the health sector.

24
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:34,319
I don't know why, but if you just go randomly and find out what the political theory is held by a powerful medic or a powerful official,

25
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,900
an HHS or a, you know, a senior doctor, something they're very likely to give you this theory.

26
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,719
So this is a thing that you're going to see reference to.

27
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:51,209
The same way that we talk about quality access, we talk about policy problems in politics, civil war, the reason gun control legislation.

28
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,200
The exercise is basically to see if all day turns out to be a window of opportunity.

29
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,540
Okay, here's the theory. Three strengths. Policy strengths.

30
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,629
This is where you find ideas, policy ideas now even baked into the curriculum of your major,

31
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,550
you will notice the assumption that you identify a problem. You do research to find out the problem.

32
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,950
You do more research to get a point, estimate of the magnitude of the problem. You evaluate ways to solve the problem.

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,600
And then right about now, late September of your senior year, you start learning about how to advocate for a solution to the problem.

34
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,580
Hands up. If you think political scientists think this resembles reality.

35
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,910
Very good. You're all doing great. That was actually the video. Not remotely reality.

36
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:45,510
Policy ideas exist not because there's a problem that they can solve. Policy ideas exist because somebody wishes to advocate for the policy.

37
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:51,709
Entrepreneurs, the people who do it in the same way that somebody has got an idea for a restaurant or some kind of widget or

38
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:57,980
an app will advocate for their widget or app or restaurant to be your choice of lunch of entertainment policy,

39
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:04,790
entrepreneurs will advocate for their idea to be something that you wish to adopt in response to practically anything.

40
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:12,570
In most health care settings. When I explain multiple string theory at this point, I say, Put your hands up.

41
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:19,210
If you've ever found any problem in the whole world of health care, you haven't been told will be solved by increased I.T. expenditure.

42
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:27,780
I saw him go at once as a guy who said we were on health care and the whole route, like stop the chop.

43
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,809
And then they turned and sort of chorused is one voice telehealth. Because of course rural health care we're told that if we buy really,

44
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,400
really good video conferencing equipment set, that we can have a consultation anywhere in the world.

45
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,350
Now ask yourself, do like to solve every problem? Manifestly don't.

46
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,440
Can I make some problems worse? Manifestly, yes.

47
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:54,390
Doesn't matter, because there's plenty of policy entrepreneurs who want us to spend more money in organizational resources on information technology.

48
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:04,010
Yeah. True believers in their age. Some policy ideas exist because as an entrepreneur corollary, if you want your idea to succeed,

49
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,700
get out there and work for it because merit is not going to decide the answer.

50
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,480
Politics. Politics is the key audience populated by politicians.

51
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,050
And politicians want to make a mark. Okay, that sounds trite. What does it mean?

52
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:24,899
Well, first of all, politicians want to get reelected. If they're not elected, they want to get elected.

53
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,120
And if they are elected, they probably want to get elected to something better, especially all the really senior politicians.

54
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:38,920
The governors, senators that. Given that you need to make it clear to them they're going to adopt things based on whether

55
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,950
that's going to give them a favorable impression in the eyes of somebody who matters.

56
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,940
But it will play well with the media, whether to play well in the primaries,

57
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,640
whether it counts their chances at legislative leadership, whether it will enhance their chances with the donors.

58
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:59,460
They are looking to make a mark. They want credit for something. And he also feels that you have to understand their strategic positioning.

59
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,360
There's plenty of ideas that we can dream up a theoretical way that you could sell them to a Republican or a Democrat,

60
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,210
but in reality, no way, because they have to sell it to their parties and their parties by.

61
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,840
And finally, the problem now made people who are vectors of the problems.

62
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,250
The media ignore the media. None of us would have any idea that there's something going on in Ukraine right now.

63
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,490
If it weren't for the media, we would have gone blissfully well into 2020 without realizing that something had happened in the past.

64
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:30,850
But there's also sheer happenstance. COVID 19 made itself manifest not entirely in media creation.

65
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,740
The invasion of Ukraine goes a planet, so it's probably media and it's probably just happenstance.

66
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,530
730 somethings crash out of the sky. We learn that there's a problem in aviation safety regulation.

67
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,370
Stock markets crash. And remember the problem with derivatives regulation.

68
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,500
They come together. A window of opportunity opens. Maybe we can get this on the agenda.

69
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,580
You're missing any one of the three strings. Nothing's going to happen. Policy and politics is not a problem.

70
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,710
It'll get shoved off the agenda, not a priority. Politics and problem about policy.

71
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:07,390
You got a lot of performative statements about how everybody cares deeply about the problem and move on.

72
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:13,150
That's right. They're sending thoughts and prayers because they have no idea what to actually do or to stop doing.

73
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:19,019
So let's look at the three things for us, which means that as a political actor,

74
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,210
you want to get the three scripts together, and if one script is missing, you want to about right.

75
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,050
If nobody thinks there's a problem that create attention to the problem, start badgering journalists.

76
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,550
When they come in, what's on the agenda? So here's a few things to remember this guy.

77
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,860
First of all, this theory is called ballistic.

78
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:45,530
Example recently well over to me, I published an article which is part of an inquest into the United Kingdom's handling of COVID 19.

79
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,940
It came out two days ago. I don't know if you noticed the news from Britain.

80
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,690
What are the odds you think anybody is discussing the use of scientific advice in British public policy right now?

81
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,220
Instead, I have to say, I'm willing to, you know, have the faith,

82
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,799
take away some of my policy influence in return for being alive in a glorious era in which we actually get

83
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,530
significant media coverage of how the Queens beekeeper broke the news to the queen to be a priestess.

84
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,749
He said that these folk. What I prefer as something of a policy entrepreneur.

85
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,680
There are suggestions for improving the quality of scientific advice and government has been taken.

86
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,370
Yes, I think that would actually be a better agenda item in the Queen's views. But am I going to get shoved off the agenda?

87
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,690
I think beekeeping seems like they deserve their moment in the sun.

88
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,340
Right? So it's probabilistic, can't always win.

89
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,070
And when it's a game of probabilities, what do you do? You persist. Second.

90
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,020
Agenda setting, which is what we're talking about, an alternative specification, namely, what are the things we could do?

91
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,150
They're not the same thing as legislation.

92
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,459
This is where all these senior health people screw it up because they operate on the assumption that if you can get the policy,

93
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:56,520
the politics of the problem, you get the law. That's why we have universal cap and trade climate legislation in the United States.

94
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,639
That's why we have a nationwide abortion ban. In both of them.

95
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,180
The policy, the problem, the politics came together, went on the agenda.

96
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,870
12 years. Every year you got an opportunity to pass cap and trade as climate change policies are not passed.

97
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:20,410
So everybody's got an opportunity in the Senate, the House, to go vote on a nationwide abortion ban in 15 weeks.

98
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:25,650
Also on the agenda doesn't mean it's going to pass. Agenda is not legislation.

99
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,960
Committees can decide to say no. Legislators can decide to say no.

100
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,459
As I said, this vision of politics is nothing like the conventional.

101
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,020
You are there to find a problem and seek a solution. You might individually do that, and that's good.

102
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,740
That's how science sometimes works when it's doing having a good day.

103
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,850
It's not how politics works because politics depends on energy.

104
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,240
And if this sounds a lot like life to you outside politics, you're entirely correct.

105
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,890
The Multiple Streams theory is based in organizational studies of decision making in larger organizations.

106
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,230
Who is at the meeting dictates which agendas get seriously considered, for example?

107
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:09,069
This is one reason that so many people in business spend all the time going to meetings that aren't going to work is because if something comes up,

108
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,590
they want to be an advocate for their agenda or kill it.

109
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,920
This is why, for example, work from home is necessarily limited because you want to be in the room when the agendas are being decided.

110
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,370
Do you get more work done that way? Probably not. You will. More power?

111
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,010
Probably. That's a pretty strange theory.

112
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,330
I hope that was just briefly recapping some of the salient points which you all already know.

113
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:39,260
But now I'm going to go to an exercise, begin the chaos. Maximum of 20 groups of 3 to 4.

114
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:45,080
This is the first test of your self-organizing abilities. So start with three and then see if anyone around you doesn't have a group.

115
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,570
And we're going to count off and confirm we have 20 groups. And if we have to reshuffle group 21 or something, we'll do that.

116
00:10:51,050 --> 00:11:24,970
So 2 minutes, groups of three. I know that you are responsible.

117
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:31,190
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

118
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:45,310
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

119
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,270
Okay, so this might make you feel like you're in kindergarten, but trust me, it's going to save us a lot.

120
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:57,490
Chaos. Well, can I count up groups when each group says their number?

121
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,370
All of you put your hands up because, you know,

122
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,620
highly sophisticated students at one of the great universities in the world are routinely

123
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,280
capable in this kind of environment of ending up with two good faces and every night.

124
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,670
So I'm going to start this network and say one, and they all put their hands up.

125
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,240
Then we'll continue onwards to the number 20. Okay.

126
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:36,580
So what? Haven't the.

127
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:53,710
11, 1843, 16, 1891.

128
00:12:53,810 --> 00:13:05,750
All right. And it's a very clear history. This is the mission of the London School of Economics.

129
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:09,620
Louis Armstrong went on strike, Michigan, to make it happen.

130
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,750
Okay. If you are not part of a group, you know what you need to do next.

131
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:21,310
Go sit next to somebody. The rest of you designate a port one as if I didn't see your hand go up like a problem.

132
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,720
Designate the reporter who. Who's going to speak for on your behalf.

133
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:33,010
Should just take a second. Now you remember your number.

134
00:13:34,090 --> 00:14:02,220
This is who you are. You know, this is the 93 long term, 1959, 97 seconds.

135
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,370
Thank you.

136
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:23,410
Oh, I got it. I got it.

137
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:43,720
Okay. Right. Okay. So you'll notice that.

138
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,639
You'll notice the asterisk that tells you something you can probably guess, which is what straight.

139
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:54,060
You basically work it, right? So the Houston Chronicle, part of your job is initially to report the of all the shootings,

140
00:14:54,070 --> 00:15:00,310
and part of your job is to articulate what kind of a problem it is, or maybe it's not a problem.

141
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:09,200
And you go on with the rest. John and I are going to hand out Post-its in the colors of each policy.

142
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:15,740
Okay. So right on the board. Now, what you're going to do and you have about 15, 20 minutes to do this.

143
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,920
If you're going to start with for us, try to get in session.

144
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,690
The end point is going to be a sound bite reflects her position.

145
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,160
Think of it this way. This is real life. It's the shooting.

146
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:36,729
So the information is coming out. You have an opportunity to get in there as policy entrepreneurs, as media, as politicians,

147
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:42,130
and do what you're there to do, which is effectively promote a policy idea, or at least to do damage control.

148
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:51,050
Promote your career and use your leadership. Well, also including that means saying what you want to say.

149
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,560
Yes, but to write a song about your reflexive position.

150
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,720
This is basically about forming alliances, right? So I'm sure you can all the strengths of the.

151
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:05,600
But what you need to do is actually say a position. So if your position is that therefore we should ban assault rifles, make that your position,

152
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:13,559
and just try to gussy up in a way that people are going to respond to. I cannot to being silent is also now in terms of mechanics,

153
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:21,330
what you're going to do is you're going to go to one of these white papers that are dotted around the room on the wall.

154
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:30,110
L.A. Sharpies are the same kind of suspense. The name of the organization and then a bit to formulating a sounds like after you do your

155
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:36,409
part it sits out strategize say okay so you can stay seated while you practice sitting.

156
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,580
I guess you can stay seated while you practice standing strategizing.

157
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,070
But then you should try to stand up when you say. Okay.

158
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:50,340
So we'll come around. You get to work on formulating this analysis for whoever actually you're representing,

159
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:56,110
and we will pass out your Post-its, which are going to be used later and your markers.

160
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:01,360
Please remember, those markers are communal to the entire department. So to keep them, it's just.

161
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:56,840
Second place. We appreciate that they have all these other topics.

162
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:28,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

163
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:45,740
At like you they said.

164
00:18:49,300 --> 00:19:26,370
Oh yeah, that's right.

165
00:19:27,030 --> 00:21:53,990
I think some people say oh yeah I talk have my brothers or sisters and I it.

166
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:55,930
Bernie Sanders is just like everybody else.

167
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:49,600
So it's just a matter of hours and.

168
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:32,260
Yes, that's right. I don't think so.

169
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:43,860
I think it's.

170
00:24:44,180 --> 00:25:13,470
And people want to somebody who would.

171
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:32,650
Well, you know I that.

172
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:45,010
Everything am.

173
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:44,750
This is obviously very high and all of it has to keep with everybody's life.

174
00:26:50,210 --> 00:27:42,780
But somehow this difference at home started when I was writing about this question of how to sit at home.

175
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:52,219
Just like you said, you ought to write your soundbite on sticky notes are going to bring your soundbite that Margaret brought around,

176
00:27:52,220 --> 00:28:01,450
that you're going to put your name of your person or your organization on those white, large sticky pads and then your soundbite on there.

177
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:14,670
It's all very inside and out.

178
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:48,870
I'm not ready to say this, but this is important.

179
00:28:49,590 --> 00:29:35,830
Oh, good. Migration begins. I because there are other types of you.

180
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:52,750
And today are.

181
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:37,840
I have no idea what they look like.

182
00:30:55,430 --> 00:31:00,330
I think. Oh.

183
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:30,370
You know, it's like.

184
00:31:36,080 --> 00:33:19,410
It's kind of like my grandmother's house or anything like that, because they understand how I feel about virtual reality.

185
00:33:20,850 --> 00:34:28,720
Yes. They are talking about 70,000 people out there because it was kind of like.

186
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:41,340
Yeah, like I said, I.

187
00:34:45,660 --> 00:35:06,810
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

188
00:35:12,320 --> 00:36:29,240
Oh, she's no better. Yeah, it's like that. So there is no reason at all that it starts on YouTube over the last year or so.

189
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:53,570
I know. I mean, like, work for that.

190
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:42,410
Mean, I think we have to be ready, but there's no doubt about it.

191
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:54,080
And that's all I can say.

192
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,190
I don't know.

193
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:08,660
You haven't finished writing your sound bite. You want to finish writing it next 90 seconds.

194
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:22,080
And now you're to have to make sure you have your post this year.

195
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:31,500
So hungry will help you out.

196
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:52,999
Those people. Yeah, I have it right there.

197
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:02,840
And I never saw anything like this with your name on it.

198
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:14,750
I'm. If they could break up with this, of course, and help us get a commission independent of each other to make the calls on their own.

199
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:19,470
Right? Yeah. Yeah.

200
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,430
Okay, everybody. Everybody wants to.

201
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:29,180
Careers as professionals in the field of turning a tragic event into what you want to have happen in American politics.

202
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,450
I hope it's been enjoyable so far.

203
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:37,460
Strategising and a nice distraction from the horror show that you're watching on the televisions as you do this work.

204
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:44,030
What we're going to do now is try to get the streets to couple. Okay? What this means is you each have a little packet Post-its.

205
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:46,490
You deploy those Post-its as a group. Okay.

206
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,420
CNN or people over the Houston Chronicle and housekeeping on any of us means that you have independent people or corporate actors.

207
00:39:53,660 --> 00:40:02,960
So go around in a group. When you see somebody who you think would be an ally, somebody who is saying something that is resonant, are useful.

208
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:07,190
You write the name of your organization and slap it on the poster.

209
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:17,150
So do you go around, view each of these offerings and you see six potential allies write your name, whoever or whoever you are on that corporate body.

210
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:24,020
And those are your potential allies in the speech to go talk to about 15 minutes.

211
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:50,780
All right. All right.

212
00:40:51,060 --> 00:41:02,510
All right. Let's see what you see in that one.

213
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:14,690
Oh. Yeah.

214
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:50,360
You know, I think that's wonderful.

215
00:41:51,800 --> 00:42:14,570
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

216
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,540
You know, I do.

217
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:53,630
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

218
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:20,510
I don't know, but I really felt like.

219
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:27,420
Yeah, yeah.

220
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:47,090
I guess you're right. You're right. You're right.

221
00:43:47,720 --> 00:44:45,810
I do know that there are people who are like, I don't know how, you know.

222
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:50,080
I mean, you know.

223
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:33,250
Where posted your color is also like, oh, I don't know you.

224
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:39,040
I think, oh, you don't have to be said.

225
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,700
Oh, I thought we only had six. Well, no, we get more.

226
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:49,150
Oh. So we thought we were limited. Our support and everyone in the group is very well.

227
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:52,930
We can start with. I thought there was somebody on the right.

228
00:45:52,930 --> 00:46:58,630
Yeah. And then they all said after they said if you run out of close friends, if you want to look back of date or whatever, you want them to love it.

229
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:11,470
Yeah, we did accidentally convey that they were limited to hundred people, so I.

230
00:47:18,260 --> 00:48:38,780
Every time I look around like everyone else I know this is not something that you see.

231
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:52,050
It's good, to be honest.

232
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:02,150
And I admit that I use.

233
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:12,750
You all right? Yeah.

234
00:49:13,880 --> 00:50:17,830
You know, I don't really love my husband yet, so let's just do whatever is necessary for us to be able to do right now.

235
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:34,300
I to have to sit in the area and chat about your hair color.

236
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:42,970
Order to explain what they think they've learned from this about your process, your sound, and also the friends he made along the way.

237
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:50,580
Yourself? I don't know.

238
00:50:53,250 --> 00:51:25,550
Well, I guess I'll take your holster, the reporter, and say what I think you've heard from us.

239
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:36,680
Okay, so these are the questions you want to quickly make, right?

240
00:51:52,100 --> 00:52:01,680
I like figuring out their own position.

241
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:23,560
I was glad they finally got it. It is a combination instead of being athletic, which is par for the course.

242
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:29,690
I know a lot of people want to be like, Who do you think that is?

243
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:36,470
And the other time, you know, I will be take it and I'll be LBJ.

244
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:50,600
So was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

245
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:57,350
Okay. So before you got to ask the questions behind me,

246
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:02,050
I'm going to run around the basically to be able to say something about how you think your day went and why,

247
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:05,959
like how you came to the position you were in and what you thought.

248
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:06,530
The numbers,

249
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:15,440
the number and coloration and type of stickers you got might have told you about your ability to shape the political agenda on an exciting day.

250
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:22,069
And I'll start with your energy and energy. Okay.

251
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:32,690
So here's the. We think overall, we probably have to say, because our goal is to what's happening and is happening all up.

252
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:36,470
And some goal is to just let everyone know what's happening.

253
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:44,120
So it was a little difficult for us, this exercise, because even though our rhetoric implies the perspectives, never say it.

254
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,710
So we had a sense of, yeah.

255
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:52,790
So our overall color, we have a little bit of everyone.

256
00:53:53,270 --> 00:54:04,370
So we think that probably occurred because we're trying to be this like objective, reliable source that people can use to be informed.

257
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:11,200
It looks to me like conservatives are right. These are all Democrats and that is the structural problem.

258
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:24,160
We were selling his stocks and he was so supportive of the people that were dedicated.

259
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:32,800
Well, the Second Amendment was open to the Second Amendment and the overall battle against.

260
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:40,830
Looking at the media. They were Everytown for Gun Safety.

261
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:44,420
A pretty good about what we had expected.

262
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,090
And we got a few senators and we were all with them.

263
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:58,140
So I sensed we had a little bit of difficulty with some of the representatives just because they weren't in the

264
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:05,330
U.S. That could imply that they want to take control or that they just wanted to see what they wanted in control.

265
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:11,480
But then they probably didn't even know. What I do is I think that a lot of it, you know.

266
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:18,049
Okay. Gavin Newsom wisely been involved in nothing.

267
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:23,390
Great. Gavin Newsom was ready to pass legislation in California.

268
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:31,720
And we got some I think it was a pretty good day. We got some support from every town, but our only media was t vo print.

269
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:39,050
And I think that's because we tailored our message for protecting young people, especially in schools.

270
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:46,250
And that was the connection. But we were teaching a segment of postings on other people's posters.

271
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:53,810
We didn't put it on senators just because of the fact that they're working on federal legislation that only states.

272
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:58,640
But a couple folks supported us at the state level and we brought that in there.

273
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:08,190
Yeah. And also this is this is called getting a good Democratic coalition to run for president in 2024 2028.

274
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:22,730
Heritage Foundation exclusively. How are the heritage generation contenders expecting and difficult into any media segments?

275
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:34,370
We've got some different institutions that can order overseas at the same time, a couple of days ahead of the conference.

276
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:37,550
And there's some sort of.

277
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:53,989
All right. So I think that everyone would have been fully vaccinated.

278
00:56:53,990 --> 00:57:11,350
And then in the Fox News Office where that's not the case, many Americans and women on the project.

279
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:19,660
So we'll see here a few conservative, very, very conservative organizations in a row.

280
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:26,770
And you notice the beginning is the conservative politicians and the conservative other organizations are lining up behind that.

281
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:32,670
So you see in this corner is polarization. Conservatives are going to back out of assets.

282
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:38,040
New York Times to. So yeah pretty much all we are nice.

283
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:44,640
And so before we had a lot of news outlets, we had a couple politicians who were all.

284
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:51,760
Well. What do you think of The New York Times?

285
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,570
Again, this is a serious problem, which is what it does. It gets as Democratic.

286
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:06,560
So we were really scared of it and we did end up having a bad day because have a lot of it was

287
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:13,700
threatening a lot of his policies and his viewpoints had come under criticism in the Army.

288
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:24,350
This seems to make sense considering that he wants to promote a discussion strategy to really focus on wars, not terrorism.

289
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:33,680
So I think it's I think you put your finger on it, right.

290
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:36,920
This is an absolute miserable day, obviously, for the governor of Texas.

291
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:40,190
But in general, you see here is the formal ranks,

292
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:46,030
but they're also not getting a great job matching with the public perception of what's going on with the colonel.

293
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:57,890
He didn't have any problems. So we are a large law enforcement organization that represents advocates for the interest of people in law enforcement.

294
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:02,680
And so I would say he had a bad day because of.

295
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:10,770
Many mass shootings. This one was very much focused on the failure of leadership.

296
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:18,700
And so they were very much thoughts and prayers approach, and that was mistakes made to learn from them.

297
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:27,110
But I think it really shows because we had no idea or problem sticking out, wanting to partner with us.

298
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:33,440
And that just goes to show how the failures of police leadership really play a role in this movie.

299
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:39,480
But we did get people in our conservative corners supporting the Fraternal Order.

300
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:44,970
And part of the problem is it didn't return of order police as a lot of Democratic politicians like us.

301
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:49,980
So finding yourself perhaps in the movement, conservative coalition might not be a long term place to be.

302
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:59,440
We're Debbie Stabenow. And as part of the politics screen, we try to talk a lot about these legislation that we would support.

303
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:04,030
And we had a decent day because we had a lot of different research groups to support us.

304
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:12,710
But none of the other policy makers applied because of our strict stance on the areas of background checks and the medical weapons.

305
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:17,830
So we really only had senator deaths as a coffee maker who supported us.

306
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:25,160
General, along with seven of those most effectively everything you do a mental health conversation.

307
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:31,850
So to the extent that she's doing that, she's successful a lot of time what we hear the people go off their.

308
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:38,430
He was his boss. And we had pretty good days.

309
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:44,740
We got a lot of we got a lot of media attention, which makes sense as as a nonprofit work.

310
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:55,780
And we have a lot of data and we are it's like the senator,

311
01:00:55,780 --> 01:01:06,340
if it's any better than the person that said that we gave you some advice so that we can take action and.

312
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:14,830
Listening to this, I feel like it's shaping up as a very partizan thing going on, right?

313
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:18,330
As a thoughts and prayers Republican coalition shaping up.

314
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:22,150
There's a lot of talk to the likes of Giffords center every time from the Democrats.

315
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:27,120
I think a lot seems about to start coming out the first week you go to the usual political smoke.

316
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:34,070
Yeah. Routine, though. We did not have the best day.

317
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:39,410
We got support from the New York Times Center. We never really political allies.

318
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,660
I think the reason for that might be that our primary demographic here.

319
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:49,970
So I don't feel like I'm kind of like, listen,

320
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:59,470
it's not that I didn't see some of this written by a representative that I see that this issue is really silly to be a human like platform,

321
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:01,070
like over immigration.

322
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:13,090
Like one of the demographics actually was definitely more or less weighted that they were journalists like New York Times or we see.

323
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:18,820
One of things about England that you feel like you've accidentally, correctly selected.

324
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,620
They discover that their leadership really, really wanted them.

325
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:29,430
They got very political. They deserved a lot of trouble since then because Joe Biden's administration

326
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:33,890
doesn't account for teenagers and quite simply don't know anything whatsoever.

327
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:39,150
Not this because it's one of the most valuable media properties in the country because they don't vote for politics.

328
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:45,150
Teenagers are really good at harassing their parents and supporting something that.

329
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:51,700
And so we were Fox News of the Day.

330
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:56,890
We were supported by a lot of politicians from across the U.S.

331
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:05,290
And it was a little bit difficult to come up with a lackluster response.

332
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:13,770
But also just the conversation was more of the values that we felt that we would want to discuss as an organization.

333
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:22,740
But it seemed that. We often also have a lot of support from like underserved communities.

334
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:29,780
One of the things you saw as graveyard of the highest level in terms of deflection,

335
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:38,840
you actually immediately tried to put a bunch of undocumented migrants on a bus like they're going to work to try to shift the conversation.

336
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,580
So we were going. You do so well.

337
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:49,150
All we got was the times as a supplier.

338
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:55,600
But that was surprising because The View doesn't really have a specific stance.

339
01:03:55,900 --> 01:04:04,660
Instead, what they do is use issues like this to debate each other just to greet each other.

340
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:13,600
So we also had trouble getting our food support around the room, so to speak, quickly around a specific status of the rumors.

341
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:22,390
You have some folks that are withholding, some that are very weak and they have no real consensus,

342
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:26,560
other or real message that they were trying to promote.

343
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:34,460
So. One of the most attractive media properties in the United States does not have any influence.

344
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:43,660
We are Senator John Cornyn. So we are we on a pretty good day.

345
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:50,140
We got the support from an array of states that is mostly upset.

346
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:59,050
We also have governor the governor of Texas for of the Senate Republican leader.

347
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:08,110
And we also supply them with support from Senator W, the Democrat opposition and the Heritage Foundation,

348
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:13,760
which is also one of the other senators on the block.

349
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:23,350
He was at least one of the major or the major gun law legislation in the Senate since 1994.

350
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:31,970
So I think he's having a good time. Sullivan Cato Institute in Geneva.

351
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:46,080
One of the leading public policy reasons we haven't done so well in this area on this issue is to attract more conservative supporters.

352
01:05:47,460 --> 01:06:00,800
But we didn't support a lot of people were offered when we were signed because we think that it was actually individuals and.

353
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:10,080
In a typical response to any call for regulation, I said, We're very tired,

354
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:16,890
so I'm going to race down to the Houston Chronicle and see if we have time to get more to the panel.

355
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:25,440
I am very pleased to have a yes, but in fact, what I said, I don't know,

356
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:35,340
but I suppose at the end but and also kind of like alienate Texas readers who generally support and not by the law.

357
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:46,860
So as I said, we also found that work is divided over more and a lot of people come down to about one.

358
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:54,700
And I'm going to ask Leader McConnell one question because I think the other.

359
01:06:54,700 --> 01:07:04,219
96. Well, we got a lot that is similar, but it is interesting to sort of continuously and honestly,

360
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:12,110
we're the ones that suffered injury control over us because we definitely did not support them.

361
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:17,030
So we're a little surprised by that as well as criminal justice.

362
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:25,650
We felt like they were not who we thought law enforcement did a good job and so we wrote most of them.

363
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:32,150
So I think I read a lot. So I think that's like most people look at us.

364
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:40,830
I also feel like a lot of Hollywood is like, you know, the country and we don't make any strong sense of, you know, obviously very conservative.

365
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:48,370
So like we used to be like the nineties, so we can get a lot of people to be with us.

366
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:55,660
So here's an issue. If you read this stuff, you actually pretty much predicted what actually happened.

367
01:07:55,690 --> 01:08:01,570
Right. So standard playbook on the explicitly pro-gun, which is that this isn't a problem, but this is a problem.

368
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:05,420
Isn't a problem. You don't require solution. Politicians. If you the.

369
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:14,730
And that's typically what you see from, for example, the NRA, because it is so manifestly a problem because the view got involved,

370
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:22,350
was interested, because CNN is running back on the process of producing static stories about police.

371
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:28,950
That policy didn't work. And you saw basically a lot of the most conservative policies both reinforce each other.

372
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:33,670
So it's left the field open in large part to two groups.

373
01:08:33,690 --> 01:08:36,890
One is Democrats. Obviously, this is what they do.

374
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:44,610
This could go on forever without producing results. But it also meant that there was a really good legal opportunity for common sense,

375
01:08:44,610 --> 01:08:51,390
sensible gun regulation that'll keep guns out of the hands of the worst people, which is overwhelmingly supported,

376
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:59,670
which people like Everytown immediately gave up 90% of what they wanted in order to get something, and that produces alliances of yellow post-its,

377
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:06,750
which you start to see people like Debbie Stabenow, Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn, who had a great day working with each other.

378
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:12,750
So what happened is what got on the agenda were some very basic mental health and gun regulation

379
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:18,150
provisions because the politicians said that's an idea we can collectively work with.

380
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:22,530
And the more pro-gun groups collectively failed to keep the problem off.

381
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:29,370
So once we agreed there was a problem, defining this gun problem is easier to say defining it as a police problem,

382
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:35,780
which it obviously was defined as it got more people like Everytown and Policy Ideas ready.

383
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:40,070
Also, on the other hand, the politicians were able to do something bipartisan instead of that.

384
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:47,639
So if you look at this, really almost kick it out. And you can also see why the media's interests aren't quite the same as everybody else's,

385
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:53,120
because I really broke down into this partizan kind of war, and that's exactly what they do.

386
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:57,680
Right? Because if you're the poor Houston Chronicle, what are your readers?

387
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:01,080
So guns, even the popular ones. So what are you supposed to say?

388
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:08,400
And The New York Times sounds like The New York Times, even if everybody thinks it's a Democratic help, etc., etc.

389
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:14,660
So the media's got a real problem. Which is one reason that there was sort of social media was absolutely fire black.

390
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:18,670
Okay. Thanks a lot. Return to Shami.

391
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:28,240
We'll deal with the papers in a tweet. I don't know.

392
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:44,350
Whatever. I mean, do.
