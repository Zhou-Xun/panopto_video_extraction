1
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:22,980
All that equipment or whatever you want if. Okay.

2
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:30,420
Now we'll talk about the WBC and the HIV co-infection and its associated with HIV.

3
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,890
Whether or not I said it for positivity. Lefsetz can't.

4
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:51,290
JP awareness is also called the Habitats Key because the two animal collectors came from a separate lives during the 1980s relative to the

5
00:00:51,290 --> 00:01:02,779
habitats that showed the five homology indicating the two names represented the then virus classifiable as a member or family of four.

6
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:11,960
Never and again as the genesis of Earth is low enough location to live up to and it doesn't have to assume.

7
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,290
However, JPC is a highly prevalent population.

8
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:25,799
What about you can see the prevalence in the different regions and the upper limit.

9
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,050
So for this reason is is more than 20%.

10
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,760
In fact, a recent infection has also been observed.

11
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:44,400
The HIV one infect patients of bats, conservation of A.C. and bird.

12
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,690
HIV is a scourge in the general population of Brazil.

13
00:01:49,320 --> 00:02:02,400
Several studies suggest a protective effect of GBC against the progression of HIV one compared to HIV infected patients.

14
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:13,860
The individual overcoming infection with the BBC and the HIV were experienced below the events like delayed progression to at.

15
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,230
So a protector was a cross sectional study group there.

16
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:34,920
The second negative, the 313 HIV infected persons are about a blood sample and the information regarding sex, age, ethnicity,

17
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,020
killing and the therapeutic aspect of which you are presence of a certain

18
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:47,900
characteristic of AIDS and the use of an antiretroviral treatment about a man took

19
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:54,680
a lot ages to react to real time of his methodology trimester HIV one plasma

20
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:02,730
by the second one nested so a PCR action can detect the GBC into the kind of.

21
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:11,160
So the last two words of loss and commentary is a measure to an episode of sound bites of Manka,

22
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:20,309
which kind of showed for lower risk recent about this take on a net the quantitative what variables,

23
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:28,780
what measures of central centers and the variation of under the quantity to worry about of

24
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,470
the certainty and the relative distribution and the world compared to using Chi Square test.

25
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:44,590
Afterwards, the texture of the G.P.S. They divided into two groups.

26
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:51,220
One was the HIV one and the second conservation group, which was 70%.

27
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:57,370
And the Nats well, was the HIV one only group, which was 83%.

28
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,660
There were only one sample between the two groups.

29
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:10,190
You can see some of the figure. Based on the P-value, the sex distribution,

30
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:17,540
age distribution and sadness distribution and the odds use were not significantly different but the

31
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:25,370
prevalence prevalence of and so that was the second kind of how oh mom thought those money infected it.

32
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,510
There was this cooling effect to the patients. Let's see 32 now.

33
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,450
And that makes one more comment.

34
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:41,720
In the co-infection group and the age distribution of co-infection, do you tend to include the chart below below the 18 years old?

35
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:54,590
In this. Fuga And the p value was school then the p value was lots and 0.05 about the future.

36
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:04,650
Good as you could be there just to simply compare the viral load and the 34 positive or less said they all can't be twins are true books.

37
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,400
You'll get a HIV viral load of a man in infection.

38
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:18,580
Who was the second infection. The housing the coefficient go up you feel good be the city for positivity laughs.

39
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,400
That's the whole concept of the the infection group was the second you fixed the load

40
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:33,110
and coefficient who you go see and if you look at the you what the arts figures say,

41
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:42,460
you can see that HIV one viral loads was significantly higher in the HIV only group in the coefficient group.

42
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:56,850
Better to use the art or not. Of course it presents a significant difference that HIV one viral load the b two are not at this HIV one only group,

43
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,710
but the coefficient of they tend to show a significant difference.

44
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:11,159
We're going to show that the significance in the city for putting T left set as the outcomes between art and and not out again.

45
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,280
So two books the use of arts so you can see the city for positivity.

46
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:28,190
Lefsetz was slow to load into HIV are only a group thrown into concentration group feel good and if you look at if you

47
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:37,709
go and you show the significance of HIV viral load bitcoin as are the no acts within the HIV one only group amongst us.

48
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:51,350
And as you can see, the HIV viral load was the had in the HIV only group in the face and the figure at shows the city for positivity.

49
00:06:51,360 --> 00:07:00,600
Lefsetz cell phones was low in the HIV only group a cohesive group amongst the central of at.

50
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:18,670
In the present study, the prevalence of HIV one and CBC Scotia is co-infection is was low but not different so far what has been found in other place.

51
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:32,410
There was no significant association between the presence of UBC infection and sex, ethnicity and age based on the low HIV.

52
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:43,630
A among infection is a indicates the possibility that a CO invasion was the WBC somehow influence HIV one.

53
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:51,130
They might like to vary a lot since our results also reinforced the theory that

54
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:58,430
co-infection is also a protective factor because of a half 34.3 when he left

55
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:09,490
the so-called Scienza co-infection in UK just and it was possible identified the

56
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:17,079
direct relationship between the presence of co-infection and the hale setting

57
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:25,030
for passing the peer cell count compared to those awful money factor to go for

58
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:31,660
your semantics which shows the possible beneficial effects for authoring WBC

59
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:39,099
answer no response reducing the HIV one replication and acting indirectly to

60
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:47,160
amplify the beneficial effects of arts treatment into account concentration.

61
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,979
Wolf The proportion of individuals over in the UK and to publish of individuals with signs

62
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:02,650
and symptoms of us was significantly lower than of observed among the infected individuals,

63
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,650
which was shown by the paper in the results.

64
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:16,120
You can see that before the association directly related to the HIV load and

65
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:23,320
the city for positivity left side cell counts of A or Marconi fixing persons.

66
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:33,059
About an invitation to my say the panel to measure the effect of ten and a dose of

67
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:41,460
a WBC battery cell was related to the dose and the timing of the WBC infection.

68
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:55,770
So it can be confirmed and based on the sample for infection, it didn't have the head because the age range was from 18 to 75 years old.

69
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:01,380
And that's the age range of HIV only group you can call the chad.

70
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:17,070
The amount of concentration, the presence of A.C. was associated with high proportion marks, which was very low and in situ for positivity.

71
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:29,040
That SAS Outcomes Center has 34 and 34 levels and is still also reinforced further with studies that suggest a

72
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:39,300
protective role for GP residual into HIV and the host interaction event you're seeing outside the city for Positivity,

73
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:52,230
Love said itself still held into how the money affected the patient, so it shows the possible indirectly beneficial effects of the art treatment.

74
00:10:52,950 --> 00:11:01,920
So this proportion of the center of cross between the between the two groups also contributed to a better understanding

75
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:14,610
of the relationship with with us between the two groups because it's directly related to the has 34 positive life sets.

76
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,910
The six outcomes are the lower HIV viral load.

77
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,930
And then the men, the infected patients.

78
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,850
Do you have any questions? Sorry about myself. So.

79
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:51,640
Are there any other factors that you're concerned might be different between the HIV 11 Group and the HIV Co-infected group?

80
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,150
I know you said your slide was a table one.

81
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,240
They were very comparable in the things that you measured.

82
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,890
But are there any. So the next slide.

83
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,490
Next from this table? Yes.

84
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:17,200
Is there anything in addition extra that should be a you know, that might be evaluated in future?

85
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,210
There's no right or wrong answer. I'm just curious about. Okay.

86
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:31,929
Uh, I think it's a power and the thoughts that those of the GDC can be a factor.

87
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,460
Because, uh, you don't know what, Pam.

88
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:48,010
What what's what kind of course costs HIV, and you don't know what kind of infected the, uh, can be infected subjectively.

89
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:56,720
I think that it's assumed to be the comfort, to influence the influence the association has.

90
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,180
And that's all that is. The cat is thoughts. Yeah.

91
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:10,059
Yeah. Yeah. I was wondering the same thing cause, you know, viral load changes over time, and so it's hard to know, but it'll be good.

92
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:14,350
Next step for your time. I think maybe.

93
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:23,950
Excellent. Thank you very much. Thank you. In. Right.

94
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:53,210
Thank you. All right, we do arboviruses first.

95
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:58,690
Should we do Ebola and rabies first? The is accepted.

96
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:14,050
Yeah. Why would they do that? I think this in terms of the class.

97
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,830
We've done it. How is it that?

98
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:33,410
He just says it's part of an unpublished. I bet there's okay.

99
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:39,100
I know about that. Believe it or not I've gotten a lot better.

100
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:47,660
Used to be aware of those things and I feel they're almost there.

101
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:55,660
And what is the emerging and emerging knowledge where I don't where I am on the river.

102
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,960
One third of the searches. Yep.

103
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,290
So. Okay.

104
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,510
You should be able to see it now. And you should be able to see the reading and stay.

105
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:25,350
All right. Well, let me go ahead and start with Arboviruses, then. And then why do people index it to download it?

106
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:36,440
Okay. Raise herbal viruses. So we're in a lot of what we are going to talk about, both with some definitely with the Arboviruses lecture,

107
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:41,070
but then death from some of the Ebola and rabies virus lecture.

108
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:46,140
We're giving the really the focus right now is talking about indirect transmission systems.

109
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:52,620
So indirect transmission systems are systems where you don't have one human directly infecting

110
00:16:52,740 --> 00:17:01,350
another human and you need some sort of intermediary in the system in order for this to work,

111
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,100
particularly when you have a vector transmission cycle.

112
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:13,200
You need that being what's called a maintenance cycle. So you need some sort of system where the viruses, virus transmission, replication,

113
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:20,490
continual infection of new hosts is happening outside of the human cycle in a way that it's continuing and maintaining.

114
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:30,899
Humans can be a major player in the cycle. Humans can be a minor player in the cycle when we have hosts that are outside of the maintenance cycle.

115
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,850
And I'll show you a few examples of what this looks like. This is when we call hosts, terminal hosts.

116
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:42,600
So these cycles, you have the maintenance cycle where you've got the kind of persistence and continued transmission of the virus,

117
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,770
and then you have basically emergence out of that cycle into a host.

118
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:51,630
But that host does not feed back into the cycle. That's when you have a terminal host.

119
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:58,590
So this is a host that does not maintain further viable transmission after after they're infected.

120
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:09,080
So for an example, let's look at yellow fever transmission as a as one of these cycles.

121
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:19,110
So you've got different maintenance cycles happening in different areas, different types of mosquitoes.

122
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:26,370
And here you've got non-human primates and mosquitoes that continue to continue the persistence of the virus.

123
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:33,030
So the virus is continuing to infect additional people. And then you've got a human out here.

124
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:40,739
Now, in this schematic here, humans are can be become part of the maintenance cycle because you can have

125
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,030
human to mosquito to human to mosquito transmission continue to happen here.

126
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:55,680
And you also have in yellow fever, you actually have this intermediate maintenance cycle as well where you have a combination of human

127
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:03,780
or non and or non-human primates that then have mosquito transmitted virus as well between that.

128
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,340
This will happen in areas where we talk about and I use this term a lot of the animal, that human interface.

129
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:17,040
So where you've got animals and humans kind of coexisting in a space where there is a previously animal based transport maintenance cycle,

130
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,430
then you're going to have humans kind of insert themselves into the human cycle here.

131
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:28,770
So this is what it looks like for dengue. You've got the silverback zoonotic cycle with an eighties mosquito and primates.

132
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:37,740
Somehow you've got the introduction to humans and then you can have continued maintenance between humans mediated by mosquitoes.

133
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:52,710
Now here is a example of an example of a maintenance cycle where we have terminal hosts or dead end hosts.

134
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,430
So this is Easter equine encephalitis. We hear about this a lot in the fall in Michigan.

135
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:06,610
And occasionally I think eastern Ukraine is like this. This is best actually that are kind of top line control for this.

136
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:14,260
When it starts to happen and we start to see human cases, you you'll have aerial spraying at the county level to start spraying for mosquitoes.

137
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:28,180
Very controversial. So you've got this internal virus maintenance cycle where you've got some birds and and a set of species,

138
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,620
mosquitoes, continuing eastern equine encephalitis.

139
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:44,559
Then you have this secondary outbreak cycle, this epizootics cycle where you've got now eighties mosquitoes and other kinds of waterfowl.

140
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,900
So pheasants and birds, cranes and other kinds of sort of larger migrating birds.

141
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:59,200
And then from there you can have dead end hosts where the eighties because eighties mosquitoes will also by humans

142
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,829
and they'll be horses you can have a mosquito get infected from one of these birds by the horse and by the mosquito.

143
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:15,580
But we don't see kind of it's it is we don't tend to see disease cycles maintained be on that meat sometimes what this means when you've

144
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:24,490
got this dead end host or this terminal host is because the whether or not they are showing symptoms or are showing pathogenic disease,

145
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:31,960
the host may not be generating a viral load that's large enough to contribute to furtherance of the maintenance cycle.

146
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,200
A lot of times that's what happens when you have a terminal health situation.

147
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,250
So a lot of the viruses we're going to talk about right now are Flappy Bird.

148
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:49,490
They look like the majority of like a bird of viruses or vector borne envelopes.

149
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,870
They are single stranded RNA viruses.

150
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,870
Positive sense with an icosahedron nucleocapsid.

151
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:04,400
And I love this picture on the bottom of the Saint Louis encephalitis virus.

152
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,060
So here's what the purified virus looks like in the middle.

153
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:13,670
Here's what some infected cells. And so here is what it looks like in the salivary gland of a mosquito.

154
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:24,559
So when we talk about like how does this small mosquito, how does a small student carrying enough virus to infect a horse or a large mammal?

155
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:31,580
It's because it's packing just unbelievable quantities of variance into that the salivary glands of the mosquito.

156
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:43,040
So when it's moving virus. And there are many, many viruses here that fall into this family.

157
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:52,820
You've heard of a number of these, I'm sure, throughout the years, a mix of mostly mosquito borne by some tick borne viruses in this as well.

158
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,870
And kind of a list of primates.

159
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,959
Now, when we our list of hosts here now when we think about where where we do surveillance,

160
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,820
how we do surveillance, where we do control, you have to be thinking about virus and vector, right?

161
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,520
You have to be looking to see what population does the vector actually bite and interact with.

162
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:19,970
Now, all types of mosquitoes bite all types of hooks. So what where is your where is your vector interacting with?

163
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:28,700
Where is your vector located in geographically and then doing surveillance for what types of viruses the vectors may be here.

164
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,879
And so a lot of times what you'll see is things like mosquito surveillance.

165
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:39,800
We're actually looking for types of mosquitoes in different areas or they're looking for are the mosquitoes themselves infected?

166
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:45,770
So we saw this with the Zika virus paper. We read at the very beginning that they were actually looking to see where mosquitoes were infected,

167
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:58,580
more so than looking for where humans were infected. And here's the global distribution of viruses still.

168
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:08,629
It is still kind of it's still quite geographically distinct in terms of what type of viruses you see and what places we are starting to see more,

169
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:19,430
for instance, more dengue in the United States, more kind of arboviruses that we would typically see in other places as climate changes.

170
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:23,270
We see that movement of the vectors, thus movement of viruses.

171
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:30,230
But we still do have some geographic patterning, more so than where we've seen of other types of viruses.

172
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,340
Mosquitoes are not long range travelers. It's a good thing to keep in mind.

173
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,740
Here is a predicted map of the distribution of AIDS aegypti.

174
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:48,910
So since it is a aegypti tends to be the kind of the most frequent vector for a lot of these viruses.

175
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,780
Watching what Aedes aegypti patterns,

176
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:58,870
what these patterns are and what they're doing as climate changing kind of changes is a really important aspect of surveillance.

177
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:10,459
So here we have estimated the current I think 2017 was the last estimate I could find in

178
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:18,740
terms of where the potential range is for eighties agenda and as it's creeping further north.

179
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:24,200
So these are mosquitoes that are ten tend to cluster towards the southern half of the United States.

180
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:30,169
But increasingly seeing them further north now is albopictus is interesting itself

181
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:36,379
I think just can actually can carry other can carry some of these viruses.

182
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,130
So for instance Zika virus we do see it is LFA just can carry Zika virus.

183
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:47,120
We have not seen very effective transmission systems with these mosquitoes, but in a lab we can see them transmit.

184
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,719
And so there's always sort of this watch and AIDS applicators as well,

185
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,930
although at the moment that's not kind of the main sort of mosquito of of interest.

186
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:09,320
So if we look historically at maps of eighties Egypt, I sort of know that use of judo is a problem for a very long time.

187
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:15,410
If you look at maps historically over time, the 1930s use the geographic distribution of the mosquitoes.

188
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:21,740
1970, very minimal distribution of escudos.

189
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,880
And then we look at 1998, and the pattern more or less matches what was seen in the 1930s.

190
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:32,240
What happened in the 1960s. To give us this place and by now.

191
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,280
There. I guess we're doing aerial spraying.

192
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,079
Yes. So aerial spraying began to get rid of the mosquitoes.

193
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,280
And then what happened to get from 1930?

194
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,580
1988? Yeah.

195
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,890
Yeah. I want to sing for you, but. Yes. So, so.

196
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:09,130
So the removal of DDT from aerial spraying from like mask campaign.

197
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:18,340
So there was actually a focus during this time. The goal was total elimination of AIDS aegypti and there were a number of people that actually felt

198
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:24,489
that it was possible to completely eliminate that as the major vector for vector borne diseases.

199
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:35,899
And a lot of this was centered around yellow fever at the time. Yeah, but there were a lot of off effects of off target effects of DDT as well.

200
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:41,570
And so it was removed kind of from the the removed from the toolbox.

201
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:48,620
And so now we have to do that. All that progress was reversed and it basically re spread around.

202
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:53,840
So it's very fascinating historical historical context.

203
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:01,219
During when the Zika virus really started to pick up, when it was really of international concern, actually,

204
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:10,760
that the head of the thing was ahead of the W.H.O. at the time was saying like, see, we never should have stopped using DDT.

205
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:15,860
It wasn't a very popular comment. But there's all these trade offs, right?

206
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:21,620
So this is current the current dengue map.

207
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,710
And you see areas that are dark, the darker blue colors kind of show areas where we have more frequent or continuous circulation.

208
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:40,580
But we do have, you know, no evidence of the United States with geolocation on cases, particularly, and in Texas or along the southern border.

209
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:48,870
So when we think about dengue as an arbovirus from a clinical perspective,

210
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:54,780
Décédé is one of the diseases where it's very important to think about clinical syndrome.

211
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:04,260
So we've talked a little bit about dengue from the perspective of immunology and how do we like antibodies and prevention of dengue.

212
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:10,230
But from a public health perspective, so there are four subtypes.

213
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:19,109
The clinical syndrome is listed up on the top, but there's this grading of how severe dengue is.

214
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:23,909
And as you progress through the levels and so when you are doing studies are on dengue,

215
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:31,030
it's very important to be paying attention to how infections are being identified and what level of severity are working at,

216
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,090
particularly when you have this situation where particular, you know,

217
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:39,960
previous antibody levels or profiles could increase the severity of the infection.

218
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,740
So learning to watch these gradations are important.

219
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:50,670
Part of the case definition is using what's called a positive turn to get tested.

220
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,730
So it is a measure of capillary fragility.

221
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:59,100
You do a blood pressure coffee, you take the blood pressure cuff stuff, and this is what some days arm looks like.

222
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,460
This is a sign that they may have an active dengue infection.

223
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:15,959
We've already talked about this. I'm going to skip through this because we've sort of already talked about this idea of infection

224
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:23,910
enhancing antibodies in in when you have the first vaccine administered to young seronegative children.

225
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:32,970
So there's a lot of work towards using serology to identify previously infected people who would then get a vaccine to prevent future infections.

226
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,690
Now, with the Zika virus also another arbovirus,

227
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:46,830
one of the big challenges when we're working with Zika virus is that we now know that about 80% of infections are asymptomatic.

228
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:53,500
The clinical syndrome looks like a lot of other arbovirus clinical syndromes write fever, rash, joint pain, conjunctivitis.

229
00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:02,250
It is typically self-limited. But the big concern when we talk about with Zika virus is congenital infection.

230
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,160
So Zika virus transmission, it is in it is AIDS transmission.

231
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:15,390
It's mostly it is gender with, you know, some speculation as to whether any of these other factors can transmit.

232
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:21,060
And we have observed, in addition to mosquito borne transmission,

233
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:27,210
observed sexual some cases of sexual transmission and a lot of cases of vertical transmission.

234
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:35,220
Now, the sexual transmission is super interesting because actually there was like a lone researcher that

235
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:41,070
was studying Zika virus and everybody told him that he was setting a virus nobody was interested in.

236
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:45,080
And he had been denied science for like ten years or something like that.

237
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:53,100
And while he was studying Zika virus in an area where it was endemic far before it became more internationally spread,

238
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,310
he actually got infected and transmitted it.

239
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:09,210
And so was sort of the first ever case reported of sexual transmission of Zika virus in 2008 so far before this this outbreak happened.

240
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:19,200
And so then the then Zika virus, then there's the big outbreak that happens in and in the southern hemisphere that followed.

241
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,550
After that, this guy was like, I've been waiting for you to get my data.

242
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:28,290
I have been studying all this. But all right, so the.

243
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:34,290
But what we are concerned about the most are concerned about vertical transmission.

244
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:40,370
And this is where you see occurrences of congenital Zika syndrome.

245
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:45,480
So this is microcephaly, decreased brain tissue damage to the back of the eye.

246
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:50,399
You see joints around it, range of motion. We don't always see evidence.

247
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,790
President present right at birth or in utero.

248
00:32:53,790 --> 00:33:01,889
Sometimes evidence is seen later. So I'm going to spend an hour very briefly introduce some of this to you,

249
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:06,980
but I'm going to walk you through again, kind of the story of linking the Zika virus.

250
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:14,790
So the idea of a arbovirus causing congenital disease was very unusual.

251
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:20,940
And so I'm going to walk you a bit through kind of what it took for that that link to really be made.

252
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:37,649
And one of the major things that happened was there was a woman who had had a medical termination of pregnancy at 32 weeks and was

253
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:46,260
able to there was able to be an autopsy to figure out whether there was a biologic piece of evidence for a link to microcephaly.

254
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:55,470
And here is actually brain tissue from the autopsy where you can actually see the virus kind of clustering.

255
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,400
So you actually see infection of the virus in the tissue.

256
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:11,590
Following on that, there was a case control study that was being done about the same time in Brazil where

257
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:16,210
they were finding cases of microcephaly and they were finding matched controls.

258
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:23,260
Here's a picture of a baby with microcephaly. That was part of this study.

259
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:27,190
Can you kind of see the brain formation that was happening in the cases?

260
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:38,559
And as so the case control study found in even in as small of studies that was had

261
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,620
a very clear association with the presence of Zika virus with microcephaly later.

262
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,900
Now because a lot of the early studies had been case control studies, however,

263
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:55,840
the the ability, you know, so the kind of the next question you ask is how common is this of,

264
00:34:55,870 --> 00:35:00,249
you know, women at different trimesters if they are infected with Zika virus,

265
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:09,250
what is the risk that that woman will go on to have microcephaly as a problem in the infant?

266
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:15,940
And the part of the problem was at the time, in the early years of the epidemic,

267
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:20,920
it was completely impossible to calculate what the risk of microcephaly was in these pregnancies.

268
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:29,320
And so what was happening is, you know, you have all of these people with Zika virus infection during pregnancy.

269
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:34,150
And remember that 80% of people are completely asymptomatic.

270
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:39,190
So the vast majority of this bubble has absolutely no symptoms whatsoever.

271
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:45,370
And then you've got, you know, some people in here are going to have a rash during pregnancy that's going to identify.

272
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:52,930
But then most of them you're going to be picking up is going to be having you're actually going

273
00:35:52,930 --> 00:36:00,190
to be having evidence like a head circumference level of concern or imaging abnormalities here.

274
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:07,570
But if you see that where surveillance was happening right here in recorded cases, you're actually not able to calculate a risk of anything.

275
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:13,750
And so it took actually many, many years before we could actually communicate what the risk was during a pregnancy.

276
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:25,700
The after after being able to do that for year after kind of improved surveillance for a while to be able to look at that,

277
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:31,860
it ended up being estimated that risk of congenital open seven days is about 5 to 10%.

278
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:40,010
If when infection or after if confirmed infection. And trimester matters.

279
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:48,050
So it is the risk is much highest with infection in the first trimester compared to infections in later trimesters.

280
00:36:52,900 --> 00:37:00,790
One thing that we have to remember when we think about Arboviruses and Zika virus in particular is because the

281
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:09,850
where in the United States we have a kind of a big range of the mosquitoes that tends to transmit these viruses.

282
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:16,509
It means that we have this incredibly disproportionate impact in the areas of the United States,

283
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:23,890
which get the less the least public health support from being able to do this and to be able to manage less.

284
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:33,100
So look at the numbers on the left. These are asymptomatic cases that were happening during the big Zika virus wave in 2016, 17, 18.

285
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:41,469
There were 35,000 cases in Puerto Rico in 2016, 35,000 in the entire United States.

286
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:53,950
That year there were 5000. So think about just the huge disparity in how much is happening in one area versus the other and the fact that 5 to 10% of

287
00:37:53,950 --> 00:38:01,270
pregnant people that are infected with Zika virus likely asymptomatically are going to go and have children and lifelong needs.

288
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:10,750
Right. So this is a huge I think it's a huge health disparity thing that we have to keep and we have to be mindful of with this situation,

289
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:19,900
but also in the future. Right. Even though, you know, by 2018, we were seeing much smaller numbers of infection happening.

290
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,230
You still have a critical mass of children that are going to need care.

291
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:38,330
All right. So, Jane, the West Nile virus. So West Nile virus is something that we see more commonly in our area, upper Midwest area,

292
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,540
that takes advantage of mosquitoes, that we have types of mosquitoes that we have more commonly appear.

293
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:50,870
Over 80% of cases are asymptomatic. State wide reporting tends to be for symptomatic cases.

294
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,880
There's a pretty long it can be a pretty long incubation period.

295
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:59,870
Most infections are not neuroinvasive.

296
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:05,120
So headache, fatigue, kind of the general viral syndrome.

297
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:10,430
But then few cases will progress to neuroinvasive form as well.

298
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:25,120
The transmission cycle is mostly Culex mosquito, two birds with incidental, incidental terminal hosts leading to horses or humans.

299
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:33,020
So you've sort of seen this pattern already out of the Michigan Daily articles come out about why are there so many dead birds on campus and the like?

300
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:41,030
I'm going to let Nancy. So I talked to one of the daily reporters and it's like, do we have avian flu on campuses like maybe we a West Nile virus,

301
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:48,890
avian flu, but definitely impacts birds in our area this year.

302
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:59,480
And then the other thing that we have in this area also in our is eastern Ukraine, cellulitis virus, as I mentioned.

303
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:07,460
Now, something important to remember about Eastern equine encephalitis virus is that you actually have the

304
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:12,740
maintenance of the primary transmission cycle with a different mosquito that doesn't like to bite.

305
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,620
Humans, of course, usually need what's called a bridge mosquito.

306
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:22,190
So you need one of these other mosquitoes, probably the culex mosquito that likes to bite humans,

307
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:27,530
to happen to bite one of these infected birds, even though it's not like their usual food.

308
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:32,760
Right. And so and so you need this what we call a bridge mosquito.

309
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:40,400
We need sort of this extra introduction in order for Eastern equine encephalitis to move to a human or a horse.

310
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,810
And here are the cases.

311
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,280
It's not very common when we actually see.

312
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:58,890
Clinical cases of it. But it does have one of the highest case fatality rates of all our viral infections.

313
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:04,020
And here you can see the accumulation of virus there and that in itself.

314
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:18,170
So 2022, this is what we have seen for other viruses in our area in terms of the number of seats and the left number of

315
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:27,320
mosquito pools that are tested and 54,000 mosquitoes have been tested and then a handful of West Nile virus cases.

316
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,229
There's also monitoring on the very bottom.

317
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,850
There are a human asymptomatic West Nile virus, positive blood donors.

318
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:41,959
So we do a lot of pool testing in the state of blood donations to sort of watch for West Nile

319
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:47,840
virus viremia to try to understand what areas of the state might be having circulation.

320
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:56,640
And then here's what it looks like geographically.

321
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:07,350
If you look at the different kind of case distribution around for 2022, an interesting factoid I have noticed throughout this diaspora is,

322
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:15,660
you know, before every lecture I go back and I look at my kind of current situation slides in terms of the surveillance numbers.

323
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:21,030
And there are a lot of viruses where the last piece of surveillance on the Web is 2018.

324
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,670
Like, there are a lot of viruses that are like on hold.

325
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:31,170
It's just like interesting to see when things get rebooted because I'm sure the viruses didn't take a break.

326
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:41,609
Just the tracking. All right. So Rift Valley fever, readability is actually when you're verity and it is transmitted by can be transmit.

327
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:47,640
It is ambiguous and you spend a lot of time thinking about Rift Valley fever in the paper that you read from class.

328
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:55,400
This is largely an agricultural virus. And we see, you know, you can have mosquito transmission.

329
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:05,430
We actually see a lot of transmission when people process livestock and major the major impacts of the fever.

330
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:13,020
There are some human infection issues, but actually why this is an area of really high international concern is economic.

331
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:20,220
It can completely devastate both of the allies lives like a flock of livestock that are needed by community,

332
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:23,010
but also because the infection is the board of the animals.

333
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:33,239
You actually your animal husbandry will shut down in a community if you're having a lot of Rift Valley fever is often asymptomatic in humans,

334
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:38,550
but you can rarely have hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, you know, some hepatitis occur.

335
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:52,400
Here is an example of the major outbreak in 2016, where there were 348 cases of Rift Valley fever and they did not track.

336
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:57,200
So they had a, you know, a pretty high number of deaths at the time.

337
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:05,210
It is likely they were under capturing the human cases, but then capturing more deaths.

338
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:13,160
They were not getting animal morbidity data. But what actually happened was there was a combination.

339
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,710
So there was a big drought pattern that happened.

340
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:24,080
And because of this extended drought, there were changes in where people were traveling in order to move their livestock.

341
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:34,819
And so the trade routes changed and also the livestock movement patterns changed in a way that really sort of mixed up the animal human interface

342
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:45,050
and created these new connections between the livestock and the the maintenance cycle in a way that really caused really accelerated the outbreak.

343
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:55,129
So sort of another way to think about the way that climate changes the animal human interface in ways that can spur infections.

344
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,440
It's not just what's happening to the vector,

345
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:05,750
but it's also like how humans and animals and livestock suffer moving through environmental space because of what what is available.

346
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:15,820
All right. Any questions about Arboviruses? Right.

347
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:23,700
I'm going to switch to Ebola and rabies. Everybody needs a quick stretch break.

348
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:34,350
Go for it. Was.

349
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:48,700
Her rate. All right.

350
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:54,520
Let's move on to Ebola. So reminder for Ebola reading for Wednesday.

351
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:57,650
We're going to spend more time on Wednesday talking about Ebola as well.

352
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:05,900
Ooh. And I'll bring my pictures of the Ebola containment unit at Emory from day trip a couple of weeks ago as well.

353
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,900
Everybody was just sort of walking through and I was like, Stop, I need to take pictures.

354
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:19,370
Okay, this is very important to me. So Ebola is a filovirus.

355
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:24,020
It has threads like morphology, long, skinny, very.

356
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,070
And we see that.

357
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:36,920
And not only does it have threads like morphology in its initial virions, but it can form these long branching structures that you can see.

358
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:44,550
And so here is some infected cells. And you see these long red strings that are coming out.

359
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:50,120
These are basically like contiguous virions of Ebola, of the Ebola,

360
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:54,190
these filamentous virions that are all kind of strung along together in these long string.

361
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:12,180
The single strand RNA virus. It is enveloped and there are five species generally of Ebola like viruses, the Ebola.

362
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:16,770
Reston. I'm going to talk a little bit more Ebola. Reston. Does not cause disease in humans.

363
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:25,590
I have a little bit more about where it came from. It's kind of just good to know from a historical perspective, the clinical syndrome with Ebola.

364
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:33,959
It is often the abrupt onset of fever, myalgia and headache, nausea, vomiting,

365
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,190
a Donald Payne diarrhea, chest pain, pharyngitis, general viral syndrome.

366
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:45,569
Another thing you can add to your list next time you have like a cough and a sore throat and maybe Ebola leading,

367
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:49,950
then possibly to delirium and coma, then wasting and bleeding.

368
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:57,280
And what bleeding looks like with Ebola as that you have like these particular

369
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:02,880
you have this sort of these disrupted capillary capillaries at your membranes.

370
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,860
And so you have this like fine hemorrhaging that happens at your mucous membranes.

371
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:13,350
So eyes, nose and throat back in leading by week two of you progress.

372
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:24,690
You can lead to a point of having multiorgan dysfunction. So with ebola despite it's not been updated.

373
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:37,000
Okay. Well, so with Ebola, mortality can be very, very high.

374
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:44,379
So you can have Ebola. Zaire was originally in the first few outbreaks reported to have 90% mortality.

375
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:52,390
Now we tend to see somewhere in the range of 25 to 60% mortality when we see additional outbreaks.

376
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:57,580
Now, any time I give you a mortality to know that's not how that is, that's that high.

377
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,280
As good epidemiologist, your brain should immediately say, are you under sampling mild cases?

378
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:09,810
And the answer is probably yes. However, this is still an incredibly high mortality rate.

379
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:20,420
Now, Ebola. Reston. Why did I sign up for it?

380
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:26,510
Well, people arrested. Does.

381
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:33,320
I think I removed it and kept the letter. I walked up what I wanted to keep away, to remain for this life.

382
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:41,650
That's right. I can just tell you about people arrested. So you go arrested was brought to the United States as part of a monkey that was transparent.

383
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:48,920
And it was in fact, there was an infected monkey that was transported here for Virologic research.

384
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,469
And that monkey had Ebola rest at rest.

385
00:49:54,470 --> 00:50:00,830
So it's named after Reston, Virginia. This is from when we used to more frequently name viruses after places.

386
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:11,750
So this was there was a high containment research facility in Reston, Virginia, where the monkey was was found to have Ebola, but didn't.

387
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,920
But there was it was it was a fully contained situation.

388
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:19,700
There were some lab worker infections, but there was not a there was no mortality.

389
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,280
There wasn't. And it didn't lead to this further outbreak.

390
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:33,410
But it was the sort of the US is one of the places kind of early scare from a bio containment perspective.

391
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:45,589
The it's the starting piece is story for hot zone and a lot of like literature this is really this is that is really where Ebola

392
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:53,120
became the virus that you make movies about where then you put like Dustin Hoffman in a big suit and send them to go find the monkey.

393
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:58,879
And they actually got rid of the facility that that happened.

394
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,130
They actually ended up just closing it and then destroying it and leveling it.

395
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:10,009
I you actually can see online where the address of where the facility was.

396
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:14,299
I was at a meeting in Reston, Virginia, a few years ago and went back by there to see it was there.

397
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:20,870
Now it's now a Kindercare daycare as well in Reston, Virginia.

398
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,700
Very happily moving on.

399
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:30,980
So treatment for Ebola is there are some monoclonal antibodies that are available, but it's mostly centered around supportive care.

400
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:41,600
So fluids, lots of fluids, mostly the multiorgan dysfunction will come around, loss of fluids, oxygen transfusion and then organ support.

401
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:49,900
For human transmission. We see.

402
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:56,730
So the you know, the animals in the Ebola cycle, you will read about some of these in the paper,

403
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:06,060
but there there are kind of animal and fruit bat components for the emergence of Ebola in the human population.

404
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:10,350
But then once it gets into a human population, you can get human to human transmission.

405
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:17,219
It is the the transmission percentage in the original outbreaks that were

406
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:23,510
characterized were in the neighborhood of 3 to 70 17% in a household in the outbreak.

407
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:31,680
Since that original one is you consistently see a signal of there is a high risk to those preparing cadavers and participating in burials.

408
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,730
Also a high risk to health care workers to acquiring Ebola.

409
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:43,560
So transmissions through direct contact with blood, bodily fluids or skin of patients alive or dead.

410
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:54,270
And it's, you know, because you've got this sort of direct, almost like contact or fomite type transmission pathway,

411
00:52:55,590 --> 00:53:02,940
you don't you're obviously not requiring the infected person to to release the virus into the environment in a big way.

412
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:10,530
And so, although some people do, you got vomiting and diarrhea, which is that is going to put more virus out of the environment.

413
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:20,160
But I think it's important to remember that people that have already died from Ebola can you can still get transmission.

414
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:29,700
So one thing that I enjoyed learning about Ebola when I first started learning about it was that, you know,

415
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:35,520
this sort of characteristic movie picture of like unexplained bleeding is actually incredibly uncommon.

416
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:41,729
It's 18% of people have any unexplained bleeding and it's only in very late disease.

417
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:49,879
And they likely had other symptoms beforehand. They should not put me in charge of infectious disease movies.

418
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:58,970
I'll make them so much more boring. So we sort of think about this risk at this risk at time of burial.

419
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:03,840
Look at these RNA copy levels and you can kind of get a sense of what's happening here.

420
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:13,309
So you've got once people that die from Ebola days, post onset of symptoms that people that went on to pass away,

421
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:20,080
you see a much higher lag RNA here and fatal cases versus non-fatal cases.

422
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,130
And these are very high viral loads up here.

423
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:29,150
And so you can see where you've got the people that have died, have had very lot of very, very high viral titers when they die.

424
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:37,550
So if we look at the ecology and transmission cycle, what that looks like,

425
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:49,670
you've got this maintenance cycle here that you've got that within the bats here and then the bats then have these kind of primates and animals,

426
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:55,730
antelopes, and you can also have that transmission to humans.

427
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,649
Spillover events here are going to be much, much less common.

428
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:06,680
The spillover events that we see with Arbovirus, when you've got a vector transmission with something like a mosquito,

429
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:12,170
that's going to kind of more is going to kind of travel without notice a little bit better.

430
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:20,210
But when you do have spillover events, then you can have human to human transmission happening during contact of bodily fluids.

431
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:25,040
High risk to health care workers and funeral practices.

432
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:34,040
So skin transmission work is less common than blood transmission.

433
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:40,610
It is still unknown if the transmission from the skin is if the skin tissue

434
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:45,050
itself is able to release virus or if it's just contamination from the body.

435
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:53,480
Pure fomite transmission in terms of taking like the clothes or the blankets of the cloth from a person that's infected.

436
00:55:54,230 --> 00:56:01,910
It has been documented in the past, but it has been documented, documented in systems where there's been a lot of contact and a lot of exposure.

437
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:08,459
And so it's been really hard to tease that apart to see whether unattached fomite transmission is possible.

438
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:13,490
We don't tend to see a lot of fomite transmission in viruses that have an envelope,

439
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:23,240
but is the biggest outbreak that's happened so far is the 2014 to 2016 outbreak in West Africa.

440
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,530
Two out of five individuals in the outbreak who got Ebola died.

441
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:30,290
It was likely an emergence from bats.

442
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:49,360
And that was sort of oh, and so then if you look here at the geographic distribution in this outbreak, there were 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths.

443
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:55,860
And then sort of this is started in Sierra Leone and just kind of spread out from there.

444
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:59,580
This is the paper that you're going to read, kind of talking about how this spread.

445
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:08,610
The dynamics of how the spread happened is the paper that you're going to read for Wednesday and you're going to see this curve here.

446
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:14,070
And pay attention. I'm going to skip this slide because I want you to pay attention to.

447
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:20,340
You've got kind of this accumulation of different chiefdoms or smaller areas in Sierra Leone that are affected over time.

448
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:24,810
And all of these letters are the different points in time or different interventions or tribe.

449
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:28,140
So pay attention to that while you're reading the paper.

450
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:40,379
When the outbreak reached Guinea mid outbreak, there was there started to be vaccine products that were available.

451
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:43,670
And so this is where we started to see ring vaccination happening.

452
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,190
So ring vaccination, when we talk about packs, viruses,

453
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:53,819
we'll talk about this more of a relaxation was a big deal in smallpox control and they used it for Ebola control as well,

454
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:58,320
where they started vaccinating around the infected person.

455
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:06,480
So vaccinating the context, vaccinating the community or the health care workers, but doing it from a very kind of contact tracing perspective.

456
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:11,130
So you contact trace and then you vaccinate those people that you're identifying through contact tracing.

457
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:21,030
So the vaccine being used for this was a it was a vectored vaccines of the vaccine.

458
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,930
So recombinant the vesicular stomatitis virus.

459
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:32,250
But it expressed the Ebola Zaire glycoprotein in a way that allowed for an immune response to that protein.

460
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:40,070
It was an incredibly successful effort.

461
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:55,960
So there were no cases in the vaccinated individuals that were randomized for immediate vaccination and then the the cases issue.

462
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:59,959
So what they did with this trial for ring vaccination, they did it in a randomized way.

463
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,630
So you that had immediate vaccination or you had delayed vaccination.

464
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:06,500
Everybody at the end of the day got vaccinated, but not everybody got vaccinated right away.

465
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,240
And here's the immediate vaccination in the data line.

466
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:15,140
It's like a flat line after the phase in period from the effort.

467
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:24,950
But the delayed vaccinated people continued to get infected over time, and then you start to see some vaccinations of there.

468
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:30,500
And so this did not go on for very long like this.

469
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:37,730
This ring vaccination randomized strategy very quickly flipped to just vaccinating everybody once these initial results came out.

470
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:42,729
So it was very it was an interest at the time.

471
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:46,100
I mean, I guess sort of interesting in retrospect, too, but at the time,

472
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:53,020
this was a very kind of novel effort to approve a vaccine in the midst of an ongoing outbreak.

473
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:58,090
So to both to test it during an outbreak and to see how it worked using contacts.

474
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:06,530
So in 2018, starting to see outbreaks in the DRC and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,

475
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:14,600
the initial risk factors in the first couple of hundreds of people were things that had been seen earlier.

476
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,590
So similar, similar things known kind of with the kids attending a funeral,

477
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:26,090
visiting or admission to a health care facility to start to see infections go around.

478
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:33,620
It is just recently been said that it's as this outbreak has ended.

479
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:37,790
It has been going this whole time since 2018.

480
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:42,679
So you see here the case curve really comes down at 2020.

481
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,889
There have been sporadic cases throughout time.

482
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:53,150
There's probably some silent or or very kind of isolated transmission, things that continued beyond 2020 to now.

483
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:58,880
It's now suspected that it is hopefully control over the outbreak in the DRC.

484
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:07,490
But one of the big problems is, you know, in the previous outbreaks, it showed you in people and I towards this when you read the paper for Wednesday,

485
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:14,790
is there is this rural versus urban dichotomy when you're thinking about spread of Ebola.

486
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:22,010
So we tend to see Ebola outbreaks begin in rural areas where there is not the density of people.

487
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:29,810
Now, the DRC is really where you started to see outbreaks move to very urban areas,

488
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:37,160
but also very urban areas that had very contentious kind of political situations,

489
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:41,959
and particularly situations where you could not get health care workers and you

490
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:47,210
couldn't get U.N. personnel in to try to mediate what was going on with the outbreak.

491
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:55,580
And so it was a huge concern, took a long time to get things under control because of kind of the conflict landscape.

492
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:07,080
So as you know, in the last six months or so, people have been saying that the DRC outbreak is is does seem to be pretty much over.

493
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:14,700
Now, there are emerging Ebola concerns in Uganda. This is just this is a map from last week and the last week.

494
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:25,139
And you can start to see the beginning of patterns that we saw earlier where you're having an initial region identified as being Ebola.

495
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:30,960
And we're starting to see some spread to other regions. So everybody is watching that carefully.

496
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:41,840
All right. I want to go home.

497
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:52,120
Yeah. Let me start with rabies. Okay.

498
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:56,450
Any questions about Ebola? We have lots of time to talk about Ebola in West Africa.

499
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:00,720
So, rabies robbed of your day.

500
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:11,010
It's a ride. Share of negative sex, segmented but single stranded virus, RNA virus.

501
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:24,330
It is has these sort of kind of body shapes in the middle here and it has these coiled rival nuclear proteins that encapsulate

502
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:38,450
the the the acid are one of the characteristic ways to diagnose rabies early on was to look for these things from everybody's.

503
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:43,290
And these are inclusion bodies. We sort of seen some examples of the bodies earlier in the semester.

504
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:52,199
But when you've got these accumulations of these virions or unassembled virion components in for rabies, it looks very, very characteristic.

505
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:58,590
And histopathology that you have is a fusion product and you see it in the cytoplasm of specifically of nerve cells.

506
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:03,030
And there's actually toll like receptor three is kind of contained in inside of these.

507
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:08,400
These are named after this man with an incredible mustache and they've similarities over this picture.

508
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:17,520
I really like this message, Dr. Negri. And he actually, shortly after he discovered this, how to diagnose rabies, gastro pathology.

509
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:22,200
He died of TB at the age of 35. So like I said, you get that.

510
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:27,870
All right. So rabies spreads to humans through animal by.

511
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,140
This is the classic example of a terminal host.

512
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:38,940
So if you need to remind yourself, say the homework assignment, what a terminal host is, remember the example was rabies.

513
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:47,370
So you have a tree, a and a maintenance cycle that happens in both wild and domestic animals.

514
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:58,410
But because the virus transfers by bite, there are some I've talked a little bit about aerosol, but it's mostly transmitted through animal bites.

515
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,360
The animal is going to bite the human.

516
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:07,560
The human will get infected and the human is not going to go back and bite another animal that to continue the transmission cycle.

517
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:13,170
Right. Just behaviorally humans become the the terminal host of the cycle.

518
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:20,430
The infection rates depends on the amount of saliva delivered through the open wound virus.

519
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:27,480
Quantity is very important. If we think about how rabies transmits virus bites to the face of the head have a higher risk of transmission.

520
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:34,919
There is possible evidence of aerosolized transmission from bat caves around the United States.

521
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:44,340
There are some cases where it appears that people visiting bat caves have been exposed or infected with rabies.

522
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:51,180
The bat cave on the left, not the bat cave on the right. This is where the bat costume would have been really helpful.

523
01:05:54,140 --> 01:06:00,650
So something to remember about rabies is that remember viral load is important.

524
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:05,090
So when you have the bite happening so the virus is going to enter the spike

525
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:09,320
friendly but rabid dog in the corner is going to bite somebody in the leg here.

526
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:20,510
Then you have to have virus replication at this site of the of the bite in order for the rest of the pathology of rabies to begin.

527
01:06:20,990 --> 01:06:29,840
So it replicates in the muscle right here and then goes from the muscle to infecting the adjacent nerve and the peripheral nervous system.

528
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:33,770
It then moves by retrograde transport. I'll show you what that looks like in a second.

529
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:40,820
Up the nervous system towards the brain. You have additional replication steps that happen in the dorsal root ganglion.

530
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:51,719
And then once it gets to the brain and the brain gets infected, then the virus is going to travel to other tissues as I could be salivary glands.

531
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:55,460
So you have continued viral replication and dissemination from there.

532
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:59,240
So this is what retrograde transfer transport looks like.

533
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:09,080
So you've got your nerve and then your nervous going to have these vesicles that travel to transport neurotrope in fact, up to the brain.

534
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:16,880
They travel at a speed of approximately eight centimeters per day is how fast these vesicles travel on out.

535
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:26,540
So rabies is like the smart Zeus, or rabies figured out how to enter into those vesicles and use that to get to the brain.

536
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:32,269
So when I don't know if you've ever heard this, but when somebody gets back from rabies,

537
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:38,720
you can use this eight centimeters per day to measure the distance between the bite and the head,

538
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:47,630
to try to figure out how long you have between when viral replication reaches sort of this high point and you start to see brain infection.

539
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:51,020
It is a very rough it's a rough approximation.

540
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:58,700
But you do have this sort of this pretty slow progression of the nerve.

541
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:08,290
So there are all of these different animals.

542
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:20,470
So there's sort of this rating and high to low animal susceptibility with you've got very high being wolves and foxes and coyotes,

543
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:24,010
kangaroo rats, wolves and and low wing opossums.

544
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:33,729
And but however, there are so many dogs, even though dogs aren't the most susceptible animals to rabies,

545
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:40,060
there are so many dogs that most human infections with rabies happen from dogs.

546
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:47,500
I appreciate Montgomery County and Pennsylvania as this.

547
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:53,290
This is a rabies education campaign. Pets on the left, not cats on the right.

548
01:08:53,590 --> 01:09:00,550
You know, including I know somebody that started to raise skunks and they would have like the stinker surgically removed from the skunk, not pets.

549
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:05,980
Don't do that. No good idea, huh? Although my dog looks like this.

550
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:17,740
And rabies is the reason why we have such strict inspection and quarantine and vaccination rules for animals moving between countries.

551
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:25,480
So I like this picture. This is a negative ad trail race, a sled team getting infected before moving.

552
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:33,220
There is a fair amount of kind of anti-vaccine sentiment around babies vaccine for dogs.

553
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,200
And so, you know, it's on the Internet if you want to find it.

554
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:45,790
But this is this still remains a very kind of universal role for transporting animals.

555
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:49,830
All right. So when you get rabies, you personally. But when people get rabies, Mrs.

556
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:57,820
We tend to have these two very old terms that show the two different progressions of what rabies looks like.

557
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:06,640
Most rabies will look like what is now was called furious rabies, but it's in syphilitic rabies.

558
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:14,710
So most cases have once the once the brain is infected and then you've got other organs start to be infected.

559
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:21,340
You have hydrophobia is one of the major symptoms that happens.

560
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:24,730
And that's why with rabies, you hear of that foaming at the mouth.

561
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:34,420
It's because this sensitivity to liquid has been created in the mouth to the point where people cannot drink or they can't swallow their own saliva.

562
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:39,250
And so they they spasm and they split it back out of that sort of foaming at the mouth picture comes from.

563
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:49,760
How we've been today and then delirium, agitation and then coma paralytic rabies tends to progress more directly towards on.

564
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:55,870
So the stages of rabies infections look like such.

565
01:10:55,870 --> 01:11:07,320
You start with incubation period in early symptoms, move to either acute neurologic disease, parallel rabies and common recovers.

566
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:10,330
Recovery is incredibly rare.

567
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:14,590
If you have symptoms start to appear.

568
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:21,820
If you intervene here during the incubation period, there are interventions that are available here when you're still at the point

569
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:25,060
where it's replicating in the muscle tissue but has not yet moved to the nerve.

570
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:29,350
If you start to see symptoms, however, it's nearly always fatal.

571
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:36,400
There are fewer than ten people that have survived progressed from a progressed rabies infection.

572
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:41,650
So you have to intervene early.

573
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:52,200
All right. Here is the disease burden is quite high.

574
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:58,110
Actually, it's 55000 to 100000 international deaths annually due to rabies.

575
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:04,710
And about 10 million people are receiving post exposure prophylaxis annually worldwide.

576
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:14,129
And you see here where the burden is mostly mostly centered, though dark red is where endemic human rabies is in.

577
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:19,760
The late red is when that is where endemic dog rabies is.

578
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:29,520
And I'm going to end here and we'll pick up the prophylaxis on Wednesday just as a lesson of what not to do a few years ago.

579
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:35,130
So rabies, your health department is going to be watching all the time for people to have random rabies encounters.

580
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:39,000
A a Yudof undergraduate. This is my alma mater.

581
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:49,590
They found a bat flying behind Husky Stadium and took it home and where he lived in a frat house congregate setting

582
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:59,520
in and and showed his housemates that in that frat house his bat and they had to do prophylaxis on everybody.

583
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:06,000
It was a frat house because you talk about how you find a bat today at Halloween night.

584
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:11,790
Leave it where it is. Dude, I'm here with you no matter how cute it is or.

585
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:15,180
Mm. So with that. Have a good day.
