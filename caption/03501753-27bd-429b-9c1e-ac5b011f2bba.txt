00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Aging, Part five, health promotion, aging costs and prevention.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In previous segments of this lecture, we've discussed the major social programs that help to support the elderly,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. In this segment,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:32,000
we go a little deeper to describe the fiscal impact of health promotion on these programs and then finish up with a discussion of prevention.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The idea of health promotion is to get people to engage in healthy behaviors and to avoid unhealthy behaviors in order to improve health.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
In addition to the direct impact on health, it's also important to consider other possible consequences of successful health promotion,

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
such as the impact on the costs of social programs that support the elderly.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
As we've seen earlier in the course,

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
tobacco has been and continues to be the single biggest cause of preventable disease and death in the United States.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So it provides a good example for examining the impact of health promotion, specifically reduction in tobacco use on costs to society.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
For a variety of reasons. Smoking has declined substantially since the first surgeon general's report was issued in 1964.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In particular, it has fallen about 50 percent among those who are 65 and older.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Though there is still a long way to go in terms of eliminating smoking.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Nevertheless, the reduction in smoking has been one of the great public health success stories over the last 50 or 60 years.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The reduction in smoking has resulted in not only more people living longer i.e. greater life expectancy, but also more older people being healthier.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:04,000
In other words, compression of morbidity. So given the successes described on the previous slide,

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
what has been the impact of decreased smoking on Medicare costs since more people are living to reach the age of 65,

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
the age of eligibility for Medicare,

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
the number of Medicare beneficiaries has increased compared to what it would have been if smoking had not been reduced.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Obviously, with more beneficiaries, the overall cost to Medicare are greater than they would be otherwise.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Along with the increased longevity, longevity has come a compression of morbidity.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The elderly today tend to be healthier on average compared to what would have been the case if smoking had not been reduced.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Although on first blush, this would seem to reduce costs. In actuality, costs go up.

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The fastest growing segment of the U.S. population is those who are 85 and older, sometimes labeled the oldest old.

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This segment of the population generally has high morbidity and much greater medical costs.

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The overall net long term impact of smoking reduction has been to increase the overall costs of Medicare.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Recall that Medicaid provides medical health benefits to low income people, mostly under 65.

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
There's no question that reduced smoking, that with reduced smoking,

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
the overall health of the population has improved and medical costs per person are somewhat lower.

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
However, in addition to medical care, Medicaid also pays for nursing home care.

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Medicaid pays for about 50 percent of all nursing home care in the United States today.

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The reduction in smoking means that more people are living to the age of 65 and beyond.

33
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And a major consequence of this increase in longevity is that there are more older seniors who need nursing home care, which adds to the costs.

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The net impact of reduced smoking on Medicaid is not precisely known, but on balance, there's likely to be some reduction in costs.

35
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The impact of decreased smoking on the fiscal status of Social Security has been studied and documented.

36
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
As stated previously, with decreased smoking,

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
a greater proportion of people reach retirement age and become eligible to receive Social Security benefits.

38
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And once reaching retirement age, they live longer.

39
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Overall, the financial impact of reduced smoking is unambiguously clear.

40
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It costs more, a lot more. Back in nineteen eighty seven, it was estimated that due to a greater likelihood of premature mortality,

41
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
each smoking male subsidized or saved Social Security about twenty thousand dollars per person.

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And for females it was about ten thousand dollars per person. Alternatively,

43
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
one can say that for each nonsmoker it costs Social Security a corresponding amount

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
compared to someone who smoked to convert these numbers to current dollars.

45
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Multiply them by two point two nine. The results are shown in the table.

46
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So in considering all three of the major social Pergament programs, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security,

47
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
it is likely that the overall impact of the reduction in smoking has been to increase the aggregate costs of these three programs.

48
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It is likely that the same pattern is true for most other health promotion effect efforts for the elderly.

49
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
They may improve the duration and quality of life, which is a good thing, but they likely cost money.

50
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Nevertheless, this is considered to be a success, since the primary goals of public health are to prolong life and to improve the quality of life.

51
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Here is an example that illustrates some of the same ideas, but with a slight twist.

52
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Back in the 1990s, the government of the Czech Republic was considering a proposal to increase taxes on tobacco products.

53
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The purpose was to raise revenue and to reduce smoking.

54
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Not surprisingly, the Philip Morris Company, one of the biggest suppliers of tobacco products in the world,

55
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
was concerned that this would result in reduced sales and reduced profits for the company.

56
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So in an effort to convince the Czech government that it would be better financially for the government to not raise taxes on tobacco products,

57
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
the company commissioned a study by the Arthur D Little Company to assess the economic

58
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
impact of raising taxes versus not raising taxes on tobacco products in the Czech Republic.

59
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The study concluded that the estimated net financial gain to the Czech government by not raising taxes was five point eighty two billion Czech Corona,

60
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
or about one hundred and forty seven million U.S. dollars at the time.

61
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The savings to the Czech government were derived from reduced health care costs, savings on pensions and lower housing costs for the elderly.

62
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
All related to the L. The early mortality of smokers.

63
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:43,000
In other words, the Philip Morris Company commissioned a study that showed that use of its products as intended would kill

64
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:54,000
more people prematurely and that such early mortality was a good thing because it saved the government money.

65
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Not surprisingly, when the Philip Morris study became public, it caused an uproar.

66
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Our own professor and former dean, Professor Ken Warner, summed it up quite well.

67
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Quote, Is there any other company that would boast about making money for the public treasury by killing its customers?

68
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I can't think of one. Overall health promotion efforts over many years, such as smoking reduction,

69
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
have been successful in helping to reduce morbidity and mortality in general and among the elderly in particular.

70
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
However, it should also be kept in mind that one very important consequence of such efforts has been to increase the

71
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
overall KOTH cost of the major social programs that support the elderly now and going into the future.

72
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Our society faces a large and growing challenge of how to address the increasing costs of these programs.

73
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:06,000
In most cases, the prevention strategies for the elderly overlapped with those for younger people, exercise,

74
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,000
avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol control of blood pressure and cholesterol are all very important.

75
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Eating a proper diet and maintaining an eye, an optimal body mass index are also important, though.

76
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Getting enough calcium and vitamin D take on added significance among the elderly.

77
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Think of maintaining strong bones to prevent fractures from falls.

78
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
We usually think of vaccines in the pediatric context,

79
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and it is certainly true that the vaccination schedule for children is both important and complex.

80
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But there are a number of vaccines that are particularly important for the elderly,

81
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
such as those against pneumonia and the flu, since the elderly are more likely to have severe outcomes with these infections.

82
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,000
These are examples of primary prevention. There are a number of health screening or preventive Medicon MEDEF medical services that have been shown

83
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
to be effective at identifying some common cancers at an earlier stage when they are much more curable.

84
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Examples include mammography for breast cancer and call and Ask Capi for screening for colon cancer.

85
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
These are examples of secondary prevention.

86
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We learned in an earlier lecture that falls are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among their elderly.

87
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Some physical or environmental adjustments may help to prevent falls such as installation of handrails in homes and public buildings.

88
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Key goals of preventive practices among the elderly are to compress morbidity and to maintain better functionality as we age.

89
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
At the individual level, aging is inevitable. And as we have seen,

90
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:07,000
our society is aging or growing older on average through a combination of preventive strategies and health promotion and improve medical practice,

91
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
we have seen a large increase in life expectancy over the last century.

92
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Along with this extension of life, there's been evidence of compression of morbidity among the elderly,

93
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
resulting in increased functionality, increased functional years and increased productivity.

94
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
These are great successes, though there is still more to be done.

95
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:38,000
an important consequence of the increase in average life expectancy is growing costs related to the major social programs that support the elderly.

96
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The politics of dealing with the large and increasing costs of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security are daunting.

97
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,017
But these challenges cannot be ignored.
