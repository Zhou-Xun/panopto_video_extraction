1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:12,870
Don't forget. Okay. So today we're going to talk about tips for effective oral presentations.

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:21,360
I also want to talk about the elevator pitch and the lightning talk, and those are both coming up this semester.

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,610
The elevator pitch will be next week. We'll do it in class activity.

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,250
With that, I'll explain it a little bit today and then also before the activity next week.

5
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:41,250
So between today and next week, if you want to with the guidelines, there's a reading on the module for this week.

6
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,180
And also based on what I have in here, if you want to start thinking about your elevator pitch.

7
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:58,920
Again, it's only it only needs to be about a minute long just thinking about your describing your research and or your career interests.

8
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,580
That would be great. And then we can go through those in class next week as a group for the elevator pitch.

9
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,500
You won't have to get up in front of the whole class to do that. Will again break you up into small groups.

10
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,680
Kind of like the situation that you would be in if you were going to give this type of spiel to somebody.

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:27,240
And then at the end of class, they have some case studies and discussion questions related to contemporary topics around scientific communication,

12
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,800
which I think are things that we encounter all the time and are really important.

13
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:44,190
So with regard to effective presentations, Dr. Caruso and I have put together a short list of tips.

14
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,850
And the biggest and most important one, in my opinion, is that you should know that you're not alone.

15
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,219
If the thought of public speaking frightens you and you've probably heard this, and I don't know how true it is,

16
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:04,320
but that that some people have expressed a greater fear of public speaking than that

17
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,580
they're more fearful of public speaking than they are drowning or falling off of,

18
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:16,620
you know, falling off a ledge or crawling into a confined space or of spiders or creepy crawlies and that type of thing.

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,000
Whether that's true or not, public speaking does rank very highly among people's biggest fears.

20
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:33,930
So I think that it's a it's one of those things that practice and kind of the immersion therapy does work.

21
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,410
I don't know. Have any of you heard of Toastmasters?

22
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:52,250
Few are. You're nodding your head. This is a group that they as a that says they're they're international and they have locations.

23
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,890
Last time I checked, they had groups that met in Ann Arbor as well.

24
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,930
But it's a group that it's a group of people that get together and give

25
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:06,569
impromptu they do impromptu storytelling and presenting and that type of thing,

26
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:13,440
just to get people comfortable with public speaking in general and in a really informal setting.

27
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,589
So it says if public speaking is something that, you know,

28
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:22,590
you're going to be doing a lot as part of your career and you are just absolutely petrified of it.

29
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:32,910
That's something that I might consider checking out. So you're getting up to give a talk on your research in front of your department.

30
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,960
What part of that talk scares you the most?

31
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,850
Getting questions that you haven't thought up or that you're not really prepared to answer.

32
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:54,350
Yeah, 100%. That's probably that's my biggest fear is the unscripted part that you can plan ahead very well for.

33
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,620
Yeah. Any other ideas for getting what I planned to say?

34
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,750
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like that CEO or movie.

35
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:14,959
It was a film executive and just. Yeah, totally lost it right in front of this gigantic group of people and on this big stage.

36
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,570
And he just had to walk away. Definitely can be very nerve wracking.

37
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:28,100
Yeah, I think maybe the idea may think that other people in the room are more qualified than you.

38
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:37,910
Yeah. See? Imposter syndrome. Yeah. So, how many of you feel like you have imposter syndrome at at least some of the time.

39
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:43,070
Yeah. Just about everybody in this room to some extent, I will say that that never goes away.

40
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,329
Well, at least it never has for me. I felt that way as a graduate student.

41
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,310
I still don't feel that way as a faculty member.

42
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:57,080
And it's something that you sort of you have to beat it down every single day, you know, and just put yourself out there.

43
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:04,280
And the more you do it, the more the less that imposter syndrome sort of eats away at your confidence,

44
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:13,939
at least when you're when you're up talking to people, or maybe you're putting yourself out there trying to meet with somebody who is a, you know,

45
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,610
a renowned scientist in your field, and you have some research ideas and you'd like to maybe start a collaboration with them.

46
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:29,750
And you're terrified, those types of situations, if you are really focused on all of your insecurities,

47
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:35,530
it's really hard to be your best self to that, to that group that you're speaking to or that individual.

48
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,250
So it is something that you do have to really beat down every single day.

49
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:52,490
And it is common, extremely common. Even some of the most accomplished renowned people deal with it on a daily basis.

50
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,150
Any other? Comments. I always get nervous.

51
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,990
I become aware of saying like and then I can't stop saying yes.

52
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:09,640
Every other word is like, Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,200
The more you think about something, the more hyperaware you are of it, the more you find yourself doing it for sure.

54
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:23,180
And even when I'm giving a talk, I still catch myself saying or are like.

55
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:28,000
And it's. It does. Yeah.

56
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:36,980
You really. You have to shut that part of your mind off and just kind of focus on find something else in the room to focus on.

57
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,930
You know, if there's a person that, you know,

58
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:45,230
in the room that they've they have expressed that they will be supportive of you, you know, focus on them.

59
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:52,780
So there's always sort of different ways to get around some of these some of these sort of anxieties.

60
00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:00,200
The other kinds. Yeah. I often find myself speaking very fast.

61
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,309
When? Undecided and nervous. So I just totally turned around looking off.

62
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,030
And then I realized I forgot to say something was going to be pretty quickly.

63
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:16,650
Yeah. Yeah, I. I had to force myself to slow down.

64
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:27,059
I do that. And the other reason I would talk fast in addition to just being nervous and is that I want to just get it over

65
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,060
with as quickly as possible because all these eyes are boring into me and it's very uncomfortable and it's like,

66
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,330
okay, I talk as fast as I can that I can get out of here.

67
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:40,259
And, and then, you know, you talk so fast and nobody follows you.

68
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,270
So nobody asks you any questions and that's even better.

69
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:49,530
Yeah, because I mean, just the other, you know, so it is that is definitely a really common thing.

70
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:59,310
I think some of these tips, again, a lot of them were from Dr. Caruso and she taught the class.

71
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,480
And then there are some additional ones that I have thought of over the years.

72
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:10,710
I think some of these will help with with these. They've helped me address some of these anxieties, for sure.

73
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,360
And I've dealt with every single one of the things that you have all mentioned and then some.

74
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,819
So one of the most important things you can do when you are giving a talk is just thinking

75
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,670
about who your audience is and being able to organize your message into a compelling story,

76
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,400
but not a never ending story. You want to make sure that you are that you have a specific message that you want to convey.

77
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:44,010
Know what background you need to provide for people to understand that message and

78
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:51,120
then have a have a a statement or two at the end that sort of wrap things up,

79
00:08:51,120 --> 00:09:00,210
that give people the takeaway that you want them to to take away from your talk, avoiding excessive detail.

80
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:10,350
And again, these may seem like they're common sense in a lot of ways, but you'd be surprised if you even if you go to seminars,

81
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:19,200
you know, around campus, there are professors and I've mentioned before that I've gone to I went to the ACR,

82
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,719
for example, the American Association for Cancer Research,

83
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:30,299
and they had a scientist who is just one of the superstars of cancer research and said, Oh, he's so excited.

84
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:40,800
He's giving a talk. And he just got out there and he was just bored and he was just rambling and not his words were running together.

85
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,560
He was just not talking very loud and it was just not an enjoyable experience at all.

86
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,830
In the end, he went over the time. That's another big thing is I think a lot of people,

87
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:59,910
especially when they get to that point in their career and it's like they don't they get to be a little less respectful of other people's time.

88
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:09,960
And so, yeah, some of these things, again, they seem like common sense, but you'd be surprised at the number of people who break these.

89
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:16,230
I want to call them roles, but general tips for for an effective presentation,

90
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:24,360
keeping the audience engaged somehow in whatever way you're comfortable doing that.

91
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,010
Not everybody. You can use visuals, you can use humor.

92
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,850
Eye contact, body language, eye contact is something that people can universally can do and should do.

93
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,540
And there's some there's some elements of body language that I think everybody can,

94
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:49,050
you know, in whatever way they're comfortable, use to effectively engage the audience.

95
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,630
If you, you know, you want to avoid that.

96
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,730
When you get up in front of a group of people to talk,

97
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:02,640
you're most often want to make yourself as small as possible and hide behind the podium as much as you can.

98
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:09,510
You want to try and try and, you know, just avoid that as much as you can, you know, shake it out.

99
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:17,399
And if you have to practice in front of a I never found practicing in front of a mirror to be very comfortable and effective.

100
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:24,780
But even I mean, it's, it sounds ridiculous, but if I have to give a talk and it's a really intimidating situation,

101
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:29,130
for example, I've had to give talks for faculty job interviews and that type of thing.

102
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:40,080
I'll actually go in the bathroom stall and I'll just like, you know, spread out and like shake myself out and just make,

103
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,860
you know, kind of just make myself feel like, okay, I'm not I'm not going to get in there and shrink.

104
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,630
I'm just going to I'm going to look confident, even though I'm not confident at all.

105
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,969
And there is a TED talk that I will share with all of you.

106
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:01,770
I don't have it in today's slide deck, but it's on the.

107
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,770
What is it called? It's out. Her name's Amy. Amy Cuddy, c u d d y.

108
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,420
And it's like, fake it till you make it and try and remember the name of it.

109
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:18,299
It's a very famous TED talk. It's one of the most it was one of the most vivid TED talks.

110
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:26,970
But she talks about power poses and like how people like this concept of making yourself small versus making yourself big.

111
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,720
And you know how people, when they cross the finish line of a race,

112
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:38,250
they put their arms up and they're spread out in the this is sort of that that making yourself bigger or taller conveys power.

113
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:46,410
And, of course, that does and in nature as well. And some of that can apply to humans as well.

114
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,190
So yeah, I will. I'll share that. She has a book as well that I really enjoy.

115
00:12:51,490 --> 00:13:02,860
Oh, I believe I shared the book in a previous lecture, but I'll make sure to mention it again and also share that TEDx talk making your point.

116
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:11,050
It's really important to be very, very explicit and clear about what the point is you want to make with your audience.

117
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:19,510
Being dropping subtle hints is never going to be effective in a presentation.

118
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:33,160
Another thing that can really lose people, whether it's in a written document or especially in a presentation, is limiting is these acronyms.

119
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,870
So you really want to be careful about the number of acronyms you're using.

120
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:45,250
And if you are going to be using them in a presentation, you want to carry those through like on your slide,

121
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:51,280
like you'd miss an, W, T or whatever would if you were going to be using that repeatedly,

122
00:13:51,610 --> 00:14:00,189
you'd want to maybe have that at the bottom of your slide and define it, know so that somebody who is looking down at their phone on the first slide,

123
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,880
when you define that acronym and then they look up again and they're like, What?

124
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:13,050
What is this person talking about? So yeah, as much as you can limit them and make them as clear as possible when you do have to use them.

125
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:21,640
I have this is probably my biggest pet peeve is people not being mindful of time.

126
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,790
If you have ever had to go to a seminar and the person just will not stop talking,

127
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:36,369
at least like I have a problem sitting still for a long period of time and I do most of my work standing.

128
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:42,009
I have a stand up desk and so when I go to a seminar and I expect it to be 45 minutes,

129
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:45,999
especially when there's lunch afterwards and the person just won't stop talking.

130
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,580
I don't care how good the topic is, I just guarantee it since it drives me insane.

131
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,590
So I would say it's kind of like the price is right.

132
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,570
You want to be under under the time, and if you go over, you lose.

133
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:15,489
So if you're if your talks a little bit shorter than than what the expected time was, that's better than way better than going over and practicing.

134
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:27,130
I can't emphasize this enough. And when I first started giving presentations and this goes back to even high school in early undergraduate,

135
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:35,469
I would just feel like I could get up there and wing it and I would say, Oh, you know, I'll just I don't even want to practice it.

136
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:42,460
I'm so uncomfortable and I'm so nervous about it. I'm just going to get up there and do it and I'm not going to even think about it until then.

137
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:52,240
But if you can force yourself to walk through it, force yourself to talk about it, talk it through out loud.

138
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,120
You know, maybe you've you've put together your slides, you've written down somewhere what you wanted to say on each of your slides.

139
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,170
You practice your transitions. That is so effective.

140
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:08,830
And I will say even practicing with your cat like my cats, a lot of the time are your dog.

141
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:18,280
If you don't have any other people around in the house, I would just give my talk to to my cat or my dog just to get in that,

142
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,620
just to get the feeling of in the timing of walking through your slides.

143
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,290
I think that that's super helpful and it will be so much more you'll be so much more

144
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,010
comfortable when you get up and actually give the talk and it's so much less stressful.

145
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:41,560
But of course it is important to give a talk, maybe in your lab meeting if you or you have a research group,

146
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,250
a group of peers that you're comfortable with,

147
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:55,360
I would absolutely, strongly recommend just asking a few people to sit in a conference room and let me listen to you again, walk through your talk.

148
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:01,059
And it's better to stumble with friends in the room than it is to get up there and give it

149
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:05,440
for the first time in front of a bunch of intimidating people and stumble like crazy there.

150
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:17,050
And if you can explain it to your grandmother, you know, if you another place where you can practice is with family members.

151
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,650
And obviously, it depends on the audience that you're presenting to.

152
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:29,110
Again, you know, this is important to think about, whether it's a a community stakeholder meeting where you're you're in you're talking to

153
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:33,340
people from the general community or you're giving a symposium at a scientific conference.

154
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:42,060
You want to be thinking, be mindful of who your audience is. But if you can practice with family members and they can follow you, that's amazing.

155
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,500
And I still have family members whose eyes cloud over when I start to.

156
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,790
I mean, I don't have three words out of my mouth to. Talking about what I do like.

157
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:56,350
And I still get people who ask me when I'm going to be done with school.

158
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,930
Like, even when I was a post-doc, you know,

159
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:07,629
like people didn't notice that I finished graduate school and they sort of just saw that I kept on doing research and going to campus.

160
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,690
And so they would ask me when I was going to be done with school.

161
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,319
And I still kind of get these types of comments from family members.

162
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,840
So it just I'm just going to stay in school the rest of my life.

163
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,710
Don't focus on all the caveats and weaknesses.

164
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:33,850
This is something that being I'm very neurotic about details and I'm very nervous about misrepresenting something.

165
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:41,260
And when I get up and give a presentation, my biggest one of the biggest things that I struggle with is,

166
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:49,740
especially when I first started graduate school, was pointing out every single caveat and every weakness in my experiments, you know,

167
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:55,750
and I'd say, okay, we find that oxidative stress regulates this potassium channel.

168
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:02,140
And and then I would want to point out, but this is just in a mammalian cell line.

169
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,860
It's not really in a human heart cell, which is really where it's expressed.

170
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,780
And this assay, you know, this is a Samsung has all of these limitations.

171
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:20,259
And so we're not 100% sure if it's really this, but we think, you know, and you just start going down a rabbit hole of qualifiers and limitations.

172
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:30,790
And there are certain environments where if people kind of smell blood in the water, they're going to start picking at you.

173
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:41,080
And so you just really want to and I would say most probably 99% of the time when I given a presentation,

174
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,980
it's a very collegial environment, even if it's a group of really intimidating scientists.

175
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:53,139
There have been a couple of situations where the there have been people who were really like attacking people's research.

176
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,830
And it was kind of it was an especially terrifying environment.

177
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:04,060
But I would say in general, the more that you can just be confident about your message,

178
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,050
be confident about what you know, and be confident about what you don't know.

179
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:14,470
You don't have to oversell your work, but you certainly want to again, just be confident, like this is the data.

180
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:20,890
And if people have questions and you know, most of the people who are really savvy are going to know,

181
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:27,190
oh, yeah, this is in human embryonic kidney cells and not in heart cells.

182
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,209
And this this is in a this is in a mouse cell line or this is in a mouse.

183
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,840
And mice aren't humans. And people are going to know these things already.

184
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,490
And if they have a concern, they're going to bring it up. So you don't have to point that out to everybody right away.

185
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,660
I want to mention, for those of you who are not native English speakers,

186
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,360
there is a English language institute at the University of Michigan and they provide

187
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:58,180
a lot of excellent guidance for public speaking and for writing in general.

188
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:02,740
And I can't imagine a more intimidating situation.

189
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,450
And I have so much respect for people who are who are giving up, getting up and giving talks,

190
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:16,510
who are not native English speakers, because I find it to be so stressful and intimidating and English is my first language.

191
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:21,820
So again, lots of resources available on campus.

192
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:29,500
And then my biggest area, the area that terrifies me the most,

193
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:38,260
is dealing with questions and there are a number of different types of questions you might receive and most of them are pretty benign.

194
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,690
So it's important to keep this in mind when you're going into a Q&A session.

195
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,549
The majority of questions are going to be things like They want to know your opinion,

196
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:56,200
you know, so you're giving a talk on opioid abuse and they want to know your opinion about,

197
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:07,390
you know, the use of naloxone in the community or they, you know, there's it's not meant to attack your work at all or challenge you in any way.

198
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:15,670
It's just kind of they want to hear what you have to say about something and questions about the literature related to a particular topic.

199
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:21,550
So are there any other publications about, you know, some topic that you presented?

200
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,230
Is there is anybody else done this? Yeah. Like what is known already?

201
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,090
Suggestion questions. You'll get this a lot.

202
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:38,230
And this is because people are very collegial and they'll say, you know, have you thought about trying this experiment or this control?

203
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:45,130
And, you know, sometimes they'll offer reagents or they'll offer expertize.

204
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,000
You know, I have a post-doc in this group who has developed an assay that may.

205
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,930
Help you figure out this. The answer to this question, you should check this out.

206
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:02,030
One Another type of question you will frequently get is a show of the questioners knowledge.

207
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:11,180
So this has nothing to do with you. This is a an area of anxiety and insecurity among the person that's doing the questioning.

208
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:20,299
And so they will preface the question with all of their credentials and all of the things that they've done and why they're an expert in the field.

209
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:25,940
And and then, you know, somewhere in there after, you know, a couple of minutes of their talking,

210
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:32,400
they'll have maybe a question or something, but maybe not. And so you just sort of have to smile and nod through those.

211
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:41,959
And I actually those are kind of you can get a it's kind of a relief when that person is just sort of rambling and you can kind of take a deep breath.

212
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,990
And especially if people have just been hammering you with questions,

213
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:50,690
there's something that kind of causes a pause in in the question and answer session.

214
00:23:51,350 --> 00:24:01,640
Those can always be those can often be welcome. Another situation you will get is in our work, we we found this, so maybe they do something similar.

215
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,150
And it's really helpful to to hear what,

216
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:11,750
what maybe they've done a similar approach and they've gotten a different result or they've gotten a similar one.

217
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,630
But regardless, that can be helpful. And then these are the ones that get to be a little bit.

218
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:23,900
These ones get nerve wracking if somebody is like, I just don't understand what you're talking about,

219
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:32,370
and then you're trying to explain it and you know, they're like, Can you go back to that slide where you brought up that that bar chart?

220
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,350
Can you explain that a little better? And maybe, you know,

221
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,759
maybe it is just a really easy clarification because sometimes we get up there

222
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,510
and we give a talk and we're talking too fast and we breezed through something.

223
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,290
We didn't go through it in enough detail. And so they just need a little bit of clarification.

224
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:54,950
And sometimes there are situations where they're like, I just I just flat out don't get what you're talking about.

225
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,120
Like, this makes no sense to me or to these.

226
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:03,920
I don't agree with your data questions. Again, I have had very few.

227
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:10,190
I've presented in very few situations where you have people who are hostile and we'll get up there and just

228
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:16,150
really start trying to read people to shreds and usually they make an idiot out of themselves when they do that.

229
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:23,150
More than anything, there's more. And most of the people in your audience, no matter where you're at, want to see you succeed.

230
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,840
That's there's nothing more uncomfortable than watching somebody give a talk and seeing them fall apart in front of everybody.

231
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:36,200
You know, I just think that's a human there has to be some sort of human empathy, human nature thing.

232
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,320
But occasionally you do get people who are jerks.

233
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:48,890
And for these two situations, I think that it is perfectly okay to, you know, say, let's take this discussion off line.

234
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,660
I'm not I can give you a little more clarification.

235
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,229
Maybe we can talk about it a little more, but it's getting a little detailed and we have a limited amount of time.

236
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:05,180
So let's just take this off line after after the talk or maybe send me an email and we can have coffee or something like that.

237
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:14,900
So these are, you know, some of the strategies that have helped me along the way.

238
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:20,900
The first thing is just just trying to remember to take a couple of deep breaths,

239
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:26,030
because you do get very short of breath when you are, especially when you're anxious,

240
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,410
and then you're talking really fast,

241
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:38,780
asking them to repeat the question can give can give just a little bit of extra time to get your brain to process things,

242
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,460
taking a sip of water or, you know, maybe taking if you have a pair of glasses or something,

243
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:51,530
if there's something that would give you just a little bit of pause, but you don't want to do that too often and get where it gets distracting.

244
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:55,880
I actually had a I had to give a talk once. I still have to be careful with the water bottles.

245
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,850
I had to give a talk and I was horrified because I didn't realize they had put out a water

246
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:07,159
bottle and I was so nervous and I realized I was holding this water bottle the whole time,

247
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:14,560
like this plastic it and I'm doing this and I'm like stopping or, you know, drinking.

248
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:20,120
And then people are asking me things and I'm like, you know, curling it around.

249
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,260
You almost have to, like,

250
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:29,750
keep that stuff out of your hands like a few feet away so that you can be mindful about when you when you engage with the object.

251
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,360
It is perfectly okay to admit that you don't know something.

252
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,110
And this is something that we're all terrified to do,

253
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:46,760
especially when you have imposter syndrome and you feel like you don't belong there in the first place, but nobody knows everything.

254
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:53,620
And in fact, as scientists, the more we. The more we discover as scientists, the more we realize we don't know.

255
00:27:53,920 --> 00:28:05,200
I feel like I feel much more ignorant now as a scientist than I ever did as a as a high school student taking a science class.

256
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,450
And I was like, wow, I know all this stuff now. This is, you know, it's like, no, you don't, actually.

257
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,770
There's so much, so much more. We so much we don't understand.

258
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:21,250
And so it's perfectly okay to admit when you don't know something and if it's if you are, say,

259
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:28,960
in your prelim or in your thesis defense or your data meeting or something where a faculty member is challenging you on something,

260
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:37,389
you can say, you know, I don't know. That's a great question, but I will go look that up and maybe we can talk about that after class.

261
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:45,750
I'd love to learn more from you. I know that you are such a a genius and a, you know, a renowned scientist in this area.

262
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:50,349
You know, I just kind of stroke their ego a little bit. And sometimes that's helpful.

263
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:55,690
Obviously, if you're not sarcastic about it, the question becomes really involved.

264
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:04,420
Again, it's okay to take the discussion offline. Any comments or questions anybody has at this point?

265
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:18,690
All right. So just some again, these seem these are pretty straightforward and kind of kind of almost common sense.

266
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:26,380
But I do think that they're important to think through as you're putting together your talk, as you're putting together abstracts.

267
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:34,120
What do you want your audience to remember? So make making it relevant specifically to the people that you're addressing.

268
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,440
Teaching the audience something. Keep it as short as possible.

269
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,120
Again, you're never going to go wrong if you go a little bit under the time limit,

270
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:53,110
make it specific and concrete, and use your spoken language rather than the less wordy your slides are.

271
00:29:54,070 --> 00:30:02,020
In many cases, if you can describe it, articulate it, or have some pictures rather than words, I think that that's more effective.

272
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:08,200
So moving on to the elevator pitch, and again,

273
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:16,210
the purpose of the elevator pitch is to convey for different points what problem it is you're interested in working on.

274
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:20,530
Why does it matter and why should anybody care about it?

275
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:26,230
What are some potential solutions and benefits of fixing it and how how are you going to go about it?

276
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,860
How are you currently going about fixing that through your research?

277
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:37,450
And so I have a couple of examples of elevator pitches here just to provide a more detailed.

278
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,660
How many of you had to give one? There actually isn't a single email that I've written.

279
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:53,080
How many? How many of you had to give an elevator pitch or have some sort of similar thing before?

280
00:30:53,390 --> 00:31:00,480
So, yeah, some of you have, some you haven't. And even if you've done it a million times, it does.

281
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:08,090
It's another thing that everybody has to spend some time thinking about and practicing even as a faculty member.

282
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:11,650
Okay, I don't do this all the time. And so when I go to a conference,

283
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:16,570
I have to think about how it what sort of what's the message I want to convey to people to

284
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:22,170
know I'm going to get asked these things over the last few months without the help of family.

285
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:27,250
Would it surprise you to learn this is one of the treatments for a disease?

286
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:34,660
It still kills well over a million people every American society psychology winner and a post-doc at the University of Washington in.

287
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,740
I'd like to tell you about how my research aims to prevent unnecessary deaths from human immunodeficiency virus or HIV.

288
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:51,460
HIV affects a person's immune system, makes more and more copies of itself, essentially hijacks your system and leaves you open to other diseases.

289
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,660
Now, as I mentioned before, we have great medicines that can treat this.

290
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,920
We have medicines that can make healthy lives, even though they can be tricky.

291
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:06,710
We have medicines that can prevent transmission of HIV to networks and infection, medicines that can prevent infection of people at high risk.

292
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,910
So where do we still have this huge burden of people dying every year?

293
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:16,150
Part of that is because medicines don't work if we don't care. Now, you might say, well, if you could just take the medicines, it's not that simple.

294
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,090
How many of us? Plus every day, even though we don't know.

295
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:25,920
So what we would like to do is to make a tool for patients and doctors that will allow them to monitor them.

296
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,550
In the same way that you can look at your Fitbit and say, Well, I've got 10,000 steps today.

297
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:33,940
I know we're protected. We want to do the same thing for HIV treatment.

298
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:39,070
Our test takes advantage of some of the basic biology about how HIV functions.

299
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:46,690
We give an HIV into an HIV tool everything it needs to make more and more copies of its DNA.

300
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,380
The only thing we don't control is how much a drug is in a person's blood.

301
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:56,530
The idea is if there's enough drug in their system, maybe HIV can make more copies of itself, more DNA.

302
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,770
And if there's not enough, HIV can make all the difference.

303
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:05,890
And so what we do is we measure DNA by the number of HIV copies as a proxy for how much drug is in the patient's blood.

304
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:11,440
Thankfully, biology has advanced to the point that we can measure that DNA very quickly at room temperature,

305
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,830
and this allows us to build the quick test that doctors and patients can use.

306
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,790
We hope that this will help to improve healthcare outcomes for future.

307
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:28,390
Thank you for your time. For just $67, you can make as many commercials or like five times longer the video.

308
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:36,600
So that's one example. That one's a little bit longer. That was, again, part of a competition from the American Society of Cell Biology.

309
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,790
And I would say it's more formal than, you know, what you would have to say.

310
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:49,660
You're having breakfast or dinner with a group out of at a conference or something, and somebody next to you asks you what you do.

311
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:56,560
So that's a little more rehearsed and informal than what you would do in that type of situation.

312
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:04,060
But you kind of get the idea that you can you want to provide some background and presented in a way that somebody

313
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:14,530
who is not an HIV expert or an expert in whatever field that you were and can can follow that and then explain,

314
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:22,300
you know, how you were addressing the problem and what the implications will be for fixing it.

315
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:29,350
And then there's another one on here. And then if you if you Google elevator pitches, you'll get there's there's tons of examples.

316
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:45,370
You want to check those out. So with regard to the Lightning Talk, this is a five minute oral presentation on your current or planned research.

317
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,780
And you can if you are not doing research in particular,

318
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:55,209
if you're going to be doing some sort of applied practice or you have just some research or scholarly interest,

319
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,970
you want to present time, that's perfectly fine.

320
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:07,570
The Lightning Talk is a really short presentation that's meant to grab attention and convey information quickly.

321
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:13,090
These are typically given in a conference where there's kind of they're all mashed together.

322
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:16,300
You know, they'll have like ten people in a row that'll give a lightning talk,

323
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:23,560
like bare minimum and then not really a lot of opportunity for questions after the talk for these I

324
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,480
will I do because I think it's so important to practice the question and answer session after a talk.

325
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,720
And we do have enough time in the in the classes for the rest of the semester to get everybody in.

326
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:40,780
I think that we'll have a five minute of question and answer session after each talk.

327
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,200
They should contain the same general components of the abstract.

328
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,679
You know, you want to provide some background,

329
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:58,380
some rationale for why you're doing your your project a little bit on methods and results and then some key takeaways.

330
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:06,180
But again, you only have 5 minutes, so it's important to get to your you don't want to you won't be able to spend a lot of time giving a

331
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:13,710
ton of introduction and build up to your your research or the message that you're trying to convey.

332
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,400
You need to be able to get to the point quickly and stick to the big picture.

333
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:27,450
So, again, this is not the place where you're going to be trying to draw a million different connections and who don't have some really complex story.

334
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:38,610
You want to I would say here especially it's especially important in the shorter talks to rehearse the timing,

335
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:48,750
you know, the the longer research seminars. They can be more intimidating in some ways because you have you know,

336
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,890
you have so much more time where you're up in front of people and you have so much more material to present.

337
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,540
But these shorter talks where you really have to nail your message in a short

338
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:03,150
period of time and have really effective have really effective communication.

339
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,780
Those can actually be more difficult in some ways.

340
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:12,720
And so this is a place where you want to get out of stopwatch and in rehearse,

341
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:18,060
rehearse with the family member tier or anybody who'll who will listen and help you.

342
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:24,900
And then I think it's important for these shorter talks, especially to to really have a solid takeaway summary at the end.

343
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,480
And again, we'll have a five minute question and answer session after each talk.

344
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,260
And these will do everybody will have people get up in front of the class and give these talks.

345
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:47,040
But again, I think that this is a a generally collegial and friendly group of people and a pretty low intimidation environment.

346
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:54,540
And so this is a place to just just practice. And hopefully and most people don't find present giving presentations to be fun,

347
00:37:54,540 --> 00:38:00,989
but hopefully you can kind of have fun with it a little bit because it's a pass fail class and you're not you know,

348
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:14,820
it's not a really high pressure situation, but it will help you, I think, as you get into some higher pressure situations, I will postpone this.

349
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,510
This is actually pretty funny. If you want to check it out, I'll let you watch it on your own time.

350
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,960
But this guy,

351
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:33,600
he's a comedian and he goes he goes to like corporate corporate seminars and types of things and has a whole spiel on Death by PowerPoint.

352
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:40,110
And he has actually some really effective and really important tips in there.

353
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:46,769
And the last thing I wanted to with the last few minutes that we have,

354
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:51,600
I thought that we could just maybe discuss a couple of questions related to scientific communication.

355
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,440
And this one, I think is really interesting.

356
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:03,149
And it just came up. This was just in The New York Times very recently where California has proposed

357
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:08,190
a bill to punish doctors who spread false information related to COVID 19.

358
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:14,879
And so this is probably one of the hottest scientific communication topics right now,

359
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:24,930
is to what extent should we police misinformation or disinformation and should it be regulated at all?

360
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:29,400
And what what? I'd love to hear some of your thoughts on this.

361
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:44,610
Yeah. So my freshman year, I'm working with people right now on like controversial political issues.

362
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:50,099
And I think one thing they keep bringing up, it's like, oh, that's going to be like, Oh,

363
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:56,610
there is this like public health argument for why we should implement like a needle exchange or an economist reason for that.

364
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:03,450
And a lot of the like common perspective is like, you know, like this we think it's bad.

365
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:08,159
We don't like this because of religion. And they're like, Oh, do I like have to consider that?

366
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,620
Because it doesn't even matter. And I've been kind of thinking about that too, because like also I grew up in rural Indiana,

367
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:21,430
so like my family and I, other than the parents and the country, doesn't really have, um.

368
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,540
Yeah, but I keep thinking about, like, how if a lot of people do think like that,

369
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:32,940
I really believe that misinformation and that's going to impact policy because you're not going to,

370
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:40,520
you know, like somebody who doesn't represent what you think is real. In a vote against what their constituents think they're elected.

371
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:45,680
So then we end up like from the policy level at impacting everything.

372
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:57,390
Yeah. Yeah, I think, um, I think when the misinformation is harming the society more than it's actually helping.

373
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:03,810
I don't see how it would help, but when it's impacting society negatively, like as a whole,

374
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:14,340
then it needs to be regulated because like with COVID vaccines and everything like that, like a lot of people weren't getting vaccinated.

375
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:22,600
Members came out because of like misinformation that was being spread, which then just led us into this big.

376
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:30,450
Well, there's so many factors as to why we handled the pandemic wrong, but, like, it just kept us just digging a deeper and deeper hole.

377
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,760
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

378
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,170
I think there's you know, I think there's pros and cons in both in both directions.

379
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,930
Does anybody else have any have a different perspective?

380
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:53,420
Really, the source of the problem is lack of good education. And I think people should be able to identify misinformation and disinformation

381
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:57,139
and like teaching those critical thinking skills like in elementary school,

382
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,010
like at a young age is really important. Yes. Yes.

383
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:01,420
Yeah.

384
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:17,540
To what extent is it the the responsibility of our of our government to regulate what we what we see in terms of health information or other other,

385
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:22,630
you know, bits of information and who who's going to be the gatekeeper?

386
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:28,160
You know, if you want to regulate something, somebody has to be the gatekeeper about what's the truth and what isn't.

387
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:35,120
And, you know, it's maybe seems logical and obvious.

388
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:41,839
And in a certain situation where you have you have a situation where there's clear disinformation,

389
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,190
deliberate spreading of nonsense that's killing people.

390
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,239
But maybe there are some other situations that are more grave and there's a

391
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,990
little less black and white in terms of what's the right answer and what is it.

392
00:42:54,440 --> 00:43:05,899
And, you know, the person who's appointed to make that call, who gives them the authority, and then what are the implications if if you are you know,

393
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:13,160
if you are found to be guilty of some sort of of spreading misinformation just because you're

394
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:18,469
you have a little bit of a different interpretation of of the same scientific evidence.

395
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,650
For example, does anybody have any other.

396
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:32,950
Um, I think I'd be interested to see what comes to mind is when Facebook started removing posts that they found to be not factual.

397
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,980
Like when someone would post that if Facebook found that.

398
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:42,050
It like great album said that you didn't have that disclaimer on there.

399
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:51,350
But then people who had that mindset were like, Oh, Facebook is part of the Liberal government.

400
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:59,959
And so now I don't trust Facebook either. So I interested to see research showing how those sort of tactics and how effective those really are,

401
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:05,290
because it prevents some people from seeing it and believing it.

402
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:14,240
But are those people? Does that really change anyone's opinion, everyone's opinion on it and about everything?

403
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:17,690
Right. It doesn't matter if someone says it's false.

404
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:21,410
If someone challenges you, then they're wrong to. Yeah.

405
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:27,140
No, there's so much of Yeah. People are so ingrained in what they think.

406
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,670
And it's not really that it's no amount of evidence is going to change their mind.

407
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:43,140
Right. And so yeah. How effect does that more do more to just so mistrust in our agencies and and

408
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:49,430
risk and discontent among the people that that are already buying this stuff.

409
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:56,930
Did you have a comment? Yeah. I think for this scenario especially, I mean, when you're a medical doctor,

410
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:04,940
you swear on the Hippocratic Oath that you're supposed to do no harm to eliminate excuse me, as much harm as possible.

411
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,580
I think if you're going to take that oath.

412
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:14,120
It's your responsibility to ensure that your patients are receiving information where they can make informed decisions.

413
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,400
Yeah. And, you know, we're creatures of free will.

414
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:26,629
You cannot force somebody to do something inherently, but it's really, really important for patients especially to be receiving that information.

415
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:30,110
That's true. That's been informed by current scientific knowledge.

416
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:33,260
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

417
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:45,440
And I would say, you know, there's on both sides of the aisle, there is you know, there's a lot of misinformation around COVID that it's a hoax,

418
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:52,009
that, you know, if you just take this deworming agent and, you know, you're you're going to be fine.

419
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:55,970
You don't need to see a doctor do any sort of traditional medical intervention.

420
00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:07,129
And then the other side, there is also a lot of people who are very who have become quite dogmatic in their beliefs around the pandemic.

421
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:13,970
And they have this sort of you know, there's they want zero-covid.

422
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:16,070
They want they want COVID eradicated.

423
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:23,840
Until then, it's like we want to have the same sorts of guidelines that we had in 2020, even with vaccines and everything.

424
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:34,159
And so there there's a lot of gray area here and a lot of places where things are still open to interpretation.

425
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:40,970
And even among, you know, the most established people who have spent their entire life,

426
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:47,600
vaccine experts on infectious disease experts, there's a lot of a lot of disagreement among them.

427
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:51,540
And so so, yeah, I think it's just a it's an interesting question.

428
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:59,659
And, you know, I can think of a lot of pros and cons about how we we as scientists deal with these types

429
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:06,440
of situations and how do our code as our society and our government regulate it as well?

430
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:11,270
And do or do we regulate it and think coming back to, you know,

431
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:18,140
do we need to focus on getting people all these critical thinking skills that maybe we have a problem of people here can't discriminate,

432
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:23,240
you know, with between what's real and what's nonsense.

433
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:34,249
And have you I, I was also reading New York Times last night and another scientific communication topic popped up,

434
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:39,710
which is quite hilarious in that if you just.

435
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:48,200
Have you heard of this NyQuil chicken? Yeah, I like the take away and it's like cold chicken.

436
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:52,459
Yeah. The headline was the FDA.

437
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,870
FDA Warning on NyQuil chicken alerts, many to the existence of NyQuil chicken.

438
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:04,820
So, like, if we go out of our way to warn people about all of the the risks associated with these crazy fads,

439
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:15,190
then we just sometimes we inadvertently spread more of it around and make it more we inadvertently validate it in a lot of ways.

440
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,179
Like most people didn't take it seriously until the FDA started putting out all these warnings.

441
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:24,320
Like, you really shouldn't put NyQuil on chicken like that. It sounds like the most disgusting thing.

442
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:28,100
Like I read this and I was like, just I almost gagged.

443
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:37,430
Like, just reading it is on some girls. But yeah, so those are just a couple of topics I wanted to have the chance to talk about.

444
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:44,149
As it grew. So now we get into a lot of just technical details around giving talks and whatnot.

445
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:47,660
But I think these are kind of fun and interesting topics to think about.

446
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:57,710
So does anybody have any any questions or comments, anything to say before we adjourn so we are done?

447
00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:04,300
Yeah, but again, work for the government.

448
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:22,340
Any agencies call for law enforcement to stop the lending of the information, especially because they need to be faced with whatever owner goes there.

449
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:38,180
And everybody, if we place a responsible person, can see the source of the use of the information, given this is true or anything.

450
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:44,750
Yeah, but most of the people are just credit shared to their friends.

451
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:52,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

452
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:58,999
I think that. I think that's what's that horse is out of the barn, so to speak.

453
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,210
It's, it's very time they put it back. Yeah, I think so.

454
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:11,260
And it's so easy to spread and spread not, you know, back in the days like and you were in the same situation.

455
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:17,040
You know, to communicate with people, you had to write notes in a lot of cases and talk on the phone.

456
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,939
And we didn't have all of these like you didn't have to work for various smartphones.

457
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,630
And so, yeah, it's easy.
