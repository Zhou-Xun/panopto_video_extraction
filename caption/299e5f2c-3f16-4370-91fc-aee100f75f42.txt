1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,729
Now that we've reviewed some key data
about the hospital industry structure

2
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:13,840
and trends.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,223
Let's take a look at some of
the economic drivers of those trends in

4
00:00:18,223 --> 00:00:19,721
their consequences.

5
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:23,816
Our learning objectives are to analyze how
actors interact in the pursuit of their

6
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:26,904
objectives and how these
interactions influence the cost and

7
00:00:26,904 --> 00:00:29,059
effectiveness of the health care system.

8
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:32,191
And to adapt this general
behavioral model to account for

9
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:35,661
the particular features of health and
health care decisions.

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,386
Although hospitals account for a declining
share of spending, they are rapidly

11
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:45,016
restructuring their market position
by consolidating into systems and

12
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:47,940
integrating with other levels of care.

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,285
Other levels of care delivery or financing
include hospitals integrated with

14
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,918
physician practices, post acute providers,

15
00:00:54,918 --> 00:00:59,040
physical or occupational
therapy companies, or insurers.

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,279
We'll focus on integration of
hospitals with other hospitals and

17
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:05,786
hospitals with physician practices.

18
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:10,140
Defining markets and quantifying how
competitive they are can be challenging.

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,940
One commonly used measure of concentration
is the Her Fondle Hirschman Index, or HHI.

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,040
First you need to define the market and
the firms that operate in that market.

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,840
For example, general hospital is located
in a particular geographic area.

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,510
Next you need a measure of each hospital
size or outputs, such as beds or

23
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,240
admissions.

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,740
Finally, you calculate each hospitals
market share, square them and add them up.

25
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,935
The resulting index ranges from 0
to 10,000, where zero represents

26
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:44,203
the perfectly competitive ideal,
and 10,000 represents monopoly.

27
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:49,240
Where one hospital or one hospital
system controls the entire market.

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,440
In other words, higher values
represent more concentrated markets.

29
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,067
Let's see a few examples
of the HHI calculation.

30
00:01:57,067 --> 00:02:02,240
Monopolist has a 100 market share
squaring that yields 10,000.

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,952
Now, suppose that instead, we had
a duopoly market with two firms where

32
00:02:06,952 --> 00:02:09,513
each firm has exactly half the market.

33
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:14,740
That markets HHI will be 5000
50 squared plus 50 squared.

34
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,851
Suppose we still had to firms that one
of them controlled 80 of the market and

35
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:21,840
the other one only controlled 20%.

36
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,763
That would represent a less competitive
situation with an HHI of 6800 80

37
00:02:26,763 --> 00:02:29,340
squared plus 20 squared.

38
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,119
Finally, a market made up of 10 equal
sized firms would have an HHI of

39
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:38,580
1000 10 squared is 100 and
we'd add that up 10 times.

40
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,536
When analyzing a proposed merger,

41
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:43,667
the Federal Trade Commission and
the Justice Department

42
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:47,202
places markets into one of several
categories based on the HHI.

43
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:53,147
Unconcentrated markets for
HHI under 1500 moderately concentrated for

44
00:02:53,147 --> 00:03:01,040
values between 1500 and 2499, highly
concentrated for values of 2500 4999.

45
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,049
And finally super concentrated
HHI is 5000 or above.

46
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:10,678
Now that we have some sense of how
to assess the markets concentration,

47
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:14,561
we may want to know why some markets
become concentrated in the first place.

48
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,040
Some markets may simply be too small
to support multiple competitors.

49
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,151
For example, a rural community is likely
to have only one viable hospital.

50
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,102
In other cases, a firm or firms become
large by out competing others in

51
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:31,983
the market,
if you provide a consistently better or

52
00:03:31,983 --> 00:03:36,651
cheaper product than your competitors, you
can win a larger market share of sales.

53
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,616
Other markets feature network effects
where the value of the product increases

54
00:03:42,616 --> 00:03:44,091
with the number of users.

55
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:48,062
A particular electronic health record
system might be more valuable to

56
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,510
a hospital if many area
doctors also use it,

57
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,161
allowing more efficient transmission
of patient information.

58
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,261
Finally, there may be mergers between
firms that were formerly competitors.

59
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,145
An important source of market power in
the hospital industry has been mergers.

60
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:10,548
These include horizontal mergers
between hospitals, and vertical mergers

61
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:15,163
where a hospital acquires a physician
practice or another provider or insurer.

62
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:18,948
Physicians are also integrating
into larger single or

63
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:24,797
multi specialty group practices even if
they're not integrating with hospitals.

64
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:29,822
What might be the motivations for and
results of mergers and acquisitions?

65
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:33,687
Hospitals often claim that horizontal
merges with other hospitals will have

66
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:35,953
several beneficial outcomes, including.

67
00:04:35,953 --> 00:04:40,863
Increased efficiency and lower costs,
scale economies from less duplication of

68
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:45,630
equipment or service lines and the ability
to spread fixed costs of investments

69
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,561
like HIT systems over
a larger amount of output.

70
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,593
They similarly claim that vertical
integration with physician practices will

71
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,551
result in better care,
coordination and communication.

72
00:04:56,551 --> 00:05:01,046
Less duplication of tests and
better transitions between levels of care,

73
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:03,485
such as fewer unplanned readmissions.

74
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:10,695
Conversely, economists and regulators
often fear that the post merger loss of

75
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:14,161
competition will have adverse
consequences for consumers.

76
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,245
These include reduced choice and
convenience, higher prices and

77
00:05:19,245 --> 00:05:24,740
less need to compete on the basis of
clinical quality or customer service.

78
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,618
They also worry that even if some of
the claimed efficiencies are achieved,

79
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:32,451
the savings won't be passed on to
consumers in a less competitive market.

80
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,051
What does the research tell us about
the consequences of horizontal mergers?

81
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,613
Review of the literature concluded the
mergers tended to either decrease quality

82
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:47,695
or leave it unchanged counter to
the claims that quality would rise through

83
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:49,721
changes like better coordination.

84
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:53,996
Mergers sometimes decreased costs to
hospitals, but that seemed to occur only

85
00:05:53,996 --> 00:05:58,040
in cases where facilities and
service lines were centralized.

86
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,741
For example, suppose both hospitals had a
cardiac surgery program before the merger

87
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:07,261
and those programs were consolidated into
one of the hospitals after the merger.

88
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,740
However, the clearest and most consistent
evidence is that mergers increased prices.

89
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,616
The amount of increase depends on
the context of emerging partners and

90
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:21,849
their markets and arranged from 5 to 50%.

91
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:26,036
Interestingly, a merger occurring in a
market even allowed nearby hospitals that

92
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:29,921
weren't part of the merger to raise their
prices because of the lower level of

93
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:31,861
competition in the market as a whole.

94
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,240
Another effect of mergers is
depressed wages in the labor market.

95
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,545
While hospitals don't employ
a large share of the markets,

96
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:48,378
food service or custodial workers,

97
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:52,829
they are important employers for nurses,

98
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:58,531
pharmacists and
other medical technical personnel.

99
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:03,553
Without a merger, wages were lower
four years post merger by 6.8% for

100
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:08,540
RNs and pharmacists and by 4% for
other skilled categories.

101
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,043
There is no effect on wages and

102
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:14,340
more general labor categories
like food service and custodial.

103
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,455
The effects on nurse wages were
mitigated by unionization.

104
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:24,403
In terms of vertical mergers between
hospitals and physicians, prices for

105
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:27,840
services have acquired
physicians rose 14%.

106
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,731
Half of this increase was due to explain
payment rules that allow higher fees for

107
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:34,121
hospital based care.

108
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,939
A literature review by Post, Buchmueller
and Ryan from the University of

109
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:41,884
Michigan concluded the vertical mergers
increased prices and spending and

110
00:07:41,884 --> 00:07:45,827
had mixed effects on quality with
marginal improvements in mortality, but

111
00:07:45,827 --> 00:07:48,061
inconsistent effects on other outcomes.

112
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,206
To summarize hospital markets have
become increasingly concentrated and

113
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:59,140
merger and acquisition activity has
been a major driver of that change.

114
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,840
Hospital physician integration
is also rising rapidly.

115
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,360
The clearest impact of both horizontal and
vertical mergers is higher prices for

116
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,140
private payers.

117
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,861
The impacts on costs and
quality are more ambiguous.
