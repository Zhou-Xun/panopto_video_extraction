1
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:09,143
So I'm going to talk now about
the importance of considering culture

2
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:11,850
in thinking about communications.

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,880
Before we go there, however,
let's define culture.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,920
What are we talking about if
we're talking about culture?

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,825
So here's some definitions.

6
00:00:20,825 --> 00:00:24,020
Merriam-Webster has a few
definitions of culture.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,370
One of them is the customary beliefs,
social forms, and

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:32,402
material traits of a racial,
religious, or social group.

9
00:00:32,402 --> 00:00:36,020
Another subdefinition is
the characteristic features of everyday

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:43,460
existence, such as diversions or way of
life, shared by people in a place or time.

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,740
Now, these first definitions emphasize
common features of people who might share

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,530
racial or ethnic backgrounds, religious or

13
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,450
faith beliefs, social bonds,
physical proximity, etc.

14
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:01,260
And all of those things are elements of
culture, and we need to rethink about and

15
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,320
respect those.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,570
But I wanna be clear.

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,020
Culture can be thought of in other ways,
too.

18
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,310
And some of the other definitions
of culture highlight those.

19
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,850
So here's some of the other
definitions of culture.

20
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,400
A set of shared attitudes,
values, goals, and

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,610
practices that characterizes
an institution or an organization.

22
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,020
Or the set of shared values, conventions,
or social practices associated with

23
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,470
a particular field, activity,
or societal characteristic.

24
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,100
These definitions connect to
this idea of organization.

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,433
And even the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention,

26
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:43,020
when it defined culture, it made sure to
consider those kinds of aspects, right?

27
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,335
CDC looked at culture can be
defined by group membership,

28
00:01:46,335 --> 00:01:50,460
such as racial ethnic,
linguistic, or geographic groups.

29
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,730
Or as a collection of these beliefs,
values, customs,

30
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:58,980
ways of thinking, communicating, and
behaving that are specific to a group.

31
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,900
For example,

32
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,790
every public health professional
has at least some shared culture.

33
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,560
That's represented in
their shared beliefs,

34
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,660
say, about the importance of science.

35
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,210
Or about the value and
importance of acting to prevent disease,

36
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,460
not just treating it once it occurs.

37
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,300
That's core to the very
definition of public health.

38
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,530
Public health professionals
also share some values.

39
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,467
For example, caring about the health of
the population, not just individuals.

40
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:35,420
Or about reducing disparities amongst
different parts of the population.

41
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,780
Those values are shared by the profession.

42
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,080
We also have our particular terminology,
right?

43
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,100
Epidemiology is not a word that many
people use in their day to day life.

44
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,720
But it's a term that public health
professionals use on a daily basis.

45
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,700
Now, other professions may differ,
they may have different beliefs.

46
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,702
An economist or

47
00:02:57,702 --> 00:03:03,400
a business man might have a belief in
the effectiveness of economic incentives.

48
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,120
That belief may or may not be held
by public health professionals.

49
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,473
Other professions may differ
in their values, right?

50
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:14,210
Valuing profit or individual autonomy.

51
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,830
Those kinds of values will be reflected
in the decisions that people make, and

52
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,950
in the way they're gonna
respond to communications.

53
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,540
And of course, other professions have
their own jargon or terminology.

54
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,093
So some really concrete examples.

55
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:34,370
Medicine and nursing are obviously very
related health professions fields.

56
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,260
But even there,
there are important cultural differences.

57
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,670
A doctor who is speaking
to a nursing audience,

58
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,000
needs to be aware of those differences.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,070
Needs to understand the shared values,
the shared beliefs,

60
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:52,607
that a group of nurses would hold,
and think about how that relates to

61
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:57,619
the message that she might
want to be communicating.

62
00:03:57,619 --> 00:04:02,568
The US, the United States,
has a culture that on average

63
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:07,532
tends to emphasize individuals and
individual rights.

64
00:04:07,532 --> 00:04:12,063
Other countries in the world have
a greater emphasis on collective rights or

65
00:04:12,063 --> 00:04:13,820
collective good.

66
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,660
Other countries have more
deference to authority.

67
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,960
Those different values and

68
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,440
beliefs interact with
the communications that we give.

69
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,040
And so,
being aware of those cultural differences

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,070
is important to being effective.

71
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,070
These cultural expectations change
the way in which we interpret and

72
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:37,890
respond to words, to gestures,
to communications, to visuals.

73
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,020
And therefore,
the takeaway point here is simple.

74
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,952
We need to think about culture
whenever we are communicating.
