1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,300
All right. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to another day of this.

2
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,410
Good to see you all. And of the missing, a couple of people.

3
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,700
But we'll get started any way they can catch up someone.

4
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,329
Okay. So today we're going to finish up last week's lecture.

5
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:35,300
We talked about kind of looking at exploring that lung cancer mortality data a bit more.

6
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,920
Right. You played around with that. And I wanted to get into this issue of key steps in using this data.

7
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,000
We'll talk about that today and we'll talk about mapping health information,

8
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:54,180
which is kind of the main activity in terms of creating maps and thinking about different ways of or ways we can create maps in.

9
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,940
ArcGIS Okay. But just to outline, we're going to a recap from last lecture for a few minutes.

10
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,370
We'll do key steps in using just data. We'll do some magnet lab activities.

11
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,260
So we'll today we'll start getting our own data, right? So we'll practice together.

12
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:17,190
We'll download data from state cancer profiles to update some of the data that we'll be looking at recently.

13
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,560
That lung cancer mortality data were all there from 2000 to 2004.

14
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,879
So we'll get updated data today. We'll learn how to manage some of that data,

15
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:37,410
clean that data and what we call joining it with the shape files or boundary files, right, or feature class data.

16
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:44,040
So we can attribute data and feature class data and bring it together in lab activities 10 to 13.

17
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:51,120
And then we'll do student led discussions and then we'll talk about mapping health data in area data.

18
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,799
So different kinds of maps that you can create and issues around them.

19
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,460
And we'll talk about complex maps and deciding which intervals to use for your categories and so forth.

20
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,669
And then we'll do lab activities 14 and 15. If we have time, we will do some visualizations,

21
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:16,080
right to work more with symbology and learn about the different tools we have within the symbology function in our areas.

22
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,230
Okay, that's the basic outline for today. We may not get to everything, but we'll see.

23
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:30,240
Okay, so let's do a little bit of recap. Last week we learned about a few tools in ArcGIS Pro.

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,950
We learned about carry and selection by attribute.

25
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,330
Could somebody tell the class what these tools are for?

26
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,610
Why do we use Claire? Yeah, we.

27
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:58,490
Certain parts of our dataset is a very terrifying feature to look at.

28
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:14,420
So based on. So this entire lung cancer mortality rate right out of the 40,000 or 20,000 for people who picked this data and just.

29
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,830
You just saw that. Perfect.

30
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:29,650
Yes. So queries are a way to filter the data and select subsets of the dataset you're looking at based on some kind of an attribute.

31
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,720
So you're right. Last week we looked at the attribute of state names.

32
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,690
Right. We looked at all the Michigan counties and selected those out.

33
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:45,700
And you guys did some of your own work with your own states. So what about selection by attribute?

34
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:53,410
What is that? Is that something you talk about that you can compare and contrast with query?

35
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,370
Yeah. That one.

36
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:13,109
I think you were using it when looking at like within a state, looking at specific counties and comparing like the rates of lung cancer.

37
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,739
So I think the selection by HBO allowed us to look at like which ones that we wanted to see,

38
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:22,680
like the five highest counties, and we were able to select all five of them and then compare their data in that table.

39
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:27,990
Okay. Okay. Anybody want to add to that or say more about that?

40
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,830
Okay. I guess what I would say is a little different than what you mentioned.

41
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:47,910
It's not necessarily about finding the high rate counties or high value areas.

42
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,280
It's really very similar to query. But query just filters the data and creates a subset of it.

43
00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:01,890
Right. Selection by attribute selects those filtered areas.

44
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,220
Okay. And what you could do after doing that is make a new layer from that selection.

45
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,690
You can't do that when you do a query function. You can just subset the data and look at it.

46
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,970
But you can create new layers from it. And why do we create a new layer?

47
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:24,120
After we selected by attribute, we selected, let's see, counties in Michigan based on the name of those.

48
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,720
Name of the state where those counties were located.

49
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,910
Why do we create a new layer after we selected those counties out?

50
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:44,450
Yeah. So we don't see unnecessary data or like extra data that we were hoping to see in that way other than perfect.

51
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:51,080
Yeah. So there's many times you'll have data for, let's say, the whole world and you want to look at just the United States.

52
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,530
You don't want to ignore the rest of the data in your dataset.

53
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:02,480
So this is a way to select those areas out and create a new layer of data, which then you can analyze, visualized and so forth.

54
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:12,050
So before we did that, if you the previous weeks of work, you had looked at a specific state and try to map it in creative layout for it.

55
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,550
But you had all the other states around it as kind of confusing and visually pleasing.

56
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:24,140
So this way you can create a new layer based on that and then do a layout and so forth.

57
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,909
Okay. So what's the difference between maps and layouts?

58
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:36,610
Again, because these are two different pieces of the middle view in ArcGIS Pro.

59
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,920
Right. We have a map view in the layout. Yeah,

60
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,820
the map is more like a dynamic field and area and you can move it around in like

61
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:50,600
zoom in to change what you're looking at versus a layout is more of something

62
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,249
you can disseminate to others that have a specific part of the map highlighted

63
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,240
with different attributes that you want to be able to communicate to others.

64
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:07,490
Great. So layout to use to create shareable maps or exported maps from our guys.

65
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,530
Matthew is there to explore analyze the data that you have.

66
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,260
But then after you're done doing all that work,

67
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:25,820
you create a layered view to start creating some kind of a map that you can put in reports or share with your friends or colleagues and so forth.

68
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:32,480
Excellent. All right. Any questions or comments, concerns you have so far?

69
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,220
Yeah. Does everybody have ArcGIS Pro installed in their home computers?

70
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,470
Anybody know I haven't installed. Okay.

71
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,460
Are you do you. Do you need assistance or. Okay.

72
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,620
I just don't think it's compatible with my devices people. But I've tested the virtual side and.

73
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,510
Okay, okay, good, good. So that's a good alternative if you can't get it to work at home.

74
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:09,050
Yeah. I think a couple of us run the computers from that very day and they got brand new ones.

75
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,990
Oh, you should be able to download it on there. Let's get it out. Yeah.

76
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,190
Yeah. I did hear a couple of students that read laptops.

77
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,870
That's a good alternative for the semester.

78
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:25,530
Yeah, but as you move forward, it's going to be a lot of homework, you know, and stuff outside of class for your computer access.

79
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,870
Yes. Okay. It looks like everybody has teams, so that's great.

80
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:37,040
Assignment to meeting with instructors. I'm going to send out a Google calendar invitation to everybody by the end of this

81
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,419
week or early next week with the appointment slots that you could sign up for.

82
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:50,990
So we can start talking about your second assignment. So start looking for a paper or report or whatnot for your first and second assignment.

83
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,280
You should be doing that already. Okay, great.

84
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:02,359
So let's talk. What key steps in using gas data? Now, these steps look pretty self-explanatory.

85
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:13,160
Nothing new or rocket science. See, here, it's pretty logical, but it's really important to think through these steps when you start a gas project.

86
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:19,430
Okay, as many times you go to step four and that's kind of, you know, when you start, you know,

87
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:27,140
getting the reward of all your hard work, but you really got to do steps one, two and three before you get to that final step.

88
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,930
And each of those steps are very, very important.

89
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:38,090
And, you know, you can't really do a good job of your last step unless you really work hard on steps one, two and three.

90
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:48,470
So the first step is data acquisition and verification. Get the data you need for your project, and that is a harder job than you might think.

91
00:09:49,280 --> 00:10:00,760
You need to find data for your public health problem. You need to find data that's relevant to your geography, to your time period and and so forth.

92
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:06,410
And you need to look at the quality of the data. So you should understand where does that data actually come from?

93
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,069
Okay. So the state cancer profiles data that we look at.

94
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,180
It comes from cancer registries called the Seer Registry.

95
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Right. And those data actually come from hospital records.

96
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,870
So whenever a hospital gets a cancer patient, they have to report that to this year registry.

97
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:32,570
That's part of the law. And that data then is compiled with the data about prevalence, staging of cancer,

98
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:40,280
treatment of cancer and the outcome of that cancer that includes mortality or remission and so forth.

99
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:47,899
Okay. So there's a lot of data in the see registry that go along with the actual disease data, which include geographic information,

100
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:57,830
personal information of the individual, clinical care information, etc., and also the tumor information, genetic profile of the tumor and so forth.

101
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,540
And so knowing where that data comes from is very important. We also looked at census data,

102
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:12,680
right where the census data came from and that was a permit had household data was from the census that comes from household interviews.

103
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,230
Right. And many times are done every year or they would do it every ten years.

104
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,710
Okay. So, look, thinking about those things will get you about the quality of the data as well.

105
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,980
Because when you input cancer data into the registry, there could be data entry errors, misclassification errors that occur.

106
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,700
And those are they try to resolve those, but those are not always resolved.

107
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,330
In the in the census data.

108
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:47,150
It's hard to get good sensitive coverage for the whole country that's temporally aligned with the research question that you are interested in.

109
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:53,870
So we sometimes rely on something called the American Community Survey Data, which is part of the census, which we'll talk about today.

110
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:58,760
But that that doesn't give you a good coverage and there's a lot of error in that data.

111
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:06,980
So thinking about where the data comes from after you get it, the quality of the data is very, very important.

112
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,500
Once you get it, you have to manage that data, right? You have to prepare it for your project.

113
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:20,450
Part of it might be cleaning data, getting rid of extraneous information you do want and looking at the completeness of the data.

114
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:26,990
There may be areas that are missing or you can't have data for because of rare instances.

115
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,270
For example, in the cancer data,

116
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:36,110
they don't give you data for some counties in the country because there are few there are very few lung cancer deaths in certain counties.

117
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:41,360
And to protect the individual privacy, those data are not provided.

118
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,400
And then you have to. Merge data and combine data sets together.

119
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,120
That's part of data management and that's a big task. Okay.

120
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:56,900
And finally, after you do that, you can start doing some data analysis by looking at the distribution of the data.

121
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:03,919
Right. The central tendency to the variance may be correlations between different variables.

122
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,760
In your data set. You may be regression analysis to look at, you know, predictors of a certain outcome.

123
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:18,110
Okay. You may do spatial analysis like clustering analysis or spatial regression and so on and so forth.

124
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,040
And then once you do that, you finally visualize the data,

125
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:31,100
meaning we map it and decide how what's the best kind of mapping approach that you may want to use for virtualization?

126
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,660
And there you can spend a lot of time because there's a lot of design and

127
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,820
graphic design oriented kind of questions and issues that you need to address.

128
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:48,860
Okay. So when you think about your project assignment to in the final project or

129
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,850
any public health problem that you try to understand from a data perspective,

130
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,930
you should go through these types of steps. Okay.

131
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:07,519
Well, I asked you last week to think about these issues related to a map that you may have found in your you know,

132
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:14,600
in you know, on the Internet or doing some kind of the literature search, literature search about a public health issue.

133
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,220
So let me just go through these items one by one a little bit.

134
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:19,480
Right.

135
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:29,570
So every time you set up a project, especially for this class, you should you should start with some kind of a question, something you need to answer.

136
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,280
Okay. A research question, programmatic question.

137
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:44,360
Right. So what we were looking at so far with lung cancer mortality, some of the questions that we had in our mind were,

138
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,570
well, what's the, you know, the spatial variation in cancer mortality rates across my state,

139
00:14:51,500 --> 00:15:00,110
which are the high rate counties versus the lower rate counties where our may maybe there are large disparities,

140
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,490
ethnic or socioeconomic disparities in lung cancer mortality.

141
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,490
In my state, the data we had could you could use to answer those questions at least 20 years.

142
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,410
Right. So those you should be driven by some question.

143
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:24,649
All right. And then once you develop a question, you can develop a set of variables that you will need information about to answer that question.

144
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:29,570
Right. So what's the variability in lung cancer mortality in Michigan?

145
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:37,280
Well, I need variables about lung cancer mortality rates by men, women, black men, black women, etc.

146
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,790
Right. Maybe it's been socioeconomic status issue.

147
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:51,080
So maybe need information on maybe county level education rates or unemployment rates or any other indicator of this,

148
00:15:51,410 --> 00:16:00,800
or preferably an index like the socioeconomic position index that the Krieger article talked about in the unit of analysis.

149
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:06,260
And so the unit of analysis in the lung cancer mortality data was an individual.

150
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,840
Okay. Because the data come from an individual's experience with lung cancer.

151
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:19,530
So that's the unit of analysis. But we aggregated that unit up to counties.

152
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,420
Right. Because we had county level rates. So the geographic unit for the analysis is the county.

153
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:35,720
Same with the 10th census data. The people that had household information, the unit of analysis there is the household.

154
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,150
Right. That's all for getting the the most basic unit of information from.

155
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,890
And then we aggregated that up to the county and then time frame.

156
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:52,850
We were looking at the time of 2000 to 2000 for the let's see you ask that same question now.

157
00:16:53,510 --> 00:17:02,989
Your time frame should be more contemporaneous. Right. So you need to find data that's more recent so you can be more effective in communicating

158
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:08,090
with your stakeholders about lung cancer mortality issues in your specific region.

159
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:19,220
So when you think about your projects, break it down into these five basic concepts question variables, units of analysis and time frame.

160
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:27,950
Okay. So this is your homework, right? So did anybody find a map for and kind of think this stuff through it all?

161
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,170
If you did. How about you send it to me via email right now?

162
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:41,260
If you have an electronic copy of it and I'll pull it up and then we can take a look together and kind of go through the question.

163
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,640
Variable unit of analysis in. Geographic timeframe.

164
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,810
Of that specific map. Okay.

165
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:58,980
So I'll give you maybe a minute to send me that email and I'll just go through the first few that I get and we can discuss those together.

166
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,250
Let me know if somebody sent one so I know to expect more.

167
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:51,420
You certainly look good. It's still arriving.

168
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:59,310
I should have asked you to do this before, but. There you go.

169
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:10,080
Jean, thank you for sending. And all right, so this is the map we're looking at.

170
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:18,180
So let's go through each of these bullet points in reference to this map.

171
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:24,300
So, Jane, from your perspective, what question is this map trying to answer?

172
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:34,290
So I think now that progress is made on turns, it's sort of going over state by state what the policies are for, like how restrictive.

173
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,590
It's now sort of been turned over to the states to decide how they want to restrict abortion access.

174
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,160
Great. So living in a little more sustainable,

175
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:53,550
you could say what are state level variations and restrictiveness restrictive policies related to abortion or something like that?

176
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,450
Excellent. So what type of variables do you need to answer that question?

177
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:10,200
So I think if you're just looking at this list, the statewide policies or the laws that they have passed in the past,

178
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:16,400
and then actually if you click on the states, you can also get I think they provide census information.

179
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,620
They provide demographic information about the state, especially like women of reproductive age.

180
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,300
And then I think how much they're covered by insurance.

181
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:30,900
And then also, you have a place for you can get abortions in the state and how far on average people live from.

182
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,030
Excellent. So they give you a bit more information about each state.

183
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,090
But let's think about this simple math first.

184
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:45,630
Now, you said you need the variable, this policy. Let's let's be a little more specific about that.

185
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:58,320
So if you needed to create this variable about restrictiveness of policies, you said the policies are the variable.

186
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,459
But what would you really need to do to develop the analytic variable?

187
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,600
You need to create this map. I guess he's probably try to create like.

188
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,629
Or something like that. Yeah, very restrictive too.

189
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:18,810
Not at all restrictive or even protected. So what period of time they restrict abortion?

190
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,470
Like how many clinics there might be available in the state? Things like that.

191
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:29,400
So first, you need a kind of a definition that's relating to each of these beings, as you call them, each of these categories.

192
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:42,530
Then you probably need to read the policy or some digest of that policy, a brief about the policy so you can put each state into specific ban.

193
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,020
So that's a lot of actual work you've got to read.

194
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:55,020
You know, historically, probably 50 different sets of policies around abortion and then developed this one variable,

195
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,050
which looks like seven categories here. All right.

196
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,630
Great. So it's a lot more work than just having a variable like this.

197
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,200
Luckily, these guys have done the job. So what's the unit of analysis here in.

198
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,420
In this map? The states?

199
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:18,480
Yeah, I think you're right. It is the states, because it's really the policies at the state level.

200
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,910
And that's the most basic unit that you're getting this data from.

201
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,290
Right. And what's the geographic location?

202
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:37,400
Okay, great. And then what's the timeframe? Since Roe was overturned, so has.

203
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:47,900
It tells you here it's it's as of 12 yet 20 September 26th yesterday.

204
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:53,710
So they're really updating these maps because this is like changing all the time right now.

205
00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:03,430
Right. Because a lot of court decisions and constitutional changes might be occurring in the state constitutions and so forth.

206
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:12,559
GREENE So if you wanted to get as contemporaneous data about these things as possible, if this was ten years old,

207
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:19,460
it would be kind of a moot discussion because we had a federal kind of law about birth versus, well, excellent.

208
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:25,730
Let's see if there's another minute somebody sent anybody else sentimental can.

209
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:30,410
Isabel. Isabella. Great. Let's look at this map.

210
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,490
What are we looking at here? So what's the question this map is trying to answer?

211
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:44,030
Two areas with the highest population density have the greatest number.

212
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,429
I know. That's okay. Okay.

213
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:55,020
So it looks like it's reporting a percentage of diagnosed diabetes.

214
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,280
Uh. Uh, I'm not sure.

215
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,930
Oh, and then relative to the national average.

216
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:12,350
Right. Okay. So maybe it's talking about what is the variation,

217
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:22,760
geographic variation in diabetes diagnoses at the county level relative to the national average prevalence of diabetes.

218
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:30,560
Okay, great. And so what's the what are the variables you need to create this type of, um,

219
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:39,980
diabetes diagnosis from our demographic backgrounds so we have a different age groups, uh, different ethnic backgrounds, gender.

220
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,810
It says on the report. Yeah. Yeah.

221
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:50,510
But let's think of just about the map, because the map is a limited set of information relative to the details in the report,

222
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:55,570
which talks about maybe ethnic breakdown of the rates and so forth.

223
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:02,990
For this map, what do you what kind of variables do you need to create this myth that the cases are.

224
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:10,280
Yeah. Or maybe just the percent of diabetes or county.

225
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:14,690
All right. Or the cases. If you have the cases, you need two variables.

226
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:24,620
You need the cases with the denominator, the number of people who are in the who are who may be exposed, for example.

227
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:34,550
Right. So you need two variables, but you need some third information to what other variable or piece of information do you need to calculate this,

228
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,040
which is the US average rate.

229
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,680
Right. Um, so then you would create a new variable like this.

230
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:55,960
This is less than the average rate. About the same as the average rate, a little higher or even greater than the Texas average.

231
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,770
And then guess Texas maybe has a high rate already relative to the United States.

232
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:09,409
So breaking this down into those components will help you go find the data you need to really create the analytic variable.

233
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:13,219
You need to answer this question. Right. Okay.

234
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:18,020
So what's the unit of analysis here? Mm hmm. I thought it was individual.

235
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,460
Yeah, it's the individual person. Um, afflicted with diabetes.

236
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,820
Great. And the geographic unit here is these counties.

237
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,230
Yes. And what's the time frame? Can we tell?

238
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:36,740
2015. 2015. That's when we did our thing.

239
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:42,710
Okay, great. Great. All right, let's look at maybe just look at one more.

240
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:51,110
I'm going to pick neck. And it's similar where it it's on page ten.

241
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,370
Yeah. All right. So that's a little bit smaller. Okay, I can zoom in.

242
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:11,920
For better. Sorry about that.

243
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,530
I have problems with the description. Here it is.

244
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,360
Okay. So what are we looking at here?

245
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,430
What? What question is this trying to answer?

246
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:37,530
This is a map looking at the number of, like, affordable and livable housing units for people of extremely low income, specifically renters.

247
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:44,390
And it's actually it says 2013 has an acronym data from 2011, 12 and 13% per year.

248
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:52,220
All right. For your. And then it's looking at units per 100 households that might.

249
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:59,230
I think it's broken down probably in the counties. Okay.

250
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:03,910
So can you summarize that into a question that you may want to answer?

251
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:20,920
Are there enough affordable and available and livable units to rent for those who need them and are within the category of the stream?

252
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:25,719
Okay, great, great. We will try to be a little more specific.

253
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:34,299
Maybe you could say you may want to add some statement about geographic variation in all your questions if it's if it's applicable.

254
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,820
But it seems like it will be for this class. Right?

255
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:52,090
What's the geographic distribution or variation in affordable, adequate and available housing units for extremely low income renters?

256
00:28:53,130 --> 00:29:00,910
Okay. So you want to look at that across the United States of America in the year 2011 to 2013, if that's the type of.

257
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,250
Okay. So what, what variables you need to or variables do you need to make this math?

258
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:12,200
So there are a lot of them from when I was looking at them.

259
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:19,379
So first of all, you need the population information for each of the counties and then additional

260
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,720
information on how many of the people within those counties qualify as extremely.

261
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,560
And then you'd need rental prices across the entire county.

262
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:36,410
And then the only thing that I wasn't sure about is housing quality.

263
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:45,480
The therefore, I wasn't sure exactly what like they have in measuring housing quality versus unlike unlivable.

264
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:52,320
And then you also need like rental information. So there's this only available housing units.

265
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:57,390
So it doesn't it doesn't include ones that are being rented currently.

266
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:04,590
So it's only like ones that are on the market and then fit with the criteria of where.

267
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:13,140
Be for this population group. And I believe that that is all that I have written now.

268
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:21,870
So you need some kind of information about the population economic status so you can count how many people are allowed here.

269
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:30,560
And then you need probably some information of all rental units in the United States of America and for each rental unit you need.

270
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:35,460
Is it adequate? I don't know what that means, but some definition of adequate for that rent.

271
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:38,700
Is it affordable? So below a certain price point.

272
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,480
And if it's available or not available. All right.

273
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:48,450
And once you have that, you can count how many fit the category of adequate, affordable, available.

274
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:55,590
And then you divide that number by per 100 yearly to get analytic variable that you can measure.

275
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:00,420
So it looks like you need a lot of complex data to generate a simple map like this.

276
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:06,210
Right. And great. So these are the kinds of exercises I would like you guys to go through,

277
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:11,510
thinking about the first and second assignment and then finally about your final paper, right.

278
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,310
To break it down like this.

279
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:20,910
Like what is the actual pieces of information I need to create, the variables I need that I ultimately will map and analyze and so forth.

280
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,170
Excellent. Any questions or comments or thoughts?

281
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,830
Okay. Great. Nice work on the homework.

282
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:37,950
I really appreciate that. That's awesome. That's all right.

283
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,739
So just thinking about, you know, where do you get this data? Right.

284
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:52,320
So some of the examples that we heard here so far, right, we learn about abortion policies at the state level.

285
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,710
Right. So it doesn't fall into any of these categories here.

286
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:05,070
So as you can tell, there's a universe of data that are not listed here that you will be reporting for public health work that we talked about,

287
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,700
extremely low income renters that you can probably get from the US census data.

288
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:19,770
We talked about diabetes cases that comes from disease registry data.

289
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:28,410
Right. You probably have a state level registry for diabetes that you can access that type of information for from for Texas.

290
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:35,309
We had information on rental issues and things like that.

291
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:39,630
So that might be related to issues around resources such as housing.

292
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:50,310
Okay. So just to give you an idea that to create a map and then, yes, you have to pull data in from multiple, multiple places.

293
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:58,020
And these are just examples of some places you can start looking at information for information that might be related to your interests.

294
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,979
But these are all basically most of these are national level data.

295
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,820
Right. But these can be boiled down to local information as well.

296
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:16,290
So birth records, divorce, marriage records, death records, cancers registries, vaccination registries, things like that.

297
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:25,110
Disease registries for major chronic diseases are places where you can get some of the data you may need health surveillance data from.

298
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:34,620
These are surveillance of mostly behavioral and also health outcomes like the National Health Survey.

299
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:40,620
But in Haines, which is more nutrition oriented behavioral risk factor surveillance system,

300
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:46,949
the risk vector risk behavior surveillance system, the National Immunization Survey.

301
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:55,140
And there's so many others. Right. So there's a lot of places where you can get the data you may need.

302
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:04,740
Another important source is census, and that's one of the main sources of the denominator information that you will need for a lot of your work,

303
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:11,430
but also to characterize demographically the areas that you will like to understand.

304
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:17,040
Right. So census is done to count everybody in the population.

305
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,670
We used to count everybody years ago, but now we sample and we use that sample to generalize to the population.

306
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,500
But that's a basic foundation for population sciences, including public health.

307
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:38,760
And the census has very important resources for public health, and some of them are really related to cartography and mapping.

308
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,940
And those are what the Tiger products are all about in terms of mapping and cartography.

309
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:53,830
The Tiger census products provide boundary data for the United States of America, right?

310
00:34:54,420 --> 00:35:04,080
That includes natural features, administrative boundaries, built environmental features and so forth, and included in Tiger products.

311
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,809
There's a whole host of these types of products.

312
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:14,490
We're going to learn to go to that site and download information about cartography that's related to the work we do.

313
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,920
And then there's the. So these are the feature class data, the Tiger products, right?

314
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:29,400
The boundary and things that you put on a map. And then the census attribute data can also be downloaded and examined online.

315
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,510
Right. The the the the data website for the Census Bureau.

316
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:43,440
Okay. So go to those links and check out that stuff. But we're going to go to them in class, not today, but coming up.

317
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:48,690
And part of your homework will be to explore census data for a state of your choice.

318
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:57,900
So the census, I don't know if you guys know this, but we have two programs within the census to develop census information for

319
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:04,590
the country and in all countries in the world have census is that they do.

320
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,049
So if you're interested in other regions of the world,

321
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:18,620
it's important to learn how they collect census data and share census data with the civil society and other stakeholders in the United States.

322
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:25,590
We have something called the ACS call. It's the American Community Survey and the decennial census.

323
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:36,650
So about. I think it was ten years ago that this country decided that decennial census was great, but it's not timely.

324
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:41,450
So the American Community Survey was developed, right?

325
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:52,010
So the American unit serves a continuous survey. It's going on all the time, every day, maybe for the holidays and every year.

326
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:56,360
Right. And then the decennial census happens every ten years, of course.

327
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:07,880
So the next one will be in 2003. So the data is is an average characteristic over a certain time period.

328
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,510
So usually you can get that three year estimates,

329
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:17,450
meaning they use three years of survey data to generate an average for a specific area in the country.

330
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,470
They're five year estimates which are even better and have more coverage in the country.

331
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,920
And then you can go to the ten year estimates, which are the decennial.

332
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:33,010
Well, they're not ten year estimates a specific time. So in 2030, this is what the country looks like it will look like or 2020.

333
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:40,640
Right. So often that X is ongoing annual in the decennial census.

334
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:48,829
How many households are surveyed? 11 million households are surveyed over five years in the U.S. and the decennial census,

335
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:56,420
we took it take a sample of 18 million households in a single year and complete that right and sampling error.

336
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:05,280
So as you can imagine, you have many fewer households in the U.S. so you have much more error in that data.

337
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:12,290
So the standard errors for any estimate you get are going to be wider than the decennial census, but it's more timely.

338
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:24,080
Okay. So many times people will record x data unless they have a research question that lands at the period of the decennial census.

339
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,020
Then you can use the decennial census data. Okay.

340
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:35,510
So the way that this country is organized, not all countries are organized like this are lots of variations.

341
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:46,210
But the way we've done it in the United States is our census is collected through these geographic kind of entities or hierarchy of entities.

342
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,930
And the main ones are the ones in the center growing here.

343
00:38:51,590 --> 00:39:00,950
And the other offshoots here are how other administrative boundaries interact with the census mean geography.

344
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:06,560
All right. So the great thing you want to kind of understand is this middle line here and other ones are important,

345
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:12,860
depending on the research that you doing on a program you're trying to understand information about.

346
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:19,730
So the basic issue is a census block is the smallest unit of geography in the census.

347
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:28,220
You really usually can't get block level data in the census because that would reveal something about an individual,

348
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:31,700
because there's only about 80 or so households within a block.

349
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:39,770
So then the aggregate blocks into two block groups, you can get block group data many times, but not for all variables.

350
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:44,240
And then you have census tracts which are aggregates of block groups,

351
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:52,250
and then you have counties, states, divisions, regions, and the whole country as a whole.

352
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:59,700
Okay. And then this class, you can work with almost any of these geographies, right?

353
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:05,960
But a lot of times we'll download data about census tracts and counties and states.

354
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:12,830
Now, step two. So once you get the data, you have to manage the data.

355
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:20,720
Sometimes part of data management into this, in addition to merging and cleaning the data,

356
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,240
more spatially oriented data management issues might be unique to geo reference data,

357
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:32,480
meaning that if you have a piece of data, you may not have it spatially referenced.

358
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:38,239
Maybe you have an address or something like that.

359
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:48,290
But you you could reference some some did all data to a geographic location that's geo referencing geocoding.

360
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:58,760
Usually that word is used to send you to turn address information into not long information or

361
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:07,880
some kind of a coordinate on the on the planet or so turn addresses into points on the planet.

362
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:15,620
That's what geocoding refers to. So you can do geo putting the U.S. in many parts of the world, but places like India,

363
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:19,339
we can't really do geo putting well because the address system is so complex.

364
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:27,200
That NGO processing, we did some of that in class like you took the selection by attribute.

365
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:32,120
And you took away your states counties from the rest of the country.

366
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:42,020
Right. So that was doing some sort of geo processing to select out features and then creating a new layer out of that.

367
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,890
So you can do that query select clipping.

368
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:50,839
You can cut part of the feature in half.

369
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,070
Like if you only interested in half of a county, for example, you could do that.

370
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,560
Buffers will work with buffers.

371
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:05,150
And I could say, you know, within a thousand meters of schools, you can't sell drugs or alcohol or tobacco or anything like that.

372
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:10,310
So you can create buffers around schools on a map and see if that's actually happening in some places.

373
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:20,270
And you can do joins will do some of that today where you're joining two sets of features together,

374
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:24,020
where you're joining attribute data to feature data.

375
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:31,670
We'll do that today if you get time. Okay. So that's all called geo processing and it's part of data management and preparation.

376
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:40,550
And this part can be a lot of work and sometimes it's a headache, but it's okay, you will get through it.

377
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,370
So yeah, in terms of attribute data, we talked about spatial did a little bit here.

378
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:54,830
You can merge and reduce the data set somehow, right? You will get rid of extraneous information, bring couple of data sets together.

379
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:59,000
You can create new variables, great concrete rates.

380
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:03,590
Let's see, you have the count of something over the population size.

381
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,120
You can create rates.

382
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:14,270
You should create age adjusted rates if you're switching, if you're looking at disease outcomes because those are all or mortality outcomes,

383
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:19,879
these really need to be adjusted by age because that's so driven by the older you are and you know,

384
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,690
creating variables like we discussed about this few examples in class so far.

385
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:28,490
Okay. So that's part of data management. And then you do data analysis.

386
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:39,350
One of the common things you could think about is do spatial units or features clustered together in a in a nonrandom way,

387
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:47,630
or are they dispersed in a non randomly? So the question is, are the data distributed randomly across geographic space?

388
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,830
That's what you do in spatial clustering or dispersal analysis.

389
00:43:52,520 --> 00:44:00,050
We talked about network analysis a little bit, at least some of our students did in the readings where we looked at the flow of

390
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:06,979
something down in network many times this is look at river flow through a river system.

391
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:15,170
That's what it was developed for. But now we could use that to find the shortest distance between point in point B over road network, right.

392
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:22,850
And spatial regression is looking at the same similar to regression for that

393
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:26,900
you may have learned already instead where you're looking at maybe individuals

394
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:31,519
and outcome and what factors are associated with that outcome here you can do

395
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,470
that spatially to see if there is a relationship between a spatial variable,

396
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:49,640
a in a spatial variable. B And the reason we use were spatial is because you have to account for spatial clustering when you do spatial regression.

397
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:57,320
So in this class, we're going to really do number one, we're not going to get to network analysis or spatial analysis.

398
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:03,980
We're going to do a lot of work around clustering and dispersion, which includes proximity, analysis and so forth.

399
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:12,410
Okay. And then you visualize finally, when you get all that stuff done, you start visualizing the data, you create maps,

400
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:22,370
you create graphics, graphs, tables, you write a report, you do a presentation, you write a blog entry, whatever it is.

401
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:34,010
So visualization, mapping and presentation is the last step and I guess provided this link here.

402
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:42,709
So you can just take a look at some of the CBC map gallery that they have just to get some ideas about maps that people create.

403
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:50,030
And the CDC has developed a repository to maybe, you know, get your juices flowing or something like that.

404
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:55,880
So take a look at that map at your leisure. All right.

405
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:06,110
Any questions about these steps? Simple, but I think involve a lot of thinking and work to actually accomplish the mission.

406
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:10,700
And that's the point I want to get through. No, I would appreciate you going through the steps.

407
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:15,560
One, two, three, four. When you do your projects in this class or any class for that matter.

408
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,840
All right. Okay.

409
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:25,250
So let's do some lab work. Did you guys get a break?

410
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:30,200
We can do some lab work and then we'll take a break. Right. It's only been 40.

411
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:39,770
50. Yeah. Let's do some lab work. Oh, look at this moment, we don't need to look at Erica's proof of lab activity.

412
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:45,919
Ten. You don't actually even need the lab folder yet.

413
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:52,910
But you know what? I would suggest you download it and open it into your onto your computer, and let's do that together.

414
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:57,110
Because I know maybe we forget how this is done sometimes.

415
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:06,740
So we go to modules, get the zip file, the download the zip file.

416
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:18,140
I just see, you know, showing folder is a nice way to to get the look at the zip file.

417
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:33,710
There it is in right click on it and you can see extract all and I want to place it in my C draw.

418
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:41,680
Card holder and extra.

419
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:50,340
So I've added some data to it. So it's getting bigger as the class goes on.

420
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:56,970
There's replace. Yes, they should have deleted the existing file, but I think we should be open.

421
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:12,150
All right. So if you look at your C drive, you should see this file and check that it is the correct one, if it is.

422
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:19,380
All right. Okay. So we have that there. But for this lab activity, you're going to go to this website.

423
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:28,920
You can just type in Google. You can type the cancer profiles.

424
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:44,510
And they should talk to. Surrounded by activity.

425
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:55,600
Okay. So the first one that pops up here and then you see the whole country map here.

426
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:03,190
So you can go to each state and select the state of your interest because you can get it from the dropdown menu.

427
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,160
We're going to be interested in Michigan.

428
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:16,340
So click on the Michigan part of the map and it will take you to a table that shows all you know, all the different cancer settings.

429
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,610
Right. Breast, brain, bladder, cervix, etc.

430
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:26,470
And then you have down here lung and bronchus, which is what we're most interested in.

431
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:34,270
And this gives you the the Michigan rate, the U.S. rate and the table, etc.

432
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:41,560
Okay. So we're interested in this is the incidence rate of the cancer.

433
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,800
Right. We're interested in mortality.

434
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:58,059
So let's go to the mortality tab. You notice you see all the different information about each side of cancer and you get, you know,

435
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:07,570
other information like historical trends, five year reaching comparison by cancer and by area.

436
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,940
If you go up, you can change the state.

437
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:22,510
Right. So what we're going to do is we're going to go to this pink table icon right next to for lung bronchus.

438
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:27,650
There's a table here. So let's click on view table. Okay.

439
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:36,319
Yeah. Yeah. So look at the table headings.

440
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:42,140
You know, it tells you the county name they didn't meet the healthy people objective.

441
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:49,430
And what's the age adjusted death rate for lung cancer in that state?

442
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:55,460
What's the contribution confidence interval? What's the the count, the number of deaths?

443
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,600
What's the trend? Is it falling or rising in that county?

444
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:06,049
And what's the five year trend? Okay, if people left, that's kind of interesting.

445
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:15,050
You can get data by you know, by county or health service area and change the cancer site.

446
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:20,330
You can get it by different race group. Right now we're just looking at all races.

447
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:26,660
You get male or female data, age breakdown, etc.

448
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:31,400
All right. So we're we're going to just do is we're going to export the table we're looking at.

449
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:38,900
So we're our number seven click the export data link this one.

450
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:47,899
And once you export that data, you'll see a death that fills the file pop up at the bottom.

451
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:54,710
If you're using Chrome, you can open that up.

452
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:07,110
Take a look at the secret. Take a. Yes.

453
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:16,769
It gives you a table. Having the time frame and the data in the same information is on the table and this is sorted by rate.

454
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:20,020
It says that the high street is at the top.

455
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:30,560
Okay. And you can save this file to file, save errors and put it in your.

456
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:46,080
But the grouse. Put it in the C drive HP Cheese 66 lab.

457
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:54,900
My idea is files and data and you can call it I go to Michigan, get that 50.

458
00:52:56,890 --> 00:53:05,920
Sit right. Keep using that format if you get that dialog box to see us.

459
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:11,230
So take a few moments to explore this website.

460
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:19,100
You may be interested in other cancer data. So I see confused faces.

461
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:25,870
What's going on? Couple of people. This might be my computer only, but it won't open the Excel file.

462
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:31,310
It says that there's no memory left on the computer. That's okay.

463
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:37,140
We have a bunch of things open or no. I mean, this is the only thing that doesn't sell.

464
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:43,300
But it also won't let me open the start time to look at all the other stuff that I am.

465
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:48,240
I see you abandoned that computer. Luckily, people are missing, so you could just switch.

466
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:52,950
Yeah. And you haven't done too much in this file that I asked you to download.

467
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,720
I provided it already in the lab folder, just in case you have this problem.

468
00:53:56,730 --> 00:54:01,530
Okay. Yeah. Just shut down and turn on another computer.

469
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:06,990
So just take about maybe 5 minutes to explore the website.

470
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:10,380
Okay, check it out. What other data are there?

471
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:18,240
Check out what's going on in this table. If you're interested in, think about other cancer sites.

472
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:27,780
Some of the most common cancers are breast cancer, cervical cancer, um, prostate cancer, lung cancer.

473
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:35,500
Those are the most common cancers in the country. Okay, just take a look.

474
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:41,320
Maybe want to download a couple of other cancer site data, go for it just to play around here.

475
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:47,040
Maybe you want to look at the same database and look at it for black blacks versus whites.

476
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:51,710
Could do that for a few seconds and then we'll go to number 11.

477
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:22,180
It's if you go to about this is a nice place to go to is tells you you know a little bit about where the data are coming from.

478
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:27,280
Right. This they're screening information in this website.

479
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:38,650
So those data are from the behavior risk factor surveillance system and incidence data are from the National Cancer Institute, its SERE program.

480
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:52,400
And. Okay. There are also some data on cancer, tobacco or non smoking laws, etc.

481
00:55:56,660 --> 00:56:26,930
So I don't know. Is there. You can even get demographic data from this website at the county and H.S. level, right?

482
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:32,260
So some major demographic variables are provided.

483
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:49,890
Yeah. It perfect.

484
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:39,900
She? Okay.

485
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:50,430
So, you know, you browse the website, take a look at it, at your leisure, at home to understand it better.

486
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:54,660
And there's more information than just mortality data here.

487
00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:03,540
And there's also some census data provided in this website. So you don't necessarily have to go to the census to get some census information.

488
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:07,500
You can get it directly through here, which is really nice. Okay.

489
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:13,110
So the next web, what's going to add activity number 11?

490
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:20,520
For that, we are going to use ArcGIS Pro. So start that program and then it load up.

491
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:32,220
And for this activity, we're just learning to create a dual database.

492
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:41,160
When you create a project map project, the next year's person automatically creates a geo database for you for that project.

493
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:50,760
Sometimes you want to create another one to organize your data, or you just want to have a few database that you're working,

494
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:56,370
populating and creating and populating, and you're not really working on a map project.

495
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:03,480
So you can do this work. I did something.

496
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:51,900
Okay. So everybody at this page, somebody is not just raise your hand or wait a second or two.

497
00:59:54,180 --> 01:00:02,600
So let's open up a new template and oh, right here, start with that.

498
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:10,130
A template. Okay. And so just create a project without saving it or naming it.

499
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:14,400
You can name it at the end of this activity.

500
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:21,950
So it's really easy to create a duty to believe in. ArcGIS Pro Okay.

501
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:27,650
You will need to work with the catalog pane. So that opens up right here.

502
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:38,070
If it didn't open up for you for some reason, you can open up that pane by going to view and you can click on catalog pane and they will appear.

503
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:45,570
One thing to note is if you want to use that, if you want it to pin this pane,

504
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:52,230
you can use this button which says a little pin here and it will minimize.

505
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:59,580
If you push X, it disappear. So you have to go to view and select catalog thing.

506
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:03,630
If you just want to pin it for later use, you can do that. Okay.

507
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:10,320
All right. So let's create a geo database. So what you can do is go to databases here.

508
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,790
There's one created automatically the default view database in your system.

509
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:25,470
But we're going to create our own. So right click on databases and go to new file your database.

510
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:33,010
And you can place that new found your database in your.

511
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:41,960
Who? My guys files folder in the C drive.

512
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:52,010
And. Okay.

513
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,920
You can put it in data, but, you know, we're going to create a whole project after this actually,

514
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:01,450
so we can put it in projects instead of notes as data in the text.

515
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:12,249
But just put it here and we can call this what I want you to call cancer profiles and your name just so we can

516
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:28,870
distinguish cancer or find or find something you like and mark your name and just say so a new GIO database was created.

517
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:33,340
All right, easy now let's populated with something.

518
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:40,750
So let's be downloaded this data from state cancer profiles right for Michigan the death rates.

519
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:48,100
Let's add that information to this new database. So right click on the new GIO database.

520
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:53,950
You just created an import, and what we're importing is a table, okay?

521
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:58,030
Not a feature class or class is just one table.

522
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:02,739
So it's become table. And where is this input rows.

523
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:07,480
You should have a new pane that shows a due process info on the right hand side.

524
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:24,850
Uh, click on the browse button and find that my death data, which should be in this C drive 5066 lab, I think you put it in data, right?

525
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:29,200
Yeah. Okay.

526
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:36,040
Go. And you should name it.

527
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:39,730
And my dad, if it's not already name that, that's fine.

528
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:47,050
And once you name the outfit mean you can do run this little procedure?

529
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:52,120
It tells you it's running when it's done. It gives you a little green checkbox if it's done.

530
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:57,340
Okay. And you can just ignore some of these dialog boxes.

531
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:09,910
And let's go to our. The catalog pane and you could see that the table is now in your view, database.

532
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:18,370
Okay. If you don't see it there, you can right click on the geo database and push refresh and it should come up.

533
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:31,480
Right. And you can actually take a look at it by clicking it and go open table.

534
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:43,860
And if you open up the table. Now, one, you're seeing problems already.

535
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:52,110
Probably this is what you see. It's because the data table we downloaded it had all this information at the top, right.

536
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:57,209
That's not really organized like a data set should be organized that you should

537
01:04:57,210 --> 01:05:03,180
have variable names at the top and each the first row should be variable names.

538
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:07,410
And the second the first column should be all the features.

539
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:16,470
Right. So because of the way the data were set up, you have all these null values and problem issues in the table.

540
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:20,730
So we're going to correct that. Okay. You're going to correct that problem.

541
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:25,020
So let's move. Well, before we do that, let's save this.

542
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:35,250
I ask you to see. Right. So you can if you go to project, you can say save and you can put it in.

543
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:46,380
At age 50 626 chlamydia in the projects and called his cancer profile.

544
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:53,000
You're in New York State. All right.

545
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:56,310
You can close this at my death up.

546
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:02,610
And, you know, we're probably going to delete it later because it's kind of useless at the moment

547
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:07,680
because we just learned to process that data and clean it before we can actually use it.

548
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:11,710
So just right click and delete it. Yes.

549
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:18,840
So what we're going to do is in lab activity 12, we're going to process that tabular data.

550
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:26,310
So let's go back to the data you downloaded.

551
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:31,640
Okay. This one is in my.

552
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:34,890
Yes, this is fine. Okay.

553
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:55,500
I think. Okay.

554
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,980
Somehow it closed. So I'm just going to open it up again.

555
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:09,020
I think you guys saved it into. My ideas for data.

556
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:18,450
Okay. So looking at the file, there's another copy of it in the other data folder in the main folder.

557
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:21,870
If you didn't get the chance to download it. Okay.

558
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:28,980
So what's going on here is there's all this extraneous information that we need to delete to make it usable.

559
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:34,530
So all this stuff at the top is not something our guys can read.

560
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:38,910
So we want to delete the top eight rows of information.

561
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:43,680
Okay. So you can select those rows, right click and delete them.

562
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:51,120
So the top the first row in any data table for x pro should be the variable names.

563
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:57,790
Okay. The second thing is we don't need rows two and three because that's Michigan.

564
01:07:57,810 --> 01:08:01,830
All of Michigan that follow the US data, we don't we're not looking at that.

565
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:06,300
We're looking at county level data. Okay. So we can delete those two rows.

566
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:18,930
All right. And if you go down in the data set, you'll see there's all this footer information that's causing problems to us.

567
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:28,410
So you should delete all of that information. So go from row 85, 210 and delete all of that stuff.

568
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:38,900
Okay. And the next thing it says is for Pee wee LA County.

569
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:47,000
There are all these asterisks here. Asterisks are things that our kids can't read.

570
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:50,960
So you just want to delete the actors and leave it blank.

571
01:08:51,140 --> 01:09:00,770
Because those are basically if you read the footers and those are numbers that are too small to report for privacy issues.

572
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:06,950
Okay. And when it says three or fewer, well, that column of data should be numeric information only.

573
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:14,240
So just turned up to three. Okay. Right.

574
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:27,830
And you can scroll back, can scroll back up. And there's also extraneous data here that we don't really want to analyze so we can delete some columns.

575
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:34,130
So there's a list of columns here. I said you should do delete c f g h i l m n.

576
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:54,800
Okay. So you can use control and select c e f g i l and pro and then right click and delete those.

577
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:05,750
They did something wrong. Then do it again. See? Yeah.

578
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:19,390
Yeah. Okay.

579
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:26,470
So you should have only for the the.

580
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:37,069
Two should be talking. Okay. The other thing to notice is that the names of these variables,

581
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:44,150
some of them are problematic because here we have spaces and we have parentheses and brackets.

582
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:51,140
All righty. Has propane handle it? Okay. So you need to change the name.

583
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:56,390
So what I've done is just turn everything into lowercase to keep it all the same.

584
01:10:57,170 --> 01:11:07,639
So you could change county to load this county FIPS, to just replace this and adjusted that 3 to 1.

585
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:13,130
Do they say their death rate one word? Okay, that's very common word.

586
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:24,170
No spaces and no special characters. Average count could be even death and deaths.

587
01:11:26,570 --> 01:11:35,900
Recent trend you can just turn to trend. Okay, so now the variable names are something that actually has four can handle.

588
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:45,680
The other thing you want to do is I'm thinking forward now that I know that my county feature class data

589
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:51,380
from the census were the names that county it doesn't have the word county in the name of the county,

590
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:58,040
but here we have the word county everywhere. So you need to delete all those counties, the word county.

591
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:08,390
Okay, so you can select the column and go to this find and select and say replace.

592
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:11,120
And you want to replace,

593
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:20,090
you want to put a space and then Ford County Capital sees you and you are because there's a space after Schoolcraft Space County.

594
01:12:20,690 --> 01:12:27,080
So you want to delete that space as well because it has to match exactly with what the census file has in it.

595
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:33,440
Right. Because I know in the census why there's no space after the county name and you replace it with nothing.

596
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:43,110
You just put replace all. You should see that 83 replacements were made okay and close.

597
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:50,180
So now all the county, the word county are out of this home computer.

598
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:58,250
The other thing is that each column has to have a specific format.

599
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:04,520
So text has to be a text field. Numeric has to be a numeric field.

600
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:12,620
So county is a text field. So in Excel it's called string field.

601
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:21,140
In Excel is called text. You turn into text. This should be a text field too, although those are numbers.

602
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:32,810
If you use it for joining, it should be a text. That field is a numeric field, so you're going to appear with a general and change it to numbers.

603
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:42,980
Average death is also numeric. You can change it to number and then trend is that string so you can change it to text.

604
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:48,710
Now this file is something else can read.

605
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:57,230
Okay, so this is the kind of stuff you have to do when you start processing your data that you found.

606
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:01,610
Okay, so we're done with step three.

607
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:07,280
We did step forward just now and now you can save this file in exit.

608
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:12,320
So you can just say, yeah, say yes, keep the format.

609
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:18,900
Yes. Yes.

610
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:22,320
Please share some features.

611
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:30,990
Do you want to keep using the thing that you're. You know, it's taking more.

612
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:46,290
No. All right. So this is called, I think it correctly.

613
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:56,070
Okay. So now what we should do is we should add this table into our GIO database we created in the previous lab activity.

614
01:14:56,070 --> 01:15:06,030
Right? So in the catalog pane in our years pro, we still have the state cancer profile project up there.

615
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:11,550
If you have the old table in your cancer profile for your database,

616
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:18,300
you can delete that table by right clicking on it because we're going to add the new table now.

617
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:24,720
So right click on cancer profile your database and.

618
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:42,060
Well, one thing I didn't do. I didn't name the the fault correctly, but that's okay.

619
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:53,100
You can still import go to import tables in the lab activity and call it an Excel file.

620
01:15:54,750 --> 01:16:00,330
But it's not an Excel file to CSV file and it doesn't have the last four characters.

621
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:06,660
So the import rule is this. Am I dead?

622
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:10,830
CC push. Okay. Well output main.

623
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:16,190
That's right. I'll put name my death and it can be more specific.

624
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:20,700
Right. It's got zero from 2015 to 2019.

625
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:24,990
Good. If you put that in the output me in push run.

626
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:37,260
Okay. So if you look at the catalog pane again, you should have this new table up here.

627
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:45,270
And if you want to view it, you can right click on the table and go to open table.

628
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:51,030
And now this looks a little better, right? There's no no values.

629
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:55,830
It's organized, as you would expect, the data set to be organized.

630
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,700
So this worked. Okay.

631
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:05,860
Now the next step is, well, I have the attribute data.

632
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:10,800
I want to link it with my boundary data.

633
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:15,580
Okay. So that's lab activity number 13.

634
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:23,460
So let's do that activity. So this is joining state cancer profile data with count tree shapefile data.

635
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:29,120
Okay. So he's going to use a shape palette. So continue with the last activity.

636
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:33,510
What we're going to do first is you can close out this table if you like,

637
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:43,290
go to the catalog pane and in it can right click on the database cancer profile.

638
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:50,340
Ritesh here. Database view database and import a feature class.

639
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:58,679
So last time we imported a table. So let's look for the feature class that we're interested in.

640
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:09,390
So you put the browse folder button next to input features, you get an input features dialog box and go to each page 666 lakh.

641
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:26,510
Under data there is a census form, so I've downloaded the county street files for all of the country.

642
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:33,470
So these are the county share files, if you notice, as a as HP extension, that's a shape shifter.

643
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:37,140
Okay. So you click on that and just push. Okay.

644
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:42,170
And I'll put name. You could call that. You can name it.

645
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:47,900
What did I say here? US counties. You have the keys.

646
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:53,180
And I got these are the 2019. And these are 2019 counties.

647
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:58,310
And they are temporally aligned somehow with our cancer data.

648
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:11,210
Right. So then you push run everything on the green, you can close up the dialogs and let's go back to the colored thing.

649
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:20,240
And you notice that there is a new feature class here called U.S. Counties 2019.

650
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:27,940
All right. Okay.

651
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:32,090
So now we want to only look at the Michigan counties.

652
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:37,030
Right now we have the whole country's counties and that should shift this feature first.

653
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:41,090
But there is no map in the middle here.

654
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:47,409
So we've got to insert a map before we can start looking at this stuff. So that step is not in the in the lab activities.

655
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:51,070
I'm sorry, but go to insert in this push new map.

656
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:58,700
Insert new map and then a map will pop up in the middle.

657
01:19:59,570 --> 01:20:03,670
You can get rid of that based on base maps here.

658
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:06,320
You can turn them off. I find them to be distracting.

659
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:21,200
So the campaign lets drag over US counties to the contents page and then you see all the counties in the country right here.

660
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:32,780
Okay. You can zoom in if you like. I think my computer is being slow.

661
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,930
It's just about everything. I think so. So, okay, I don't need to zoom in.

662
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:50,820
So what we're going to do is select out the the Michigan counties and then make a new layer for them.

663
01:20:51,240 --> 01:21:00,120
Okay. Just like we did last night. So how do you do that? You go to select by attribute right in the input row.

664
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:03,450
There's only one layer, so we're good there.

665
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:09,150
It's a new selection. What field? I think it's state.

666
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:16,620
This is what we're looking for. State. FP That's the state's FIPS code, it's called.

667
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:22,260
And I know that the FIPS code for Michigan is 26.

668
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:32,129
So you need 26 right here. And if you push it, okay, you'll notice that only the Michigan counties got highlighted in the map.

669
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:35,190
Brett. Everybody there?

670
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:40,320
Yeah. Okay, I can slow down. You guys going to tell me if you're if you're behind?

671
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:45,350
So don't you go on. Where should I go back to? Tell me, please.

672
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:52,010
You got the map up. Okay. And the counties that. Okay, good, good.

673
01:21:52,050 --> 01:22:01,610
So how do you get the map? What we did in the previous activity was get cancer data for Michigan.

674
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:06,720
Right. So now we just want to have the boundaries for Michigan and not the whole country.

675
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:11,220
So we're going to select out just the Michigan counties.

676
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:16,020
So you do that by select that attribute up by a map.

677
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:24,590
Select that attribute. Do I need to go back further for somebody?

678
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:31,030
If you do, it's okay. Don't be embarrassed, because if you speak up, others will be helped as well.

679
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:42,200
I'm sure of it. I think I have no problem implementing roles in putting roles right here that they don't like the previous roles.

680
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:46,850
Okay, so here we are.

681
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:57,560
Okay. How about I take a 2 minutes to to solve these problems in the those people who know how to do selection by attribute?

682
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:03,830
You guys can do that because we did it last time, right? Select by attribute and make a new layer for Michigan.

683
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:10,970
You can follow the text. That's why I need you to give me the script for that.

684
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:21,370
You. Me? And my comment, they want to know what's to remember, right?

685
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:29,240
I'm like, Oh, no, I feel like we did like, I want to treat him like this.

686
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:43,430
For people who love titles, it's not like I can like anywhere in a number of places and I would like to know how.

687
01:23:44,330 --> 01:24:00,840
I'm terrible at watching movies. Like, I was like, you know, I was like I was wondering like, how are you?

688
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:04,630
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know.

689
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:09,970
Yeah. I mean. I mean, I know.

690
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:13,720
I mean, I just do swing how I'm living.

691
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:19,160
I think. I think, like, today.

692
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:30,900
Today. I mean, I, I don't think I was open to any ideas for the last few years.

693
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:40,690
Kind of like improv. Yeah. You know, like those kind of, you know, 26 layers from 25.

694
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:46,710
Her selection, I think is very close.

695
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:53,030
I think she was as good as.

696
01:24:55,470 --> 01:25:03,690
I don't know what they have to tell you right now. I think it is none of your business.

697
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:17,139
So I believe this is good for your political opinion.

698
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:23,610
But between the media, I don't want to capitalize on anything there is oh god.

699
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:30,550
I got 70% journalism like this.

700
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:37,810
I only do. Yeah, I did that. And it was really good.

701
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:47,840
And I was like, yeah, I want to do is I like this, but how do you know?

702
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:59,450
I like this. You know, it doesn't mean it's just that.

703
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:10,910
I know when I was up here, it was a great time and I was like, just.

704
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:14,330
I just think about it for a minute. Just. Just consider.

705
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:23,750
Yeah, come with me. On this journey in life, I mean, I kind of feel like this will be, like, really challenged by that.

706
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:31,700
I mean, if if they want to know how I feel, that makes me feel better.

707
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:42,880
Want why is it different? Which are like 70% sure I know what it means to have, you know, multiple benefits.

708
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:49,490
I've taken seven months in the mood, just in flow.

709
01:26:50,780 --> 01:27:00,740
I mean, it's it's just so like and, you know, it's just like and it's like underwater that way.

710
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:06,170
It's like nothing. But, you know, and then teaching about Excel and all that.

711
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:08,460
And I understand that. And I know, right?

712
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:17,689
Because I know that those people enjoy, you know, so it's not just about as my dad had it when I learned to drive.

713
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:22,270
Yeah. And be like memorized. Yeah.

714
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:27,990
And I Google Maps and literally I'm like, if I don't have my phone, I really don't like it.

715
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:33,920
Know, you know, I know what I like.

716
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:38,510
I have a good sense of direction. I don't like that. And I was just.

717
01:27:38,510 --> 01:27:41,940
I was working late.

718
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:45,830
Yeah, no, I thought I was going to.

719
01:27:46,730 --> 01:27:50,480
I didn't make it. I was like, I really. Maybe not.

720
01:27:53,360 --> 01:28:01,670
Well, this may not be this. Don't know how I think. It's not like I feel like it's all right.

721
01:28:01,930 --> 01:28:08,180
I just feel like play around. I don't know. My family is not in there.

722
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:12,510
So, yeah, I just think it's more just like they still left.

723
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:15,650
It's like there's just, like, you not know about it. Yeah.

724
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:20,770
Oh, okay. Yeah.

725
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:34,310
Oh, yeah. And then you go, you know, it says, make sure you have something so that make this the.

726
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:39,380
Oh yeah I see.

727
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:50,180
Made with the owners which is not, it isn't properties I think probably for believe that everything is impossible for everybody that's.

728
01:28:50,630 --> 01:29:01,650
Oh I think it's just. Taking it all back to the players living on the island this close is actually going to be fatal.

729
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:08,190
So you've got to get an agreement and David, something more.

730
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:16,100
But I think he has to let it run like it has to be. Well, I don't know.

731
01:29:16,730 --> 01:29:33,970
Maybe you. Oh, okay. So, you know, like Radcliffe, that's where you make that distinction early on and then go to make choices that they're not there.

732
01:29:34,330 --> 01:29:41,420
It's like so so there's and there's like so many ways in my life and stuff.

733
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:48,370
Nearly two years later, I find this, like, your day.

734
01:29:48,370 --> 01:29:55,560
And he was like, Make notes for me. And I'm like, I'm like, I can try, but it won't be anything.

735
01:29:55,580 --> 01:30:06,700
No, no, it's. I mean, I think. Okay.

736
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:11,430
I want to hear from your progress.

737
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:17,790
Okay. All right. So I'm going to have some of you guys meet some of your own.

738
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:22,020
So I'm going to continue where I left off. There you go.

739
01:30:23,670 --> 01:30:27,510
Okay. I see people. You want to look. You guys are good.

740
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:32,500
Okay. So I got my feature cluster in here.

741
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:37,440
I got my attribute data in here. The next step is combining those two together.

742
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:45,960
All right. So before we do that, I want to select out the Michigan counties from the counties in all of the US.

743
01:30:46,150 --> 01:31:01,500
So you select by attribute input Roe US counties 2019, you selection from there, meaning which field, state FP Which stands for state.

744
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:06,600
I think there's also a name here, but I think I see the county name actually.

745
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:10,050
The fifth 26 is Michigan. Okay.

746
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:24,990
Okay. And the Michigan counties will be highlighted. So once you get those to be highlighted and you can right click on the layer in

747
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:34,050
the contents pane and go to selection and make layer from selected feature.

748
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:41,730
Okay. So once you click that, a new layer pops up on top with the same name with the word selection at the end of it.

749
01:31:42,670 --> 01:31:47,640
Okay, so if you turn off the bottom layer, you'll just notice that Michigan.

750
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:52,890
Okay. If I zoom in, you can see it's Michigan.

751
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:58,140
I can rename the top layer. So it makes more sense.

752
01:31:58,530 --> 01:32:02,650
You can see right click on it and go to properties and call it.

753
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:10,350
And remember what I said you should call it, but you can come to Michigan Counties 2019.

754
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:15,000
Thank you. And my county's 2019.

755
01:32:21,450 --> 01:32:29,030
Okay. Theory name. Okay.

756
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:32,690
So now you have a new layer to work with.

757
01:32:33,650 --> 01:32:38,060
So the next step is joining that census data with the boundary data.

758
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:43,080
I mean, the death rate data with the boundary data. Right. Okay.

759
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:48,110
So the way you do that is you use something called joint field tool.

760
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:54,410
The way you find it is there's a nice command search at the top right hand corner.

761
01:32:55,370 --> 01:33:01,070
Okay. And that's a great place to find any tool that you need to find enough as per

762
01:33:01,550 --> 01:33:12,350
the type enjoying space field and top to be joint field data management tool.

763
01:33:12,830 --> 01:33:18,170
Select that and the geo processing pane should pop up on the right hand side.

764
01:33:19,130 --> 01:33:32,480
And there you say, Well, what's my input table? My input table is my county's 2019, not U.S. County's 22.

765
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:37,910
Input field is the input joint field is the name of the counties.

766
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:41,180
Okay. And that's stored in the field called name.

767
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:48,410
Then you can take a look at it if you need to go to right click on the layer and go to attribute table.

768
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:54,110
You can see all the different variables in there. The name is the county name right here.

769
01:33:54,350 --> 01:34:07,209
Okay. And then the join table, which is the the debt three table, you have to go find it because it's not in the contents pane.

770
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:17,890
So it isn't pop up on the dropdown menu. You go to the little folder and then you can go to a let's see, I think it's in.

771
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:27,870
For you guys. It's in my guys files, projects, cancer profiles to your database.

772
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:33,970
Am I dead? 2015 to 19.

773
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:41,000
That I'll do that again. You guys, I think, most likely saved it in your sea drive.

774
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:58,060
Each 8066 lab my case file projects you created that your database right where you put imported this table into and there it is.

775
01:34:58,690 --> 01:35:03,850
Okay. And the joint table field is called County.

776
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:12,550
Okay. And there are no threat. You can say, I just want these fields to be transferred.

777
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:15,140
I don't want other fields to be transferred. We're not going to mess with that.

778
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:20,390
I like to do a validate join before running it, just to make sure everything is okay.

779
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:29,300
Now, some of you I know will have a problem because you had Michigan in the US rows on the top right of your table.

780
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:33,190
So you'll have an error here from me.

781
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:43,340
It says at the bottom 83 in the input table and 83 in the joint table were matched.

782
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:47,630
Here, there you'll have 85 and 83. So two unmatched.

783
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:51,320
Okay. So we weren't so close.

784
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:56,780
And then you push run. All right.

785
01:35:56,900 --> 01:36:04,940
So what happened here is it added the join table data, the depth data to the the feature class boundary data.

786
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:14,300
So if you go to the right of this table, you will see here's a county name.

787
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:18,320
Right? This is the the table. I that's table right here.

788
01:36:18,830 --> 01:36:24,050
County fits that three have that trend. All right.

789
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:30,559
So the joint field creates a permanent join. That means you don't have to redo it.

790
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:35,000
Again, there are other processes here that create temporary joins.

791
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:39,620
We don't want to deal with those because you want to not do your work again. So this is a permanent join.

792
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:50,780
So once you close out of this project, you should be all good to go for the next step.

793
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:57,319
So I guess what I would like you to do now is this practice.

794
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:01,230
But it's time is running out. We're at 4:00.

795
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:06,380
I think what we should do is take a break, take a ten minute break,

796
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:16,640
come back practice labs, ten, 12 and 13, and then we'll do student led discussions.

797
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:20,270
Okay. So let's come back at 420.

798
01:37:21,770 --> 01:37:24,080
And in the meantime, I can help anybody who needs help.

799
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:43,070
If you'd like to work on this, the great thing about this that I felt like and I know I have a ratio that's like, I'm not going to like this one.

800
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:50,540
I would do it again. I don't want anybody to know.

801
01:37:52,220 --> 01:38:04,800
And I mean, like, like I can write with it to the country because like from the right, you know, I don't know.

802
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:14,980
A girl is I'm not like this is her. My name.

803
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:25,080
Through September 30th, they started using that data.

804
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:40,380
More. Now, how do you prepare for something like that?

805
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:48,020
They need to protect that, right?

806
01:38:49,970 --> 01:38:55,450
Yeah. I was listening to those trying to catch up now.

807
01:38:55,910 --> 01:38:59,290
Where is the. Cancer.

808
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:04,630
Oh, yeah. Oh, thank you.

809
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:12,230
So I just believe these are just the Clintons individually.

810
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:15,750
I think Hillary Clinton is a very interesting.

811
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:34,090
Yeah. You just start looking.

812
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:20,280
Topics that you.

813
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:33,440
I think he was a good time for the second one. Yeah. Because we have this employee speaking out know on an article.

814
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:38,330
Yeah. And then we're going to use that same one right to.

815
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:44,270
Different dates in October, right? So I guess the first one,

816
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:53,680
did you think the critique thing like something like now and then or what do you say like would be helpful to pick based on top of your head?

817
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:59,080
We haven't taken topic either online or offline because I think the steps that

818
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:07,120
we're doing because we have to make those instructions on how we got to.

819
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:14,890
Yeah, I think the first one is I think we run on finding like with the map and try to retrieve the map in the arcade.

820
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:19,750
Yeah. And I think that makes sense. Yeah. We just is just like.

821
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:23,990
Yeah, it'd be like. Yeah, exactly.

822
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:28,230
Yeah. And so do you. Yeah.

823
01:41:31,530 --> 01:41:35,550
Oh, because you don't have any. And when they do, they are. That makes sense.

824
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:43,790
We would. Yeah. I mean, I don't want nothing to be really different because I don't want to be doing clashes.

825
01:41:44,170 --> 01:41:50,610
Have to stay funded through the OP, which is not good enough for them I think right now.

826
01:41:51,450 --> 01:41:55,410
Yeah, well, I've only been working on my work in the language.

827
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:03,040
Yeah. Yeah. One of the things I made.

828
01:42:03,310 --> 01:42:08,780
Yeah, I think it was on the 17th or something, along with my friends in interviews, like career.

829
01:42:09,270 --> 01:42:12,429
Like recreate the map. Yeah. Oh, my God.

830
01:42:12,430 --> 01:42:20,130
If the end of the a man like, he doesn't look like the one who came out, you know, through the training ground.

831
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:29,690
So I'm all right. So I mean who these people for this there's just a website like downloading the video that you want to program.

832
01:42:29,950 --> 01:42:37,270
I guess we were like, I think I wouldn't pick something that's, like, super specific, right?

833
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:40,830
Yeah. That's like leaving a club in the beta or something. Yeah.

834
01:42:41,300 --> 01:42:49,030
Then we can get the general approval for people like go to the registry or whatever.

835
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:52,689
He like basically will even be like commercial movies.

836
01:42:52,690 --> 01:42:58,209
But I think that's like like he basically just sort of what do you, how am I going to know what I should do?

837
01:42:58,210 --> 01:43:01,510
We have a lot of money on the cell phone right now.

838
01:43:01,930 --> 01:43:15,760
So, yeah, it's like he was like he couldn't really he just had to do like change the names to the trailer the kids were using their.

839
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:24,840
I know. Cause I know you have to screens. That's really easy for like I have a computer screen so you have.

840
01:43:31,370 --> 01:43:35,430
And what kind of. June 1931 there.

841
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:49,840
I know. I mean, it's going to be like my phone is almost getting a piece of paper in his face, but like my one.

842
01:43:50,950 --> 01:43:55,120
And I said, Yeah. And I'm like, Thank you.

843
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:59,469
Part of me just like, I can't believe that. So yeah, I'm like, I really think we have to use it.

844
01:43:59,470 --> 01:44:07,240
But I mean, I know like for years I knew what they were doing, right?

845
01:44:07,540 --> 01:44:10,840
It's cool and nothing ever gets out. You were saying?

846
01:44:12,070 --> 01:44:17,950
Yeah, I'm thinking of like I've heard from that so much. I guess I just was wanted like orders I made on my computer.

847
01:44:17,950 --> 01:44:21,340
I uploaded up into Google Drive and into the whole thing.

848
01:44:21,460 --> 01:44:27,250
Because even though this is like, what if we ran into this point of feeling like it was true?

849
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:34,240
Would you do it like you don't know if if you reach like.

850
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:38,160
For you, Larry, in there.

851
01:44:38,170 --> 01:44:47,360
Maybe this isn't basically like the one drug thing, because any of those on that, because I have to take everything I space down.

852
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:56,669
I know. Because I'm like everyone, right? I think like a mom, because I'm slightly over the limits of these people.

853
01:44:56,670 --> 01:45:00,370
Not only like, yeah, but like not even if it's like really partially.

854
01:45:01,130 --> 01:45:09,030
And I don't even know why they've been there, but I was I needed I guess there probably is probably going I happen I think from all my

855
01:45:09,030 --> 01:45:14,470
other like I said I kind of my parents up in the nineties I guess I see my B or whatever.

856
01:45:14,490 --> 01:45:16,260
So I feel like that's what it is. Everything's okay.

857
01:45:16,620 --> 01:45:21,880
And so, you know, and I talk to my kids and my friends are wonderful, but usually and you never get back,

858
01:45:21,990 --> 01:45:27,750
you know, part of me for interaction with one another, everybody is getting a lot of interest.

859
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:35,850
Yeah. It's good to find out if I that's basically be like I said some of that because she's had a lot of it my.

860
01:45:36,690 --> 01:45:40,710
Little bit more covert I and there's only there's no way next year.

861
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:46,210
When I got close, I thought. Yeah.

862
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:58,380
Picture the world. It's probably been bad because. But I know where it is and I don't know where you're at.

863
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:02,420
I think so. I don't have an apple, remember?

864
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:07,960
You know. I don't know. So what do you think?

865
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:15,150
Gravity. Yeah. I think with my whole.

866
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:33,160
I guess you could do that because I want my old computer modified and old for me to realize that I had a way to wipe the computer.

867
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:40,530
But it's still really slow. And something like, I don't I wouldn't be downloading 90 lines, but I could use it to like pull up the paper for.

868
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:49,650
You shouldn't do good because most of the time you don't.

869
01:46:49,660 --> 01:47:14,620
I'm like, well, because me in my life, it's a big. Other thing.

870
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:30,490
Because like the prisoner of war. So.

871
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:43,629
But this one from Conservative MP was overall I think it was able to pass and I

872
01:47:43,630 --> 01:47:47,650
would have liked to just go from side else just like over the course of time.

873
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:51,310
But I really have always rejected like either no gender or.

874
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:59,350
Yeah. Look, my whole title is about the future.

875
01:47:59,350 --> 01:48:06,160
During might time, I went to go to something like I guess this was actually called longer than it is.

876
01:48:08,550 --> 01:48:26,060
So. All right.

877
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:29,570
So let's resume our work.

878
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:35,420
I think what we should do now is practice what we did, because I think there are a lot of steps.

879
01:48:36,230 --> 01:48:40,490
And it's good to practice these steps because you can have to do them over and over again.

880
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:50,420
So what I would like it all to do. There's a couple of things I didn't go over before we talk about practicing.

881
01:48:50,540 --> 01:48:54,170
I missed it because of the slides here.

882
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:57,950
Just some tips about getting tabular data into our.

883
01:48:58,970 --> 01:49:03,290
All right. We have to process that data a bit before we can actually make use of it.

884
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:10,300
It can be a challenge. For example, if you notice, we had to delete that space after the word counting.

885
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:22,280
Those are my new share of details that sometimes get you from the for our to you know, to causes problems.

886
01:49:23,630 --> 01:49:32,990
So just be patient. And if you get stuck, always contact your doctor about easy to remove from just to do the simple step.

887
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:41,140
Okay. And there are some additional resources about this problem of getting tabular data in parentheses.

888
01:49:42,650 --> 01:49:46,820
Our kids perhaps made it a little easier where you can work with Excel files more easily,

889
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:51,290
but you still have to do all that data cleaning that we did before.

890
01:49:51,590 --> 01:49:56,210
These data would not have worked unless we did all that deletion and all that work.

891
01:49:56,370 --> 01:50:00,350
Okay, so that's super important. So just stick with it.

892
01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:05,450
And I've given you a little bit of a cheat sheet here chart that may help you.

893
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:10,700
So for example, when you name files in Excel or any artist product,

894
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:19,550
I always just don't use any special characters or don't use spaces, especially Excel files and worksheets.

895
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:33,830
Okay. When you use Excel files, use Excel 2.23 or earlier for Excellence Files and 27 Excel s X Files.

896
01:50:34,690 --> 01:50:43,610
And remember the header rule. The first from that Excel file has to be your variable name MP.

897
01:50:43,610 --> 01:50:47,510
Anything else? And the columns are all your fields.

898
01:50:47,990 --> 01:50:51,920
Okay. And when you name your fields, these are some general rules to follow.

899
01:50:52,670 --> 01:50:55,700
Begin with a letter, not a number. Okay.

900
01:50:57,770 --> 01:51:00,800
It only letters, numbers and underscore characters.

901
01:51:00,830 --> 01:51:06,320
No other characters should be used like brackets or signs or anything else.

902
01:51:07,310 --> 01:51:10,490
And limit your variable names to 64 characters.

903
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:13,430
That seems to be debatable, but that's the general rule.

904
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:21,290
And there are some special characters you can use for variable names that are listed in and reserved words.

905
01:51:21,530 --> 01:51:25,250
File here in the Azari document. Okay.

906
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:29,930
So whenever you work with downloading and getting tabular data into our JS,

907
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:38,600
go back to this table to guide you and it's set to the second table in your lab activity.

908
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:43,310
So it's in the beginning just so you have easy reference to it.

909
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:48,829
All right. That's that's it about some things I wanted to cover.

910
01:51:48,830 --> 01:51:53,450
Now practice, practice. Meaning we do ten, 12 and 13.

911
01:51:53,870 --> 01:51:56,929
Activity 11 was creating as your database.

912
01:51:56,930 --> 01:52:01,520
You don't need to worry about that, but do the same activities for a different state.

913
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:06,380
And if you want a different cancer site, you can do breast cancer if you want or something else.

914
01:52:06,830 --> 01:52:12,920
But just do the same thing. Go to the State Cancer Profiles website, pick a state of your interest.

915
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:20,120
Download the data for that state. Okay, clean up that data in Excel.

916
01:52:21,230 --> 01:52:26,300
Bring it into the GIO database that you already created for cancer profiles.

917
01:52:26,930 --> 01:52:34,980
Your name due database. Right. You already have the the sheep ball for the counties.

918
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:45,690
Input it into your geo database. So now you just have to merge that with your cancer death or incidence data whichever you choose to download.

919
01:52:46,290 --> 01:52:50,940
So go through those activities. You take a good 20 minutes to do, maybe more.

920
01:52:51,450 --> 01:52:54,810
Okay. And I will come by and help anybody who gets that. Okay.

921
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:11,880
Oh yeah. And this is the link to the state FIPS codes.

922
01:53:12,630 --> 01:53:26,910
Remember, we use 26 for Michigan. If you go to this this link here, open hyperlink, it gives you the state FIPS code.

923
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:40,830
Write the abbreviation, the name and I don't know what the EMC number is, but if you go down this list, 26 is Michigan and California is six.

924
01:54:13,190 --> 01:54:52,540
Yeah. Yeah. It is.

925
01:54:55,150 --> 01:55:00,910
Oh, there was one student who had a slight issue that others might have, so he's going to show them the problem.

926
01:55:04,180 --> 01:55:08,530
You may have a situation where your doctor for looks like this.

927
01:55:08,530 --> 01:55:18,310
There's no map present. Okay? You can't drag over anything to the contents pane when there's no map present.

928
01:55:19,210 --> 01:55:33,370
So you have to have a map present to drag things in. If you have to insert in that first and then you can drag over to the layer table file.

929
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:39,460
Okay. That step is missing in step number one, lab activity three.

930
01:55:40,720 --> 01:56:32,510
Okay. That's.

931
01:56:35,050 --> 01:56:54,460
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Right.

932
01:57:24,310 --> 01:58:27,220
Okay. And so.

933
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:48,560
Yeah. Let's work till 450. Okay, because we still have strong discussions and I want to do 15 minutes per presenter.

934
02:01:56,530 --> 02:02:12,280
So I'm having trouble getting back to. Isn't that?

935
02:05:17,710 --> 02:05:21,540
See. He tried.

936
02:05:33,210 --> 02:05:53,050
He has. People.

937
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:12,220
Queensland Police spokesman. You haven't put it in yet.

938
02:06:14,140 --> 02:06:21,770
Oh, they've done. In a peek.

939
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:51,340
We? Yeah.

940
02:06:52,230 --> 02:06:56,070
How do you even know what number for the AP? And in a different state.

941
02:06:56,070 --> 02:07:04,380
How I hear that. Yeah, well, there is a link on the practice book that gives you the list.

942
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:22,140
This link gives you that list, and I think I have opened it and it's nice if you go to that link, it'll give you this table in the first number.

943
02:07:22,980 --> 02:07:26,160
Column of numbers is the FIPS code. Gotcha.

944
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:41,340
Yeah. My.

945
02:07:52,090 --> 02:07:56,080
I think it's important if we just move it over.

946
02:07:59,090 --> 02:08:09,830
Just a copy of. Yeah.

947
02:08:28,090 --> 02:08:34,030
When I tried to. But.

948
02:08:41,420 --> 02:08:48,320
Take a look here. I mean, let's get through the.

949
02:08:51,230 --> 02:09:00,040
You know, when it happens is after you. Let's look at the attribute itself.

950
02:09:00,350 --> 02:09:12,430
Was it? Newman 6367 with.

951
02:09:16,940 --> 02:09:22,880
Okay. Can we check the to. The.

952
02:09:45,750 --> 02:11:09,470
Do you see this new format? The Nigerian.

953
02:11:12,970 --> 02:11:24,350
Yeah. Sure.

954
02:11:34,460 --> 02:12:48,890
Purchased for the. And.

955
02:12:53,850 --> 02:12:58,820
It turned out instead of.

956
02:13:12,570 --> 02:14:03,700
But. It's coming from.

957
02:14:22,930 --> 02:14:57,520
So. Times.

958
02:15:01,210 --> 02:15:16,640
Just. I mean, I know it's.

959
02:15:25,850 --> 02:16:28,310
Yeah. Know. In terms.

960
02:16:54,900 --> 02:17:07,830
Interesting. They like to see the data?

961
02:17:09,800 --> 02:17:15,270
Yes, there is.

962
02:17:17,090 --> 02:17:20,530
So I have no.

963
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:31,540
Those. The next few.

964
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:24,040
Even. You know.

965
02:18:49,470 --> 02:18:53,280
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

966
02:18:54,700 --> 02:19:03,440
I mean, that's true. I think that it's sometimes good to just you know, we do that.

967
02:19:05,030 --> 02:19:09,060
I think there is some confusion and we need to find that.

968
02:19:09,620 --> 02:19:23,880
Yeah. Thank you. Okay.

969
02:19:24,030 --> 02:19:28,319
We're at 451, so we should start now.

970
02:19:28,320 --> 02:19:36,630
If you you're in the middle of something, it's okay. What I would do, I would suggest you do, is go to your right.

971
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:41,310
You must be working from your messages folder, right?

972
02:19:41,790 --> 02:19:45,450
All your stuff should be there for this practice session.

973
02:19:46,170 --> 02:19:56,580
So I would. I suggest you right click on it, then you should be able to zip it here.

974
02:19:57,030 --> 02:20:06,870
Right click seven zip and you can say compress to my JS files that zip.

975
02:20:08,820 --> 02:20:18,300
Okay, close. And then look at where I put it and this being the C drive and then send that to yourself.

976
02:20:20,750 --> 02:20:34,810
Oh it's sending it. You cannot access the file because it's open.

977
02:20:34,830 --> 02:20:41,520
I'm using it right now because I have 30 years pro and then zip it and send it to yourself.

978
02:20:41,660 --> 02:20:49,680
Okay. So you can continue practicing when you get home. In the meantime, you can listen and do that at the same time.

979
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:55,620
So Rachel will go first and she's going to talk about the Crumlin reading on corporate maps.

980
02:20:56,100 --> 02:21:05,700
And these are your slide tricks, things like. Hi, everyone.

981
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:11,489
I'm Rachel and I'm going to be discussing our reading on Quora Plus map legend designed

982
02:21:11,490 --> 02:21:16,650
for visualizing community health disparities by Robert Crumley and Elizabeth Gramley.

983
02:21:16,980 --> 02:21:22,410
So before we jump into the content, I just want to refresh every one of the goals of the paper.

984
02:21:23,290 --> 02:21:25,140
We do this every day.

985
02:21:26,460 --> 02:21:33,240
So the paper's main goal was to illustrate how health disparities are a huge problem across all communities, all over the United States.

986
02:21:33,660 --> 02:21:39,809
And to illustrate this, the authors use poor plot maps, and I've provided some examples here,

987
02:21:39,810 --> 02:21:44,520
and I removed the titles just to sort of stimulate some thought for if you guys have

988
02:21:44,520 --> 02:21:48,480
any examples that you want to share for what chloroplast maps can be used for.

989
02:21:54,850 --> 02:21:59,020
Code cases. I think that the right one is one.

990
02:21:59,890 --> 02:22:04,959
COVID case or incidence of COVID cases from like Google or something.

991
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:15,370
So yeah. That you. So did population density out I think is on the left side and then you could do things

992
02:22:15,370 --> 02:22:21,100
like divorce rates or environmental health outcomes as well as a plethora of other things.

993
02:22:23,740 --> 02:22:31,600
So for more of a background, corpus maps are maps that show the geographical distribution of the little things,

994
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:36,370
and they use shaded or colored areas to represent the magnitude of an attribute.

995
02:22:37,030 --> 02:22:41,859
They usually show these geographical distributions and individual layers that don't

996
02:22:41,860 --> 02:22:45,940
link to spatial patterns of other social factors that might play a role like income.

997
02:22:46,510 --> 02:22:47,820
And just as a reminder,

998
02:22:47,830 --> 02:22:55,480
the spatial distribution of a pattern is defined by the arrangement of the individual entities and the geographic relationships that they share.

999
02:22:56,320 --> 02:23:04,450
These can be helpful for detecting hotspots, relationships between a variable and a geographic location, and they also work best for relative data.

1000
02:23:04,480 --> 02:23:09,790
So like not necessarily absolute data because it might be more difficult to find

1001
02:23:09,790 --> 02:23:13,810
patterns and then they also work the best when you're just showing one variable.

1002
02:23:14,380 --> 02:23:20,980
But just as a refresher from last week, does anybody remember what the definition of an attribute is?

1003
02:23:26,750 --> 02:23:29,750
It's like a descriptive term, right? For a geographic.

1004
02:23:30,300 --> 02:23:35,040
Yeah. Yeah. Perfect. Okay.

1005
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:39,059
So you have a purpose out here.

1006
02:23:39,060 --> 02:23:43,020
And then also just in this study for a preface,

1007
02:23:43,020 --> 02:23:48,030
we are using data that's mapped to compare low birth weight by town in Connecticut in

1008
02:23:48,030 --> 02:23:51,750
the incidence of Lyme disease by town in Connecticut as well in relation to income.

1009
02:23:52,200 --> 02:23:58,680
And so this is applied by using publicly available data on low birth weight and also Lyme disease incidences in Connecticut.

1010
02:24:02,180 --> 02:24:05,240
That's the Connecticut town map right there.

1011
02:24:06,650 --> 02:24:13,040
So I just wanted to look at figure one really quickly. So as you can see here, we have a core plus map on the left.

1012
02:24:13,490 --> 02:24:18,530
And this is documenting the low birth weight percentages in Connecticut.

1013
02:24:18,860 --> 02:24:26,880
And like we saw last week in class, the legend on the left is a standard legend that lets us show what these colors represent in percentages.

1014
02:24:26,900 --> 02:24:31,040
And the right is a cumulative frequency legend, which we haven't really worked out in class with.

1015
02:24:31,370 --> 02:24:36,590
And the legend shows us the cumulative frequency of the towns associated with each data point on the map.

1016
02:24:36,950 --> 02:24:45,980
And it can be useful to just quickly quantify your data points. So as you can see from the lightest going down, each percentages get higher as we go.

1017
02:24:49,020 --> 02:24:55,680
Next. Just a couple of limitations of the use of core plus maps in research.

1018
02:24:55,710 --> 02:25:01,530
So although it's a great way to put your data into a digestible graphic, there are a few drawbacks to them.

1019
02:25:01,950 --> 02:25:06,180
So from the numbers side, mapping absolute counts, which I touched on earlier,

1020
02:25:06,570 --> 02:25:12,840
might not give you the most reliable data just because spatial units do vary in size and also number of observations.

1021
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:22,409
So I know that that's kind of like a brief description, but is there any ways that you guys thought of while doing your reading to sort of solve

1022
02:25:22,410 --> 02:25:29,840
the problem of this unreliable mapping data just because of the unreliable distributions,

1023
02:25:32,140 --> 02:25:38,400
but also specifically the readings? I think one of the other things that we saw, something about librarians,

1024
02:25:39,030 --> 02:25:42,929
nothing to talk about, like how using greater proportions is how you fix that.

1025
02:25:42,930 --> 02:25:47,639
Just because you like thinking about some counties are larger than others will have you to account.

1026
02:25:47,640 --> 02:25:54,360
It's going to be that you can't compare them just because you get like like population density and size plays a role in that.

1027
02:25:54,630 --> 02:25:57,720
Yeah, perfect. That's exactly what this reading recommended too,

1028
02:25:57,720 --> 02:26:06,170
using like a density ratio rate or a proportion to just make those numbers a little bit easier to visualize out on a map.

1029
02:26:06,180 --> 02:26:09,750
And then they also recommended age sex standardization when possible.

1030
02:26:10,140 --> 02:26:19,710
However, it also when you use standardization, it can also masks an important differences in the distribution of that numerator and denominator.

1031
02:26:20,910 --> 02:26:28,500
Next, just on area, this can be an issue because spatial units do have boundaries that divide the distribution of interest.

1032
02:26:28,860 --> 02:26:33,149
So these might mislead you if the denominator isn't in the area of the spatial unit.

1033
02:26:33,150 --> 02:26:39,660
So large areas might be more visible and then like a sparsely more populated map, might distort that health risk.

1034
02:26:40,320 --> 02:26:44,790
So one way to solve this is to use a cardiogram, which I have an example of on the next slide,

1035
02:26:44,790 --> 02:26:47,519
and that sort of distorts the geographic view of the map,

1036
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:58,080
but it gives you a better visualization of how that health outcome or data point will look in a way that's easier for your eye to understand.

1037
02:26:58,950 --> 02:27:04,439
So and also a cognitive study found that these cardiogram can be a more effective way of

1038
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:09,030
showing public health data if the readers are given more background on how they work.

1039
02:27:10,140 --> 02:27:17,969
But finally, for classification accuracy issues in core mapping mostly fall back onto data classification.

1040
02:27:17,970 --> 02:27:22,530
Since we sort of have limited categorization processes with our brains,

1041
02:27:22,530 --> 02:27:30,790
traditional core of what maps might break the data into smaller class intervals, and doing that will limit the number of graphic values on the map.

1042
02:27:30,810 --> 02:27:37,080
So like we've discussed, it's easy to manipulate the maps by their class breaks and it's spatial representation,

1043
02:27:37,080 --> 02:27:43,440
but it's more difficult to disseminate the underlying statistical distribution so its value is good,

1044
02:27:43,440 --> 02:27:50,070
while a visual variable is present for perceiving the ordinal relationships, but not as effective for perceiving the numerical data.

1045
02:27:51,180 --> 02:27:57,660
Next, I'm just going to show a couple of examples of a core plus map, as well as the cardiogram that I mentioned earlier.

1046
02:27:57,960 --> 02:28:01,410
The one on the left has a couple of poorer examples on the top.

1047
02:28:01,410 --> 02:28:05,520
And then the bottom example is a more clear core plus map.

1048
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:13,259
And then the one on the right is a cardiogram or sorry, coronagraph represented represented there on the screen.

1049
02:28:13,260 --> 02:28:18,810
And then I'm just going to go over a few tips on how to make your core plus maps more efficient.

1050
02:28:19,440 --> 02:28:25,800
So firstly, for the cardiogram, just consider using it if you're wanting to show how many people are affected by something.

1051
02:28:26,370 --> 02:28:30,899
And then for the core plus who are plus try to use the smallest units possible.

1052
02:28:30,900 --> 02:28:39,780
So for our data today, we have towns instead of like just state data or for example, you can use counties as well instead of just state data.

1053
02:28:40,350 --> 02:28:43,589
And using the right color scheme, as you can see here, is very important.

1054
02:28:43,590 --> 02:28:53,250
And as we also discussed in class, if you can use a color from colorblind friendly data set of colors, then that's also very beneficial as well.

1055
02:28:54,150 --> 02:29:01,230
Also trying to just use as few colors as possible so the reader can remember what each color means while they're reading your map.

1056
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:09,540
And also, I learned through a little bit of extra research that you can use color patterns to highlight different values within your map.

1057
02:29:09,540 --> 02:29:14,310
So if you're trying to show attention to both extremes or just a difference of one variable,

1058
02:29:14,550 --> 02:29:19,560
you can use different set colors to sort of show those in a more highlighted way.

1059
02:29:19,560 --> 02:29:23,490
So I thought that that was interesting and something to explore later when we start building our maps.

1060
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:34,590
But next, for methods of the study, I just again, there was the two data sets that were used, for example, in this study.

1061
02:29:34,590 --> 02:29:41,310
So we had low birth weight births by town in Connecticut from 1998, as well as Lyme disease cases in 2001.

1062
02:29:41,850 --> 02:29:47,040
And although they're very different health populations, they both are relevant.

1063
02:29:47,110 --> 02:29:51,070
Because they have data at the town level so we can analyze those together.

1064
02:29:51,940 --> 02:29:58,179
So for low birth weight, we have many different factors going into what causes it,

1065
02:29:58,180 --> 02:30:07,330
but it's defined by less than £5 and eight ounces, and they include behavioral socio demographic and medical care access factors.

1066
02:30:07,630 --> 02:30:11,080
And this is given in percent for Lyme disease.

1067
02:30:11,380 --> 02:30:17,950
This is caused by a multi-stage multi-system vector borne illness or Borrelia burgdorferi.

1068
02:30:17,950 --> 02:30:25,540
And in Connecticut it is caused by the blacklegged tick, and this is given in rates per 100,000.

1069
02:30:26,380 --> 02:30:29,830
So as I mentioned, these two things are very different.

1070
02:30:29,830 --> 02:30:36,820
But since they are given in the same rate, it's we are able to compare them in these maps.

1071
02:30:37,240 --> 02:30:46,840
So I wanted to take a look at some of the other maps that we have in our paper here just to quickly compare what these look like.

1072
02:30:46,840 --> 02:30:50,710
So we have the numerator and denominator, cumulative frequency legend.

1073
02:30:51,220 --> 02:30:57,190
And in this legend, the cumulative frequency curve for numerator is given in blue, and for the denominator it's in green.

1074
02:30:57,520 --> 02:31:05,110
The grand rate for each health outcome is given by a vertical yellow line that defines the maximum separation between the two curves for any value.

1075
02:31:05,620 --> 02:31:13,090
And then the equal numerator classification is associated with each color representing a class interval in the map.

1076
02:31:13,540 --> 02:31:19,690
And this one portrays the spatial distribution of the percent of low birth weight birth by a town in Connecticut.

1077
02:31:20,140 --> 02:31:25,540
And the upper left portrays the spatial distribution of Lyme disease per 100,000.

1078
02:31:26,890 --> 02:31:32,320
And then I also included figure five here. This one is quantile or sorry.

1079
02:31:33,760 --> 02:31:38,200
This is the cumulative frequency curve for this population below the poverty level

1080
02:31:38,200 --> 02:31:42,399
is given in blue and that for the total population is given in green on this one.

1081
02:31:42,400 --> 02:31:47,650
So there's very slight differences throughout. But I thought it was interesting to include those.

1082
02:31:50,450 --> 02:31:59,750
So for results that we came from in the study, I just grabbed a few but from our observational units and O drives,

1083
02:32:00,200 --> 02:32:05,599
FIG. one shows a contrast between the standard legend and the cumulative frequency legend by using

1084
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:10,550
the number of observational units in the map as a cumulative frequency variable or the O drive,

1085
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:15,500
because it's based on the cumulative frequency of observational units,

1086
02:32:15,800 --> 02:32:22,640
the reader can easily discern that 25.4% of the graphic units are in the lowest class interval by examining

1087
02:32:22,640 --> 02:32:28,130
the projection lines associated with the upper limit of the class level from numerators and denominators.

1088
02:32:28,520 --> 02:32:37,130
Instead of basing the map classification on this rate, it could be more effective to base map classification off the distribution of the numerator.

1089
02:32:39,470 --> 02:32:41,420
And as for community context,

1090
02:32:43,850 --> 02:32:54,230
we found that they can be used to show variables that relate to socio economic factors rather than just numerator and denominator of disease rates.

1091
02:32:56,890 --> 02:33:05,800
And in conclusion, a previous study has shown that the Ojai based legend can help readers recognize the statistical distribution.

1092
02:33:06,910 --> 02:33:11,649
The cumulative frequency legends can help with illuminating disease and other associations.

1093
02:33:11,650 --> 02:33:20,320
However, with income featured, we can also use multiple variables to see how ethnicity and education can play a role in the same type

1094
02:33:20,320 --> 02:33:27,100
of research as well as the cumulative frequency graph is found to be more efficient than a thematic map,

1095
02:33:27,100 --> 02:33:33,310
like a scatterplot. Just because you can show more points on one single map rather than making map multiple

1096
02:33:33,850 --> 02:33:39,879
in then public health professionals to prefer using grid plus maps over time just

1097
02:33:39,880 --> 02:33:44,470
because of their ability to assess the number of the geographical areas that fall

1098
02:33:44,470 --> 02:33:49,720
within any class intervals and associated maps to show where these areas are located.

1099
02:33:51,670 --> 02:33:57,249
So just a couple of streams from this article that I noticed were that it definitely

1100
02:33:57,250 --> 02:34:03,399
explains the effectiveness of Coral Quest maps very well and why we still use them today.

1101
02:34:03,400 --> 02:34:07,120
Even though this article is a bit dated, it gives you very,

1102
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:12,250
very detailed instructions on how to build your own and sort of just how to analyze them and what they should look like.

1103
02:34:12,760 --> 02:34:19,690
I think that it gave pretty good examples throughout and even detailed down to color schemes what you can do to make your map more effective.

1104
02:34:20,140 --> 02:34:24,580
And yeah, even though it was a bit technical, which I'll get into,

1105
02:34:25,360 --> 02:34:32,620
I think that it was a pretty good layout of everything that we needed to understand of the map.

1106
02:34:33,160 --> 02:34:37,090
And then as I just kind of was saying for the weaknesses, it's very,

1107
02:34:37,090 --> 02:34:41,890
very technical and I kind of had a difficult time getting through to sort of make sure certain points were made.

1108
02:34:42,280 --> 02:34:49,089
But I think that some of us who might have more of a data analysis background might have had an easier time.

1109
02:34:49,090 --> 02:34:56,829
So I think that that's my biggest critique of it. But other than that, that concludes what my presentation is.

1110
02:34:56,830 --> 02:35:02,740
So thank you very much.

1111
02:35:03,100 --> 02:35:13,480
I'm actually going to be very short on time, but you tune in next and I think I have to follow that up here.

1112
02:35:21,090 --> 02:35:32,680
Thank you. Hi everyone.

1113
02:35:33,030 --> 02:35:42,040
I read the paper then. Today is age, standardization and mapping adult overweight and obesity trends in the European region.

1114
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:47,380
And this is what we were going to go through today.

1115
02:35:47,650 --> 02:35:54,500
And first, I want to ask what comes up when you all hear the word standardize or standardization?

1116
02:35:54,550 --> 02:35:58,960
Like just a brief, like, thought. It's just like making everything the same.

1117
02:35:59,770 --> 02:36:03,960
Yeah. The other is. Yeah.

1118
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:07,540
Something has to be lost for there to be a standard. Yeah.

1119
02:36:07,560 --> 02:36:15,540
Yeah. So, yeah. So for me, it's like my understanding is like putting everything on the same base, like the same standards.

1120
02:36:15,540 --> 02:36:19,690
So like they can be compare on this then same standard.

1121
02:36:20,050 --> 02:36:24,310
Yeah. So first the summary.

1122
02:36:26,230 --> 02:36:32,650
So the paper aim of the study aims to improve comparability of available data within the

1123
02:36:33,340 --> 02:36:38,650
European region and taking differences related to the aging of population into account.

1124
02:36:39,100 --> 02:36:44,829
So a little bit background is that the European region,

1125
02:36:44,830 --> 02:36:53,920
the prevalence of obesity has risen three fold or more since the 1980s and including countries with traditionally only low rates.

1126
02:36:54,250 --> 02:37:04,480
So over the past few decades, the global emergence of overweight and obesity is confronted by the simultaneous aging of population.

1127
02:37:04,690 --> 02:37:12,190
So like higher prevalence for obesity or overweight all occur in older adults and population.

1128
02:37:12,190 --> 02:37:17,830
Aging may contribute independently to the rising prevalence of overweight and obesity.

1129
02:37:18,160 --> 02:37:28,840
And as we know that population aging may therefore by country and over time, therefore age adjusted prevalence is are needed for the comparisons.

1130
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:43,220
Okay. So they include the various databases like the global databases and BMI and the National Obesity Task Force, Eurostat and PubMed.

1131
02:37:43,230 --> 02:37:49,070
So basically they just search for the keywords like overweight obesity and BMI and stuff.

1132
02:37:49,520 --> 02:38:01,190
Yeah. And so that included so many surveys and data and actually they talk a lot about like about a lot methodologies and come from,

1133
02:38:01,190 --> 02:38:05,590
I think different data collections and way to include as much data as they could.

1134
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:09,140
So I won't be talking about that that much.

1135
02:38:09,620 --> 02:38:20,419
But yeah, they, they have two kinds of they have like measured and self-reported data and it's reported separately in the study later I will mention

1136
02:38:20,420 --> 02:38:31,430
about and those age standardization was apply separately for the ages 25 to 49 and 50 to 64 and also for the full like age range,

1137
02:38:31,640 --> 02:38:39,920
25 to 64 years. And I would just refer to a younger age group, an older age group later on.

1138
02:38:40,340 --> 02:38:44,540
And they the results was shown separately for younger age group,

1139
02:38:44,540 --> 02:38:50,720
older age group for males and females and for overweight and obese versus obesity data.

1140
02:38:51,740 --> 02:39:00,800
So yeah, they reported annual changes in prevalence for overweight and obesity based on the measured height and weight.

1141
02:39:01,250 --> 02:39:07,190
And the map only shows the age adjusted prevalence of obesity based on only the

1142
02:39:07,670 --> 02:39:14,270
self-reported height and weight because there are no sufficient data for that.

1143
02:39:15,800 --> 02:39:19,040
So I talk about the age standardization.

1144
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:24,889
So age is like the confounding variables too, like they want to put on the same standard.

1145
02:39:24,890 --> 02:39:31,760
So do anyone have any ideas of other kind of like other how many variables could

1146
02:39:31,760 --> 02:39:39,410
be used to standardize gathered data like and examples so to economic status.

1147
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:46,300
Sorry, socioeconomic status. Yeah. Socioeconomic status or any one else.

1148
02:39:47,390 --> 02:39:50,690
Like race. Yeah. Ethnicity. Yeah.

1149
02:39:50,870 --> 02:39:54,980
Yeah. So talk about other results.

1150
02:39:55,700 --> 02:39:58,280
So first we'll talk about the measured data.

1151
02:39:58,790 --> 02:40:06,590
So I said they could link together and measure data and self-reported data and they reported the separately.

1152
02:40:07,220 --> 02:40:17,330
So in men, both men and women, the older age groups had higher prevalence for overweight and obesity as compared to the younger age groups.

1153
02:40:18,050 --> 02:40:25,520
And while other countries have increasing overweight and obesity trends, the annual obesity prevalence has changed.

1154
02:40:25,970 --> 02:40:36,800
This decreased and both male and female in Germany so can see annual prevalence change in overweight and obesity strength in males.

1155
02:40:38,660 --> 02:40:49,070
And smells. So other countries are mostly like increasing the prevalence, but only Germany has decreased prevalence.

1156
02:40:53,280 --> 02:40:57,730
Next. Then we'll talk about more.

1157
02:40:57,780 --> 02:41:03,479
The thing more relevant to you guys? I thought the whole paper would be like so many maps.

1158
02:41:03,480 --> 02:41:08,280
But I tell you, the only report hit a little bit. So this is the mapping part.

1159
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:17,879
So in males, only eight of nine countries like they only can gather this much data for self reporting and put it into maps.

1160
02:41:17,880 --> 02:41:26,070
So that's only like nine countries. So eight and nine countries shifted into a higher category between the first and last surveys,

1161
02:41:26,340 --> 02:41:32,070
with only Switzerland's retaining a less than 10% opportunity in the last ten of survey years.

1162
02:41:32,640 --> 02:41:40,440
So this is the first earlier survey and the middle and the last.

1163
02:41:41,190 --> 02:41:46,860
So we can see only Switzerland have this like retain less than ten.

1164
02:41:47,430 --> 02:41:52,530
Another have like a shifted, but a trend shifted into a higher category.

1165
02:41:53,730 --> 02:41:56,100
And so you can see in females,

1166
02:41:56,100 --> 02:42:07,440
six of the nine countries shifted into higher categories of obesity prevalence and also Switzerland rating less than ten and also in Italy.

1167
02:42:09,980 --> 02:42:18,590
This is what I saw. And Italy and Estonia retained 15 to 19.9%.

1168
02:42:19,400 --> 02:42:28,510
So I have the question there. What is the one thing that you think could be visually improved in these maps, like for the first sight?

1169
02:42:28,790 --> 02:42:34,110
How do you think about this map? Ideas.

1170
02:42:37,120 --> 02:42:45,210
Okay. So this is they like thinking about when you add the other things, it's like very hard to distinguish between like the orange and the pink.

1171
02:42:45,490 --> 02:42:48,910
Yes. That's like the first one you can do. It's like orange and yellow.

1172
02:42:48,910 --> 02:42:53,440
But once you add the pink, it's hard to distinguish, like the color differences between them.

1173
02:42:53,570 --> 02:43:00,220
Yeah. Yeah. I also think like this. So all of these things, all four of our lives are just primitives.

1174
02:43:00,970 --> 02:43:05,710
Maybe adding gradients would be an easier color scheme to follow.

1175
02:43:06,040 --> 02:43:09,430
Yeah. Greater. So to just more presents.

1176
02:43:09,640 --> 02:43:11,240
Yeah. That's also what I thought.

1177
02:43:11,260 --> 02:43:20,540
I feel like if there's like presented it like getting higher percentage, they should probably be like darker color like display it and gradient.

1178
02:43:21,370 --> 02:43:24,510
It's probably be more intuitive for me personally.

1179
02:43:24,520 --> 02:43:27,849
Like I just go back, check to check the login and then go back.

1180
02:43:27,850 --> 02:43:33,520
Like it's kind of confusing. So yeah, that's some thoughts for the maps.

1181
02:43:34,240 --> 02:43:37,600
So I'll talk about the strength of the paper.

1182
02:43:39,640 --> 02:43:49,900
So. Okay. The study results come from the evidence for increasing prevalence for overweight and obesity and the European region.

1183
02:43:49,900 --> 02:43:56,920
And even after accounting for the demographic changes and that there is opposite trends of

1184
02:43:56,920 --> 02:44:04,480
there's this decreased obesity prevalence observed in Germany and maybe need further attention.

1185
02:44:04,720 --> 02:44:12,220
So we don't know if it's like the data or if it's really like really decreasing.

1186
02:44:13,180 --> 02:44:24,760
So also the maps in this study illustrate the impact of age standardization when compared to global map created by IATA.

1187
02:44:25,570 --> 02:44:31,330
The IATA map is not shown in the article, but the author says,

1188
02:44:31,330 --> 02:44:38,410
like a comparison of crude and adjusted prevalence shows age standardization shifts and shifts,

1189
02:44:38,980 --> 02:44:48,040
female obesity prevalence to lighter shade and for other countries and Mel like the adjusted prevalence

1190
02:44:48,040 --> 02:44:57,200
is for German males like shift to I like also shift to a lighter shade so this is what they get.

1191
02:44:58,420 --> 02:45:02,540
Okay. So an easy question. What is the strength of pulling the data into maps?

1192
02:45:03,280 --> 02:45:09,400
And this basically like how is the strength of guys anyone else for this?

1193
02:45:10,450 --> 02:45:19,570
Can you just get people who might not even really have much public health background, a visual example of what is going on and where?

1194
02:45:20,080 --> 02:45:24,880
Yes, agree. So like it's easier for us to like maybe observe a trend.

1195
02:45:25,330 --> 02:45:30,370
Let's see, like which part is like have a more serious problems.

1196
02:45:30,970 --> 02:45:34,160
Yes. So some weaknesses.

1197
02:45:35,640 --> 02:45:40,850
Okay. So what is the one limitation that you can think of when using national level data?

1198
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:43,970
So like this paper basically used like national level data.

1199
02:45:46,720 --> 02:45:57,070
They often feel a variation in the regions of these countries that you're not getting to see.

1200
02:45:57,430 --> 02:46:03,150
Yeah. Yeah. But. Demographics and.

1201
02:46:04,770 --> 02:46:11,570
I guess the the the the term is they can you know, fluctuate the reasoning for you know.

1202
02:46:13,220 --> 02:46:16,810
Yeah. Which companies to. Yeah.

1203
02:46:18,060 --> 02:46:22,830
Yeah. Cause you want to and and built in.

1204
02:46:22,910 --> 02:46:30,920
I was concerned with the variation of causes for obesity across the national context.

1205
02:46:30,920 --> 02:46:40,740
It feels like. That statistic of trying to standardize the national level data and to visualize the problem in a way that may not helpful.

1206
02:46:41,980 --> 02:46:45,520
The context of the health issue? Yes, totally.

1207
02:46:45,820 --> 02:46:49,870
So I think the author also knows some of the limitations of that.

1208
02:46:49,880 --> 02:46:57,760
So it's like they are they're not account for the shifts and problems that may be occurring within specific risk groups.

1209
02:46:58,150 --> 02:47:07,629
And like, for example, like different countries have different like aging, like speed and like they have different ethnicity and migration.

1210
02:47:07,630 --> 02:47:13,480
So that might be a problem if we only look at the overall national data and like, oh,

1211
02:47:13,630 --> 02:47:20,320
another big weakness I would say in this study is like direct comparisons of the study

1212
02:47:20,320 --> 02:47:25,390
and other studies are limited due to the differences in methodology and reporting.

1213
02:47:25,900 --> 02:47:33,340
So like in other, like global obesity studies, they include adults over 20 years old.

1214
02:47:33,370 --> 02:47:42,549
So like all the adults, but this one, they only collect like 25 years old to 64 because of the they have elderly.

1215
02:47:42,550 --> 02:47:51,820
So they can really have like direct comparisons between these and like the original definition is also older friends.

1216
02:47:51,820 --> 02:48:00,910
So like they're till like very famous and global obesity studies and one is using like work by World Bank regional definition.

1217
02:48:00,910 --> 02:48:09,790
So like looking more on an economic basis and the other one looking more like western, central, central and Eastern Europe.

1218
02:48:10,060 --> 02:48:15,310
But this one is based on country so they can really have direct comparison.

1219
02:48:16,240 --> 02:48:22,750
And also this maps not only use the self they had to put on the map.

1220
02:48:23,860 --> 02:48:28,990
So anyone tell me what is the limitation of using self-reported data?

1221
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:36,130
So that is probably yeah, some of it probably inaccurate.

1222
02:48:37,630 --> 02:48:44,740
So self-reported data like as everyone learned maybe last semester and AP class, so like,

1223
02:48:44,740 --> 02:48:52,750
you know, probably underreported and leading to result and underestimated outcomes.

1224
02:48:53,680 --> 02:48:59,889
And another weakness of this study is some other studies have shown,

1225
02:48:59,890 --> 02:49:08,200
like later studies have shown like abdominal obesity to be a better estimation for health risks and diseases than BMI.

1226
02:49:08,200 --> 02:49:14,520
So. Yeah. So implications.

1227
02:49:14,970 --> 02:49:19,110
So from a preventative point of view,

1228
02:49:19,110 --> 02:49:27,990
the study is important to identify demographic factors such as age and gender and improvement and collecting data,

1229
02:49:28,290 --> 02:49:34,260
collecting comparable repeated measure data that are needed, and representative,

1230
02:49:34,380 --> 02:49:41,970
representative population monitoring and surveys should be performed on a regular basis to monitor overweight and obesity problems.

1231
02:49:42,390 --> 02:49:49,380
And can you give me an example of how these regularly collected data can be used?

1232
02:49:53,020 --> 02:49:54,630
Okay. Okay.

1233
02:49:55,660 --> 02:50:07,060
So I think they can be used like examining if that's how the intervention works or to see like the effectiveness of health promotion policies,

1234
02:50:07,510 --> 02:50:08,110
something like that.

1235
02:50:09,370 --> 02:50:18,940
And also the additional information is needed on migration and socio economic status and to see the prevalence of the things these group.

1236
02:50:19,990 --> 02:50:22,060
So this is my presentation.

1237
02:50:28,270 --> 02:50:39,050
So what I am really impressed by the presentations and the quality of discussion that you guys are having in the past about the readings.

1238
02:50:39,530 --> 02:50:45,409
So keep up the good work. It's great. I guess I always like to give some take home messages.

1239
02:50:45,410 --> 02:50:50,239
We're a little out of time, but for the first paper, I guess I wanted to score with you guys,

1240
02:50:50,240 --> 02:50:58,910
thinking about the idea that you need to look at the distribution of the variable before you classify that variable into intervals.

1241
02:50:59,420 --> 02:51:02,840
And it's really important to communicate that distribution in your write up.

1242
02:51:03,650 --> 02:51:08,210
Okay. So you should have a chart showing the distribution.

1243
02:51:09,530 --> 02:51:18,380
You know, a normal histogram is perfect because these cumulative incidence graphs are very hard to understand for most people.

1244
02:51:20,360 --> 02:51:23,929
That said, for that one, for now, in the last paper,

1245
02:51:23,930 --> 02:51:30,250
I think the idea of standardization is really important because you guys will be working with rates many times.

1246
02:51:30,710 --> 02:51:36,200
So each standardization or standardization is going to be really critical when you compare regions.

1247
02:51:36,710 --> 02:51:43,250
And I really like this last paper because it goes into depth about what are the data themselves,

1248
02:51:43,250 --> 02:51:46,250
why do they what were they come from and their limitations.

1249
02:51:46,610 --> 02:51:52,189
And that's the type of work you need to do when you kind of critique the quality of the data that you're using in community.

1250
02:51:52,190 --> 02:51:58,640
But in the writing, just to to just takeaways or I think we'll end there.

1251
02:51:59,510 --> 02:52:02,550
Yeah. Next time we'll just do more of this stuff.

1252
02:52:02,570 --> 02:52:05,720
Have a good week and I'll talk to you guys next Tuesday.

1253
02:52:06,110 --> 02:52:13,670
Thank you. Thank you. You know.
