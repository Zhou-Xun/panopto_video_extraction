1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:15,340
I think we will get started. So first thing to mention is, like I said last week, I'm currently in Bangladesh.

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,149
The reason I mention it is in the in my it might go out for like 20 seconds.

3
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,560
It's normally quite good, but it sometimes turns off and then comes back on like in less than a minute.

4
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,660
So if it does, I will be back, as you know.

5
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,150
The main thing I'm trying to say. So apologies if that does happen.

6
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,980
But for now, let's move into the lecture.

7
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,780
Wonderful. So we're going to today talk about the historical context of global health.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,720
So can the origins of it, where we are right now and hopefully the future directions of it.

9
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:18,980
And this would really be quite similar to what we talk about the second half of the lecture last week, but kind of going a bit more into that.

10
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,569
So you have some background, but we're actually going to start off with actually,

11
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,200
I'm just going to give a little aside before we set off on some stuff we talked about last week.

12
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,910
We will then develop some community guidelines for our discussions.

13
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,690
Then we'll go on to the lecture and then we will have another discussion on the lecture and history of global health.

14
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,760
So the first thing I want to talk about with some one of your classmates, Rachael,

15
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:50,240
stay behind to chat with me about after the last session was the terms development and aid.

16
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:59,330
So you don't see development and aid that much in research, but you see it a lot in the NGO and programmatic space.

17
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,200
So after kind of having this conversation last week,

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:11,480
I'll think about a more looked into more and it seems like terms development and aid is still a relic of the international health area.

19
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:21,620
It's still going into low income countries and running programs that you do have some bilateral aid where, you know,

20
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,530
it's between low income countries or sometimes even low income countries coming into high income countries.

21
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:38,090
HIV is a great example of that, but it's still very much seen as something from that international health era off of global health.

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,229
And the way it's kind of broken down, like I mentioned last week, is humanitarian aid is like there's an emergency, something that's happened.

23
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:50,780
You have to go just that, whereas development is a long term, long term problem.

24
00:02:50,790 --> 00:03:03,950
So for example, cholera in Bangladesh might be one or or tuberculosis and in Malaysia might be another one, some not acute emergencies.

25
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:11,090
But there's kind of two things that are while we're getting more about this, the past few days that I've seen coming up,

26
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:17,040
the first is going into a more global or, you know, planetary health frame of view.

27
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:23,210
You you may be one develop better terminology. So it's not as you know, high income country going into a low income country.

28
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,440
So, you know, something which I think I might start using instead is emergency versus non-emergency,

29
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,549
rather acute emergency versus non-acute emergency.

30
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,930
I say acute because, you know, climate change in the world is an emergency.

31
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,100
And you can say a lot of other long lasting things on legacies,

32
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:49,999
but I wouldn't say that acute didn't just happen, you know, in the past day or week or also but something else.

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,629
And I put a link in there if anybody wants to view the photo once you put the slides up is do you need to separate these?

34
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:03,590
Are they intrinsically linked? They are. But because logistics, you might need to separate them somehow.

35
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,780
So I don't have the answers to this, obviously,

36
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:12,350
but just something to think about as something to be aware of as you as you work in the global health space.

37
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:23,180
So now we're going to actually start off with a small group activity and we're going to develop some community guidelines for our discussions.

38
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:38,120
So what I'm doing right now, trying to do that here is share in the chat a link to a Google Google sheet.

39
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,460
And in your groups you're going to do a few things.

40
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,450
Going to think about good group discussions you've been in and this can be in any field in any,

41
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,510
you know, even if it's outside of the classroom setting and reflect on why they were quite satisfying.

42
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,020
You can then go and talk about the bad ones you've been in and again reflect on why they were unsatisfying.

43
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:04,729
And then in your groups you each come up with three things that we can do to promote satisfying discussions and put

44
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:12,080
those in the Google doc and things we can do to prevent unsatisfying discussions and put those in the Google doc.

45
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:22,650
So I'm going to stop sharing right now and put into a few different clusters.

46
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,990
Right. Let's do there.

47
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:59,180
So. It looks like everybody's back.

48
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:05,630
And actually, before we move on to chatting about that, I notice some new people in the class.

49
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:16,460
So just want to give them a quick second themselves. So first you just give the class a quick introduction by yourself.

50
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,630
What did you call me? Yes. So just if you could.

51
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,000
I was intending to have you introduce yourself to class since we all did introductions last week.

52
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,810
But I forgot to say if you mind. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.

53
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:43,940
Okay. So. Hi, everyone. My name is Maria and I am a CS Master's student on my second year specializing in

54
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,560
environmental justice and also in the global public health certificate program.

55
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:54,440
I'm interested mainly. Well, focusing more on like waterborne diseases.

56
00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:04,069
Currently taking algae 605 on infectious diseases and just really excited to like to learn more about

57
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,930
just like health inequities and really like anything that ties with like global public health.

58
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,170
And my pronouns are she. Great.

59
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:19,190
Thanks for your analysis. Nancy, it's yes. And Nancy elements excuse herself,

60
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,970
but Nancy were giving one the guest lectures and in a few weeks and it's just kind of sitting

61
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,900
in a few class sessions and that's if you could introduce yourself briefly to the class.

62
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:42,530
Thank you, Doc. Hello, everyone. My name is Nancy from Kenya, and I'm currently doing my master's in Women's and Gender Studies in South Africa.

63
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:51,530
I'm here for a research project that explores how sexual minorities are represented in phones.

64
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,100
And I look forward to interacting with you. Thank you.

65
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,200
Great. Thanks, Nancy. Was anybody else who wasn't here, sir?

66
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,430
McNally, I don't think you in the last class. Yeah.

67
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:11,939
Hi, everyone. Sarah I'm a second year master's student in the Health Behavior and Health Education Program,

68
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,720
and I'm going to apply for the certificate in the Global Public Health Program.

69
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:24,300
I mostly look at the Pacific Islander population in the U.S. and because there's a lot of migrants in our population,

70
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:30,810
the health of back home in the islands is still very relevant to the health of the national population here.

71
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,160
So I'm excited to take this class or.

72
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,080
Thanks to anybody else who wasn't here last on Tuesday.

73
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:45,600
Fantastic. So let's move on to discussing what you just discussed.

74
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:54,680
So when somebody from I'll share my screen, but would somebody from Group one walk us through that discussion?

75
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:06,330
Yeah, I can do it. We mostly were talking about respecting fellow speakers, so a lot of what we wrote down sort of related to that,

76
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,520
some good things from past discussions were holding a safe space for everyone to speak.

77
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,940
Allowing people to take their time. So not interrupting. Um,

78
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,950
and then also having a confidential confidentiality agreement where we just agree to

79
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:28,230
not share personal stories or anecdotes that people have said during the discussion.

80
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:34,080
Similarly, some bad things were, you know, interrupting people, dominating conversation.

81
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:42,180
And then we all sort of agreed that in the past, when there has been an expectation to speak a number of times for participation credit,

82
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:50,459
it tends to detract from the conversation and cause people to speak up and not really contribute thoughts.

83
00:20:50,460 --> 00:21:00,150
It's more just to get the grade. So and sometimes it tends to you start to take turns away from the the normal discussion topic.

84
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,650
And so those are some things that we noticed that we didn't love so much about past discussion.

85
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:10,020
Fantastic. And it does make complete sense.

86
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,280
Does anybody else in the other groups have any actions, goals before we move on to to.

87
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,730
Perfect. And just to mention, you mentioned being great on participation. I completely agree with that.

88
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:30,000
That's why we didn't for anything say there's a hard and fast rule of how much you need to participate or couldn't come in some result.

89
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,590
Like, like we mentioned last session, for example, a perusal.

90
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:42,780
I'd rather you, you know, do one really interesting comment and say I need to do X comments and x replies.

91
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:53,940
So keep that in mind is good throughout the class and fantastic if someone from group two could discuss what they discussed.

92
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,970
Yes. We just talked about similar ideas as what group one did.

93
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:15,980
Good discussion groups that we have been a part of all kind of like shared similar themes of just like being respectful of

94
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:25,100
others ideas and being open minded and just acknowledging where everybody's coming from and just respecting each other's ideas.

95
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:35,990
And like, along like that, discussions, like, just not dominating or like being domineering in conversation and like, that leads just like,

96
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:46,390
allowing time for everybody to share their ideas and just everybody participating in their being like an equal balance of ideas shared and yeah,

97
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:54,020
just not interrupting people, not judging people, just practicing like, friendly discourse and stuff like that.

98
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:58,899
So. Okay. Fantastic. These all look great and make little sense.

99
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,070
But these are these are tough ones, especially the judgment one.

100
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:12,719
You know, the way public health is right now, there's a lot of, you know, really hot takes people can have on things which you might honestly.

101
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,230
I know. I mean, I listen to people conferences and I'm like, that's really stupid.

102
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,340
That doesn't make any sense.

103
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:25,690
I, I had to check myself all the time to, like, come into things with an open mind and, and accept, you know, pretty different points of views.

104
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:35,590
These are great but very challenging things which really, you know, I mean, I especially need to work on sometimes before we go on to the final three.

105
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:43,310
Does anybody have any reactions or comments on these? Wonderful.

106
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,720
And then finally, a representative from Group three.

107
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,890
I can take care of that for us. So for the good.

108
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,780
Based on our past experiences, we feel that if you're comfortable with it, of course,

109
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,459
sharing your own unique experiences as it relates to the course contact and content.

110
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,300
And this can be based on personal experience, academic, what you've learned, your work, etc.

111
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:11,610
So being able to have multiple perspectives and diverse discussion around those perspectives has been really good.

112
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,759
Equally listening. So, you know, being mindful that when you talk, everyone is listening.

113
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:24,510
So replicating that behavior when someone else is talking and also again in line with the diverse opinions.

114
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:32,850
If you have an opinion but you also can argue for the opposing side, go for it that it would make for interesting discussion.

115
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:40,409
And then on the bad side, they kind of are similar, but definitely when you're stuck in a discussion with someone,

116
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,430
but it's completely one sided and there's no room for other opinions or thoughts,

117
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:50,910
that's not enjoyable if you dominate the discussion which ties into the listening.

118
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:56,760
So once again, don't overtake the space, let others have an opportunity to speak,

119
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:02,330
and then having clear about your opinion biases or being argumentative,

120
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,329
there's a fine line between giving critical feedback or asking the questions versus

121
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,440
just turning it into a complete argument based on your own personal beliefs,

122
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:18,930
biases, or what you've seen. It's a difficult thing to balance for all of us, but definitely makes the conversation bad if it's not there.

123
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:29,549
Yep. Fantastic. Again, these are great points. And again, these are all, you know, easy to write down on paper, but difficult to do in your life.

124
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:33,990
I know 1 to 1. So people take control of conversation. A lot of times it comes from a good place.

125
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:38,310
It's a topic someone's really passionate about. You know, this isn't a, you know,

126
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:43,350
chemistry one on one you're taking because it's a pre med school all year because

127
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:47,100
they're interested in public health and you want to work in global health.

128
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:52,740
So, you know, it's natural. You're going to be really interested in something and just talk about it forever.

129
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,440
So just kind of making sure you're not doing that.

130
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:02,909
But you know what, if you really are interested in something and you have little to show to talk to me outside, I'm happy to sit class at a time.

131
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,770
It's so outside of science class.

132
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:14,309
Time aside, if you want to chat to class or lead a session or something and again, being argumentative, it's difficult, you know,

133
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:22,650
to draw that line between, you know, you know, a good discourse and a good disagreement, which is very healthy and fantastic or just arguing.

134
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:31,920
So all great points. And what we'll do is we'll post these with the lectures line so they'll all be on lecture slides, speaking, refer back to these.

135
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:41,580
But I was great. Thank you. So we are now going to move back into into the lecture.

136
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:54,770
There you go. And we'll talk a little bit about the history of global health.

137
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,360
So it all kind of started in, you know,

138
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:06,380
the 12th century during the plague and then the outbreaks of cholera and smallpox and other large disease outbreaks.

139
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,420
And these diseases spread because of trade.

140
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:19,700
So, I mean, all types of trade around the world and people moving from place to place.

141
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:27,830
And they were they were massive. The bubonic plague, trade plague killed close to half of the affected populations in some places.

142
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,210
And back then, people didn't know what caused it.

143
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,660
You know, they thought maybe, you know, there's an issue with the arrows,

144
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:42,500
divine intervention or something else, but there was no kind of concept of pathogens or all that kind of thing.

145
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:48,319
So the first global health intervention or the first intervention you could consider kind of on the

146
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:56,990
global health side was invented in the 1700s where ships had a quarantine before entering port.

147
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,240
But the thing is, I don't think think back to the areas of global health.

148
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:07,370
It's a very kind of tropical medicine learning medicine mindset where we protect our own people beyond actually addressing what's happening.

149
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:13,250
And they were all at the local regional level rather than in a nation.

150
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,600
So, you know, in Venice, the Venetian said, we got to contain the ships to protect our people,

151
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:23,960
but they aren't saying we are going to work on the plague or whatever in the country where it came from.

152
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:36,500
And then, you know, as as the world became increasingly colonized, we kind of moved solidly into the tropical medicine,

153
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,840
colonial medicine area off of global health, and it went both ways.

154
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:50,749
So to call them doses of smallpox and measles and TB and all kinds of these, the countries where they colonized that same time when they went there,

155
00:28:50,750 --> 00:29:01,490
they were affected by malaria or tremendous meiosis, all different types of disease of pathogens that one found in in the country they came from.

156
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:11,930
And the colonial leadership imposed pretty draconian policies to make sure that our soldiers and their diplomats burned affected by these diseases.

157
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,850
The one I find most interesting is.

158
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:21,410
So the British government made all the soldiers train creaming every day.

159
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:26,960
And just like as an interesting kind of side story cleaning taste, disgusting.

160
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:32,240
So the British soldiers do, they mix it with gin, water, lemon and sugar.

161
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:39,080
And that's how the drink gin and tonic came to be, because British soldiers were forced to drain cleaning to prevent malaria.

162
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:47,360
But it was all about protecting the colonial workers and the soldiers and missionaries.

163
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,650
The British weren't giving cream into to people in these different countries.

164
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:55,160
It was all for their soldiers. And to be completely fair, that still happens today.

165
00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:03,890
MSF, Medicins Sans Frontieres or Doctors at Borders. I was speaking to one day responders a few years ago who was in Syria,

166
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:12,110
and they had enough antidotes for sarin gas for the international workers, but not for the Syrian doctors over there.

167
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,020
So this is this is still going on.

168
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:20,900
And the British army, when they send people abroad, they do a bunch of studies and a bunch of what looked to other British soldiers,

169
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:25,880
but nothing not too much on the people in the countries where they're working.

170
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:32,790
So this is not at all over. And this is also where sanitation kind of came into play.

171
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:38,450
They realized that the diseases can be fixed by improving sanitation hygiene.

172
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,480
So this is where the term sanitary medicine comes in.

173
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:51,500
But this is at this time, there's also a big focus on racial differences and people thinking that populations,

174
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:58,700
the countries they went to, had different medical needs and just different physiologies based on their race and doctors.

175
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:02,210
Medical doctors became almost instruments of racism over that.

176
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,159
One of the more famous examples is throughout Africa.

177
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:17,870
A lot of doctors, mostly they would just run these ridiculous studies on people living there, like just measuring all parts of their bodies and,

178
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:24,110
you know, just like just bad things over there because there's all different species to some extent.

179
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:30,259
But also, you know, they came up with these crazy areas like that.

180
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:37,280
Black people don't feel pain the same way white people do, which, you know, kind of perpetuates God racial mindset.

181
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,750
And the kind of mindset when you go in tropical medicine that these populations are quite different.

182
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:49,800
So Greece is asking, did social Darwinism factor into this to.

183
00:31:52,220 --> 00:32:03,950
It very well might have. I will look into some of the literature on that and we can and post it on on canvas.

184
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:13,770
Maybe we can chat about it a bit more in the next session. And then we kind of move into the early 19th, 20th century,

185
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:20,280
and that's when you start to get a lot the a lot of epidemics of cholera and yellow fever, for example.

186
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:30,450
And this prompted the International Sanitary Conferences, which were countries coming together to kind of solidify their quarantine strategies.

187
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,430
They still won, working on fighting epidemics in different countries of origin.

188
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:39,600
More How do we stop cholera and yellow fever from coming into our country?

189
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:45,210
From this, there was a few different organizations set up like the Pan American Health Organization.

190
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:53,850
My French is very bad. The Office Internationale de Hygiene Public and the Far East Association of Tropical Medicine,

191
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:59,100
which is just different companies trying to coordinate their efforts, mostly in quarantining.

192
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:06,600
And also after World War One, the League of Nations was founded to Treaty of ACI,

193
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,590
and the whole point of this was international cooperation to prevent another world war.

194
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:17,069
Obviously that was unsuccessful and you know, history repeats itself.

195
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:26,100
The US never joined this, but it's gotten really weak and weak and it's it's powerless.

196
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:34,230
But the kind of key point here is the League of Nations absolved all the other shows of this international Dutch in

197
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:44,190
Public Vice Association of Medicine to make the League of Nations Health Organization kind of a precursor to the W.H.O.

198
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:55,660
Then a few things happened in the early 20th century, which often don't end for us as well.

199
00:33:55,930 --> 00:34:01,989
The Panama Canal was completed and they were very,

200
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:09,880
very strict on controlling yellow fever and the Panama Canal so that people wouldn't be scared of transmitting it.

201
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:16,180
Today, with daily house inspections and fines of people who have mosquito lobbying and water supplies,

202
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,520
and this really set the basis for vector control to control malaria.

203
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,450
And that's something that you touch about in the infectious disease portion of the course.

204
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:38,680
Later on, the Rockefeller Foundation developed the yellow fever vaccine when I will mention his yellow fever has been around for a long,

205
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,970
long time, hundreds of years.

206
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:49,480
They only developed a vaccine when it became important to to high income countries, to the US, because now the Panama Canal is that you have to.

207
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,200
They didn't want their sailors and all those people getting yellow fever.

208
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:59,800
So in the US they said we need a vaccine and this is a theme which which repeats itself throughout.

209
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:12,820
Chloroquine was also invented to emulate creamy quinine is very difficult to to extract from I think it comes from that you know it treat.

210
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:24,040
And so in fact they could synthetically make it a substitute for it was pretty big for the area prevention and treatment efforts.

211
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:32,469
Penicillin was also discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928 and became widely available in mobile tube and again along malaria.

212
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:39,910
DDT was kind of refined and demonstrated to work to prevent breeding of mosquitoes.

213
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:49,940
So after World War Two, the League of Nations Health Organization was replaced by the W.H.O.

214
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:55,430
And the W.H.O. has a really interesting history.

215
00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:02,360
There's actually a lot of pushback when they saw the format and kind of got across the finish line

216
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:07,010
as they changed it from the International Health Organization to the World Health Organization.

217
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,880
And they were the first people to make the case this isn't a international problem.

218
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:17,870
Health transcends global boundaries. So it's world, not international at that time.

219
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:27,640
USAID was also developed to kind of coordinate U.S. foreign aid projects and goals.

220
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,509
They say it's fear of influence in the military.

221
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:42,770
But like we talked in the last session, every country that runs foreign aid programs or funding, they're all working towards the same goal.

222
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:47,690
You know, the military interventions, the hard power interventions, these are still soft power interventions.

223
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,880
You're going to have to get countries on your side, convince populations to be on your side.

224
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,129
These, you know, USAID, CBO and U.K. echo in Europe.

225
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,070
All the other ones didn't do this of the goodness of their hearts. Most of the time.

226
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:05,090
It's because there's some kind of reason why you want a country to be on your side.

227
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:18,920
So you send them money to build a hospital or whatever. And then we kind of moved into the era of international health, moved deeper into it,

228
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:31,970
where you first you get a malaria eradication campaign and then smallpox eradication, which is even a little bit more in the area of global health.

229
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:40,400
So the malaria eradication campaign failed because it didn't have a global component as no international country,

230
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:49,850
high income countries tried to intervene in low income countries by saying you need to spray DDT or CO2.

231
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:55,010
So creating a chloroquine and it just didn't work at all.

232
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:07,040
Smallpox medication did work quite well. So just as a little bit of a history of that, it started off kind of in the in in the early 1900s,

233
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,160
mid-to early 1900s, when the British tried to eradicate smallpox with the vaccine in India.

234
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:20,270
Now, naturally and rightfully so, the people living in India didn't trust the British with the vaccination programs.

235
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:23,630
They're like, absolutely, no, I'm not taking this vaccination. It's that kind of feeling.

236
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:34,370
But then in the 1950s, the the Pan American Health Organization started vaccinating in in the Americas, and that was actually quite successful.

237
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:46,310
Then the W.H.O. and the World Health Assembly decided they're going to try to eradicate smallpox globally.

238
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:50,750
They started off by saying they're going to be getting vaccinations.

239
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:54,170
And vaccinations are you find the case and you vaccinate all the contacts.

240
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:02,090
Now, the issue is there's not much surveillance for smallpox, so you can't do any vaccination if you can't find the cases.

241
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:08,210
They even tried. And you can see on the top, right. They tried offering money for people to find smallpox cases, but that was quite unsuccessful.

242
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,229
So they said, we're just going to vaccinate everybody.

243
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:16,730
And it was a it was a mammoth effort, but it was incredibly successful.

244
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:23,660
And seeing as smallpox now eradicated and there were a few lessons learned from that.

245
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:32,000
But the biggest one is the biggest reason why it's successful is they learn to work with, you know,

246
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:38,720
in-country actors and and harness local capabilities as opposed to saying W.H.O. is here,

247
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,270
CDC is here, whether from high income countries here and vaccinating them,

248
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:54,560
they put local ministries of health in charge and with technical guidance from from the CDC or the W.H.O.

249
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,270
And they also did a lot of creative mobilization activities.

250
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:07,190
They held massive dinners with different leaders at all different touch levels to say, how do we get your population immunized?

251
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:13,580
So massive community mobilization efforts and that's why it worked. And it's it's honestly crazy seeing.

252
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:19,030
We learn all these fantastic lessons of smallpox eradication. Why can't we do it today?

253
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,389
It's like every single epidemic and worldwide immunization program that comes around.

254
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:26,900
We just forget every single time the lessons from the past one.

255
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:42,759
And then there was a movement to to move into primary health care as opposed to just targeting, you know, diseases that are appealing at the time.

256
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:50,110
And this came from the World Health Assembly, where they realized that malaria advocation eradication was was a big failure.

257
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,730
And they said, you know, we this isn't working.

258
00:40:56,050 --> 00:41:02,709
What we need to do instead is build primary health care systems that people are looked after holistically as people,

259
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:09,190
so that education, the psychological welfare, economic welfare and health is all one thing to contribute to overall well-being.

260
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:21,420
And this was ratified by the Alma Astra conference in 1978, where they issued a declaration saying primary health care has to be built.

261
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,650
So primary health care systems have to be built in every single country to improve the health and well-being of the others.

262
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,000
The one who knows is actually convened by the USSR.

263
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:37,480
And chances are, I mean to answer that it wasn't taken very formally by the US.

264
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:44,170
So the US held their own conference where they pretty much said primary health care is absolute rubbish.

265
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:49,210
I mean, it's good on paper, but it's not going to work. It's not in the funding.

266
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:54,490
There's not enough impetus in countries and technical capabilities in different countries to do this.

267
00:41:54,970 --> 00:42:04,510
So they recommended something called selective primary health care, which is a mix between primary health care and disease specific strategies.

268
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:08,410
So you're not saying we are just going to eradicate malaria,

269
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:16,600
but you're saying we're going to do a few things to impact malaria and related diseases like diarrhea and and

270
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:22,330
conjunctivitis and all those different entities and mean build a small package of interventions to impact that.

271
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:28,930
But it's not at all general well-being. It's just more a package of interventions as opposed to siloed interventions.

272
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:40,880
And this was kind of. And following this under UNICEF released a similar declaration for children where they

273
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,160
proposed that selective primary health care interventions on girls oral rehydration therapy,

274
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,590
breastfeeding and immunization.

275
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:58,610
And I'm not sure yet if you've learned by the different types of public health interventions, if that comes later in one of your other classes.

276
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:04,070
But the three levels of public health intervention, this is different clinical intervention.

277
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:08,420
There's primary public health interventions which is preventing disease,

278
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:13,460
the secondary public health interventions, which is early screening and detection of disease.

279
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,129
And there's tertiary public health interventions,

280
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:24,490
which is early treatment of disease to prevent severe mobility and mortality and selective primary help.

281
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,240
Health care was really it wasn't primary health interventions.

282
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,100
It was mostly secondary health interventions.

283
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:38,359
So you can see this child trying to get from here to being a healthy child, but they fall in this gap because not to get the case,

284
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:45,510
they're just caught by a net, which is he has some oral rehydration solution or he has some hospital care so you don't die from diarrhea.

285
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,659
Here is your, you know, very quick nutrition programs.

286
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,160
You don't die from nutrition. But they get really close to this,

287
00:43:53,180 --> 00:44:00,620
which is why primary healthcare was a little bit of a failure and why there was a bit of a push back against it now.

288
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:13,820
So then we enter the neoliberal era of public health, where there was a quite a bit of pushback against something which is almost we're today.

289
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:24,170
Suppose that we had chose budget was frozen due to lack of funds and then the US started withholding their contributions to the W.H.O.

290
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:31,550
The reason being the W.H.O. wanted to provide low cost drugs to people who need it in different countries around the world.

291
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:34,720
And the US said no because the pharmaceutical companies.

292
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:41,030
Oh yeah, but there was quite a bit of money, which again is a whole different type of conversation.

293
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:52,040
At the same time, the influence of the World Bank Group and the the issue, depending on how you look at it for the World Bank,

294
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:57,470
is the World Bank doesn't give grants to countries, they give loans, and those loans have to be repaid with interest.

295
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:01,190
So now you're going from grantmaking to loan making.

296
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:09,950
And if countries are just financing themselves with loans, is that really going to pull themselves out of or let them advance up the income ladder?

297
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:13,849
It's the same thing as if you just paying off your credit card loans and more credit card loans.

298
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:17,060
At some point it's all going to catch up, which you can see it has been doing.

299
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:31,310
And at the same time, HIV was discovered and discovered in quotation marks because HIV has been around since the fifties, at least it was first.

300
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:38,780
You know, I was first in 1959 from a man in and from a Congolese man.

301
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:45,820
HIV was isolated from his blood, but it only got us in the mid 1970s.

302
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:49,430
So at that point there was a major push. And look what actually is going on here.

303
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,710
How can we what virus is this?

304
00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:01,139
And as was around the time that the extent of HIV was actually really being recognized, and we'll go into HIV a little bit more.

305
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:05,460
And one of the future lectures that we'll have an entire session on HIV.

306
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:15,350
And but the thing with HIV is it really pushed us from the international health area to the global healthcare.

307
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:20,479
It made different countries realize what happens in a low income country on

308
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,790
different countries is going to at some point catch up to the rest of the world,

309
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:32,840
especially for infectious diseases. And that's what made countries realize it's in our best interest, actually,

310
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:38,990
to intervene with diseases in the country where, you know, when it when it comes as opposed to waiting for it to get to us.

311
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:49,250
And you'll see the funding for HIV and AIDS programs really increase quite a bit over in the early 2000 because of this.

312
00:46:51,110 --> 00:47:04,730
But there's a lot of controversy when it comes to not especially HIV programing, but but global health programing in general.

313
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:13,100
A lot of times of people say when it comes to global health programing, as we say, HIV, for example, we need to be used to people in Africa.

314
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,190
There's no business in Africa. There's no condoms in South Africa.

315
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:21,290
You know, there's no prep in Zimbabwe, all that kind of stuff.

316
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:23,870
So the artificially creating scarcity.

317
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:36,850
But and this is a quote from Paul Farmer, just to just to summarize it, he was struggling and he was saying, there's no success in us.

318
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:41,270
My parents don't have scarcity. The medications, my my kids don't.

319
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,930
It's only scarcity for people who are black, brown or poor.

320
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,130
And that leads to all kinds of issues and also people accepting that scarcity, which is quite dangerous.

321
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,090
And then I just had this.

322
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:08,880
And now we move along. Now the movement, the global era of global health and global health.

323
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:18,060
And now we're moving into the next bit of global health, hopefully, or even what some are calling planetary health.

324
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:22,860
And that's why there's even more substantial partnerships, both internationally,

325
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:27,159
hopefully led by low income countries, but also public private partnerships.

326
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:33,120
So private companies taking on more of a role in global health interventions.

327
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,520
Whether or not you think that's good is up for discussion, but that is the case.

328
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:49,139
There's also more funding and more funding mechanisms, so more banks are actually putting money into global health,

329
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:55,650
even not just a World Bank, that proper for profit banks and more philanthropic organizations, too.

330
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:03,720
And they are increasingly funding low income country pockets directly, as opposed to needing them to have a high income country.

331
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:16,290
Who's the primary funding and then subbing to a low income country is also more costs for ethical global health practice, which is fantastic.

332
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,150
From what I see right now, it seems to be more a show, but hopefully soon will actually become more action than a show.

333
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:30,150
And example is, every time I submitted grant application, I've got a paragraph on how am I engaging in country actors?

334
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:38,100
And you know, it's kind of like something you put in that most people do the most and they don't take that section very seriously.

335
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:42,880
But hopefully in a few years that would be one of the major components of a grant application.

336
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,680
Is this actually something coming from a low income country or the country of working?

337
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:51,660
And is this something which is being led by people in the country where you're working?

338
00:49:55,930 --> 00:50:00,940
There's also more recognition on how diseases spread globally.

339
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:05,280
And COVID 19 was a massive example of that, that, you know,

340
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:12,430
in such a globalized world and we don't live in silos anymore, what happens in one country affects the world.

341
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:19,990
And then also a lot more on capacity building and development.

342
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:25,900
And there's two things that go into this. The first is training of people around the world.

343
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:30,159
And so not just sending in, you know, people from other countries,

344
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:38,800
but going in and making sure every country has done work for a second that can that can work in the health sector,

345
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:43,570
but also more emphasis on avoiding danger.

346
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:47,079
So a big issue you see is, for example,

347
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:53,870
health care workers often leave leave countries with lower rates of pay and move to different countries

348
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:59,799
for the high rate of pay and trying to avoid that as well and do that for increased salaries,

349
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:07,480
increased benefits. So people who work in those countries and also, you know, there's more emphasis now, transparency and accountability as well.

350
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:14,200
The aid world is very murky and varied in all kinds of stuff goes on all the time.

351
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,230
And there's very little oversight.

352
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:24,250
Most of the time, the amount of embezzling you'll see is a tequilas, and there's all kinds of other issues to touch on later.

353
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:28,480
But really cracking down on that too, which is fantastic to see.

354
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:40,140
And then just so you can see over time, this is where health funding comes from and left.

355
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:55,120
And big actors are still the US, UK and Europe, but you're still getting a little bit of money from the UN organizations and from the World Bank.

356
00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:03,340
But you can still see a lot of funding. It's still quite heavily controlled by governmental powers and in the US and Europe.

357
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:08,710
What I find really interesting those bands this money going and.

358
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:20,860
And while there is a benefit shift to attacking global problems, not just problems that are going to impact high income countries, it's still there.

359
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:25,890
One example I'll give you is the Ebola funding, which you'll see in 2014.

360
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:30,490
That's in time. You can actually see Ebola something because that's when Ebola was in the US.

361
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:39,399
So you still have that. But what is good is you're having an increase in this yellow line here, which is health system strengthening.

362
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:45,520
And that's really one of the big components in the future of improving health globally.

363
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:52,640
And just finally, we'll talk we'll talk briefly about major access and global health.

364
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:59,120
So there are few different models, multinational organizations, international organizations, which is the U.N. system.

365
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:05,899
Essentially, it is bilateral organizations of government run organizations, their NGOs and foundations.

366
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:11,180
So those are not government run, but also not for profit. And then you do have some private organizations.

367
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:16,040
The U.N. system is massive. You can do it. How close to the U.N. system?

368
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:21,690
So I'd encourage you all to look into it outside of class if your interests are taxable.

369
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:27,530
But the U.N. has a bunch of different organizations that are relevant to health, and they all do that work.

370
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:36,320
They are quite siloed in their work. But it is some some push to have them work more collaboratively together.

371
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,100
A good example is how they work on HIV and AIDS.

372
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:49,129
A few different organizations like UNICEF, W.H.O., UNFPA, UNDP and UNHCR banded together to make UNAIDS.

373
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:55,370
So there's substantial cooperation between different U.N. systems, different U.N. organizations.

374
00:53:56,450 --> 00:54:03,499
But it's still very, very siloed. And the U.N. also has a lot of internal issues as well.

375
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:11,480
The the corruption that is is ridiculous. The amount of money they throw out things is so ridiculous.

376
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:18,740
I mean, the salaries they pay are crazy. An example is someone with about two years of experience.

377
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:26,330
If you're working in the in an office, say, the Johannesburg office, Johannesburg,

378
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:32,120
the cost of living is less than half that U.S. You you're making about two years experience, about $100,000.

379
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:40,550
You don't pay taxes. You get $5,000 a month and you get all these ridiculous things, which is like you, you don't need that.

380
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:47,330
So there's there's really, you know, it's time for a big change in the UN system,

381
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:53,299
especially when it comes to how they manage their finances and this bilateral agencies arms.

382
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:58,129
These are from the high income countries to have government controlled development agencies

383
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:05,240
and these are mostly grantmaking agencies still fund an NGO to go and do their work.

384
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:10,790
But like I mentioned, these these aren't most of the time from the goodness of their hearts.

385
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:20,920
It's it's a calculated political move. Here are some examples of the bilateral aid agencies in the US and they quite a few.

386
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:28,459
So you have the CDC which funds most of the disease detection and control efforts.

387
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:33,380
You have the NIH funds, a lot of research, the DOD defense funds,

388
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:40,730
quite a bit of public health work globally too, but normally in a very calculated military way.

389
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:48,059
So I think I welcome the project and the to what a DOD funded work on HIV surveillance.

390
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:54,920
Surveillance among soldiers in the symptoms. It's only back to the Department of State as well and that's very calculated at political.

391
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:07,790
And then there's all kinds of other ones as well. And just as an aside, if any of you are working in the country and you're looking for easy funding,

392
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:11,990
you can just go to the U.S. embassy and say, hey, I'm from the University of Michigan.

393
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:19,670
Can I have like X amount of money to do some work? And chances are they're going to say yes, especially if it's all your students.

394
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:31,860
That's always something to look into. Then the NGOs and NGOs are still all over the place so they can be nonprofit or profit based.

395
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:34,930
Generally, when you say NGO, you do mean nonprofit.

396
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:39,340
They can be religious or secular, and even the religious ones,

397
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:43,450
they in different categories, they can just be religious on paper, but not proselytizing.

398
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:49,960
Or they can be, Hey, we're going to go out and just convert a million people to Catholicism.

399
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:56,560
That's somebody else they could want to do. They could be very narrow in their work, or they could do everything at all.

400
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:04,900
They can range from massive with billion dollar budgets to, you know, tiny ones in a few tens of thousands of dollars.

401
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:17,679
Something which comes up a lot is how, how, how staff and NGOs paid a big issue.

402
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:25,910
As you'll find in most NGOs. They pay international staff and local staff very, very different salaries.

403
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:34,780
And, you know, that's accepted USAID and FCPA and that CO they all have different salary calculations,

404
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:39,429
the local staff with Metro staff, and that causes a lot of problems, rightfully so.

405
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:43,480
It should cause a lot of problems, but we'll chat more about that later on.

406
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:48,010
They can focus on a single country or multiple countries or multiple regions.

407
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:55,450
And the other big differentiation is they can either focus on emergencies or non-emergency.

408
00:57:55,450 --> 00:58:03,339
So if you do do both emergencies and emergencies and then just a touch on the private organizations.

409
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:09,160
So the largest recipient of USAID funding is actually a for profit institution called IT'S.

410
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:15,540
I won't speak too much on camera, but I encourage you to look at them.

411
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:21,060
And one of our guest speakers in a few weeks actually works him on it, so you can feel free to ask him any questions you do.

412
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:26,550
And there are quite a few other ones. One is called John Snow.

413
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:30,590
John Snow is kind of cited as the father of epidemiology.

414
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:36,190
He was a British doctor who discovered that cholera is coming from a specific water.

415
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:44,210
But anyway, it's a it is a for profit organization named after them and their horrific day.

416
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:50,190
They've got the USAID budget for immunization in India, I think a few a decade or so ago.

417
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:57,810
And they absolutely botched it. They've been nothing over that. And all these private organizations, they they they run like that.

418
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:05,070
They very much do things on the cheap just to maximize profit. And a lot of times it doesn't really work very well.

419
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:13,320
But I hope we can talk more about that later on, especially when we chat to one of my friends about commodities in the streets.

420
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:18,320
But don't tell him I was like kind of talk about me about clients.

421
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:27,180
So and then the last thing just to mention is, is how goals are set in in global health.

422
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:35,790
So the first goal that was set, the first group of goals that was set was the Millennium Development Goals and at the time, the millennium.

423
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:46,830
And the whole point was to set out by the by the UN to set out achievable, sustainable, measurable goals for global development.

424
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:56,730
And these were the eight of them. So reducing poverty and and social exclusion, achieving universal primary education,

425
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,680
promoting gender equality and empowering women, reducing child mortality,

426
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:11,310
improving maternal health, combating HIV, AIDS and tuberculosis, ensuring environmental sustainability and building partnerships for development.

427
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:14,760
And it was incredibly successful.

428
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:24,240
The people living in extreme poverty, more than half the proportion of up under those people also almost halved as well.

429
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:31,020
School enrollment enrollment rates went up quite a bit, especially for girls.

430
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:35,760
Big fights against the AIDS of big gains against kids under five.

431
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:42,819
Maternal mortality went down, maternal mortality went down and access to safe water went up.

432
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:54,510
Quite sabbaticals. So this is very, very, very successful. So in 2015, as 2015 came up the UN so how do we build on the successes of the MDGs?

433
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:58,890
And what they came up with was the SDGs, the Sustainable Development Goals.

434
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,220
So the first one, the first goal is no poverty to end poverty in all its forms everywhere.

435
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:13,470
The second one is to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.

436
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:18,900
The third one is to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing at all ages.

437
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:24,360
Number four is ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education.

438
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:30,960
Number five is to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.

439
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:35,130
So I think that to say gender equity, they say equality.

440
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:42,880
Number six is the availability of water and sanitation.

441
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:48,640
Number seven is access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy.

442
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:54,280
Number eight is sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth.

443
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:58,750
With full time employment for all of those who can.

444
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:07,330
Number nine is to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation.

445
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:14,380
Number ten is to reduce inequality both within and between countries.

446
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:21,160
Number 11 is to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.

447
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:27,200
Number 12 is to ensure sustainable consumption and productive patterns.

448
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:31,700
13 is to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

449
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:39,410
14 is to conserve sustainability. Use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.

450
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:46,850
15 is to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems sustainably manage forests,

451
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:54,440
come back, deforested the desertification and halt and reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss.

452
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:59,420
16 is to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development,

453
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:05,720
provide access to justice for all, and build effective and accountable, inclusive institutions at all levels.

454
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:13,280
And 17 is to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize global partnerships for sustainable development.

455
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:22,550
So there's a lot in it's it's not a small thing, but it's really been adopted quite well.

456
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:27,260
Every time you submit a grant, whether it's a research of a program, anything,

457
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:34,670
if it if it's global in nature, there'll be a section on which SDGs does this impact.

458
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:40,250
When I apply for jobs half term, the question is what SDGs do you work on?

459
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,580
And you'll see that too. If you apply for jobs in global health.

460
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:51,560
And you know, the fact that they have these goals that fits with which, you know,

461
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:59,800
we're all working towards is really good at harmonizing the efforts and, you know, having all these many numbers on it yet.

462
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:05,840
But I'm sure it's going as well as the MDGs have. So we will.

463
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:15,540
We will. Before we move in discussion, I just want to pause and see if anybody has any questions on what we just talked about.

464
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:28,319
I have a question. Yeah. So in the past have there been so you mentioned how MDGs have been quite successful,

465
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:35,460
but have there been any other kind of global health initiatives or goals that weren't as successful?

466
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:45,180
So MDGs were kind of first international ones, which came off the top of my head though.

467
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:52,360
The UNAIDS had what's called a 19, 1990 goals, and that was by 2020.

468
01:04:52,980 --> 01:05:04,560
Worldwide, 90% of people would know the HIV status, 90% would be on antiretrovirals, and 90% would have viral suppression.

469
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:10,080
That has not been successful. A big reason actually being because of COVID.

470
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:13,830
They were on track. I mean, it was really tight.

471
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:19,560
They may or may not have made it, but there was a good chance by the end 2020 they would have achieved 1999.

472
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:23,790
But because of COVID, that was all trailing off completely.

473
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:28,620
But if anybody else has examples, how could you hear about those two?

474
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:41,130
Any other questions? Anybody else? So we'll move into discussion now.

475
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:46,770
And just to remind everybody, there's no pre-set discussion questions when you go into your group.

476
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:48,749
So you can kind of bring up,

477
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:56,940
discuss the questions you want to talk about or just kind of chat about something in a meeting or what a lecture that was of interest to you.

478
01:05:57,810 --> 01:06:02,490
But it's kind of li 206 for me, so four six for you.

479
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:05,910
So let's reconvene at about 4:15.

480
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:57,480
I think everybody should be back. So if someone from Room one could let us know what they talked about.

481
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:10,920
Sorry. Which group was group one? Yep. So group one was.

482
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,910
Jonathan was in my group. We don't have Madison. Marcus, maybe. Rachel.

483
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:21,800
Sarah. Okay. I think I'll just talk generally what we discussed.

484
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:29,690
So basically we're just talking about the 2015 new sustainability development goals

485
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:36,950
and how that they're more like not necessarily specifically public health focus,

486
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:41,809
but there are like hitting of factors that are like way more upstream from public

487
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:48,530
health that sometimes lead to these big discrepancies and disparities down the line.

488
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:52,489
And we found it interesting that a lot of these goals,

489
01:16:52,490 --> 01:17:02,650
like especially focused on like climate change or combating climate change and environment as opposed to like on the individualistic level.

490
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:14,630
And we're kind of like pondering how like maybe COVID 19 might've delayed potentially meeting some of these goals by 2030.

491
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:21,080
Yep. So yeah, absolutely a completely right.

492
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:26,569
They are meant to be kind of big lofty goals and that people will work off kind of one component of them.

493
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:32,420
And they do have there's like a 2000 page document that describes all them, has some some goals in there as well.

494
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:38,510
And COVID 19 had a massive, massive impact on the SDGs and human development in general.

495
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:42,920
I think they set back some of these things, you know, at least five or six years.

496
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:48,979
So massive one. So thank you to Amir.

497
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:52,160
Caroline, Christine. Elise, NAV.

498
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:05,680
I can speak. So we were we when we went over a couple things,

499
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:09,339
we were like talking about the readings that we did and the video that we all

500
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:18,730
watched and about how passionate he was speaking and how we really respected

501
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:24,520
how he was a bit scathing about the comments he was he was speaking and how

502
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:29,770
they were not following the goals that he believed global health should have.

503
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:39,909
And I thought that was really admirable. And we were talking about the readings about how how we label countries like low

504
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:44,380
and middle income countries as unskilled and high income countries as skilled,

505
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:50,800
takes away credit from researchers and future job opportunities from them as well.

506
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:59,320
If someone else can remember, one of the other things we talked about, we were we went over a couple of different topics.

507
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:04,959
So talked about the ESG very shortly, very briefly.

508
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:11,380
We talked about the goals in particular and how it would be very helpful to include,

509
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:19,200
as we were if we were to actually look into them as they're, as you described,

510
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:24,970
the very lofty, really heavy goals and actually thinking about it,

511
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:33,100
considering that reaching some of those goals that you mentioned, they have some sort of goals themselves.

512
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:42,280
They're pretty big goals, like any world hunger or ending hunger in general for ending poverty or sustaining clean water.

513
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:47,829
So in my personal opinion, we're reaching a by 2030.

514
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:50,650
It seems that reaching some of those goals might be.

515
01:19:51,710 --> 01:20:00,070
Too much of a task, but it seems that it's a good effort, you know, and it's a good thing to look towards.

516
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:05,950
But I think we talked about that. Good.

517
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:16,220
Thanks. Yeah. Just going off where you mentioned is a massive, massive effort to try to reach those close, particularly especially to Mexico.

518
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:25,250
So who knows? And then on the video, if anybody has a Twitter, I'd recommend following.

519
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:29,660
He was Dr. Gupta Pi on Wikipedia on Twitter.

520
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:38,060
If you thought he was very outspoken on that video, he is way more outspoken on Twitter is one of the best accounts I follow.

521
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:46,760
And then I sat in a group to somebody else I think you mentioned was papers and also Syrian papers, is that correct?

522
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:53,959
Like I said, at least not enough knowledge, so to say, you know, it's it's a big problem,

523
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:56,960
everybody, because because of the way the institutions are set up.

524
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:00,229
So if I want to say I'm just a lecturer or not,

525
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:07,040
if I want to become attorney professor or if I want to keep my job or if I want to do anything in academia,

526
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:12,290
the first thing they look at is how many publications that I get, how many first author publications that I get.

527
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:21,590
And in that way, it's, you know, even for people who want to do good, you're kind of thinking, well, you know, I can ask, you know,

528
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:30,190
one of my colleagues in in Bangladesh to be the first daughter or I can do it and then, you know, I'll get that kind of acquisition I want.

529
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:35,020
So then institutions are not set up well for that kind of thing at all.

530
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:41,410
The solution be reached by this I reached is co-first authorship on papers.

531
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:43,960
So I'll share first sort of ship.

532
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:55,510
But with people, you know, the people who I work with, which seems to be working quite well, but it's a massive problem and you know,

533
01:21:55,570 --> 01:22:00,980
you'll get at anything as well when it comes to people who don't work in research group up on the program side as well.

534
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:07,720
How many crimes did you witness need? And it's just a massive problem everywhere you look.

535
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:11,840
And then moving on to the last room for Chris Jacob.

536
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:24,470
Q Maria, Ricky Luce, Sophie opens. I'm sure I can chime in.

537
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:32,760
I'm not sure I'm going to remember everything that we spoke about. I think we covered some of the bases already through group one and Group two.

538
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:39,690
We did spend a good amount of time talking about how tricky it must be being in the position of a

539
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:48,059
researcher and maybe perhaps getting funding from these organizations that are inherently flawed,

540
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:52,709
and then also wanting to criticize those organizations but not wanting to lose your funding.

541
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:59,940
We're not sure what that process is like, but that brought us to a little discussion on the video.

542
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:09,090
And once again, as Ali said about her group, how scathing reviews were, his opinion was the Canadian government action.

543
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:15,479
And we thought that was very brave of brave of him.

544
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:21,120
And we respected his opinions as well. But we also reflected on how difficult that must be.

545
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:27,900
I think we also brought up points about like and more about flaws of institutions and how

546
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:36,360
several of them are very corrupt and profit oriented and how that's hindering global health.

547
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:46,680
And we also brought up who? Q You had a really good point, and it's it's fading on me right now.

548
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:51,960
At the end of our group, if you want to bring that up to.

549
01:23:55,250 --> 01:24:05,570
Yeah. I got to the point about it's easy to criticize institutions, but who has the right, who has the freedom to do that?

550
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:10,200
The freedom of speech and who feels comfortable doing that?

551
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:22,940
For example, I was bringing up my own example because I come from a communist country where criticism isn't taken very it's not very safe to say,

552
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:27,589
and I can go straight to jail if I say anything bad about the government or like certain organizations.

553
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:36,860
So who has the freedom? And even if we observe these things, do the people in that country has a platform to voice out those concerns?

554
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:42,670
Yeah, that that's a really important point.

555
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:48,040
At all levels, I mean, especially the level of, you know,

556
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:53,830
people in countries with more restrictive or oppressive policies, it's very difficult for them to speak up,

557
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:56,260
which actually at that point,

558
01:24:56,410 --> 01:25:05,410
sometimes having international actors come in with less than the ideal amount of global participation might be necessary.

559
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:07,899
The last 2 minutes I'll chat about this.

560
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:14,500
Basically, there's a few actors that the International Federation of the Red Cross and MSF, based on somebody is there,

561
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:19,710
the two big organizations that don't need permission, they'll say they don't need permission to come to country.

562
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:26,410
They will just show up and start doing their work, you know, without being invited at some point to be kicked out.

563
01:25:26,410 --> 01:25:31,420
But that's what they do. And, you know, because of that, sometimes it does.

564
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:37,450
Sometimes that needs to happen obviously very carefully. But again, at all levels even over here,

565
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:43,900
I can't go and tweet about how the NIH funding is horrible because then I won't win the ground somewhere or, you know,

566
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:46,610
somebody's working for, you know,

567
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:54,430
Clinton help access contribute about how USAID funding is is colonial in nature because then they'll stop immigrants from that.

568
01:25:54,430 --> 01:26:02,580
So it's a really tough situation. The only people who really can do it and that it's going to be privileged is people who have retired.

569
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:09,940
And it's kind of at this point, you know, old white men, for the most part, allowed them to use their platform for good.

570
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:13,389
But, you know, a lot of them, you know, don't they just semiretired.

571
01:26:13,390 --> 01:26:16,840
So whatever. Okay. So that's really fantastic discussion.

572
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:23,770
Great points from all the groups. Any other questions before we just briefly mention what we'll do next week?

573
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:40,880
Awesome. So next week, on Tuesday, you will have the session with Gurpreet Rana, the absolutely amazing global health information librarian.

574
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:45,370
And Jonathan, no readings from Preet, right?

575
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:52,540
There have not been any. But she does have something that she would like right before class.

576
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:56,180
I'll make sure to do an announcement for you all. I don't think she did.

577
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:58,010
So it's been sending to you? I don't think she'll go.

578
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:09,080
I did post a discussion on canvas about how different as a global how it would respond to the floods in Pakistan.

579
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:13,250
Some of you respond, which is fantastic. If you haven't, please do respond to that.

580
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:18,590
For those who have responded to it, I added one more kind of optional reading on that you might find interesting.

581
01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:24,440
We're just going to have a look, but that's completely optional and then start thinking about the assignments you do.

582
01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:31,669
So like we mentioned last week, they'll be six assignments of two big papers and you can do different context to that.

583
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:36,410
But I think it's best if you just pick one subject, you get a really deep understanding.

584
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:39,830
Just think about what context you want to pick for that.

585
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:43,580
And next week, on Thursday, I'll talk about that further.

586
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:52,970
And next week, Thursday will be a session on health and urban settings and that two meetings on campus about that.

587
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:57,350
So that is all for today, if anybody else is.

588
01:27:57,350 --> 01:28:03,620
Any other questions. Jonathan and I will stick around for a few minutes now, but if not, have a lovely weekend.

589
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:11,020
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

590
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:24,160
Thank you. Oh, yeah.

591
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:30,360
Your God. Do you want to stop recording, Ryan? Oh, yeah. Any questions, or were you just waiting to go with the canvas?
