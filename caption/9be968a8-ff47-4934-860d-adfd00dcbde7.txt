00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:13,047
Welcome to the online motivational interviewing course, I'm Ken Resnicow,

2
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:14,062
your tour guide.

3
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:18,760
I've been involved in my research and practice since 1994, for

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,821
me learning and I was life changing both at work and at home.

5
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:27,723
Since my conversion, I've been involved in almost 50 MI studies, we've used MI

6
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:32,626
across all sorts of practitioners, from community health workers to physicians,

7
00:00:32,626 --> 00:00:36,028
across all sorts of settings, from churches to clinics.

8
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:41,916
And even through digital applications that have learned to detect reflections and

9
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:42,680
empathy.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,817
Now, while it was originally used as a method to treat substance misuse over

11
00:00:46,817 --> 00:00:51,278
the years, it's been used in almost every nook and cranny of health care, diet,

12
00:00:51,278 --> 00:00:56,023
exercise, obesity, medical adherence, injury prevention and cancer screening.

13
00:00:56,023 --> 00:01:00,114
Diabetes, kidney disease, organ Donation and even COVID-19 vaccination.

14
00:01:00,114 --> 00:01:04,559
Learning and practicing MI showed me there's a different way to communicate,

15
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,809
a different way to listen, a different way to persuade and

16
00:01:07,809 --> 00:01:10,881
a different way to go about the art of behavior change.

17
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:14,036
It taught me the power of reflective listening and

18
00:01:14,036 --> 00:01:16,446
the futility of unsolicited advice.

19
00:01:16,446 --> 00:01:22,253
Rather than steering, we become the rudder rather than directly guide.

20
00:01:22,253 --> 00:01:26,279
This has made me increasingly aware that if people are going to change,

21
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:30,653
they do it best when it's on their terms on their schedule for their reasons.

22
00:01:30,653 --> 00:01:35,756
The change should be volitional, it should feel meaningful and manageable, pressuring

23
00:01:35,756 --> 00:01:40,267
people through guilt and shame is not only ineffective but can even be harmful.

24
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:44,327
Our job, it turns out is to help people find their why, help them find

25
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:48,807
a compelling reason to do what they can do to make what can be an unpleasant and

26
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:53,569
difficult change, to quote Victor Frankel to find meaning in their suffering.

27
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:57,893
Over the upcoming weeks, we're gonna describe what MI is, how it differs from

28
00:01:57,893 --> 00:02:01,648
other styles of communication and other models of behavior change.

29
00:02:01,648 --> 00:02:05,966
We'll demonstrate the key skills that comprise the MI such as reflective,

30
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:08,529
listening and listening to change talk, and

31
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:12,185
we'll give you ample opportunities to practice these skills.

32
00:02:12,185 --> 00:02:16,908
If I do my part, you will know time begin to see how these techniques can help you

33
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:19,281
both professionally and personally.

34
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:22,609
Welcome, let's get started.
