1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:32,990
I think. Yes.

2
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:41,930
Yeah. I think I.

3
00:00:41,930 --> 00:01:02,120
Yeah. Why do you?

4
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:18,310
Know. It's pretty ridiculous. Yeah, I agree.

5
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:30,120
I mean, there are some. It's like it's a more.

6
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:38,610
Weekend. Panopto.

7
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:48,930
We're. He's.

8
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:57,360
She's excited about it.

9
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:07,020
Okay, so this hour at 10:00, so let's get started today, so there's discussion session.

10
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:18,210
We were forced to reveal some of the key points from the Tuesday lecture, and that can be done the first.

11
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:30,330
Maybe we can go through the example from the meta analysis that we have talked about in class.

12
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:41,820
So though it seems to me analogous is to try to looking at the association between the menopause hormone therapy and cancer.

13
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:50,310
And the first thing is to determine the research question and for the research question, you can't have one.

14
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,780
Oh, you can. How logical that in this case is.

15
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,610
You know how to me research practical.

16
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:06,750
That's of course, associations between the use of the Astrakhan along therapy.

17
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:20,010
And the second is to use the AstraZeneca plus the process he Hamasaki served together and kind of the two different exposure.

18
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,930
So let me ask her, we have this side of our research questions,

19
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:36,330
and the next step is to search the literature and you're want to identify a particular study and you need to think carefully

20
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:47,280
about all of the research firm of our needs to use to character all of the relevant studies and that for this term,

21
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,150
this includes ovarian cancer and maybe yoga also about to include seeing that overall tumor or other heart

22
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:02,730
related harm using that they would use in that regard so that you can kind of search all the related study.

23
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,430
And also when you search, maybe you can have her.

24
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:16,260
You also want to go through the reference of this paper so that you won't miss and your latest study in the reference paper.

25
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:29,550
And another thing is that you see these two when a search was conducted so that if more activated, the research may have come out since then.

26
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,810
You can know, is that what's your sense of? What's your research gone?

27
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:43,230
And you can you rather continue your research over time just to start from the last time you have the best search?

28
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:53,550
So after the search, you need to who put in effect ask made from the paper that much the inclusion criteria.

29
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,950
So not all of the paper you have search that would be included in your final study.

30
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:05,670
So you have to decide what your inclusion and the crucial criteria, for example.

31
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:11,670
Sometimes we do not want to include the hospital based the kids gone study on, you know,

32
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:22,140
our main personalities because maybe we completely Saturday the what the base population are with those case Congress study are like we helped.

33
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,740
Our study are really large hospital.

34
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:34,740
That's a you have at hospital and meet the people from all other counties will go to this hospital or maybe one day or just doing our research,

35
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:42,060
just the people from Ann Arbor, Michigan, out of the hospital. So it's we decided where she is our base population.

36
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:54,800
So sometime we would excludes the hospital based the case cohort study so that you can't give us a more comenzo meta analysis of.

37
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,250
OK, so finally, you want to use all of the.

38
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:08,050
That's the measure of association you have got from the papers to calculate the summary afterwards.

39
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:15,940
And here this blog, it would cause for arrest plot and is what we used to present data for.

40
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,380
Analysis on the x axis for this part,

41
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:30,640
is the measure of association and of that access is the individual studies and name of the individual study and the right thoughts.

42
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:41,230
As a pod academy, it is upon asking it from each of the study and the list so you can see some corresponding confidence intervals.

43
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:46,630
So the is a lie. You see how our confidence and allows.

44
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:54,070
You know that maybe it's a large study and we want to create a large weighted on this study.

45
00:06:54,070 --> 00:07:03,760
And the final shapes as a bottom is to compare the estimation of the included study so that

46
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:12,190
the last two roll so come bad is kind of like your final result when your match analyzes.

47
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:21,380
And we can see that the combined measure of association is about one to two in this case.

48
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:28,630
And we also want to know does this are used for failure of use?

49
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:36,470
Also ask for against therapy. And oh, we can say for all the confidence, even these are really narrow confidence.

50
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:49,300
And also the combined are so that we can conclude that this ah, this association is statistically significant.

51
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,480
And another thing about a couple of days is that they have all of this is the hazard benefit.

52
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:01,630
So we would do a statistical analysis and get a p value.

53
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:10,450
And this p value is you go to part one, so is larger as the old five.

54
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,380
So the p value is not statistically significant.

55
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:22,510
We're going to have to lose that. There is no hazard done off the fact that with regard of this particular association,

56
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:37,060
so to our SAT and the research concern is the association between the use falls to Africa as a process progestin therapy and the risk of the cancer.

57
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:45,370
So this is kind of the Sergeant First Class, the first of for our side and the research question.

58
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:54,100
So it's really similar like the how blue they are is one five one and is also

59
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:00,160
statistical significance and the P value for had their identity is past twenty 24,

60
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,570
which is also louder, up by five point five.

61
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:11,200
So he's not there. He's got a similar therapeutically significance.

62
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:22,990
OK, so here is all things that we're underpowered for Amanda and the others, so you just need to know that's a generous dove for the meta analysis.

63
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,730
And also like, what's your issue?

64
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:34,000
Maybe not hasty is that for lack of inclusion, exclusion or something.

65
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:44,850
So we do not want to really any or nods about this during the exams.

66
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:53,610
So the nice thing is just the reviews of the computer output, the coward for Harmony,

67
00:09:53,610 --> 00:10:02,550
for this second half of the semester, so well, the observed association between exposure and outcome.

68
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:08,760
The first question they should ask is whether this acceleration is real or not.

69
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:17,790
Our confidence that this association is now due to something that bias or arrow, if we are seeing is not real.

70
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:23,880
So we are seeing that maybe that is due to bias or systematic arrow.

71
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:31,890
So we have talked about different types of bias and how they can influence our results.

72
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:44,460
So if we see anything that is not really ready to check our study design or something to know which kind of bias there is.

73
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:50,290
So on the other hand, we are thinking this association is real.

74
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:59,130
We need to think about if these associations due to certain observable and for a certain variable,

75
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:06,610
if there is truly a third variable involved, then there is maybe two possibility in our class.

76
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:12,180
Why is the confounding or the other is in fact modification?

77
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:22,020
So we will review how to identify whether there is a that modification or not, the flag.

78
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:31,410
So in this slide, we assume that if there is no third variable, then it may be kind of Langeveldt.

79
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:45,300
Could this association with you cancel them out? So if we think this is kind of maybe due to due to that cancel something we want,

80
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:54,630
you maybe tax a P-value obsess over Asia to say, why is there the evidence for the correlation is strong or not?

81
00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:06,660
And another thing that is kind of could help us to decide whether there is a causal relationship or not is not what our study cited.

82
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,130
The study is that is a core part of our safety.

83
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,300
We are very proud to temporarily between the exposure and outcome.

84
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,820
So maybe it's a cultural one.

85
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:27,130
If there is a perception that there is no temporarily of the association, the p values of the is really large or something.

86
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:35,340
So maybe it's that business association was just due to chance.

87
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:45,390
So the last thing is a summary graph of the process that you were taken into the compounding effect modification.

88
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:52,890
So the first thing we're going to do is to calculate the crude association between the exposure and outcome.

89
00:12:52,890 --> 00:13:03,660
The after the new there's a crude as a ratio of about two also calculate strontium specific measure of association.

90
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:11,970
If there is a third, a third of our volume down and assume that this sort of error about is sex.

91
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:20,700
So we want to calculate our for the female group and amountof respectively.

92
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,810
So after we have calculated stratum specific,

93
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:33,480
while we're about to note that whether this you are for spouse group, the same or not, if they are not the same,

94
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:43,290
so they are matched, the exact modification that's the effect of the exposure to the outcome is different for yours,

95
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,860
truly different for the female adult male group.

96
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:56,160
So in this case, maybe we want to give part of stratum specific or other hand allergens.

97
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,940
Those fragments that they are, all are is the same.

98
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:10,920
The the that's the same way about we do is to compare our spread of specific or our rates of crude association is just

99
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:20,070
a calculated way for us to calculate it and to compare this to are we allowed to based on the 10 percent through?

100
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:30,960
Yeah. Of the first numbers that mean that if there is larger than 10 percent difference

101
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:37,080
between the crude method of association and the stratum specific macro off association,

102
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,100
then they see that the crude or our allies.

103
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:53,310
Now can you people to describe some specific or and this is not equal to maybe there is a confounding that the sexes,

104
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,780
the confounding between the exposure and the outcome and if there is a cop out,

105
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:10,320
everyone who adjusted these half out in your model, oh, and reported the same or am I sure like after adjusting to the confounding?

106
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,840
And if we see that's the crude oil, our is equal to the stratum specific?

107
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:25,650
Or are there maybe there is no confounding or interaction between this association,

108
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:34,170
between the exposure and Thomson, we can simply adjust the reported for the crude.

109
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:49,600
So, oh, so so is there any other question about how to identify the bombing or what they've done, but obviously.

110
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:59,800
So if not, we can just go ahead. And how did they engage in 1910?

111
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:11,200
So maybe they will go back, and maybe at 10, 15, then we will you and me and go through the gate learning together.

112
00:16:11,200 --> 00:20:17,100
So you have maybe about thirty five minutes to this.

113
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:39,330
And here's. Is.

114
00:20:39,330 --> 00:22:18,600
And. Yeah.

115
00:22:18,600 --> 00:23:20,730
It's a short. And it's too late to talk to you because I speak with the.

116
00:23:20,730 --> 00:24:31,490
Yes. Yes. This.

117
00:24:31,490 --> 00:31:27,390
We're. Yeah.

118
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:52,270
And if. It's.

119
00:31:52,270 --> 00:34:50,940
Thank you. I was thinking.

120
00:34:50,940 --> 00:35:19,070
Yeah, I know. I was.

121
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:47,160
That. About 30.

122
00:35:47,160 --> 00:36:43,580
Oh. Typekit.

123
00:36:43,580 --> 00:38:08,030
Yeah. Yes.

124
00:38:08,030 --> 00:42:04,760
And the. Yeah.

125
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:48,790
You. Yes.

126
00:42:48,790 --> 00:43:08,640
We'll be. You have listened to the whole.

127
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:20,460
So we say with.

128
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:47,050
But you really. Think.

129
00:43:47,050 --> 00:44:36,060
It's a. Yeah.

130
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:46,530
Yes. Because it's not doing anything, it's.

131
00:44:46,530 --> 00:45:19,420
Yeah. No.

132
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:45,310
Good news. So you can.

133
00:45:45,310 --> 00:46:01,070
Yeah. It's.

134
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:16,180
It's. Yes.

135
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:24,310
Yeah. Yes, I.

136
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:48,440
And the Russians to have to go. Yeah, OK, only.

137
00:46:48,440 --> 00:47:25,440
I was assigned. Yeah.

138
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:52,390
Yes. But we do.

139
00:47:52,390 --> 00:48:06,250
I do this it just so it would be really the end of the festival over that period, I guess.

140
00:48:06,250 --> 00:49:22,420
Yeah. You know that.

141
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:45,500
You know. The president really.

142
00:49:45,500 --> 00:50:15,170
And. And businesses and businesses, just like the.

143
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:32,650
He did reference. They could be.

144
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:37,950
He in the end, was. And.

145
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:52,830
There is a fear that we're not sure if that makes sense the.

146
00:50:52,830 --> 00:51:06,390
Yes, it's good that they call. But that.

147
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:21,240
I don't think it's really that. Really?

148
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:34,140
There you. Yeah. So he is his father, he was the manager.

149
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:47,310
She referred to the line of work, which is another $100 million, so.

150
00:51:47,310 --> 00:52:07,880
They have been. Just to be clear, have.

151
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:22,810
First thing. You know, people.

152
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:33,530
OK, so you can't just go through this crash together.

153
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:40,400
So first, maybe we can go see the scenery of this conference,

154
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:50,730
so we have made a kosher dog from the dogs to help us work through all of the information we can.

155
00:52:50,730 --> 00:53:01,120
So it has said that the researcher can shoot bad or ask me the association between obesity and the kidney disease.

156
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:11,550
And so the exposure itself basically and the outcomes of kidney function.

157
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:24,180
And I've also said this is an important question since the risk Abdul basically increased the waist age into adulthood.

158
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:33,570
So there is an arrow from the age to the elbows, which is what we get from this sentence.

159
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:39,210
And also, the obesity is a risk factor for diabetes.

160
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:51,180
So there is also another variable in strategy, and obesity is a risk factor that there is an arrow found out basically to diabetes.

161
00:53:51,180 --> 00:54:01,740
And also, it is well known that that that beauty and a bath associated with worse kidney function.

162
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:08,760
So you can see exactly how arrow from the diabetes to kidney function and about Alzheimer at

163
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:15,090
all from the age to consumption because there are false risk factors for kidney function.

164
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:21,570
So it is all the that's potential association meta of this variable.

165
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:29,820
And if we have all them in the stacks and the second paragraph is about the study design,

166
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:44,280
that the study design is a cohort study and the study participants all aged 50 to 55 and age one to examine the association between the BMI,

167
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:51,000
which is a measure of obesity and the failure of kidney function.

168
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:59,820
So we know that there is five years change measurements between the exposure and the outcome.

169
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:14,050
So there is a cohort study has that Panopto rob have had to be between the exposure and outcome and the Kennedy days and measured back any function.

170
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:23,160
OK, so here is all the information we have now, so we can't go through the pattern together.

171
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:28,650
Mm-Hmm. So the first question is in the general population,

172
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:37,440
with the back age to be a potential co-founder of the relationship between the eye and the payment options.

173
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,030
So what's your answer, do you think? Yes.

174
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:53,660
So maybe within there years or so.

175
00:55:53,660 --> 00:56:03,590
The answer is yes, because in the general population, and that's the key part we think is confounding,

176
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:12,320
is that age is both associated with obesity and is also associated with the kidney function issues.

177
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:17,020
Our outcomes so is associated with both the exposure and outcome.

178
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:28,650
And another important thing is that because the confounding cannot be in the cultural cost relating to the exposure and outcomes of drugs,

179
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:36,140
the Arawak has stayed there the fast arrows from the age to the exposure and from the age of two the outcome.

180
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:45,650
So there is no causal pathways that there is no arrow that goes to the aids, to the kidney function.

181
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:55,020
So yes, in the general population, age is truly a potential confounding.

182
00:56:55,020 --> 00:57:02,070
So the second question is, is a cofounder in this particular study?

183
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:12,920
Why, oh, why not? So who think the age is too confounding?

184
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:26,180
So the answer is, maybe now because we can see that in this particular study, aid is restricted.

185
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:31,460
Was a five year it five year range, that's a 50 to 55 years.

186
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:39,810
So it's kind of like the age has a limited variability in this situation.

187
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:50,030
If this is a statistical model is kind of like we have controls age, oh, we have make a yes, but the big stratum.

188
00:57:50,030 --> 00:58:02,360
So in this case, there would be no compounding that's caused by age between the obesity and the kidney function.

189
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:08,690
And you guys is at least you have a five year range for the age.

190
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:18,500
And the reason is that maybe we were restricted to a specific range age that's a 50 or just 55.

191
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:26,240
The maybe we cannot have enough participants in our study because the age restrictions across the state.

192
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:33,740
So that's a way we can apply to those 50 to 55 as our year age range.

193
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:40,980
So there we have more participants in our study.

194
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:53,680
Focus. So if not, we can go to another that is diabetes compounding in this study.

195
00:58:53,680 --> 00:59:06,870
So who think that it is? Okay, so, uh, so we can see the from that.

196
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:15,900
There's a difference from the diabetes and age is maybe the direction of things, Carol.

197
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:25,890
So we can see that diabetes can now we can go through the obesity,

198
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:34,200
diabetes and then through the arrow they have from that gulf around that that beat me to the kidney foundation.

199
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,120
That's her age. They tell us,

200
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:51,560
we just see that we cannot go through the obesity to the kidney Silver Age because that's the contraction of the arrow is not allowing us to do that.

201
00:59:51,560 --> 01:00:00,050
So because this is so sad that beauty is not her co-founder in this situation,

202
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:08,360
because in the causal pathway and this cultural pathway is that we have given the information that

203
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:16,220
obesity is a risk factor for the diabetes and that it is a risk factor for worse kidney function.

204
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:27,060
So it's kind of like these cultural things from the obesity rubbed obesity to diabetes and found out that if you took me back to Adelaide,

205
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:36,740
you're not allowed to flog this hawker pathway. And that's why the diabetes is not a on the end of this study.

206
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:47,680
So, OK, so let's say in the description. Risk factors like that.

207
01:00:47,680 --> 01:01:06,500
His kidney function, which was actually. Because in fact, I mean, you are going to have to read about this, right, so like to written about her.

208
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:12,950
So this question that I'm just asking if this question were worded differently.

209
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:19,910
Uh-Huh. And did not explicitly say or better believe that it was a risk factor.

210
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:30,160
Uh huh. And the only fact that dining is. Then.

211
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,760
Lovely to be with you, do not smoke.

212
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:46,470
Love, you only know that there is also a issue and you do not know which health we here, then you can now see why there is a lot less than that now.

213
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:54,480
Is that co-founder? Because you do not know the direction that only it is cannot can possibly be found,

214
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,660
but says you do not know why there is that beauty that house the opposite.

215
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:01,860
You can all see that happening.

216
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:12,370
And there he's kind of like, we asked him a real Panopto satisfied with the direction of the arrow so that we know then which house.

217
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:17,190
We do not know that maybe is a and maybe it's not.

218
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:21,900
Please miss Panopto. We cannot really be sad about that.

219
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:32,750
All right. Thank you. The.

220
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:44,390
So it's not nice, that's the other question is, should that with your status be adjusted or in this study?

221
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:57,700
So do you think this should be adjusted? So that we only around adjusted for the confounding.

222
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:16,730
So since that is, are the causal pathway and is not a confounding, so we do not want to adjust for gravity in this situation.

223
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:29,070
And we'll go to our last question, if ever that is another slightly depressing area that they consider a slightly different

224
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:36,930
scenario where the cohort study participants who are in the age range of 15 to 18,

225
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:49,530
I, as the table below showed the results data from the study, so we can see that age range is much wider than just an outlet.

226
01:03:49,530 --> 01:04:00,780
Just nice. Just a 50 to 55 now. Two eight my so age as account age may be up at an accompanying birthdays class

227
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:14,390
and ask us to use the data to evaluate whether the age is truly a Capaldi allows.

228
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:27,980
So that this is the slides from our Nocturne that reveal how we assess whether there is the aid is a company or not the of the staff.

229
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:33,050
The first step is to populate the crew to measure how fast operation.

230
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:43,070
And so I can trust that between the exposure and the compound, there is a, you know, our situation.

231
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:50,480
And the third is just the association between the outcome and the outcome and the quality of

232
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:59,750
the orbiter to Asia is the kidney function as a and it's only among the nine exposure pool.

233
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:07,970
And the four is to consider whether they're putting a is on the culture plus maybe 20 his outcome.

234
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:18,450
And this stuff is you do not need to calculate who just made sure that was just the two things that maybe thought that.

235
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:24,950
So something and all of that was either there is the causal pathway that to go through the age,

236
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:32,960
and the fifth is to calculate some measure of association between exposure and outcomes guided by the paternal grandfather.

237
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:42,230
So it's kind of like we're stratified by age. And of course, we did that because we have to age group from our data.

238
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:55,640
So maybe you stratified r o r, you turned up the D and the kidney function, and the last is to compare the crude nature of association.

239
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:10,890
We have calculated in the forces that choose a stratified sniper off US location to evaluate whether there is a difference.

240
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:21,450
Using our 10 percent through were just introduced. Okay, so this is a generous dives.

241
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:30,270
And another thing is that when you calculate that you want to know which measure of association you want to calculate,

242
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:39,390
like whether we would use R R O R O Providence ratio.

243
01:06:39,390 --> 01:06:46,650
So how do decide that is just from the center where they have given that in this study?

244
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:50,800
Are we how that is a cohort study?

245
01:06:50,800 --> 01:07:01,800
And we know that the kidney function is a five-year change of kidney function, so we can see that there is a time to run their case.

246
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:07,440
So we want them to calculate the Assad regime because it's not an outcome of your life.

247
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:18,150
The public are. And if you have Assad variable, we also want to know that kind of wins Assad variable.

248
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:25,470
How we measure. If the third variable is never the same have with the solitaire or something,

249
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:31,410
we have to just calculate the price and this ratio because they're measured at the same time.

250
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:35,550
So it's kind of like a curve sectional study or something.

251
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:47,750
So it's kind of you want to think about like when the two variable we're evaluate a measured.

252
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:52,940
So specifically, this is what we've done.

253
01:07:52,940 --> 01:08:01,040
That's the first step is to calculate the crude measure of association between the obesity and the

254
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:09,380
kidney function and the way we will use the data we have given to create a new tobacco table.

255
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:14,660
But this is stratified by age that the crude why we do not want to stratify by age.

256
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:26,630
So we added the two age group together and how that addresses that cohort studies of over to calculate the risk ratio.

257
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:39,010
So the crude measure of association in this federation is to find 45.

258
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:46,990
Hmm. So nice to stop is to calculate the association between the compounder,

259
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:54,040
lots of age group in our situation and the exposure, so we are new to that table.

260
01:08:54,040 --> 01:09:08,230
The exposure is the age group and the outcome is the obesity and the say is false the age laxity in our study people.

261
01:09:08,230 --> 01:09:16,540
So the adds measure that's the baseline and opposite me is also an exposure that's measured that those who have it's come out false.

262
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:23,740
The age group and the opposite is education obesity status at measured at the same time,

263
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:30,100
so they can only calculate the providence ratio rather than the at risk ratio.

264
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:45,190
So here is the mutuality table, so we can see that the association between the age and the obesity is nine, which is really large.

265
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:58,350
So there is a truly association between the age and obesity based on what we have calculated.

266
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:08,540
So that is where we are to calculate the association between the age, a power compounder and the kidney function.

267
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:20,880
Our outcome and this is that we need to say nowadays that this measure association is calculate Amazon values faster.

268
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:27,660
So what we need the data is just to from the participants who were not obese.

269
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:33,950
So it's just as a result. So from those that were transferred,

270
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:45,870
this they had to a new tobacco table that use age group as the exposure and use the kidney function as the outcome.

271
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:51,360
So you can't see that because the kidney function is measured five years after the baseline.

272
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:58,110
So is a risk ratio measure of association,

273
01:10:58,110 --> 01:11:06,180
and the risk ratio they have covered is based on this neutrality table is to live with also larger zone one.

274
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:19,470
So we also may be indicating that there is association between the age and assumption.

275
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:29,100
So the next is to populate this draft and specific risk ratio,

276
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:37,470
so we just use this information because they already have it too small to the table here.

277
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:50,090
So it does cover the risk ratio for. Younger and older is this bus tour that's a risk ratio, a thousand in particular.

278
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:59,660
So all we can see that is grab him as saturation is, you go to your father based on that,

279
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:21,090
although we do not ask power that there is no that age is now in fact, modification for this association because the Stratham specific are the same.

280
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:33,750
So the last thing is, we want to compare the crude risk ratio to the drought on specific risk ratio,

281
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:44,190
and we calculate the percentage difference weaknesses as a percentage difference is 42 percent in this case,

282
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:52,170
which based on our 10 percent rule, that this 42 percent is much larger than 10 percent.

283
01:12:52,170 --> 01:13:09,300
So we kind of to is that this guidance that I think are the same, but they are truly different from the food, which means that age is a compounding.

284
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:14,370
So in conclusion is that there is all this saying.

285
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:20,630
We have observed that the age is not the time for postulated reasons.

286
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:27,870
We need to make sure for them. We know that age is associated with the obesity.

287
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:31,130
Our exposure age is associated with.

288
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:41,850
The kidney function issues are asking about our exports to cover their families and not based on population us and all those problems as a risk ratio.

289
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:51,120
Others say that different from the crew, the risk ratio and the percentage rent is larger than 10 percent.

290
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:55,380
And that's why we conclude that based on the scenery,

291
01:13:55,380 --> 01:14:07,020
there's other data we have given a is truly confounding in terms of safety and the kidney function.

292
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:19,960
So is there any questions? Okay, so if not, we will end our discussion today.

293
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:28,990
So this is kind of all the contents new content of what we'll covered during this causes during these thoughts.

294
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:52,990
So the next wave is just maybe we have some action about what we have, Howard.
