1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,520
Hey, everyone. How you doing? So this is the great part of the year.

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,520
I worry that summer is done and that sunshine is done.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,940
I was hoping it was going to be beautiful and sunny at the weekend and we could go out and like walk in the park.

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,800
My little one is learning to ride a bike. So we were hoping that that would happen, but it didn't.

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:31,330
I know despite being from England, I'm not necessarily okay with like really gray, yucky weather like this and lots of clouds.

6
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:39,510
So today we're going to talk a bit about some of the basics of policy evaluation.

7
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:46,560
It is kind of a policy evaluation week. So things that we do today are a bit more of a surface level.

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:56,160
We're going to go a bit deeper. In our second class this week and I just want to say upfront, we're picking some values to discuss today.

9
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:03,840
And there was quite a bit in the readings about some other different values that you would use to judge a policy.

10
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:14,310
So what we kind of want you to get to grips with here is what are some ways to assess whether a policy is a good one from your perspective?

11
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,970
But we also want you to appreciate what other people think are some values on which policy should be evaluated.

12
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,090
And the reason for that is you.

13
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:33,810
Well, we as health researchers and public health people tend to care a lot about some issues that other people don't care about quite so much.

14
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,600
And we might choose to evaluate policies based on a different set of values.

15
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:38,940
Right?

16
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:48,030
So understanding how other people are approaching the same evaluative exercise is probably a good idea if you're going to go and do advocacy work,

17
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:56,100
because you might be there saying this is the best way to implement this policy, this is going to be an equitable solution.

18
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:03,120
But drawing on the theme of today, this will expand health care access to lots of people in good ways.

19
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,760
And so you might be arguing based on those merits,

20
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:15,569
but it's good to know that your opposition might be bringing in other kinds of criteria to evaluate the same policies.

21
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,810
They might say this is too expensive to be justified.

22
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,730
They might say the cost of this is too much given its effectiveness.

23
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,229
So there are lots of different ways to evaluate policy and we kind of just going

24
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,959
to stick a toe in the water today and think about three key concepts equity,

25
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,570
efficiency and efficacy. So we'll discuss what those might mean in a minute.

26
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,520
And that's part of the part of the problem is not everybody agrees on the definition of all these concepts.

27
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:51,930
But let's also keep in mind that there might be plenty of other criteria that you might use to evaluate this.

28
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,380
Is this a just policy? Is it an ethical policy?

29
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,740
Some people might want to know, is this a deterrent policy?

30
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:05,160
Which is not something I personally agree with. But there are you can see how there are different criteria that you can employ here.

31
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:11,850
So we're giving you a small, simple framework to start, but we want to have a bit more of a discussion.

32
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,049
So we're going to talk about what is good policy and some values that we could use

33
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:22,680
to evaluate a policy trying to understand the normative stakes of policy analysis.

34
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:33,300
What we mean by that is everybody doing policy analysis and policy evaluation has ideology, has preconceived ideas that they apply to this exercise.

35
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,989
Don't let anybody tell you that you can do a value neutral evaluation of a policy that is not true.

36
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,410
You can't, right? So every approach comes with an ideology.

37
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,780
And we want you to appreciate that. Right. And.

38
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,960
We're going to talk a bit about the Affordable Care Act today.

39
00:03:52,530 --> 00:04:02,250
And I have one embarrassing question for myself, but I want to ask you, how old were all of you when the ACA was passed in 2010?

40
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,810
Oh, my gosh, I'm so old now. So now I am the grand age of 42.

41
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:18,559
And I remember teaching the ACA when it was first introduced, and I remember living through all the policy battles that came up to its passage.

42
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,600
So we were where we got to teach is a bit differently given you guys were like nine and ten.

43
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:33,860
So we're going to talk a bit about the Affordable Care Act. I think there was a period in which the Affordable Care Act was it still is

44
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,940
being disputed and many of its provisions being challenged in different ways.

45
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:47,300
But after its passage, there were very significant legal challenges, lots of legislative challenges which were ultimately unsuccessful in Congress,

46
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:58,700
and a big political debate basically around the extent to which the government could and should expand health care access to certain populations.

47
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:07,100
And lots of disagreements underneath that about the ways in which health care access should be expanded

48
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,350
and how that clashes with some of the fundamental values that were being expressed in that debate,

49
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:19,130
whether it was around access, whether it was around equity, whether it was around efficiency and cost,

50
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:25,100
or whether it was around other values, like, I don't know, individual freedom to not have health insurance.

51
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:34,450
So. You can tell I'm a bit cynical about this having lived through this debate, but hopefully we can get to some of these the key elements of the ACA.

52
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:40,170
So our key question for this whole week is how can we judge whether a policy is good or not right?

53
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:50,080
That's already a value laden judgment. I want to start with these three concepts, just bearing in mind that there are other ways to evaluate policy.

54
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,580
How would you define each of these three?

55
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:02,260
We don't have to start with equity. You can pick whichever one you think is the easiest to define.

56
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,960
Give me a definition of either of these equity efficiency or efficacy.

57
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,110
If a policy is equitable, what does it look like? If a policy is efficient, what does it look like?

58
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,350
If a policy is effective, what might it look like?

59
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:28,040
If it's easy, you can also give me an example. Please hang on.

60
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,440
For our folks who might not be here, let's do. The microphone.

61
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:45,450
So efficacy to me seems like did it achieve what it was set out to do, like by the legislators?

62
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:51,730
And that can be different based on what policy it is, but kind of evaluating it after it's been implemented.

63
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,330
Like the enforcement. Yep.

64
00:06:53,340 --> 00:07:02,090
So please note that we've got we probably have a piece of law in the case of the ACA, it's a really complicated law with lots of different goals.

65
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,900
Right. And that quite is often the case from Congress.

66
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,770
You get a lot of different goals combined into this big piece of legislation,

67
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:17,909
especially now when we're in a model of like fewer bills that end up being must pass legislation

68
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,830
and everybody in Congress trying to squish their issues into those pieces of legislation.

69
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:31,230
So sometimes evaluating for efficacy is kind of complicated because we are confused about the goals.

70
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,980
So we have to think about the goals as written in the legislation, what was the intent of Congress?

71
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:44,400
But that's also something that the courts look at, what was the intent of Congress when they're evaluating a law?

72
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,020
And it's also something that you have to go and look at the implementation side of things.

73
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:55,710
So after the law has been passed, what rules and guidance have been produced by the bureaucracy?

74
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,240
That might have changed slightly the way that the law works,

75
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,150
which could be a little bit different than how if you just read the legislation, it would be conceptualized.

76
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:13,320
So the basic idea, though, is let's figure out for efficacy what the goals were of doing this in the first place.

77
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,040
And is this program actually meeting its goals once it's on the ground?

78
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,500
So it's an implementation question. Great. Anyone want to come in on that or come in on one of the other two concepts?

79
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,690
What about efficiency? We talk about efficiency a lot in public policy.

80
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,930
If you have an engineering background or a economics background or a hard science background of some kind,

81
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:53,580
you might have a thought about what efficiency is. Please.

82
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:04,830
I'm coming. It's Monday and I'm slow. They go outside thinking they're going a cost benefit analysis that the good it does outweighs the costs

83
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,720
and that there aren't so many administrative burdens that make it in the policy do more harm than good.

84
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,290
Yeah. So you mentioned cost effectiveness analysis. So that's one way of doing policy evaluation.

85
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,389
It's a very specific way. It's often done in organizational studies.

86
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:27,540
And in theory, engineers do this quite a lot. So health researchers do do cost effectiveness analysis quite a bit.

87
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:33,420
So you're looking at how expensive the intervention is on the one hand and then on the other.

88
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:41,399
Well, how effective is it? Right. So what? Maybe I'll stick with you if you're like, how do you feel about cost effectiveness analysis?

89
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,630
Do you think it is a good way to approach policy evaluation?

90
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:53,580
In one of the classes we had last year, we talked about sometimes the cost effectiveness goes to all right, so this helps this one person in this way.

91
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,190
How much is that worth? Like, how much is this one person's health worth monetarily?

92
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,820
So it can be difficult in that way and maybe not always as useful because of that.

93
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,320
Yeah, it's it's kind of controversial. Right. So thank you so much.

94
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,930
So on the one hand, cost effectiveness analysis is a really common form of policy analysis these days,

95
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:21,630
and especially because it's commonly practiced by people with quantitative research, training, in particular economists and engineers.

96
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:32,040
And it's become the norm for lots of parts of government to routinely approach policy in that way and look at this through a cost lens.

97
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,740
And you can see already what the problems might be.

98
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:41,460
If you're doing cost effectiveness analysis, you're measuring people's lives and the quality of their lives using dollars.

99
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,830
So you could already start to see how some people might not like that idea.

100
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:54,119
And in fact, in Congress, this is a very has been a very controversial issue for that reason.

101
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,360
There's a lot of cost effectiveness analysis required in a lot of different health policy areas nationally.

102
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:08,040
And there's been some pushback from legislators around using dollars to value people, but also.

103
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,040
What does that mean for other qualities of the policy? Right. You're measuring in dollars.

104
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,670
You're measuring effectiveness in a particular way. You might not.

105
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,560
It's not the same.

106
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:29,830
I hope you can see as looking at how equitable is this policy, because the most equitable solution might not be the most cost effective solution.

107
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:36,070
Which is a problem, maybe. So what do we mean when we talk about equity?

108
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,190
You guys have been through extensive public health training.

109
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:46,270
What is your take away from, um, about how we define equity in this kind of context, please?

110
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:55,960
Thanks. I think of equity as like who is getting resources and is it distributed based on need?

111
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:02,830
So who is potentially benefiting from any like law that has been passed to get the actual resources that were intended?

112
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:09,070
Exactly. So when we're talking about thank you.

113
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:17,710
This is immediately this conception of the idea of bringing people up to the same level,

114
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,060
which means people with more need need to receive more help to get there,

115
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:29,770
rather than the idea that everybody should get the same, which would still leave some people further behind than others.

116
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:35,290
Right. So the difficulty with implementing this, though, in a policy space is.

117
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:43,610
Measurement. So how does one measure need? And what mechanisms do you use to measure need?

118
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,240
Do you focus on certain quantitative indicators?

119
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,070
So a really good example here that we're going to talk about later in the class.

120
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,719
It's almost a stealth policy. Not that many people know about it.

121
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:09,560
But if you've heard of the Justice 40 initiative, the idea is to spend 40% of public investment in communities at the level level of the community.

122
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:19,400
And in particular, the the criteria that they're using to target this investment is the disadvantaged or minoritized or marginalized communities.

123
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:27,110
And the difficulty with that is figuring out what a disadvantaged or marginalized community is in that context nationwide.

124
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,830
And also, you could try to measure that,

125
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:37,940
but you might not actually talk to any of the people in any of those communities to see what they think their needs are.

126
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:47,059
Right. So you already run up in policy analysis against the distinction between quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis.

127
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,090
And I'm totally biased because I'm a qualitative research.

128
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,700
You just talks to people all the time about their needs.

129
00:13:53,150 --> 00:14:00,890
So when you're thinking equity, the basic idea and how it translates into policy can also be a problem.

130
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:09,180
So. Does anyone want to come in further on any of those definitions or add anything?

131
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,550
Okay. So this is just the summary of the same thing I've just said pretty much.

132
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,989
Um, when we're thinking about efficiency,

133
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:31,410
I guess the thing I didn't say is we could think in that cost effectiveness way of what's how much output can you get per the input that you give.

134
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,960
So for every unit of input, how much can you get?

135
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,520
You're more efficient if you can get more out for a smaller investment.

136
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:46,290
Um, and then allocate efficiency. So how to best use a resource across society would be another way of conceptualizing that.

137
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,309
And so there would be some other values we could use here that I've alluded to.

138
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,850
But I'm going to let you talk about that together. So I want you to chat in pairs today.

139
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,100
So if you happen to be sitting on your own, you might have to move a little bit.

140
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:07,340
You can also chat in a three. I'm going to have you look at these three things.

141
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:17,750
So everybody on this side of the room, can you please look at just in time, procurement of PPE, personal protective equipment in hospitals.

142
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:25,130
So during the pandemic, there was a lot of panic trying to acquire enough personal protective equipment

143
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,350
in time to protect health workers and to prevent the spread of disease.

144
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:40,970
Right. This is saying the just in time part here is procuring this stuff as needed rather than the argument that you might stockpile in advance.

145
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:50,210
So if we're in a situation where hospitals are buying PPE on the spur of the moment in response to a disease outbreak, is that equitable?

146
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,960
To what extent is that efficient? To what extent is that effective?

147
00:15:54,260 --> 00:16:01,640
I want you to discuss that. Everybody in the middle, I want you to think about translation services for Medicaid patients.

148
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:12,920
So if we're providing translation to somebody who's needing care but doesn't have the level of English needed to understand their care.

149
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,200
If we do that and we pay for it in a publicly funded program like Medicaid.

150
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,980
To what extent is that equitable? To what extent is that efficient?

151
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:30,710
To what extent is that effective? Right. And everybody on this side, I want you to think about school closures in the context of the pandemic.

152
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:36,380
So if we close elementary schools, what does that mean?

153
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,520
Is that an equitable response? I think you guys have the hardest job of all three groups.

154
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,220
Sorry. Is that an equitable response to close schools?

155
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,290
Is it an efficient response to close schools? Is it an effective response?

156
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,740
Okay. I'm going to give you all about 10 minutes into threes to discuss this and then we're going to come back.

157
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,710
So especially which of these three values.

158
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,080
And feel free to suggest other values that should be considered here.

159
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:13,790
Like, I'm not holding you to it necessarily. Which of these seems to be the main priority in adopting that policy?

160
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:22,660
Two And then to what extent is this really about one thing versus all three?

161
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,470
So is this equitable? Is this efficient? Is it effective?

162
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:32,430
Right. Any questions? Okay.

163
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,670
I'm going to give you about 10 minutes and we'll see what we come up with.

164
00:17:42,330 --> 00:19:11,130
He was. I guess.

165
00:19:51,990 --> 00:20:04,020
I think. Yeah.

166
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:29,030
First time. It's so.

167
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:48,200
I'm sorry about.

168
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:51,680
Yeah. So.

169
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:26,340
Yeah, I used to. He is, obviously.

170
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:40,160
I'm. I thought.

171
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,280
Right. But.

172
00:22:52,460 --> 00:23:24,190
Kyrie. Yeah.

173
00:23:42,640 --> 00:24:02,180
I love. Were.

174
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:16,060
I. Interesting.

175
00:24:31,710 --> 00:25:04,900
Well. But hey, I'm going to give you one more minute.

176
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:44,340
I think a lot of people have had some good thoughts in. It's.

177
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:53,350
Yeah. You.

178
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,120
So this.

179
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:33,010
Okay. So. So what did we get?

180
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,980
I was able to speak to some groups over here and over here, uh, and you to generate.

181
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,140
So let's start with you guys on the site.

182
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:48,200
Tell me a few things you were thinking if you're not. Yes.

183
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,459
So we had the just in time procurement of PPE by hospitals.

184
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,270
And in terms of the EA, that seemed to be the main priority.

185
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:03,620
We were saying efficiency because with this policy they're trying to have the best use of resources.

186
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,770
However, we said that equity and efficacy ended up being problems in terms of equity.

187
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:18,950
The larger health systems would be able to buy more PPE, which would lead other low income or less wealthy hospitals to get the PPE that they need.

188
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:24,200
And in terms of efficacy, the just in time procurement overburden manufacturers,

189
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,370
which led to supply chain bottlenecks and made it hard for everyone to get access.

190
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:33,049
Yeah. And also, I think the really interesting thing here too is exactly the same pattern.

191
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:37,670
But internationally, some governments were I know the rich countries that I study,

192
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:43,969
they were on the phone desperately trying to procure from any source this stuff for their health systems.

193
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:51,110
And so if you don't happen to have the dollars or currency equivalent amount of money to to purchase that,

194
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:57,169
then it's a huge problem of inequity across countries and then within countries like the US,

195
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:01,549
where there's a real difference in wealth and revenue for hospital systems.

196
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,660
That causes the problem too. Yeah, I think it did. Right. Does anyone else from the side want to come in on that?

197
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:16,350
Anyone disagree will come up with something different. Okay.

198
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:25,050
I'm going to move on to you guys. So, yeah, what would the equity efficiency and efficacy concerns think?

199
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:30,090
I'm going to forget my own three E's. Does anyone want to volunteer and tell me what you discussed as a group?

200
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:43,900
The he's. We were saying that providing translation services does make the health system

201
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,879
just more equitable in terms of like health literacy for these patients.

202
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:57,790
And we are saying, though, as of now, it seems like a lot of providers are using like Google Translate or like not as like.

203
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:04,620
I don't know. Effective translation methods. Whereas like an in-person translator is like really what's needed.

204
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,780
So if Medicaid were to cover that,

205
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:18,450
like it would really be beneficial for like these populations or potentially like implementing like a policy around like providers getting or like

206
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:28,800
having some sort of incentive to like expand their like language understanding and like knowledge based on like some sort of voluntary benefit.

207
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:33,360
Great. And we have another a there we go.

208
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:45,230
Thank you. Um, so we were saying like a other value or like, I guess it might fall under efficiency, but it's also like empathy.

209
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,430
We were talking about like what we've noticed with translation services just in

210
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:55,409
general is like sometimes doctors talk directly to the translator if there is one,

211
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:58,560
or they don't really address the patient just because they can't speak the same language.

212
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,260
Um, yeah. And then other other things to consider are just like different dialects.

213
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:11,100
Like there's so many different dialects and different languages that are often, like, glossed over in translation services.

214
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:17,630
Yeah. And it's really important because this is literally a life or death matter or quality of life matter for the patients.

215
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,260
Something to. I like that your alternative concepts come up.

216
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,830
Start with E. That's good. Um, but yeah.

217
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:31,480
What role is there for empathy in the context of the patient physician relationship?

218
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,239
Um, I think then both of you are talking about the quality of the translation that is provided.

219
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,250
How accurate is it? And also, can technology provide that empathy?

220
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:48,390
That makes me ask right? As opposed to a person and preferably a good also and a good connection with the provider.

221
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:56,129
Something else that came up in my other discussions in this group were this is a sneaky one because in theory you would

222
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:02,400
think that there would be some interest from the people managing the health system around provision of translation,

223
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:06,450
not just for equity reasons, but also hopefully for efficiency reasons.

224
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:12,420
They might waste a lot of money on diagnostic tests if they can't communicate well with the patient.

225
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:19,349
So in addition to very serious concerns about is the patient going to be misdiagnosed, are they not going to be able to communicate properly?

226
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:23,310
Are they not going to get a good quality of care which could have really bad consequences?

227
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,080
I think we can also ask whether.

228
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:38,639
Is there an area of mutual beneficial policy where this the health system is incentivized to try to do better and for equity reasons,

229
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,210
but also maybe for efficiency reasons, too. All right.

230
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,790
Does anyone else want to come in on that before I move on? Yeah, please.

231
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:57,280
Okay. I'm curious. The only thing our group would add is that we were wondering what the actual need is among Medicaid patients.

232
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:04,219
Like we wouldn't want to place translators or translation services in areas that wouldn't use them,

233
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:08,360
and that's a lot of wasted like salary money to those individuals.

234
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,429
So Amanda came up with the idea of using like telehealth instead.

235
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:17,419
So like the translators would be used on the as need basis.

236
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:24,320
And so I've just always there at the hospital. But yeah, we just weren't sure what the actual need is among Medicaid patients.

237
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,910
Well, I guess it's sort of an allocation of resources concept of efficiency,

238
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:33,980
like what would be the most efficient distribution if you can fund translation,

239
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:42,440
I want to say a different way of what would oppose that would be a view that says translation should be the right of everybody who needs it.

240
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,719
So how do you balance the idea that this is the right of patients to get good care and

241
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,210
have someone understand them and try their best to communicate with them clearly?

242
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:59,540
As opposed to then what do you do to make that efficient if you have a limited pool of resources?

243
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:05,120
Great. Thank you. All right. Let's go back to to this group over here.

244
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:12,880
So what did you think about schools? This was kind of like a tricky one, like you were saying.

245
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:19,930
We kind of came to the conclusion Abby and I were talking that in terms of being available.

246
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:31,060
Or efficacious that sure like closing elementary schools was successful in reducing the risk of transmission of COVID in elementary schools,

247
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:36,100
but that it probably was just super, super inequitable.

248
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:46,629
And in terms of like online class and having like young students do that, like in lower income or more rural areas,

249
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:52,750
do those people have access to technology less so than in higher income areas?

250
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:56,800
And do they have access to like broadband Internet and stuff like that?

251
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,429
And like what are the occupation of their parents?

252
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:06,610
Can they take time off work and be home with the kids and can they pay for childcare and stuff like that?

253
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:15,340
And just with the fact that like schools and the US, it's already kind of like very inequitable and schools,

254
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:20,049
a lot of schools have less resources to begin with that this probably just

255
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:27,550
really exacerbated that and also not super efficient like for teachers kind of.

256
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:34,430
Abby was talking like her mom is an elementary school teacher and it kind of seemed like they just got thrown under the bus a

257
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:40,400
little bit and everyone kind of funded for themselves in terms of like getting resources to their students and stuff like that.

258
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:49,120
Right. So. Okay.

259
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:56,500
So yeah, I think I talked to a few groups over this site and everybody was saying, yeah, there's definitely a lot of equity questions here.

260
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:02,439
It's kind of problematic to close schools for some people who don't have alternative

261
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,600
childcare and might have jobs where they have to be there in person for one thing.

262
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:15,130
Also, like the resource allocation across educational districts in the US is incredibly unequal because it's based on local taxpayers

263
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:22,209
and these weird education districts that mean that it's really hard to redistribute between one district and another.

264
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:28,930
So there's a lot of inequality there. So the Ann Arbor Public Schools District bought laptops for the kids.

265
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:36,010
And so my kid got like a lot, got a laptop and had that at home and every kid had that.

266
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,150
Whereas that's not feasible necessarily depending on where you live.

267
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:50,020
But I like the point too about efficiency. We talked a little bit about the idea that transition to online learning is not necessarily efficient.

268
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:59,020
It might not also be necessarily effective. Notice how the efficiency and effectiveness calculations might change depending on

269
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:03,340
whether you're framing this as a question of education or a question of public health.

270
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,840
Because I think some other groups were arguing that this could be effective.

271
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:12,700
But it depends on the disease outbreak you're trying to address and how that spread.

272
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:20,500
And and so there was a lot of public debate around how much should we close down schools in order to prevent spread of disease.

273
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:28,600
Given that at the time, there was a lot of discussion of whether kids were being affected and how much so so kind of a difficult one.

274
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,600
I think that's why I thought this was the most complicated out of the three.

275
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,020
So anyone else want to come in on this question? Okay.

276
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:45,270
And move on to the next part. And I'm going to keep my cute.

277
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:51,900
So. We want to extend this a bit and have another go.

278
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,620
You can stay in your threes if you like,

279
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:00,240
but I think it might be better to move to groups of four or five people, get a bit, clump up with another group.

280
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,160
The general link is on canvas if you want to open that and use that.

281
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:14,370
The we're going to give a grade on each of these three is to some of these aspects of the ACA.

282
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:24,870
So let me just go through these in brief. The public health fund in the Affordable Care Act is kind of significant because this was the

283
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:30,089
first time there was real federal funding that was nonspecific for public health issues,

284
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,880
and that's essentially mind blowing to me.

285
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:40,890
I know the US is a federal country, but we didn't have sustained investment at the federal level in public health in that way until the ACA.

286
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:52,830
So I want one group to have a look at. The idea of putting a specific defined fund for public health in the Affordable Care Act.

287
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:57,280
Is that equitable? Is that effective?

288
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:06,800
Is that efficient in exactly the same way? Number two, the ACA contained a very controversial individual mandate initially.

289
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:14,340
That's why it says, as in Bill, because there was subsequently some really significant legal challenges to that and it was really unpopular.

290
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:18,090
So there's polling done on every aspect of the Affordable Care Act.

291
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:26,250
The most unpopular part was the requirement for each individual to have health care insurance or otherwise face a fine.

292
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,060
Right. And the reason you're frowning at me is because that got gutted.

293
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:36,240
So it's not it's not the case today. But the original fine was like 300 and something dollars.

294
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,250
It went up to 600 and something dollars.

295
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:47,280
So that core idea requiring everybody to have health care and punishing you financially if you don't have health care.

296
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:53,190
Let's think about the three E's of that third one Medicaid expansion.

297
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:00,420
That's about the original intent to expand Medicaid across all 50 states.

298
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:04,680
We are in a situation now where a few states still did not adopt this.

299
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:10,590
This is another issue where there were a lot of legal challenges to the original intent of the law.

300
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:20,850
But I want you to evaluate the basic idea that we're going to put in this law provisions that expand a relatively popular and accepted,

301
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:26,909
established health care program to more people. What does that mean for equity effectiveness?

302
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:30,890
Efficiency? Fourth one, the marketplaces.

303
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,670
Does anybody who can tell me what the marketplaces in the ACA do?

304
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:41,260
I know that some of you know this because we made you do the quiz at the beginning of the semester.

305
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:54,340
Please. I believe it's where insurance can be sold and like all the details are on this website,

306
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,990
and there's also specific enrollment periods to buy insurance.

307
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:02,149
And I believe in the reading it said and covered,

308
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:09,530
they opened up so much like another opportunity to get insurance through the marketplace, to get public insurance that way.

309
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:17,870
So yeah, exactly. So it's difficult to say now,

310
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:24,859
but the idea was to provide a centralized point where anybody could go and purchase health insurance

311
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:31,729
and provide a bit more standardization around how those different insurance packages were are graded,

312
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:36,680
what they offer, help individuals try to navigate the marketplace a bit better.

313
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:47,030
So I hope by me saying marketplace and purchase and you're still shopping as an individual consumer in this environment and you're using a website,

314
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:51,170
you can probably already start to see maybe what some of the equity concerns around this are.

315
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,920
So is it equitable? Is it efficient? Is effective?

316
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:03,530
And then linked to that federal subsidies for people who might be purchasing insurance on the marketplace.

317
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:14,840
So the idea was to have this marketplace somewhat standardize purchasing decisions for consumers and then to provide income support,

318
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:19,490
to provide some subsidies for people purchasing these plans.

319
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:25,250
And again, you could probably see how the implementation of this could be a bit problematic, right?

320
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:32,950
What happens if the subsidies go away or some government changes the eligibility for those subsidies?

321
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:38,719
For example, what happens to people who might have incomes that are a bit higher but not that much

322
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,540
higher than the cost cutoff point for financial support when they're purchasing insurance?

323
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:51,530
So three years again for that one. Finally, we've got mandatory cover of preventative services.

324
00:41:51,800 --> 00:42:01,040
This is the idea that we should force coverage across these insurance packages offered in the marketplace to to cover essential services,

325
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:07,700
a basket of things that everybody has to everybody has to provide in their insurance packages.

326
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,320
But here it's the idea is to include preventative services.

327
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:20,630
This is sort of a roundabout way of trying to provide more preventative care, which is something that the US does quite badly in a lot of cases.

328
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:29,420
So what do you think about that policy idea of requiring insurers to provide preventative care of certain in certain specified ways?

329
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:38,600
And then finally, one of the things the ACA did was keep people allow people to stay on their parents insurance until age 26,

330
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:44,630
which has an international health policy researcher is crazy because just give them health insurance.

331
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:50,630
But again, this is a very American workaround here to try and keep people insured for longer,

332
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,750
trying to acknowledge the difficulty of getting insurance. If you're a junior in a low paid job.

333
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,700
So what do you think about this idea? Is it effective? Is it efficient?

334
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,820
Is it equitable? Hopefully by me hinting that not everybody has insurance to start with.

335
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:13,970
Everybody has parents with insurance. You can kind of get the sense of how that fits within those three E's.

336
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,040
So can you form up into groups, please?

337
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:21,320
I'm going to give you a number and you're going to have a look at that number policy.

338
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:25,170
So who's over here is a group. You guys.

339
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:30,600
Can you be number one, please? You guys do. Number two, can you do number three?

340
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:38,550
Down here. Who's in a group? If you want to be a six.

341
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,950
Come on. All right. Number four, please. You guys.

342
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:49,210
Okay. Whoever's included. Number five. Are you guys going to be or are you going to go this way?

343
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:55,420
Right now, I'm. Who's in this group? Everybody.

344
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,630
Okay. Number six, then place. Just have a big discussion among yourselves.

345
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,980
I want you to give a grade on each of these three, eight years, by the way.

346
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,600
You guys at the front number seven, are you all together?

347
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,710
Strength in numbers. Great. Number seven, go back to number one, please.

348
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:17,400
Number two. Number three. Perfect. That will do.

349
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:24,030
All right. We will be going round. So if you guys have questions about any of these different interventions,

350
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:27,660
I know they might be a little strange, but hopefully the basic ideas make sense.

351
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:45,210
I should say I'm going to give you about 20 minutes. I should say I'm going to give you about 20 minutes to do this just so we can wrap up.

352
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:57,560
It is so difficult. Plan tonight I took to them.

353
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,230
So I myself is actually, you know, 4 minutes.

354
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:36,270
I think you can say one. Seven.

355
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:47,550
His coming. Yes.

356
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:55,350
I think very often it's I don't know.

357
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:04,080
I think I would rather do something like this in really maybe just a few minutes.

358
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:08,990
All right. I'm going to stop the slides and then I'm going to go back to.

359
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:29,120
Is the Red Cross.

360
00:46:48,240 --> 00:47:06,190
Yes. I.

361
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:34,580
Yes. And that.

362
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:45,710
I know that. But it's not exactly what I like about.

363
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:26,330
Oh, really? Yeah. Right.

364
00:48:40,980 --> 00:49:05,460
Felt like. I guess.

365
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:27,830
It is. And.

366
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:40,020
I always. The ambulance.

367
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:51,770
It's just like in general, you know.

368
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:59,460
Time to speculate.

369
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:08,030
Think. I feel like a lot of.

370
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,950
It was like three or four different. Right.

371
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:43,740
So I'm just saying. Think.

372
00:50:47,720 --> 00:51:10,000
I'm not sure how. But.

373
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:54,460
So I. So.

374
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:11,250
Yes. And that's why I.

375
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:25,600
It's. If you want to see.

376
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,330
I. And.

377
00:52:55,990 --> 00:53:01,800
So. Know.

378
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:24,450
And. I don't know what.

379
00:53:50,660 --> 00:54:32,860
It's not as. I mean.

380
00:54:52,540 --> 00:55:35,030
Yeah. Do.

381
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:58,070
She? Hopefully. Yeah.

382
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:28,480
I just, I. Martin Luther King.

383
00:56:31,270 --> 00:57:11,120
Thanks, everyone. I guess that's.

384
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:28,470
I think this. And the.

385
00:57:34,480 --> 00:58:11,690
Later on. I feel like.

386
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:41,760
You know. Because of his experience.

387
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:15,380
I get this job. Obviously.

388
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:26,570
It's. What have you seen?

389
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:34,400
I was surprised.

390
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:53,130
I mean. We know.

391
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:40,790
I? No. In my.

392
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:03,270
You know, I just for example.

393
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:16,920
We have a lot of things. So.

394
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:28,930
Not just because.

395
01:01:33,430 --> 01:02:16,400
I. Small things.

396
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:29,150
Thank you. Great. Hi. So wrap up whatever discussion you're having right this minute.

397
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,520
We should have a discussion a bit more as a group.

398
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:41,090
Kind of an interesting question that was coming up in the discussion over there was to what extent these criteria are mutually exclusive?

399
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:45,110
Can you have an efficient and effective policy?

400
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:51,139
Was a very good question that's asked. I'm not sure we know we have the space in the next 10 minutes to come up with an answer.

401
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:54,620
But it is kind of interesting how all this is taking place,

402
01:02:54,920 --> 01:03:02,810
even with this big piece of legislation within the health system that has a lot of problems to a lot of problems delivering on equity,

403
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:11,180
a lot of problems delivering efficiency. I think most people would argue there's quite a bit of wasted money in the health care sector,

404
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:15,110
maybe from completely different angles depending on their ideology.

405
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:23,540
But it's a lot of consensus on that one. And then also the thing that strikes me looking at this list of policies is.

406
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:32,230
A lot of these are designed on political feasibility. They're designed to fit with a political system that would pass a piece of legislation.

407
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:39,190
So everybody's putting forward their thing, the element that they would like to see in the health service health system.

408
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:43,510
And some of those ideas a bit competing.

409
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:50,320
That's where you get very long and complicated law, which makes evaluation of some of these criteria a little hard.

410
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:55,899
Because if we're talking about y coexistence of the individual mandate,

411
01:03:55,900 --> 01:04:05,740
which is a very conservative idea with funding for preventative care, which is a much more left wing idea, how do these things coexist?

412
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:10,150
Well, they all coexist within a system that is not a universal health care system.

413
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:15,250
So I wonder how many of these categories really got a Grade A?

414
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:20,610
Where did I start? Last time I started that slide. Right. I started over here.

415
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:24,200
Okay. Okay. Good. I'll start over here.

416
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:28,020
So who wants to volunteer? There's no pressure.

417
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:33,350
I just want to hear from a couple of groups. You guys had one, two and three respectively, correct?

418
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:39,290
Okay. Please.

419
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:56,570
So we did the individual mandate and we talked about like in terms of equity, it leaves out like.

420
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:02,030
So to require everyone to kind of purchase health insurance and be covered,

421
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:08,419
it leaves out a lot of people who may not meet state eligibility but are below the poverty line.

422
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:12,879
So it kind of. It feeds into the coverage gap.

423
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,990
And then it also leaves that leaves out undocumented individuals.

424
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:28,780
And like it's it seems unfair to also penalize for noncompliance when you literally, legitimately can't afford it.

425
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:35,560
And then in terms of like effectiveness, I guess like the individual mandate is like to like.

426
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:42,540
Push the goal for universal health care coverage.

427
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:45,780
But in practice, it causes a lot of financial burden.

428
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:52,950
And then in terms of efficiency, since when you mandate coverage for everyone,

429
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:59,760
it's supposed to like reduce costs overall for the sicker patients that will access care more frequently.

430
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:08,880
So in that way, it would be efficient for the entire population in terms of like input output.

431
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,370
But yeah. Yeah. So thank you.

432
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:20,479
I think the individual mandate is the one that a lot of people struggle with in terms of understanding why it was done in the first place.

433
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,570
But as you're exactly right, what they're trying to do here,

434
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:29,960
the justification for adopting that part of the policy was if we force everyone to have insurance,

435
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:35,930
we're going to expand the risk pool that are considered of people that are considered by insurers.

436
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:38,870
And we're going to add more healthy people to the risk pool.

437
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:48,560
So the argument was, given that this would overall reduce costs because you have more people who are less sick subsidizing people who are sicker.

438
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:56,840
And it was controversial at the time, and it was controversial after I think it was personally controversial for people because

439
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:02,780
they did not like the penalty associated and they felt like it was government overreach.

440
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:06,380
And the court eventually agreed with that. But at the same time,

441
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:13,219
there was this weird like equity argument that if you can change the risk pool and again

442
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:17,240
you're working with a constraint within the constraints of a non universal system,

443
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:23,360
right. So that's, you're right to say like that automatically leaves out some people before you've even started.

444
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:31,760
Yeah. That argument was kind of we should expand the risk pool and redistribute the costs essentially.

445
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:38,870
So it was like a advocates of efficiency argument and slightly an equity argument in one, which is, as you can see,

446
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:48,110
the consequences of that are pretty have been worked out today in that this this the mandate's just generally ineffective.

447
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:51,430
It's been neutralized. Okay.

448
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:59,060
Do you want to pick someone from the side? At first, as anyone who covered that on this side have any additional thoughts that we didn't cover.

449
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:05,590
Yeah. Right. How about someone who looked at the public health fund or Medicaid expansion?

450
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:13,890
Anyone. I'm just going to throw it out into this general area and someone's going to have to catch it.

451
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:18,719
Okay. Ready? Here we go. Oh, wow.

452
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,960
This is. This is too much power for instructors.

453
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:29,790
I don't like it. If you would like to contribute, but please don't feel pressured, you can pass it to someone else.

454
01:08:29,790 --> 01:08:34,950
Medicaid expansion as a bell. And we thought that it was pretty accurate.

455
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:44,970
We gave it an A and C because we said that expanded it to more individuals and people that were low income or and vulnerable,

456
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:52,740
but even individuals that weren't vulnerable like would have have access if they had like higher income and then, you know, were included before.

457
01:08:53,790 --> 01:08:56,970
And then for course, for effectiveness, we thought like.

458
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:02,570
It was pretty effective, but we gave it a B, but it wasn't as cost effective.

459
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:05,059
Like we think that like what you were saying with universal health care,

460
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:10,520
there probably would be a better idea than just like expanding it to like a like a higher number of individuals.

461
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:20,300
Yeah. Yeah. I think that's something I said a lot to lots of different groups is we we're working at we're reforming within the system.

462
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:26,690
And when you combine that with political feasibility, I felt like with this exercise,

463
01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:30,319
sometimes we get great inflation and everybody gives some of the categories.

464
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:36,290
And I can I quickly see who gave an A on equity for their policy.

465
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:44,350
Sort of. You're doing this, which means like A-minus, like.

466
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:48,730
Okay. Who gave an A on efficiency for that policy?

467
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,180
You guys are not like the other group at all.

468
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:56,730
I think that we have a lot of health managers in that group and they gave A's to everything and it kind of freaked me out.

469
01:09:57,390 --> 01:10:02,000
Who gave an A for effectiveness? Okay.

470
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:05,880
Interesting. All right. Does anybody want to come in from this?

471
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:07,710
Any of the remaining groups?

472
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:16,130
We're going to do one more reporting and we're going to continue this theme throughout the next class that we do in a little bit more depth.

473
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:19,890
So this is just the starter exercise.

474
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:23,900
One more volunteer from. From our center group.

475
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:29,600
Anyone over here? Thank you.

476
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:37,860
Yeah. So we were a number seven young people in parents insurance to 26.

477
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:44,030
And the reason why we gave an A to efficacy is if.

478
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:48,200
The goal is to increase insurance coverage.

479
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:54,260
That's kind of a great way to do it, especially for young people that might not have insurance otherwise.

480
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:01,279
And we before the other categories, we weren't as generous, especially equity.

481
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:07,040
I think we gave a C plus or B minus or something in that range because like we were talking about before,

482
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:12,319
if your parents don't have insurance because they can't afford it or some other circumstances,

483
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,500
then you are not going to have insurance until you're 26.

484
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:18,500
But also, there's different types of insurance.

485
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:27,350
So someone whose parents have great insurance with like low co-pays that cover all sorts of types of services,

486
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:35,749
they're going to be more of an advantage than those with parents that don't have as high quality insurance that may not even cover dental services,

487
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:46,400
whatever. Yeah. And the the cost of insurance on the marketplace is even ended up varying by thousands of dollars between individuals and families.

488
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:51,530
So you're absolutely right to say I would give this like a D for equity, to be honest.

489
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:56,149
And I might I would give it a B for effectiveness because I think I'm I agree with you.

490
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:59,389
It's definitely an effective thing to do in the short term.

491
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:02,300
And it helped keep a lot of people insured.

492
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:09,440
But equity wise, it's a huge problem because everybody has different types of insurance at different levels of cost.

493
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,340
And that ended up being a big problem. All right.

494
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:22,000
We're going to carry on with these discussions in these valley these valley based discussions on Wednesday.

495
01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:28,340
So do think about whether there is another E or any other letter of the alphabet value that you would add to these?

496
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,400
And we'll come back to you in the next post. Thank you.
