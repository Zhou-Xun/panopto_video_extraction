1
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,840
As you previewed last week, we're going to have a couple of guest speakers.

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,120
Yeah, you don't have to listen to me talk up here the entire time. Nice break for you.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,170
But even better is that we have topical experts coming in.

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:27,070
And first of which is one of my esteemed colleagues, Professor Rick NEITZEL, who's also a professor in environmental health sciences.

5
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,090
I know some of you had a chance to meet him, others haven't.

6
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:36,580
And Rick is one of the world renowned experts specifically on noise exposure.

7
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,350
But he is going to be talking in general about physical exposures as part of today's topic.

8
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,750
And with the material, I think talk a little bit about himself and some of the things he has going on with that.

9
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,280
Thank you so much. Thank you, Professor Devonshire. Welcome. Good morning, everybody.

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,880
I will say I appreciate the world renowned expert, just like two of us.

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,350
So that doesn't really doesn't really mean what you might think it does.

12
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,340
So I'll just give you a quick sort of lowdown on me.

13
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:12,820
I've been in the department for 10 years. As Professor Devine said, most of my research focuses on noise, but I also study human vibration,

14
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:18,670
injury risks and a few of the other physical exposures we go through today.

15
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:24,760
I think that's enough about me, actually. I'll talk about one of my studies right at the end of the lecture,

16
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,470
one that you might even be potentially interested in participating in, but no pressure.

17
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,510
I'll also just say right up front here,

18
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:37,690
I'm going to be super sloppy in this lecture and I'll use sort of physical exposures and physical hazards interchangeably.

19
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,260
Just so you know, those are the same thing, basically.

20
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:47,380
So in terms of what I'm hoping you get out of today, well, first it'd be lovely if everyone could stay awake.

21
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:54,310
But that may be too much to ask because I know learning about physical hazards at eight thirty in the morning is not what any of us want to be doing.

22
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,490
I'm going to try to make this as interesting as I can.

23
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:04,600
And I will say and I think some of you who are in physical hazards have already heard me say this.

24
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:11,620
The School of Public Health has a tremendous emphasis on chemical exposures and there's, you know, eighty five thousand plus chemicals out there.

25
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,600
That's not inappropriate.

26
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:21,130
But I think sometimes the school focuses so much on chemicals that we tend to ignore some of the other hazards, biological hazards come to mind.

27
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:26,110
Of course, those are top of mind right now made pandemic, but before the pandemic, not so much.

28
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,000
And physical hazards are sort of the same. They get glossed over, but they're everywhere all the time.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,050
And so I'd like to just bring some awareness to all of you that these are issues

30
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,880
that you will face in your personal life and also very likely in your career.

31
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,970
So in terms of what I'm hoping you get out of this lecture today,

32
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:50,170
I want you to be able to describe some of the sources and also some of the health effects that are associated with things like radiation.

33
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,890
And we're going to talk about both ionizing and non-ionizing radiation.

34
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,180
And I'll tell you what that means in a few minutes. We're also going to talk about thermal stress.

35
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:05,080
So heat stress as well as cold stress, both of which we very much experience here in lovely Ann Arbor.

36
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,550
We'll talk about human vibration, as I mentioned, and we're going to wrap up with noise.

37
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:17,380
Let me also say, if anybody has any questions or comments or discussion points, please do just shout out.

38
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:23,050
We can make this be a conversation as much as possible. Speaking of conversation.

39
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:35,810
Let me ask you, so what comes to mind for you when you see these two words, ionizing radiation, just sort of immediate reactions to that.

40
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:41,840
Chernobyl. Excellent, great HBO show, if you haven't seen it, it's it's fantastic.

41
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:52,060
So that's a great example. What else comes to mind when you hear ionizing radiation?

42
00:03:52,060 --> 00:04:00,250
Cancer causing very good, so absolutely carcinogenic with no safe known dose for ionizing radiation.

43
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:09,550
So those are absolutely right. Me as a Gen Xers who grew up at the tail of atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons.

44
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,110
This is the first thing that comes to mind to me. A giant scary mushroom cloud.

45
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,940
You're absolutely right on Chernobyl.

46
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:21,940
So for those of you who have seen the show or seen this famous picture, that's what a meltdown reactor looks like.

47
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:27,670
We had our own version of Chernobyl, which thankfully was not nearly as significant at Three Mile Island,

48
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:32,440
which is located very close to New York City, potentially catastrophic.

49
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,970
And then more recently, Social Nobilis, 1986, Three Mile Island.

50
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:43,210
I'm blanking on the date right now, and some of you may recognize this image on the left here.

51
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:50,200
This is Fukushima Daiichi. So this is the Japanese nuclear reactor that melted down in 2011.

52
00:04:50,200 --> 00:05:01,120
So all of those things are definitely associated with not being able to remember your password and pull everywhere.

53
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,760
OK, fantastic. I was not expecting that I passed my first test of the morning.

54
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,610
So all of those things are associated with ionizing radiation,

55
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,350
but there's lots of other sources of ionizing radiation that we are all potentially exposed to.

56
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,220
So let me have you pop into polla everywhere.

57
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,940
And Josh, apologies. I think we've already been through this and physical hazards, but a little reiterations, never bad.

58
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,540
So let me have you pop in to pull everywhere if you could. We'll see if this works.

59
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,950
It betrays me about 50 percent of the time, I'd say. But if you can get in there,

60
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:42,040
what I'm looking to have you do is rank these exposures in terms of where you think you might get the most exposure to ionizing

61
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:52,990
radiation in your life all the way down to where you might get the least exposure out of these six possible exposure sources.

62
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,570
So we'll take a second. I will keep my fingers crossed that this is actually working.

63
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:05,940
It's always a crapshoot until the first response comes in. So fingers crossed.

64
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:13,830
Fabulous. OK, so as you guys pop in here, we'll sort of see how the results jump around.

65
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:19,920
It's always like a horse race. Who's going to be in first?

66
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:35,250
You know, I really wish I could do that horse race announcer Like, we've got cosmic rays lead by two lengths, but I can't.

67
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:46,650
All right, I'll give you a few more seconds to complete this.

68
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:53,610
OK, I see mostly eyes up here, so in terms of ranking, it looks like the clear winner here,

69
00:06:53,610 --> 00:07:02,640
which has been in first I think since the first individual is is raised on an indoor air, looks like food and water and cosmic rays tied for second.

70
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:09,750
Living within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant is fourth. Living within 50 miles of a coal fired power plant is fifth.

71
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:17,190
And then fallout from nuclear weapons tests to sixth. So I will give you the actual scores here.

72
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:24,180
And so this is the numerical ranking and you'll see some numbers after each of the categories that you've just gone over.

73
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:30,990
Those numbers are millirems. So this is a representation of radiation dose into your body.

74
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,260
So for the typical person, you guys are all absolutely right.

75
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:44,220
Radon in indoor air has far and away the greatest dose that it gives to the typical American, about 200 mg per year on average.

76
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,390
Across the whole country, food and water is second.

77
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:54,330
Certainly, it's possible to drink contamination that can give you radiation exposure.

78
00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:00,450
Your body actually also creates radiation exposure internally through some metabolic processes.

79
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:06,030
We've got cosmic rays. So space, everything out there is intended to kill us.

80
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,180
You know, we've got vacuum. We've got incredibly cold temperatures.

81
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:19,860
We've got cosmic rays or pretty high amounts of radiation that fortunately our earth's atmosphere blocks down here at planet's surface.

82
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,510
We've got fallout from nuclear weapons tests is actually fourth, not dead last here.

83
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:33,210
Living near a coal fired power plant is actually fifth. So you get a little bit of exposure from radiation that occurs naturally in coal.

84
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:40,830
And then the last and absolutely least by several orders of magnitude, is living 50 miles from a nuclear power plant.

85
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:45,120
So the obvious choice here, most of you were very savvy about and said, well,

86
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,710
I don't think a nuclear power plant is going to give me that much of a dose. And you're absolutely right.

87
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:58,020
So, again, comparatively, it's like six orders of magnitude smaller than what you would get from radon potentially in your own home.

88
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:07,020
And we'll come back to radon in a few minutes. OK, so now we've got a little bit of calibration going in terms of where our radiation might come from.

89
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:12,240
Let's zoom out a bit and talk about just how radiation is created in the first place.

90
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,740
And so hopefully all of you remember maybe back to high school or college chemistry, what an atom looks like.

91
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:27,180
So you may remember that there's a very dense nucleus which contains positively charged protons and negative or excuse me,

92
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:33,930
nuclear neutrally or no charge neutrons in a stable atom, an atom that doesn't want to decay.

93
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,200
You're going to have the same number of protons and neutrons. It's going to be balanced.

94
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,580
But if the number of protons and the number of neutrons is not equal,

95
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,990
then you're going to end up with an unstable atom and an unstable atom wants

96
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,790
to decay or basically evolve or transition into stability in the way it does.

97
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:56,520
That is by releasing radiation and that radiation can be one of two forms.

98
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:02,040
It can be an actual particle or particulate radiation or it can be an electromagnetic wave.

99
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:08,460
And we'll talk about both of those in a couple of minutes. So we've got this nucleus again with protons and neutrons.

100
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,180
And then you may remember around that nucleus we've got orbiting electron shells.

101
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:18,900
Hopefully this is not sounding too unfamiliar in a stable atom.

102
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:24,240
The number of electrons so negatively charged particles is going to be equal to the number of protons.

103
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,510
So we have basically no net charge on the atom. If the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons,

104
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:42,000
we have an ionized atom and ionization can occur when an atom encounter's particulate or electromagnetic wave radiation from the environment.

105
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:52,770
So I keep saying ionizing. What do I even mean by this? So basically ionization means that when an atom interacts with some other radiation source,

106
00:10:52,770 --> 00:11:00,810
basically that radiation can cause electrons to be removed from the atom and that atom can become charged or ionized.

107
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:07,050
Now, depending on where you look, the actual amount of energy required to ionized an atom can differ.

108
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,550
Some books say it's too low as 10 electron volts, some say as many as 33.

109
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,280
For the purpose of this class, it doesn't really matter.

110
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:22,110
Just know that depending on our definition, we can draw a hard line and say this source of radiation has enough energy to immunize atoms.

111
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:27,600
So we consider it ionizing and less than that amount of electron volts is non-ionizing.

112
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,810
It does not have sort of an effort to actually put a charge on an atom.

113
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,970
So I've mentioned now particulate and electromagnetic wave radiation.

114
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:46,230
Let's dig into that a little bit more. So some of you may have heard of alpha particles or alpha radiation.

115
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,280
So an alpha particle is released when we've got an atom.

116
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,360
And again, it's an unstable atom and to try to become stable,

117
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,230
it's basically going to release two neutrons in two protons, which is essentially the core of a helium atom.

118
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,190
And so you can see here we've got this parent atom.

119
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:11,520
And again, to try to achieve stability, it's going to eject to two protons and neutrons.

120
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,930
And we call that cluster basically an alpha particle.

121
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:21,420
Now, two protons and neutrons on the atomic scale is actually a pretty massive object.

122
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,850
So this turns out to be a pretty heavy and very short range type of radiation.

123
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,900
It's produced essentially by some of the very heaviest radioactive elements.

124
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:38,580
So we're thinking here things like uranium, for instance, beta particle is again another particle.

125
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:48,750
And what happens here is, again, this atom to try to achieve stability essentially has a neutron that converts to a proton.

126
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,290
And as a result, this atom has a charge now on it.

127
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:57,400
And so it will release an electron basically free to out into the environment.

128
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:06,120
So a beta particle is just a loose electron, essentially. Now an electron has almost no mass compared to a proton or a neutron.

129
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,510
So this thing's very light. It's very small and it can travel a pretty far distance on an atomic scale.

130
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:18,480
And so beta radiation occurs from specific types of unstable elements.

131
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,630
So those are the two types of particulate radiation. And then the third thing I'll mention is gamma and x ray radiation.

132
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:30,750
You guys all know gamma radiation from watching Incredible Hulk potentially or The Avengers or some movie like that,

133
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,170
you know, Bruce Banner, gamma radiation, et cetera. So that's a real thing.

134
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,820
It's not just in the movies. And it turns out gamma radiation is released.

135
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:47,220
Basically, if an atom has tried to stabilize by releasing alpha and beta radiation and is still unstable.

136
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,380
So it's got a little extra energy. So it's going to get off this gamma or x ray radiation.

137
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:57,090
And this is this is a wave of energy. So it doesn't have mass.

138
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:01,140
It doesn't have a charge. And as a result, it's so small, no mass.

139
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:08,910
It can travel very, very long distances. So why do I bring up the distance that this radiation can travel?

140
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:15,420
Well, it turns out to be very important in terms of what happens when our body encounters radiation.

141
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:21,060
So let's say this matrix of blue dots here is human tissue.

142
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:27,750
Let's say this is your body. Well, an alpha particle, again, this is two two protons, two neutrons.

143
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,860
It's a very massive on an atomic scale. It's big.

144
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,780
It's very energetic, but it doesn't go very far. So it's easily stopped.

145
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,260
It's not going to penetrate very far into this tissue,

146
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:46,140
but it's going to cause a fair amount of damage where it does impact that tissue right at the surface.

147
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:52,440
Now, the beta particle, again, this is just a single loose electron, much smaller, much more penetrating.

148
00:14:52,440 --> 00:15:00,120
So this is going to go deeper into the tissue, but the damage is going to be more distributed and generally is going to be less

149
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,860
overall than what we see from an alpha particle and then gamma rays and x rays.

150
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,210
Again, this is pure energy. There's no mass. This is the most penetrating.

151
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:17,520
When this stuff hits tissue, it's going to tend to zip right through and travel all the way through your body and keep on going after that.

152
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:23,490
So, again, in terms of health impacts, what this means is an alpha particle is going to cause a lot of damage at the first surface.

153
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:29,220
It encounters a beta particle is going to go a little bit deeper and Gammas and X-rays are going to go right through us.

154
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:37,200
And of course, we take advantage of that every time you go to the dentist or the doctor to get an X-ray, we can use this for imaging.

155
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:43,230
So another important concept when it comes to ionizing radiation is the concept of halflife.

156
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:48,840
And so this is a very same equation that you see when we're looking at, for example,

157
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,830
how long does a chemical hang around once it gets into your body so we can describe

158
00:15:52,830 --> 00:16:00,510
the half life of any element as the natural log of two divided by LAMDA here.

159
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:06,850
And so why do I bring up Halflife? Well, not all sources or types of radiation are created equally.

160
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:16,440
So if we look at uranium 238, which is a radionuclide associated with power generation, or also with weapons,

161
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,750
nuclear weapons, you can see we've got a Half-Life here of four and a half billion years.

162
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:27,990
You know, that's a big chunk of our planet's history. This is not something where it's like, well, just put it in a room and we'll let it decay.

163
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:35,610
And then when it's safe, we'll bring it out. This is long past any human sort of comprehension of time.

164
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:44,310
Plutonium 239 and other weapons associated. Radionuclide has a Half-Life that's much shorter, but still almost 25000 years.

165
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:49,890
So again, unlike. A lot of chemicals that we deal with in environmental health where we might say, well,

166
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:55,080
this stuff tends to degrade once it gets in the environment and after a year or two, it's going to be gone.

167
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,790
You know, this stuff is still present 25000 years later or billions of years later.

168
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,950
So it's a different timescale to think about in terms of managing it safely.

169
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,870
We've also got carbon 14. Is that ring a bell for anyone?

170
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,860
What is carbon 14 used for? Yeah, exactly.

171
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:20,670
Carbon dating or radio dating. So this stuff has a half life of only five thousand seven hundred and thirty years.

172
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,430
So much shorter, but still very, very long.

173
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:30,000
On the other hand, we can look at cesium 137, which has a bunch of industrial and medical applications that has a half life of only 30 days.

174
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,910
So that might be something that we could lock away in a room and say we're just going to

175
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:39,480
let this degrade until it's basically most of it is gone and we're down to a safe level.

176
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:48,360
Tritium has a half life of just under two weeks and radon has a half life of three point eight days will come back to that in a minute as well.

177
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:54,720
So, again, depending on the element we're working with, we may have a relatively short term concern like radon.

178
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,470
You know, if we can sort of stop the radon generation,

179
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,020
most of it's going to be gone in the order of a couple of weeks or uranium where

180
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:08,920
it doesn't really degrade in any meaningful sense over the human lifetime.

181
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:14,380
So when it comes to measuring radiation exposure, we've got a couple of different principles we can think about.

182
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:23,380
So one is just this concept of radioactivity, basically how much ionizing radiation is being released or how many atoms in a particular

183
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:29,950
amount of a given radionuclide are going to decay or emit radiation over a given time period.

184
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:35,350
And some of you may be familiar with the units here. So we talk about radioactivity in terms of the curing.

185
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:45,160
And after Madame Curie and Curie, her husband, as well as the becquerel named after unrepairable, their collaborator.

186
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:53,650
And so just like everything around the world, we've got units that we use here in the US and there's the units that the rest of the world views.

187
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:58,510
And of course, we're sort of stuck here in the U.S. if we're reading an international paper

188
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:03,070
and having to do the calculations in our head to translate back and forth.

189
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:09,790
So that's how much radiation is being released. But we're also interested in how much radiation is actually getting into my body.

190
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:17,740
And in that, we're talking in terms of individual dose. And here in the U.S., we use term we use units called Rad's.

191
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:25,900
But the the international or metric system unit is a gray here at least we have a pretty decent exchange where 100 rads is equal to one grade.

192
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,940
So 100 to one ratio. That's a little easier to do the math in your head.

193
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,720
And then we have what we're particularly interested in, which is the so-called effective dose.

194
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,080
So this is how much radiation is getting into me accounting for the fact that it's a

195
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,660
certain type of tissue or a certain sort of potential for damage from the radiation.

196
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:52,210
And here we use units called REM's in the U.S. and the international system uses sieverts.

197
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,690
And again, we have one hundred to one sort of exchange rate there.

198
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:04,840
So that's relatively convenient. So let's let's try another poll here just to keep you guys active again.

199
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:11,290
I know it is early to be learning about radiation, so if you could jump back into poll everywhere, Dotcom.

200
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,350
And this is just a question comparing different activities.

201
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:22,390
So which one of these activities do you think might give you the greatest personal exposure?

202
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:27,610
OK, so we've got coast to coast airline flight. Maybe not when you're watching TV.

203
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:54,370
God, I hope not. I'll let you guys populate this here.

204
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:59,260
All right, looks like things are stabilizing a little bit here, so coast to coast airline flight,

205
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,420
what's the concern or what's the source of radiation you might get there?

206
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:10,450
Cosmic rays. Exactly. So if we're at 35000 feet, there's less atmosphere absorbing that radiation.

207
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:17,620
And so we're getting more cosmic radiation. Absolutely. How many of you have seen the movie Radium Girls about?

208
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,620
Yeah, it's a fantastic movie. Highly recommend.

209
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:28,420
So this is about women back in the 20s and 30s who were painting radium basically onto watches to make the dial's glow

210
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:36,850
and licking their paintbrushes in doing so and getting just horrible taste of cancer from doing this over a long period.

211
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,570
So some of you put or at least one of you put two days living in Denver.

212
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:49,570
What's the concern in Denver compared to Atlanta? Which nobody picked.

213
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:55,540
Yeah, absolutely right. So Denver sits at five thousand two hundred eighty feet, Atlanta is more like 600 feet.

214
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,190
And so there's there's simply less atmosphere between Denver and the cosmos.

215
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,490
So they get a bit more cosmic radiation there. Again, glad to see you.

216
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,680
A bunch of skeptics here. You didn't take the obvious pain of living next to a nuclear plant.

217
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,130
And watching TV is a trivial source as well.

218
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:17,880
So I'll give you the answer here, which is, in fact, you're all right.

219
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,670
Each of these things gives you a dose of about one milligram.

220
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:26,710
So, again, we have to think about, well, how long does the exposure last as a days?

221
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:32,960
Is it a single aircraft flight? Is it a year? And then, of course, the amount of radiation that's actually deposited into you.

222
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,290
So all of those things are giving you, again, about one million of exposure.

223
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,440
All right. So why am I harping on radiation so much?

224
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,530
Well, as we heard early on, certainly cancer is one of the things we worry about in terms of radiation.

225
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:54,610
And in fact, for radiation or ionizing radiation specifically, we divide health outcomes into basically two major categories.

226
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:59,650
So one is deterministic, as we say, or you might also think of this as acute.

227
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:05,260
So this is damage that's going to happen very shortly, maybe hours to days after an exposure.

228
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,220
And then we have so-called stochastic or late health outcomes.

229
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:16,360
And so this is damage like cancer that might occur maybe years to decades after a big exposure.

230
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,370
So we've got two different dose response curves here. And I don't know if you've talked about dose response curves.

231
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:30,910
OK, so so the idea behind a dose response curve here is we're trying to relate how much radiation do you get from very little to to a lot.

232
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:38,740
And we're looking at sort of what are the what's the amount of damage that you might incur from no damage all the way up to a lot of damage.

233
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:47,230
And so for these deterministic effects, so again, this is sort of damage you might get very acutely within hours to days after an exposure.

234
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:53,560
We think there's a sigmoidal effect here where there might be some threshold.

235
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:59,980
And so that's this point where the sigmoidal curve here intersects with the x axis.

236
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:08,920
So there might be a threshold actually below, which there's no risk of any acute effects and above which you can see the effects start

237
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,960
to rise pretty pretty quickly and then they start to plateau at higher dose levels.

238
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,750
So that's again for the acute effects for the stochastic or more long term effects.

239
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:23,590
We actually think there's a linear relationship here, not that sigmoidal shaped curve.

240
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:29,170
And in the case of long term or stochastic effects like cancer that was mentioned earlier here,

241
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,770
you can see that line actually never crosses the x axis,

242
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:40,570
meaning there's no threshold, there's no safe dose of radiation to avoid those long term health impacts.

243
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,290
So, again, we're either worried about what's acute, what's happening immediately,

244
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:49,990
typically after a high exposure or what's more of a long term outcome like cancer.

245
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:54,340
So what are the acute effects of radiation exposure? Well, it turns out there's a ton of them.

246
00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:00,340
You can see there are many systems that can be impacted, virtually every system in the human body, in fact.

247
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,890
And really what's impacted and how badly it's impacted is depending on the dose that you get.

248
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:11,780
So you can see here down at 10 milligram, which is about the dose you get from a single chest x ray.

249
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,090
We're down in the Green Zone here.

250
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:20,830
We're really not worried you could get many chest x rays in a year and not be at any risk of an adverse health outcome.

251
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:24,250
We're still in the Green Zone for a mammogram.

252
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:32,890
Again, we've got the yearly dose for airline crews from cosmic radiation is a little less than one REM or 900 milligram.

253
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:40,450
If you were to get just a single full body CT scan or computed tomography scan, that's going to be about one gram of exposure.

254
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,400
Again, still in the Green Zone.

255
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:51,190
And two REM is actually what we allow a worker in a nuclear power generating facility to get in terms of an exposure over the course of a year.

256
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:58,480
So that's all Green Zone. No concerns really, where we start to get concerned, as if you have an exposure of about 40 REM or so.

257
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:05,290
That's the highest exposure that occurred in a given hour during the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown.

258
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:12,220
And the suspicion is that if you had 40 REM for four hours, that could cause acute radiation sickness.

259
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:19,630
So this is sort of the transition point between are you maybe going to have

260
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:24,070
something down the line to actually you're going to get sick pretty quick here.

261
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:30,220
So once we get up to about 200 ran, this is where you have acute radiation system excuse me, sickness.

262
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,760
So you're going to start to get impacts potentially on your digestive system,

263
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,190
on your central nervous system and exposure of 500 REM is going to kill about half of

264
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:45,130
the people who have that exposure within about a month and exposure of a thousand REM.

265
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,690
So a huge amount. Again, this is, you know, many times greater than.

266
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:57,420
Chest X-ray is going to be uniformly 100 percent fatal within days, so you can see we've got exposures that we're really not concerned about,

267
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,260
like the medical imaging all the way up to a thousand ram, which would be, you know,

268
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:06,270
if you were involved very closely in a nuclear accident, you could get that kind of dose.

269
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:12,570
And at that point, it's it's a certainty that you will die. So that's sort of the acute effects.

270
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:17,250
But again, we can think about the stochastic or the late health effects in terms of what we're worried about here.

271
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:26,160
As you heard earlier, it's typically cancer and it's basically every kind of cancer you can conceive of has been linked to ionizing radiation.

272
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,900
We're also concerned, though, of course, about genetic effects.

273
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:36,960
And so the idea that maybe our DNA is mutated by an exposure to radiation and, you know,

274
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,820
well, we can watch movies and think, OK, that's going to give me some superpowers. You know, that's not really how it works.

275
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,840
It's going to tend more to incline you towards sickness.

276
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,210
So the thought about stochastic effects, again, if we look back to the acute effects for a moment,

277
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:56,160
10 milligram, a single chest x ray, we're not really worried about that.

278
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:02,760
Even 10 REM. We're starting to get up to the point where as an acute exposure, that's probably not going to make you sick.

279
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:10,590
But if you have a single exposure of 10 Lammermoor, that's where we really think your cancer risk starts to increase dramatically.

280
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:18,960
And if you have an exposure up to 100 grams. So again, this is well above the level where you might get acute radiation sickness.

281
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,230
You have, based on statistical modeling, about a five percent increase in your risk of cancer.

282
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:28,890
So a lot of what we understand about radiation health effects, of course,

283
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:37,020
has come from the two nuclear weapons that we dropped in World War Two, but also from accidents have occurred and workers that we've monitored.

284
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:43,440
So you can see even 100 RAM, which is a pretty high exposure, is not associated with, you know, 100 percent likelihood of cancer.

285
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,570
It's still a very relatively small increase risk of cancer, but it is an increase.

286
00:28:48,570 --> 00:29:00,120
And of course, we want to keep that risk as low as possible in terms of promoting environmental health or during a specific time.

287
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:08,190
So this would be cumulative, actually. So so most of us are getting on the order of, let's say, about 600 million per year.

288
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:12,120
So over the years, we're going to hit 10. Absolutely.

289
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,250
And so, again, we might have a small increase in cancer risk at the point where we reach 100 REM.

290
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:23,670
Cumulatively, that risk is going to be, again, about five percent, but at 600 million per year,

291
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,900
you know, it takes us a fair amount of time to get up to 100 grand in terms of a cumulative exposure.

292
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:34,050
Great question. So what are sort of safe levels of ionizing radiation?

293
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:39,960
Well, as I mentioned already, we do have regulations for nuclear power plant workers.

294
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:47,250
And in fact, the actually I'm realizing I pulled this apology's here.

295
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:53,850
I pulled this slide from a source in the United Kingdom where they have a different regular radiation standard for workers.

296
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,320
So I'm going to have to update that.

297
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:06,630
So in the United States, just to be clear, we have a limit of 5000 mg or five REM per year for workers who are working in a nuclear power plant.

298
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:11,040
So that's basically we're permitting them to have exposure.

299
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,840
But the understanding is they're working in a plant. They're going to be monitored, they're going to be surveilled.

300
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,230
That dose is going to be known pretty darn accurately.

301
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:26,640
And of course, if they hit that dose, then they have to basically stop working for the year or go to a non exposed part of the plant.

302
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,860
And that's where they're going to spend the rest of the year because they've used up their entire dose basically.

303
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:37,740
Again, excuse me, a whole body CT scan is going to be about one gram or 1000 mg.

304
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:45,930
As I said a moment ago, the typical American's average dose in a year is going to be about 620 mg.

305
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:52,500
A chunk of that certainly comes from background radiation, including things like radon.

306
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:58,140
I'll just compare these to Greenbrier's. So if you work in a nuclear plant, you can get five REM per year.

307
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:05,220
If you live by a nuclear plant, you are allowed only one gram or 100 milligram.

308
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:11,640
So the idea here being we're we're sort of tolerant of higher exposures for workers because, again,

309
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:17,190
we're tracking those workers, but we don't want to just be randomly exposing the public to radiation.

310
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:24,480
We're not tracking them so closely. And because we're not doing surveillance on them, we want to have a much more protective limit for the public.

311
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:34,020
And so that's why the difference there. In terms of, again, where you and I sort of as typical Americans get our dose from, again,

312
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:42,390
the vast majority of the average Americans dose is going to come from radon or Thorazine, exposures that are naturally occurring.

313
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:48,180
If you do end up having sort of a bad health year and you get a bunch of medical imaging done, so CT scans,

314
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:56,010
nuclear medicine, et cetera, that can easily be the dominant source for that year when you're getting all that imaging done.

315
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:03,660
But again, for a given year, Anon's sort of health crisis year, most of your radiation is going to come from background exposure.

316
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:12,630
We do get some from space. We get some internal exposure. There's consumer products that have small amounts of radiation in them.

317
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:21,750
Occupational and industrial exposures tend to be quite low. So, again, for most of us, radon is the actual concern here.

318
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:28,050
You may not know. Well, actually, let me ask, what is the leading cause of lung cancer in the United States?

319
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:33,150
I'll give you a softball here. It is smoking.

320
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,270
Exactly. All right, good.

321
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:45,190
So the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States turns out to be rate and radon is not equally distributed across the United States.

322
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,850
So you can see a map here,

323
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:58,840
red here indicate zones that are likely to have exposures that are above what the EPA considers to be an acceptable amount, which is for picocuries.

324
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,240
So a very small amount of radioactivity per liter of air.

325
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,530
And you can see there's also sort of this orange zone and then there's a yellow zone which

326
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:13,290
has the lowest amounts or sort of amounts that the EPA considers to be not of concern.

327
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:21,210
And you'll see these red, orange and yellow zones are very much unequally distributed across the U.S. So here in southeast Michigan,

328
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,570
actually, Washtenaw County is in a red zone here.

329
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:30,630
Where I came from prior to working at Michigan was the University of Washington in Seattle, which was a yellow zone.

330
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:39,810
So I'll tell you, when I came to Michigan, we moved into a rental house that had a great playroom for my daughter in the basement.

331
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,600
So we had her playing down there for four months and months.

332
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:48,780
And then January rolled around January of 2012 and someone was like, hey, you know, Happy Radon Awareness Month.

333
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:55,020
And I was like, what the [INAUDIBLE]? That's a thing. And it's a thing. And so they said, you should get your house tested for radon.

334
00:33:55,020 --> 00:34:02,370
And so I did. So this is about the cheapest environmental health test you can do at home for about 11 dollars.

335
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:07,320
You can buy a test kit from Washtenaw County Environmental Health. They'll send you the kit.

336
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,190
It's basically a little activated charcoal tube.

337
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:18,000
You put it in the lowest level of your home. You leave it exposed for, say, one to a couple of days.

338
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,970
You ship it off to the lab and the lab emails you your results. So it's very easy to do, very inexpensive.

339
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:31,540
And when we did it and we got our results back, this playroom we had my daughter playing in was five times over the EPA limit.

340
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,790
So I'm going to feel like a monster for the rest of my life. But that's what parenting is all about.

341
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:41,700
If any of you have kids, you know, prove them wrong when we put it that way.

342
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:49,770
So so this was unfortunate, but it was something where, again, the cumulative dose she got was relatively small over a period of couple of months.

343
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:55,980
And the great news is we actually talked to the landlords and they were able to fix this very well by health standards,

344
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:04,320
very inexpensively for about seven hundred dollars and brought our levels down from 20 picocuries to leader to about one picocuries per liter.

345
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,960
So, again, I was in a part of the country where radon simply isn't a thing. Radon is a thing here in Washington County.

346
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,230
You can see it is a thing throughout the plains and part of the northeast and parts of Appalachia as well.

347
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:22,080
This is due purely to geology. So we're there tends to be uranium deposits or Thoratec deposits underground.

348
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:28,770
We tend to have high levels of radon. And again, just to sort of put this into perspective for you,

349
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:35,650
so we have more people die from radon related lung cancer every year than we have died from drunk driving incidents.

350
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:40,650
So this is not a trivial source of public health burden.

351
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:49,230
I will mention that the EPA recognizes that radon is a substantial health threat and they actually have a bunch of resources available here.

352
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:57,120
So, again, you can look at your home county and figure out what are the sort of typical radon exposures in that county.

353
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,840
I will say radon varies tremendously across space.

354
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:05,070
So, for instance, we tested our basement and it was 20 picocuries per liter.

355
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:09,840
The neighbors whose basement was about 30 feet away were down at like two picocuries per liter.

356
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:19,650
So we were very close spatially, but we had very different exposures. And so, again, I'd encourage you to to get your own home tested.

357
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:25,260
Radon is a heavier than air gas, so it tends to settle in the lowest part of your house.

358
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:29,580
So if you have a crawlspace or something where nobody lives, we're not really concerned there.

359
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:36,570
You would test sort of the lowest level above your crawl space. If you live in the basement, that's where you want to test.

360
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,180
And again, I will say the fix here is very simple.

361
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:49,050
So so once you figure out you have a problem, basically they come they drill a hole in the slab or the floor of your basement.

362
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,220
They put a pump down there and they basically suck the radon out of the ground.

363
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,050
And they ejected through a pipe at your roofline. So it gets out into the environment.

364
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:04,350
It can dissipate there and it's not concentrating in your house. So, again, 700 bucks is not trivial, but his house repairs go.

365
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:11,490
It's actually not bad because they can run into the tens of thousands, potentially something else I'll introduce you to.

366
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:20,820
So the EPA also has a calculate your rate on excuse me, a radiation dose calculator here that you can plug in some personal details where you live,

367
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:30,090
sort of have you had medical imaging procedures done and it'll spit out its best estimate of your dose, I will say, in all the time.

368
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,750
I've taught this class I only had one time where a woman,

369
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:44,250
one of your your predecessors ended up having this hugely elevated radiation dose for the year because she had had a whole slew of medical imaging,

370
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:50,370
including a couple of full body scans. So, again, if most of you do this, you're going to see on, you know, right down around the average.

371
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:59,130
But some of you may be sort of exceptional. I will also say, again, the Environmental Protection Agency is very interested in radiation health.

372
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:06,800
They have a whole radiation monitoring network or RadNet that you can see is spread all around the United States.

373
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,690
This was used historically to monitor the atmosphere,

374
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:16,890
to make sure people weren't exploding nuclear bombs in violation of our comprehensive test ban treaty.

375
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:23,820
But we can also use it to look for unexplained spikes in radiation that might indicate that a meltdown is going on somewhere.

376
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,510
Or, you know, there's been a dirty bomb exploded, all sorts of different things.

377
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:33,750
And so you can see we have actually a number of those monitoring stations right here in Michigan.

378
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,670
So let me ask you a question now.

379
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:43,080
Given what we've learned about ionizing radiation and given the fact that I'm an industrial hygienist and I tend to focus mostly on the workplace,

380
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:51,290
what kind of jobs do you think are out there where people might actually be exposed to ionizing radiation at work?

381
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,490
Just paper mills, actually. Sure.

382
00:38:54,490 --> 00:39:03,520
So paper mills, they often use radiation as a way to measure the paper thickness and quality that's coming out of their machines.

383
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:11,170
So they do have sources built into the process. They're typically fairly well controlled because they're they're static sources.

384
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:16,870
But there are also certain types of trees that will selectively take in certain radionuclide.

385
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:21,400
And so if you're harvesting those trees and running them through a paper mill, then you're getting exposed to that.

386
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:28,240
Those radionuclide, great example. Yeah, I also say working in a hospital, giant magnets.

387
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,820
Sure. Also so we have magnetic exposure, which is another physical exposure.

388
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:41,870
But hospitals also often have nuclear medicine. So, you know, applying radiation to try to cure cancer.

389
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:47,500
X-ray department, CT scanners. Absolutely. So health care is a great example.

390
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:53,000
Others were a little bit like the TSA and their X-ray.

391
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,650
They're not sure. Yeah. So you've got those TSA?

392
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:02,860
I try not to think of them as Gunes, but I've been shaking down more times by the TSA than anybody else in my life.

393
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,580
Anyway, those folks are sitting there next to an X-ray scanner all day long.

394
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:12,970
And of course, the scanner is designed in a way that it's shielded and containing the radiation.

395
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:19,090
But you're right, if it's not perfectly shielded or, you know, it's open on both ends, there is the potential for exposure there.

396
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:31,420
Absolutely. Other jobs. But you have some something especially creative where they think someone might have radiation, geography, miners, miners.

397
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:37,390
Great. Yeah. So, in fact, a lot of what we know about the impacts of radon on health come from uranium miners,

398
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:45,640
because wherever there's uranium, there is radon gas. And so many of the historic studies were done on miners to try to tease out, well,

399
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:51,950
what direct exposure might they have had from actually mining uranium versus what they inhaled in terms of radon.

400
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:59,380
So that that's a great example. And again, radon is heavier than air, so it's going to tend to concentrate below ground and tiles.

401
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:05,860
Great. So I'll fast forward to the short answer here, which is lots of jobs have radiation exposure.

402
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,810
So you've mentioned a couple of them.

403
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:18,820
You know, certainly nuclear medicine workers, health care folks, dental workers do X-rays pretty routinely as well as do vets as do chiropractors.

404
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:23,800
You know, nuclear power plant operators are certainly a great example here.

405
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,420
As I said, radiation is used in manufacturing like the pulp and paper industry.

406
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:34,700
You mentioned airport security. Absolutely right. X rays are used to inspect shipping containers.

407
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:40,090
So if you're involved in Customs and Border Enforcement, you may have exposures.

408
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:42,080
Researchers work with radiation all the time.

409
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:50,050
So, in fact, there's tons of jobs out there that have potential exposures, but there's relatively few that have potential for very high exposures.

410
00:41:50,050 --> 00:42:00,910
And so those are the ones we tend to focus on most. All right, so that's ionizing radiation in a nutshell, I know that's a lot to take in.

411
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:04,750
I'm going to switch now and start to talk about non-ionizing radiation.

412
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:10,870
And so, again, recall, this is radiation that just doesn't quite have enough to actually ionize an atom.

413
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:18,940
But but absolutely can still be bad for us. So what we're looking at here is a portrayal of the electromagnetic spectrum.

414
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,660
And so we've been focusing on ionizing radiation, which is over here on the right.

415
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:27,220
So we've got x rays and gamma rays and alpha and beta particles.

416
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:33,520
Again, here, we're typically worried about DNA damage or again, some of that acute radiation sickness.

417
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:41,560
We also have ultraviolet light and there are certain bands of ultraviolet light that are powerful enough to be ionizing.

418
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:47,470
Ultraviolet is kind of unique in that it spans the gap between ionizing and non-ionizing.

419
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:52,900
So some types of UV light can be again, they can cause ionization.

420
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,670
Others are not powerful enough to do that, but can cause other types of health outcomes.

421
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:04,880
But you can see that the non-ionizing portion of the spectrum here is quite large and it includes lots of things that we take advantage of as humans.

422
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:14,680
So we're talking things like radio frequency waves or microwaves or infrared energy and of course, the visible light spectrum that we see in.

423
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,850
And so we'll sort of dove into each of these in turn.

424
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,110
I do want to highlight, though,

425
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:26,660
that the health effects from exposures to these different frequencies of non-ionizing radiation, radiation are different.

426
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:33,130
So some of them can actually cause the induction of electrical currents in your body, which can be harmful.

427
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:38,320
Some of them have thermal effects like a microwave. Of course, it heats up our frozen burrito very effectively.

428
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,440
It can do the same thing to our body given the chance.

429
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:50,260
And some of them are optical, where they can tend to harm our eyes, sort of the most vulnerable part of our body for optical radiation.

430
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:54,970
So, again, lots of industrial applications here for extremely low frequency.

431
00:43:54,970 --> 00:44:00,970
These are the frequencies that we transmit power along high voltage power lines by anyone here.

432
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:03,700
Heard of AM Radio? I think that's still a thing. Yeah.

433
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:11,410
So we use the AM and FM frequency spectra again, microwaves, heat lamps, tanning booths, all these things,

434
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:16,630
you know, maybe more or less relevant to our lives, but they're definitely in use everywhere.

435
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:25,450
So we'll start with extremely low frequency and so for exposed to energy basically in this extremely low frequency range.

436
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:33,550
And this, again, is associated with things like power lines. But it's also what we use to communicate with submarines under water.

437
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:41,830
We use this particular part of the electromagnetic spectrum which can penetrate water to to talk to our ourselves out around the world.

438
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:46,480
So one of the problems with these extremely low frequency exposures is they can actually induce,

439
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,270
again, an electrical current in your body without you actually touching them, just being near them.

440
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:57,010
If you're very close to them, they can actually cause burns in your body.

441
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:01,030
There are lots of folks who have conjectured that, for example,

442
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:06,850
living under power lines might increase your risk of cancer, leukemia, particularly for a while.

443
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:13,090
In the 80s and 90s, there was a concern about kids living under power lines being at increased risk of leukemia.

444
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:17,320
There's also been suggestions that this could have reproductive effects or developmental effects.

445
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,140
I would say at this point, still, there's no conclusive evidence.

446
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:27,730
There are people who think this could be real and there are other folks that say it's it's just not biologically plausible for these health outcomes.

447
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:32,680
So this remains an area of some concern.

448
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:40,570
So along with these extremely low frequency exposures for sort of electric on the electric end of the spectrum,

449
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:46,300
we heard the example of magnets which can absolutely also cause different health effects.

450
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:52,540
So the problem with electricity, so some of you may know that our electricity reverses polarity 60 times a second.

451
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:59,500
So we have 60 hertz electricity. Every time that reversal occurs, we're getting a field that's being changed in our body.

452
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:07,180
So 60 times a second are we're being influenced by this change and the same can occur with magnetism.

453
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:11,860
So any time you have an electric field, you're also going to have a magnetic field.

454
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:12,790
Why is this a concern?

455
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:22,180
Well, if you're generating a magnetic field in the human body, for example, cardiac pacemakers are sometimes programed using similar frequencies.

456
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:26,140
So your pacemaker may reset in the presence of a magnet.

457
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,060
That doesn't mean you're going to die immediately.

458
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:35,890
It will still run, but it means it's going to lose your personal settings and probably not going to be a good thing for someone with a cardiac issue.

459
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:41,170
We also have this issue around MRI's, especially where we've got this massive magnet.

460
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:46,330
And when it turns on, you can have anything magnetic getting sucked into that device.

461
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:53,870
So, you know, MRI is are not the friendliest looking devices, even when they're not sort of actively.

462
00:46:53,870 --> 00:47:02,210
Causing harm. So there's stories you can jump online and find lots of these more than you might think of, like a police officer taking,

463
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:07,900
you know, a prisoner in for an MRI and having your guidance sucked out of their holster into the MRI machine with the prisoner.

464
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:13,720
That's not good for him. I'm told, though, I'm not a police officer. And I will say I just had to include this image.

465
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:20,870
I mean, that's that's exactly what I think of as an MRI. I'm finding some ferromagnetic objects and I will devour them.

466
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:26,860
I have a very small life, as you can tell. So I mentioned radio frequency and microwaves.

467
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:32,190
So for this part of the non-ionizing spectrum, we're primarily concerned with thermal effects.

468
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:38,030
So heating of the body for high, high exposures to radio frequencies.

469
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:41,960
So this might be the frequencies, for example, that our cell phones operate on.

470
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,630
We can get actually behavioral disruption.

471
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:49,790
There's a thought that perhaps your central nervous system is heated and you start to have sort of unpredictable

472
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:55,820
behaviors that resolve when you cool down and high microwave exposures can have the same sort of thing.

473
00:47:55,820 --> 00:48:02,270
In fact, there's a phenomenon called microwave sickness, where, for example, if you are a worker on a microwave tower,

474
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:07,520
you might experience headaches or dizziness or irritability, even sleeplessness.

475
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,320
And these are things that don't necessarily resolve right away but could actually become chronic.

476
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:17,780
I will say again, there's sort of some competing or conflicting epidemiological literature here.

477
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:20,600
As I said, not a lot of folks study physical hazards.

478
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:27,040
So our understanding of these is not as far along as it might be for for some types of chemicals.

479
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:32,600
I mentioned optical radiation earlier. We've got infrared and ultraviolet.

480
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,630
I'm sure all of you have at least heard those terms before.

481
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:42,380
And again, these are just different frequencies of light that excuse me, of energy that are coming into contact with our body.

482
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:49,760
So we've got UV and some of you may know UV, A or B or C, you may have seen that on your sunscreen, for instance.

483
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:55,400
We have visible light that we all see in and then we have infrared A and B and C as well.

484
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:03,320
And so you'll see here the health effects for ultraviolet tend to be things like photo keratitis or snow blindness,

485
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,050
which some of you may have experienced before.

486
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:11,480
For visible light and infrared, you can actually burn your retinas or you can burn the corneas of your eyes.

487
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,050
There are also linked cataracts, for instance.

488
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:24,110
And then for some types of ultraviolet light, the ionizing bands you can get erythema or reddening of your skin,

489
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:27,800
and then all of these can cause thermal skin burns.

490
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:35,090
This little graph at the bottom here, kind of the canyons, shows how deeply these different frequencies actually penetrate into your skin.

491
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:38,790
And you can see infrared a here actually penetrates most deeply.

492
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:44,300
So if you're exposed to infrared, see, you're probably going to get a burn at the surface of your skin versus infrared.

493
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:50,900
A, you're going to need a subdermal burn, which is tends to be much, much worse and extremely painful.

494
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:55,340
These are all exposures, again, that all of us have all of the time.

495
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:58,940
Infrared radiation actually is what warms our body most.

496
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:03,590
We have this giant yellow orb in the sky for at least like six months a year in Michigan.

497
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:06,380
That that gives us tons of radiant heat.

498
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:12,650
If you guys have ever seen a glassblowing demonstration, someone doing it by hand, there's tremendous amounts of infrared there.

499
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:18,020
Cooks, people who work in kitchens that have heat lamps can get a lot of exposure as well.

500
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:22,190
And again, here for for high exposure, we're worried about burns.

501
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:26,460
Lower exposures have been linked to an increased risk of of cataracts.

502
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:34,400
In fact, a lot of what we know about workers excuse me, a lot of what we know about health conditions has come from workers who have become sick.

503
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:40,260
So there's a condition called a glassblowers cataract, for example. And again, we benefit from this as well.

504
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:46,160
So every time you get a fast food burger that's been sitting under a heat lamp, you know, that's courtesy of infrared.

505
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:53,120
We can also use infrared imaging, for example, to take a snapshot of our house and figure out where is the heat escaping from my house,

506
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:59,930
where the cracks I need to seal or for example, where's a cool spot that might indicate that water is leaking in my wall.

507
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:04,280
So we definitely take advantage of that for ultraviolet light.

508
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,940
Again, erythema is what maybe most of us are concerned about.

509
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:17,840
You would think of that as a sunburn, sort of reddening of your skin. UVB specifically is associated with carcinogenesis or skin cancer.

510
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:23,030
UVB is also associated with just sort of aging of your skin and toughening of your skin.

511
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:26,840
So certainly we have skin impacts. We also very much have impacts here.

512
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:32,990
So UVA and UVB can inflame your cornea. Again, this is called photo keratitis.

513
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:38,480
Technically, it's also called welder's flash because welders have pretty intense ultraviolet exposures.

514
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,730
And without a welder's shield, you're going to get this effect, which is also called snow blindness.

515
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:48,320
So if any of you have ever been skiing or out in the snow in a very bright day,

516
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:52,550
at the end of the day, you may feel like you have sand in your eyes that may last for a day or two.

517
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:58,540
That's actually. Damage that's occurred to your cornea that that your body can repair.

518
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:02,050
And then again, we have the risk of cataracts.

519
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:08,740
So I know we're we're going through these quickly here, trying to punctuate with there's not much physical hazards humor out there.

520
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:16,930
Folks, try to bear with me here, but we'll shift away from the electromagnetic spectrum to thermal exposures here.

521
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:21,790
And in fact, let me talk about some high heat stress environments.

522
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:27,400
So if any of you have ever been to a metal manufacturing facility,

523
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:34,540
a steel foundry or an aluminum smelter, incredibly high temperatures needed to create and mold metal.

524
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:38,050
But again, you don't have to work in some obscure manufacturing setting.

525
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:44,080
If you work in a kitchen, you can have potentially very high thermal stress, you know,

526
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:51,310
road crews out on a hot summer day in Michigan who have the ambient environmental temperature plus the heat coming off the asphalt.

527
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:59,170
They're working with lots of potential for heat stress there. There are dozens of workers who die every single year in the United States as a result

528
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:05,230
of heat stroke from working in agricultural settings with insufficient protection.

529
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:10,480
You know, firefighters, they don this turnout gear to keep them safe from fire and heat.

530
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:18,910
But in fact, their body generates a lot of heat and then doesn't escape from that turnout gear so they can have heat stroke as well.

531
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:22,180
And then, you know, we live in a warming environment.

532
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:29,380
And so as climate change occurs, as temperatures increase, we're all at increased risk of high thermal exposures.

533
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:34,750
Some parts of the US, you know, especially vulnerable to that. The Southwest is already a very hot place.

534
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:39,370
So a pretty small change in temperature there may result in us going from, gosh, this is hot to gosh,

535
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:48,220
this is no longer a livable climate, whereas places like Michigan, we're not sort of so close to the edge there.

536
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:54,550
So in terms of how we regulate heat in our body or thermal regulation, there's a couple of things I'll I'll have you think about.

537
00:53:54,550 --> 00:54:00,590
One is we have to acknowledge that just being alive requires energy and that burning that energy has heat.

538
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:07,600
So we all have a so-called basal metabolic rate. That's how much energy and heat we generate just to stay alive.

539
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:13,780
On top of that, we might do work. So standing up here lecturing, I'm working a little harder than you sitting in your chairs.

540
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:21,910
But if I was out shoveling a hole or something, I would have much more work. So work plus basal metabolism is basically how much heat are we creating?

541
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:25,600
And then we have various ways that heat is exchanged with the environment.

542
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:34,180
So we have evaporation. So as we sweat and that sweat evaporates, that's a cooling mechanism that we use very effectively.

543
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:40,150
We have radiation and so we may have radiant heat coming from the environment around us into our bodies.

544
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:44,260
Or if we're in a cold environment, our bodies are radiating heat out into the environment.

545
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:53,290
We're losing heat. We also have convection, which is heat that's transferred to us by the movement of air or water across our bodies.

546
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:57,640
And then we have conduction. And conduction is one we don't typically worry about except for maybe two cases.

547
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:02,620
So if you're, again, a cook working in a kitchen and you touch a very hot stove element,

548
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:05,800
you're going to get some conduction and maybe a burn from that.

549
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:12,340
And then, as you'll all notice, in about five months, unless you have a really good pair of shoes here in winter,

550
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:17,290
you will get conductive heat loss specifically through your feet, which are in contact with the cold ground.

551
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:23,320
So get a good pair of boots. I guess this is what I'm trying to say there. And so we've got heat coming in.

552
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,200
We've got heat being generated. We've got heat going out.

553
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:32,620
We try to sum up all those things to create what we call a heat storage rate or capital s here.

554
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:37,600
And so if that heat storage rate is positive, that means our temperature is increasing.

555
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,740
If it's negative, that means it's decreasing. And that heat storage rate is zero.

556
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:48,220
That means we're sort of neutral with the environment around us. So what are we worried about in terms of being too hot?

557
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:53,140
Well, there's really two types of heat illnesses that we're most concerned about.

558
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,360
So the first is heat exhaustion.

559
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:04,150
And so this is basically something that occurs when your body is right at its capacity to maximally cool you off in a hot environment.

560
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:10,150
So you start to get effects like dizziness or headache. You're sweating as hard as you possibly can.

561
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:18,250
That's your body's primary defense. You're going to have a fast heartbeat as your heart tries to move blood to your extremities to to lose heat.

562
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:22,360
That way, you'll tend to have nausea and vomiting and maybe cramps.

563
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:28,090
So heat exhaustion is bad. It's a precursor to heat stroke, but it's something we can absolutely arrest.

564
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:33,310
You know, give the person hydration, put them in shade or cool, and they can recover.

565
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:38,500
Now, when your body exceeds its capacity to cool itself is when we're at risk of heat stroke.

566
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:43,960
So here the symptoms are a little different here. You're no longer sweating because you've sweated all you possibly can.

567
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:49,090
So your skin is red and hot and dry. You're going to have a very high core temperature.

568
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:53,140
You're absolutely going to have central nervous system effects, confusion.

569
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:58,690
Fainting, potentially convulsions, and this is the one that can lead to death if it's not arrested.

570
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:02,180
So for heatstroke here, the cure is we've got to get this person to a hospital.

571
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:06,530
They need to get hydrated and they need to be cooled as rapidly as possible.

572
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:16,110
Get to make sure that people who survive very intense heat stroke, that sometimes they would be incapable of responding.

573
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:22,180
So, yeah, so so there is some evidence that if you have one heat overexposure,

574
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:30,400
you're essentially sensitized and your body is no longer capable of dealing with that same environment as effectively as before.

575
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,090
I think the evidence is like many of these things, somewhat inconclusive.

576
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:43,240
But there are certainly anecdotes of workers who have had one sort of overexposure and been unable to tolerate that climate afterwards.

577
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:50,080
It's interesting. I don't think there's the same analog for cold, even though they're both sort of different ends of the spectrum.

578
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:57,580
Great question. So it turns out we've got lots of different ways to measure the environment around us.

579
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:02,680
Probably all of you are familiar, though you may not know the term with a dry bulb thermometer.

580
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:08,830
This is the same kind of thermometer you stick in your mouth to take your temperature. We use these just to measure the air temperature.

581
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:13,550
And because it's an exposed thermometer, it will also incorporate radiant heat.

582
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:17,800
So we don't want to have a dry bulb thermometer sitting out in the sun because it's going

583
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:22,390
to pick up that radiant heat and that's going to give us an accurate body temperature.

584
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:27,550
Now, we have this marvelous phenomenon of sweating that is very effective at evaporative cooling.

585
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:31,180
We want to be able to measure the environment in a way that simulates sweating.

586
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:36,310
And so we use what's called a natural wet bulb thermometer. So this is that dry bulb thermometer.

587
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:40,180
But we put essentially a wick around it and it's a weighted wick.

588
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:46,270
So as that wick heats up, the water will evaporate and we can simulate the effects of sweating there.

589
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:50,770
So this is a way that we can measure temperature and account for humidity.

590
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:55,720
Very important on a day like this where I think the humidity is about 90 percent outside.

591
00:58:55,720 --> 00:59:03,260
Again, we know that air moving across our body is a source of convective heat exchange and also drives evaporation.

592
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:10,360
So we want to consider air speed and we do want to account for radiant heat so that we can take something called a globe temperature,

593
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:14,590
which is basically that dry bulb thermometer shoved inside a toilet float.

594
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:15,890
This is how this got started.

595
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:24,100
So that black thing on top of the red instrument there is this black bulb that's designed just to soak up all the radiant heat and get a good,

596
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:30,970
accurate measurement there. And then we can combine all of these things into what we call a wet bulb globe temperature.

597
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:33,850
So this measures air temperature, humidity,

598
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:43,360
airspeed and radiant heating and is essentially our best sort of proxy for what a human would experience under certain conditions.

599
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,610
So that's if we want to make sort of environmental measurements,

600
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:51,250
we can also bypass that altogether and say, I want to get a measurement on you personally.

601
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:59,800
And so there are little devices, pills basically that you can swallow that will move through your digestive tract and through telemetry.

602
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:06,670
We can basically communicate with them and figure out what is your internal core temperature, regardless of what's going on outside.

603
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:11,170
So we've got sort of ambient monitoring or we can do very intimate personal monitoring.

604
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:18,970
And of course, you know, that pill ends up in your poop and those are single. So put that out there as well for obvious reasons.

605
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:22,180
So believe it or not, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,

606
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:28,090
which absolutely recognizes that he kills people every year, has no standard on heat exposure.

607
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:32,170
They do have something called the general duty clause, which means if an inspector goes out and says,

608
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:36,850
my God, it's super hot, these people have no shade and no water, they could die.

609
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:42,730
They can actually cite an employer based on that. But there's no heat stress specific standard.

610
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:49,480
On the other hand, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist, or HGH, actually has what's called a threshold limit value.

611
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:55,990
And full disclosure, I actually chair the committee that develops these threshold limit values.

612
01:00:55,990 --> 01:01:00,670
So there's a limit that basically takes into account how hard are you working?

613
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:05,800
So you've probably heard that a typical human just at rest puts out about as much

614
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:11,290
wattage in terms of energy as an incandescent light bulb of about 100 watts.

615
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:18,430
So we can rate your metabolic rate. We can say it's 100 watts or it's if you're working really hard, it might be upwards of 500 watts.

616
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:23,860
So we can look at how how much energy you're or how much heat you're generating.

617
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:28,450
And we can consider Watts, the environment around you that went Golden Globe thermometer temperature.

618
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:35,650
And the HTLV basically is this curve that says if you're not working very hard, you can be exposed to pretty high temperatures.

619
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:42,820
And the harder you work, the higher this metabolic rate goes, the lower the temperature you can be safely exposed to.

620
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:48,250
So this is, again, very different than OSHA in that the TV is based on some measurements.

621
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:53,200
We can actually go into a workplace and make and say this worker is overexposed and.

622
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:58,780
Potentially at risk. That's on the occupational side, we can also think about the public side.

623
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:01,660
So probably all of you have heard about the heat index.

624
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:09,400
This is the National Weather Service as a way of communicating a combination of the air temperature as well as the relative humidity.

625
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:13,720
And so, as many of you may have experienced in recent weeks, you know,

626
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:18,790
if the relative humidity is quite high, the temperature can feel warmer than it is.

627
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:25,750
And so you'll see if the relative humidity is low, the sort of feels like temperature is pretty close to the actual temperature.

628
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:31,600
But we can start getting over here into the red zone where the temperature is high and the relative humidity is quite high.

629
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:37,210
And so we can have this heat index of 120, 130, a hundred and fifty degrees.

630
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:40,090
I think it's just about the record that's been achieved.

631
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:47,770
And so as we have changing climate, more and more areas are shifting into some of these uncomfortable zones for parts of their summer.

632
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:54,400
And there's some cities I'm thinking there's there's one in Iran and one in India that have started to experience heat indices where it's like,

633
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:00,520
you know, this is a struggle for people to even survive in this climate that previously has been livable.

634
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:04,000
So, again, this is kind of a communication index where the government can say, hey,

635
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,040
it is really hot out today if you're sensitive or if you have cardiovascular issues.

636
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:15,860
This is probably not a great day to go on a marathon because you might die of heat overexposure.

637
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:23,120
All right, moving into cold stress now and then we'll talk about vibration and noise and then I'll let you all go again,

638
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:28,940
the humor out there pretty weak, but I will say I love this cartoon. This is classic dad humor.

639
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:33,950
So I'll give you a moment to digest that again.

640
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:42,110
I have a small life. So so if we think about places where people might be exposed to cold stress at work, for instance, there's lots of them.

641
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:47,570
So any job that involves outdoor work, oil and gas exploration, logging, forestry,

642
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:52,910
fishing, research potentially in the Arctic, but also we don't have to go outside.

643
01:03:52,910 --> 01:04:00,530
So some of you may have worked in food service where you had a walk in freezer at labs, of course, often have Walk-In freezers.

644
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:07,760
And in one very unique job where you can go from heat stroke to hypothermia almost immediately is shoveling snow,

645
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,660
which is why I refused to shovel snow. So you imagine being out there.

646
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:19,190
You are working extremely hard, shoveling snow. You're probably stripping off layers because you're so hot, you're working so hard.

647
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:22,970
And the second you stop working, if you're still out in the snowy environment now,

648
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:27,530
the sweat is all freezing on your skin and your core temperature can plummet rapidly.

649
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:31,880
So that's a fairly unique exposure.

650
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:37,590
So, you know, heat stroke, heat exhaustion, these are things that we're worried about, for thermal stress, for cold stress.

651
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:41,690
We're worried more about hypothermia and potentially frostbite.

652
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:46,940
I will say for both of these types of thermal stress, it's really your core temperature that we're most interested in.

653
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:51,530
So, you know, there's there's rectal temperature, which is our gold standard.

654
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:54,170
But of course, nobody wants to get their rectal temperature taken.

655
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:59,930
So we have an equation that lets us convert to oral temperature and we want to keep that right around

656
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:07,490
the body's normal range of of approximately ninety eight point six for an oral temperature Fahrenheit.

657
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:12,650
So if your core temperature drops below that, you do start to have health impacts.

658
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:18,920
You know, you'll start to shiver. Of course, that's the body's main response to cold stress, but you can only shiver so hard.

659
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,310
Shivering is not nearly as effective as sweating, for example.

660
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:27,320
And as your core temperature continues to drop, you can start to have central nervous system interference.

661
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:31,550
You can start to have cardiovascular effects. Your heart can actually stop.

662
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:37,370
But you'll notice, you know, there's some pretty scary looking effects down here in sort of the core temperature of 80 range,

663
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:43,820
but the lowest artificially cooled patient. You know, we got down to forty eight degrees as a core temperature.

664
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:50,780
So it's interesting for for workers, we want to keep their core temperature high, but for some medical procedures, open, heart surgeries,

665
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:58,820
things like that, we actually want to cool the person as much as possible to slow down their system as much as possible so we can operate more safely.

666
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:03,560
So we do intentionally lower people's core temperatures way below what's necessary for hypothermia.

667
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:10,280
But again, under very tightly controlled conditions. You know, we talked about the heat stress or the heat index.

668
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:13,700
We also have the wind chill index, same kind of thing.

669
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:20,900
But in this case, instead of humidity and heat, we're talking about wind speed and temperature, where the faster the wind is blowing,

670
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:25,130
the colder the perceived temperature and the shorter the amount of time before you might get

671
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:31,340
frostbite on exposed skin will revisit this come January and February here in Ann Arbor.

672
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:37,370
You know, my quick preview of winter is unfortunately coming. So just two more topics to cover here.

673
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:41,660
And I know this is a very quick stroll through the park of physical hazards.

674
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:46,730
I apologize. Human vibration is another type of physical hazard we have.

675
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:54,860
We can either have exposure to our hands and arms or we can actually have our whole body vibrating for both of these types of exposure.

676
01:06:54,860 --> 01:07:01,880
We are interested in measuring acceleration. So basically change in velocity over time.

677
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:05,610
So we talk about vibration in terms of units of meters per second squared.

678
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:11,300
The same thing as we talk about the gravitational constant. This is not a rare exposure.

679
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:20,090
So something around one and a half million workers in the U.S. have hand arm exposure and about seven million have exposure to a whole body vibration.

680
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:26,570
We have no idea what sort of the community exposures are. Certainly, people can have vibrating power tools.

681
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:32,870
They can sit on their tractors as they're working at home and get whole body vibration.

682
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:38,150
So thinking about where people might actually encounter this either occupationally or in the community,

683
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:44,270
I will say you guys have probably seen these these stupid videos on YouTube or maybe some of these products.

684
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:50,300
So back in the 1950s and 60s, there was this whole fad that, hey, we're going to shake your fadeaway.

685
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:56,030
We're going to cause this whole body vibration. We're going to strap you to this vibrating belt and it's just going to melt the fat right off.

686
01:07:56,030 --> 01:08:05,030
You didn't work then, but you can pay hundreds to more than a thousand dollars to buy the equivalent twenty twenty one device,

687
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:09,080
which still doesn't work, by the way, but it's more expensive and fancier looking.

688
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:14,390
So the idea here is, gosh, if your body's being shaken, you're going to have your core muscles like.

689
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:20,600
Working really hard to keep you stable, and that's going to melt the fat off again, the science there is is non-existent.

690
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,750
What we do know in the workplace, there's tons of people who have exposures.

691
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:33,830
So your whole body vibration, anyone who drives a vehicle, whether it's a land vehicle or on water or in the air, they all have whole body vibration.

692
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:38,930
Construction workers have lots of hand arm vibration.

693
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:45,950
And, you know, anyone who's working with a vibrating or pneumatic power tool is going to have some potential for Hamdard vibration.

694
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:54,290
So lots of folks out there for vibration. One of the things we're most concerned about is the fact that our our body and all

695
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:58,550
the components of our body have a natural frequency that they want to vibrate at.

696
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:02,510
You guys have probably all experienced this this concept of resonance.

697
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:06,890
If you've been singing in the shower and you've hit one note or you're like, damn, that sounds good.

698
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:11,450
You've hit the resonant frequency of your shower. So the same thing happens in your body when it's vibrating.

699
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:17,600
If you hit the frequency that your body naturally wants to vibrate at, you're going to get an even stronger response.

700
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:24,530
And it's those frequencies that we're most concerned about controlling in the workplace because we don't want to have this resonant exposure.

701
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:30,650
And so depending on the type of the structure of your body, you might have a relatively high, resonant frequency.

702
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:37,850
So your eyeballs will naturally vibrate somewhere between 20 and 90 times per second or 20 to 90 hertz.

703
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:44,180
Your abdomen is a much lower frequency of between four to eight hertz is its natural, resonant frequency.

704
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:52,520
So, again, depending on the part of the body, we're going to sort of restrict exposures to avoid those resonant frequencies.

705
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:57,110
So to actually measure vibration, you know, believe it or not, all of you have a smartphone.

706
01:09:57,110 --> 01:10:02,570
That smartphone has accelerometers in there that measure movement and acceleration.

707
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:06,920
As a result, we can use different sensors in the workplace.

708
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:12,560
So we have little gizmos that we can slip between people's fingers that sit between them and their tool.

709
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:19,760
And they can measure vibration in three orthogonal axes or three neutrally perpendicular axes.

710
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,860
We can do the same thing for whole body vibration.

711
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:29,630
So I've used this device, which is a whole body accelerometer, but workers, for obvious reasons, call it a whoopee cushion.

712
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:35,450
If if that's even a thing that you could recognize, I'm not even sure what gags are out there today.

713
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:41,990
This is something you could sit on or lie on. And again, it's going to measure the vibration that your whole body is being exposed to.

714
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:43,880
Why are we worried about vibration?

715
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:50,660
Well, it turns out for hand arm vibration you can get and I don't know what NIH grant came up with this hand arm vibration syndrome.

716
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:57,740
I love a very clear name initially after vibration. This is characterized by tingling or numbness in your fingertips.

717
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:01,250
With continuing exposure, you start to get an impairment of blood flow.

718
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:05,090
You can get blanching where your fingertips will turn white.

719
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:09,320
This will start to occur more commonly and affect more of your fingers.

720
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:15,200
As your exposure continues. It can start to spread to other fingers eventually.

721
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:21,110
If your exposure continues, you can get a loss of coordination or dexterity and a reduction in strength.

722
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:29,510
And we don't really see this anymore. But when power tools first became super common in the 1950s and 1960s, we would actually see, for example,

723
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:35,630
loggers who would be running these incredibly highly vibrating chain saws who would start

724
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:41,060
to get gangrene and physical degradation at their fingertips just from too much vibration.

725
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:43,550
So this thankfully, we really don't see any more of this.

726
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:50,240
We see all the time still, because there are lots of vibrating tools out there for whole body vibration.

727
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,310
The health effects are a little less clear.

728
01:11:52,310 --> 01:12:00,320
We know there can absolutely be impacts on your spine, which is getting compressed and expanded constantly with that whole body vibration.

729
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:05,360
So whole body vibration is strongly linked to low back pain, but so is age.

730
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:12,020
Am I right? Yeah, it turns out if you're exposed to a whole body vibration constantly,

731
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:15,770
you can actually get a reduction in your height as your spinal this compact.

732
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:20,210
But then once your exposure ceases, you'll go back to your original height.

733
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:22,850
If any of you have ever driven on a really bumpy road,

734
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:31,010
you can actually hit the the frequency where your eyes will be resonant and it becomes very difficult to focus when you're driving super dangerous.

735
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:39,260
And if anybody's ever been on a boat and felt a little queasy, that's motion sickness, which is from very, very low frequency vibrations.

736
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:42,620
Less than once per second is that boat goes up and down.

737
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:49,580
And there's also potentially a linkage between a whole body vibration and cardiovascular disease.

738
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:57,440
OK, so rounding this out while I'll finish up with noise, which is my topic du jour, actually, it's the topic of my entire career.

739
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:02,150
It's something that people seek out and the most bizarre ways on beaches in the Caribbean and they,

740
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:07,400
you know, fit their their golf cart with some some crazy speaker setups.

741
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:14,120
It's also something we've been dealing with in this country for 50 years with very little effect, unfortunately.

742
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:22,340
So. Noise, unlike some of the other physical hazards we've talked about, is measured on a non-linear or a logarithmic scale.

743
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:28,030
So one thing I'll communicate to you here is a pretty small change in the decibel level.

744
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:33,730
That's the unit we use here actually represents a huge change in the underlying exposure that you have.

745
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:37,510
So you might think 80, 90, 100 decibels, that all sounds about the same.

746
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:45,430
No, in fact, 100 decibels is 100 times more than 80 decibels in terms of exposure.

747
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:50,120
This is an exposure that we actually measure in a way that mimics the human ear.

748
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:59,770
So you'll see a weighted decibels or deba that's kind of the unit we use and that's matching the human ears sensitivity at different frequencies.

749
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:01,360
There are many folks, including myself,

750
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:08,080
who think this might be actually the most common occupational hazard that people encounter in the U.S. and around the world.

751
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:15,820
We also know that communities around the world tend to have lots of noise sources as well, particularly from transportation.

752
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:22,640
So let me ask you quickly, if you think about the noise, where you live, what comes to mind in terms of cash, that could be louder.

753
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:26,440
Man, that's super annoying. Yeah, traffic.

754
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,890
Absolutely. What else are lawnmowers? Yes, very good.

755
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:36,180
I would expand that to all all home lawn care products, especially leaf blowers.

756
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:41,180
My personal peeve, what else is out there that comes to mind for noise?

757
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:49,700
Yeah, this is construction. Sure, construction, very unpredictable, of course, it comes with other impacts on your life, too.

758
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:56,360
That's a great example. Any any other stuff of your warehouse, the beeping of the forklifts and stuff?

759
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,150
Absolutely. So so these are all quite standard.

760
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:05,690
I think just in the interest of time, I'll skip the pull here and jump to the conclusions which you've all already touched on already.

761
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:13,940
So when communities get surveyed about what annoys them, you know, crime shows up, other other things show up.

762
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:19,790
But noise is almost always at the top of the list. And it's almost always construction, which we heard mentioned traffic,

763
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:25,130
which we heard mentioned road traffic specifically, but also air traffic and then train traffic.

764
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:30,620
So it tends to be mostly transportation noise that it gets on people's nerves.

765
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:45,920
You see if this recording will play in here, not if I do it that way.

766
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:56,930
Any idea what that might be? Sorry, I've found myself up here was that free trade is a good guess,

767
01:15:56,930 --> 01:16:02,870
others have to go back to the floor, could be like an orbital waxer or something like that.

768
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:08,480
Absolutely. Other ideas and machine and machinery to plant.

769
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,290
So those are all great guesses. In fact, that's the sound of a wind turbine close up.

770
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:19,490
So that's an exposure that's associated with green energy. It's being installed all over the place for good reasons.

771
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:24,680
But it's also an exposure that we just haven't had historically. That's the frequencies we can hear.

772
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:29,930
But it turns out wind turbines put out most of their energy in a so-called infrasound region,

773
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:34,130
which is too low for us to hear, but could still have some health impacts.

774
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:40,880
So this is basically a new noise exposure that we haven't had historically that we're trying to kind of unpack the health effects of.

775
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,500
So speaking of health effects here,

776
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:49,190
there are many probably everybody knows that too much noise could lead to damage to your hearing or noise induced hearing loss.

777
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:54,080
But it turns out there's actually a very compelling now body of evidence linking noise to high blood

778
01:16:54,080 --> 01:17:01,880
pressure to ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction or heart attack to stroke as well.

779
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:07,190
These are major causes of morbidity in the U.S. and indeed around the world.

780
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:12,350
Again, probably a no brainer. That too much noise while you're trying to sleep leads to sleep disturbance.

781
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:23,450
It's also linked with degraded performance, cognitive impairment, annoyance, certainly, and some psychological and perhaps even psychiatric impacts.

782
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:26,540
Now, the way noise does this is still a little unclear.

783
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:33,590
We're pretty sure that in terms of cardiovascular disease, the impacts of noise at night are what really matter.

784
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:41,390
So as you try to sleep at night, if there's noise in the background or especially if there's sort of transients or variable noise going on,

785
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:47,540
you may not wake up, but your body can experience hundreds of so-called micro arousals per hour.

786
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:54,680
And those can activate your adrenal system and cause you to have essentially, let's just say,

787
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:59,900
increased risk of things like heart attacks because your body's not getting rest like it needs.

788
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:06,320
Now, most workers aren't sleeping on the job, but we also see increased risk of hypertension in workers.

789
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:10,490
And so the thought there is noise is actually just a general stressor on your system.

790
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:16,280
If you're in high noise, even if you don't recognize it, you're also getting this adrenal fight or flight response.

791
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:22,980
And if that occurs chronically, again, that can lead to things like increased risk of heart attack.

792
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:27,870
I'll just throw out a little bit from some work that we did in New York City,

793
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:33,390
so as an industrial hygienist, I typically think of the workplace where most people get noise.

794
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:43,170
But in fact, when we surveyed about 4500 people, we found that they were spending about six percent of their time in a year listening to music,

795
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:47,430
but they got about half their dose on average from listening to music.

796
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:53,490
So we've shifted away from, gosh, it's the workplace is the only thing we need to worry about in terms of noise.

797
01:18:53,490 --> 01:19:01,440
Now, all of us have MP three players and earbuds, and we can actually get a whopping exposure to sound over the course of a day.

798
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:07,320
And so, in fact, for about 60 percent of these people that lived in music, it wasn't their job.

799
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:15,080
It wasn't the fact that they went to concerts or rode motorcycles. It was their music that was putting them at risk of hearing loss.

800
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:21,030
And just because we're out of time here, I'm going to mention this is just one of my research for one second.

801
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:30,690
So there's so much uncertainty around how much noise exposure all of us get in our daily lives at work, at home, you know, trying to sleep at night.

802
01:19:30,690 --> 01:19:34,020
So we've launched the appeal hearing study, which we're now two years into,

803
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:43,080
to basically allow people who have iPhones and or Apple watches to share data with us about how often they listen to music,

804
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:46,840
how loud they listen, and how loud and how often they're out in the environment.

805
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:52,530
So we've got now, you know, one hundred plus thousand people participating in this study.

806
01:19:52,530 --> 01:19:58,560
They're also testing their hearing, using their iPhone in a couple of different ways and completing surveys.

807
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:04,980
So we're really getting for the first time a national sense of where are people's noise exposures coming from,

808
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:08,880
how high those are they high enough to cause harm and how is that linked?

809
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,660
So how are their exposures potentially linked to changes in their hearing?

810
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:16,770
And we're also monitoring things like heart rate and other cardiovascular impacts.

811
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:21,420
So this is super exciting for me. We're out of time. I will let you all go.

812
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:25,350
Thank you so much for for bearing with me while we went through physical hazards here.

813
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:30,840
A couple of additional resources, if you're interested. I can hang around for a minute if anyone has any questions otherwise.

814
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:39,948
Thank you all so much and have a great rest of the week. Thanks.
