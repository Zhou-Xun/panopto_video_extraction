00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:35,400
Hi. This Panopto recording will guide you through finding or locating health statistics through Michigan, the Department of Health and Human Services.

2
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:48,780
The companion slides that go with this Panopto recording can be found on canvas under course resources and their titled Health Statistics Slides.

3
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,010
I'm not going to show the slides in this Panopto recording.

4
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:04,770
What I'm showing is the actual steps that are nicely detailed on the slides so you can follow using the slides.

5
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:10,650
But I wanted to show you what it looks like when you're actually on the respective websites.

6
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:23,820
So in the first slide, it's just a screenshot of some of the instructions for the Health Assessment section of your community assessment report.

7
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:31,770
So it's just part of the guidelines and the first two health statistics that you're going to be locating.

8
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:42,379
His mortality. The ten leading causes of death among adults in Michigan as well as morbidity.

9
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,600
And morbidity is just the rate of chronic disease.

10
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:55,010
So I'm going to walk you through how to locate these. The site is not.

11
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,870
Self-explanatory. So it's important to sort of follow these steps.

12
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,489
I encourage you to explore the various websites,

13
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:11,600
but to get you to the data that you actually need for your report, there's some very specific steps to follow.

14
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,510
In the slides, outline the steps. But I'm also going to show you here in this recording.

15
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:26,120
So again, the first steps are identifying or locating mortality data as well as morbidity.

16
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,270
The next slide has a link to the website.

17
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,650
The Michigan Health and Human Services Reports and Statistics website.

18
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:47,030
And so if you copy that link at the bottom of that slide, it'll get you to the appropriate Web site.

19
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,360
And you're what? The website should look just like this.

20
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,299
And then you're going to scroll down. There's a number of really interesting topics.

21
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,860
And again, I encourage you to check out some of these links.

22
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:11,890
But for the mortality data, you're going to scroll all the way down to vital statistics, which is here on the left, and you're going to select it.

23
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:26,920
And on the Vital Statistics page, you'll scroll down until you see mortality on the far left and you'll select that link.

24
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,999
And now we're in the mortality stats page here.

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,319
Are you going to highlight community? You're not going to click it, select it, you're just going to highlight it.

26
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,610
And then right below it is county districts and city statistics.

27
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,960
You are going to select that.

28
00:03:51,930 --> 00:04:00,540
And then the data that you want to access is the second set of data, the leading causes of death, race, and other selected causes.

29
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:12,850
So you're going to select this. And on this page are some definitions about some of the indicators.

30
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,570
Definitions about the rates and ratios and so forth.

31
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:23,410
So this is a nice page to acquaint yourself with some of the rates that are available.

32
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:33,210
If you scroll all the way bottom down to the bottom of the page, you're going to select view mortality tables now.

33
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:52,380
And what you'll see here is a table of the number of deaths by age, race and sex.

34
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,360
For the state of Michigan. You're actually not going to use this data.

35
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:04,230
What you're going to do is at the top notice that you have an option to select city, local, health, district or county.

36
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,489
Most of you, if not all of you, have a city that's your community of interest.

37
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:18,300
And so you'll select city. And there's a dropdown box.

38
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,970
And so you just scroll down. I'm going to select Ann Arbor, so I just select that.

39
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,520
And then the next step is we don't have the table yet that we want.

40
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:38,700
The next step, after you select your city, is over on the left under leading causes.

41
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:46,889
So you'll see here that we have a number. We have selected mortality tables and mortality tables with averaging.

42
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:52,050
And so for the under leading causes, you want to select numbers rates and use.

43
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,940
When you select that, you get a new table.

44
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:04,500
And this is a table for Ann Arbor, but it also includes Michigan and the United States.

45
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:13,080
So it actually gives you three columns of comparison are three levels city, state and national data.

46
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:22,370
So on the far left here, we have the ten leading causes of death in descending order.

47
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,750
So the most prevalent is heart disease, then cancer.

48
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,010
And again, these are all causes of death mortality.

49
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,440
And I just want to point out that the data used to.

50
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:44,700
Generate these statistics is gathered from death certificates in the state of Michigan.

51
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:53,540
The first three columns are just absolute numbers, and that's really not that useful.

52
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:03,780
It's difficult to compare. Instead, you're going to use the rates on the far right columns.

53
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,940
So we have rates for Ann Arbor, Michigan, and again, national.

54
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,780
And these are rates per 100,000.

55
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:20,280
Population. So this is a very nice table where you can compare.

56
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,840
You can look at the leading cause of deaths in Ann Arbor.

57
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,440
Heart disease and cancer are the two leading causes.

58
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:37,170
Likewise, heart disease and cancer are leading causes in Michigan and the nation.

59
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:48,060
Also, you can note that Ann Arbor has lower rates of these two diseases relative to the state of Michigan and.

60
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:58,390
Well, in this case, it's like it's less than in the night nationally, and cancer rates are also less than nationally.

61
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,130
So here you just want to pick out some noteworthy information.

62
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:13,420
Certainly, it's noteworthy that heart disease, cancer are two chronic diseases that are the first to have the highest.

63
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:23,750
That causes of death among adults in the United States.

64
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,980
We now have COVID 19 as a category, and that's the third leading cause of death.

65
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:42,170
Some of you have an interest in some other chronic diseases, and so you can take a look at those rates in Ann Arbor relative to state of Michigan.

66
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,070
The nice thing about these tables is that they're complete.

67
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:54,200
So you can just take a screenshot of this table and you can insert it in your report.

68
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:04,040
I do recommend creating your own title. And obviously you'll need to put a source citation, but you don't have to create a table from scratch.

69
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,290
You can just do a screenshot of this table.

70
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:22,860
One other thing that I want to point out is that for cities that are very small, sometimes you will not have mortality data by city.

71
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:31,730
There just will not be enough information. And if your city if you can't find your city in the drop down box, then you need to use county data.

72
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:44,930
And so you just indicate in your report there was insufficient information to present mortality data by city, and instead I'm presenting county data.

73
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:53,010
You also have in your instructions for your assignment to present the data by.

74
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,580
Gender and race, ethnicity if possible.

75
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:11,970
So the way to get that data is to over here on the left, instead of selecting numbers rates in the US, you select age adjusted rates.

76
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,410
So I'm going to select here and now we have a table that has.

77
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:28,470
The ten leading causes of death by gender and by two categories of race.

78
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:40,780
White and black. You'll note that there's missing data, that they just don't have enough data or they don't collect data.

79
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:57,040
But for other ethnicities and there's insufficient data to populate this table, you can still make some, you know, do interpretation.

80
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,370
So, for example, in Ann Arbor.

81
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:13,330
If we look at males and heart disease, we can see that the rate of mortality from heart disease is higher in males versus females.

82
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:26,190
We can also see that. When we look at gender combined in by race ethnicity,

83
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:33,450
we can see that death or mortality from heart disease is lower in individuals

84
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:40,140
who identify as white when compared to individuals who identify as black.

85
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,110
And so there's a few other comparisons you can make here.

86
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,510
I did want to point out that if the data is if you have a lot of missing data.

87
00:11:53,660 --> 00:12:02,120
You can choose to not look at it by city and instead look at it by county and you'll probably get more data.

88
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:07,680
So if I select county. You have a dropdown box here.

89
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:15,380
You just have to select the arrow. And Ann Arbor is in Washtenaw County, so I'm going to scroll down and select Washtenaw.

90
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,850
So again, this is mortality data by gender and race.

91
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:32,169
You can see that there is a bit more data. So it's up to you what you want to present for the purposes of this paper.

92
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,920
You can either present it by city or you can present it by county.

93
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,720
In practice, they would present both to be more complete.

94
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:52,420
But I don't expect you to do that. You guys don't have enough time to add multiple tables, so either city or county is fine.

95
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:04,660
Okay. So that's it for mortality data. So I'm going to go back.

96
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:17,499
To the original landing page, if I can. Okay.

97
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,650
So this was the very first page that I landed on.

98
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:28,300
And now we're going to be looking at morbidity data. So again, rates of chronic disease.

99
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,090
So here on the first page, instead of looking for vital statistics, you're going to be.

100
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,200
You want this link here, community health information.

101
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:49,700
So I'm going to select that. And then you're going to scroll down.

102
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,030
And on the far left, we have a number of.

103
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,780
Options. And I'm going to select county profiles here.

104
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,410
And you'll see that we have a page here that looks very similar to the mortality

105
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:16,470
page where we had definitions of various rates and ratios and so forth.

106
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,560
So again, you just scroll down all the way to the bottom and you've got a select view community profiles now.

107
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,450
And so there is some data here, but this is not the data that we're looking for.

108
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:42,210
This is for the state of Michigan. So for morbidity data there, you will not find city data, you have to use county.

109
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,310
So I'm going to select county. And you have this dropdown box here.

110
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:53,700
And Ann Arbor is in Washtenaw, so I'm going to select Washtenaw.

111
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:02,100
And then over here on the left, you need to select chronic disease.

112
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,659
And when you do, you get a large table on the left.

113
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:16,380
To the table is mortality from a number of chronic diseases.

114
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:22,090
You're going to ignore that and instead you're going to use the data on the right side of the table.

115
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:29,600
And at the top are cancer rates that we have very specific.

116
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:41,820
It's broken down by types of cancer. For students who are interested in cancer, they might include a table that has all the different types of cancer.

117
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:48,560
And over here on the right are the age adjusted rates of cancer in Washtenaw County.

118
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,920
If your paper is not specific to cancer, most students just select all cancer.

119
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:03,300
And because it's only one chronic disease, this is something you could just even put in the text.

120
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:18,730
In your health statistics section. The next set of data is cardiovascular related.

121
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,470
So we have, you know, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and so forth.

122
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:34,100
You'll note that we have crude rates. Of this chronic disease.

123
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:41,630
We also have age adjusted, but we don't have age adjusted data for all of the indicators.

124
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,940
If you scroll down, there's more chronic disease indicators.

125
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,150
We have arthritis, asthma, diabetes and so forth.

126
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,920
We have crude rates for all of these diseases, but we don't.

127
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:03,770
We're missing some of the age adjusted rates. So in practice, you would include both crude and age adjusted.

128
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:11,180
But for the purposes of your paper, most students just present the crude rate since it's complete.

129
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:24,050
You will be learning if you have not already. The difference between age adjusted and crude rates age adjusted just means that it takes into account.

130
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:30,840
The fact that as we age, the rate of chronic disease increases.

131
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:40,980
All right. So as we age, we increase the risk of our getting chronic of chronic disease simply because we're accumulating risk.

132
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:47,040
So as populations age, the rate of chronic disease increases.

133
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,700
Age adjusted rates just takes into account.

134
00:17:52,350 --> 00:18:07,590
That phenomena. So again, the data that you'll be interested in is you can certainly include the cancer because that is an age adjusted rate.

135
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,520
You can just include that in the text.

136
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,470
But the cardiovascular as well as these other chronic diseases students just put them in a simple table and present the crude rate.

137
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,450
And you can present it by county and then by state.

138
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:32,290
And in the slides, there's an example of a table with chronic disease rates.

139
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:37,710
Presented. It was the crude rate presented by county and state.

140
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:44,740
One thing that I want to point out and I forgot to mention with the mortality data, which also is rates.

141
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,860
You want to let the reader know what these rates represent.

142
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,770
Oh, what they're out of. So this table, I don't believe says.

143
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:11,780
No. But the mortality data informed the reader that the rates were out of a population of 100,000.

144
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,620
These rates are also out of 100,000.

145
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:26,620
And you'll note that in the slide, there's an example of a table that has the crude, that has the chronic disease for the crude rates.

146
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:35,890
And the student in the title of that table indicated that the rates are per 100,000 population.

147
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:41,680
Some rates are per 1000, but these happen to be out of 100,000.

148
00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:06,250
So you want to be sure to let the reader know either in the title of the table or in the text, what those rates are out of 100,000, 1000 and so forth.

149
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:12,400
Okay. That's all I have to show you in terms of morbidity.

150
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:26,860
So I'm going to go back. There's another source for health statistics that I want to show you.

151
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:36,210
You can. Here we go.

152
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:48,960
I think I'm back at the main landing page. Yes. So I haven't had a chance to talk to you about the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey.

153
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:53,520
This is a survey that's conducted across the country.

154
00:20:54,030 --> 00:21:05,819
All 50 states and U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico and Guam, collect data for the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance survey.

155
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,200
And it's exactly as it sounds. It's about health behaviors.

156
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:17,820
It's about health conditions. So it collects data on some of the more common chronic diseases.

157
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,730
Everything, you know, for example, with cardiovascular, it collects information about blood pressure.

158
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,100
Have you ever been told by a health professional that you have high blood pressure?

159
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:42,480
It collects information about cholesterol. And it also collects information about health risk behaviors as well as health care access and so forth.

160
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:51,120
So this survey is also a great resource for assessment data.

161
00:21:52,760 --> 00:22:02,740
And. This data is collected by health departments in every state, including Michigan,

162
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:09,580
and in some cases counties will administer the survey and collected at the county level.

163
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:20,700
So I want to show you where you can access this data, because you some of you may be interested in using a few of the indicators in your report.

164
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:28,379
So I'm on the main landing page, the same link that was used for mortality, morbidity.

165
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:37,320
And you're going to scroll down. And you're going to select the Michigan Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

166
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,620
And then you'll scroll down. There's some. You can.

167
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,280
There's some nice resources here.

168
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:06,620
The actual questionnaires for various years are here so that you can see what kind of questions are asked.

169
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,850
There's annual reports of descriptive data.

170
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:21,110
There's data that's by race, ethnicity. And here's the regional and local health department tables.

171
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:31,430
So if there is city or county data in addition to state data, this would it would be in this particular link.

172
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:43,410
So I'm going to select it. And then you need to select the year and I'm going to select the most recent.

173
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:56,360
So that you can see it's not collected every year. And I'm sure COVID has caused disruption of the normal pattern of collecting it.

174
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,670
I would assume that we'll be seeing some more up to date data in the next year or two.

175
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:11,999
And this will generate a PDF document. And I just scrolled fast that you can see here.

176
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:22,830
These are the health indicators and the data from various regions in the state of Michigan, including some counties and cities.

177
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:30,659
So I'm going to scroll down. I recommend just looking through the table of contents because all of the different health

178
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:36,180
indicators that have been assessed and provide data are listed in this table of contents.

179
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:46,260
So you can see it ranges from how people classify their health to weight status to whether or not they're cigaret smoking.

180
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:56,420
HIV testing. There's a number of questions related to the heart and so forth.

181
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:03,740
So again, it's important to. Acquaint yourself to the data that's available.

182
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:12,820
So I'm going to just scroll down to the first. I do want to point out this is self-reported data.

183
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:29,470
Nonetheless, it's been very useful to use as part of our nutrition monitoring in this country to keep track of prevalence of health conditions,

184
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,630
chronic disease as well as health behaviors and so forth.

185
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,309
So the first indicator that comes up is just health status.

186
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:48,470
How did individuals classify their health? And so, again, the the state is broken up into regions.

187
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:54,370
Region one contains Washtenaw County. So we can see here it also contains the city of Detroit.

188
00:25:54,370 --> 00:26:10,960
So this is an example of having city data so we can see for Washtenaw, 12.6% of Washtenaw adults indicated that they have fair or poor health.

189
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:18,230
Okay. And you can compare that to Michigan overall at the top here.

190
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:27,190
The overall percentage for the state of Michigan is 17.9, almost 18%.

191
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:38,050
So here you could indicate that. Washtenaw There are fewer adults reporting fair or poor health when you compare to the state percentage.

192
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,460
I'm just going to scroll down and see what the next indicator is.

193
00:26:53,540 --> 00:27:03,470
This is whether or not individuals had poor physical health in the last 14 days, in the past month and so forth.

194
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,360
So you can see that you can find a county level data.

195
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:13,660
And be able to compare it to Michigan data within the same table.

196
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:21,980
So this is a really nice resource. Okay.

197
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:34,010
And I just want to point out, too, that in the slides there is a link to the Youth Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey.

198
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:51,610
So high schoolers are given the survey, I believe, while they're at school and they answer a number of health behavior health questions.

199
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,310
And that's a really great resource for those of you who are have adolescents as your.

200
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:05,170
Target population. And you might find some helpful health data.

201
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,200
In the in the youth one. And again, the slide has a link.

202
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:16,350
It's through the CDC where you can access that data.

203
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:19,649
The data may only be at the state level, but that's fine.

204
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,400
You just inform the reader that the data is only at the state level,

205
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:30,360
but nonetheless it provides some information about the behaviors of a group of youth.

206
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:50,250
Okay. And the last thing that I wanted to show you. Is there is county data.

207
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:55,799
If you're doing if your city is in Washtenaw County,

208
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:06,150
so if you have Ann Arbor or Ypsilanti or some other city in Washtenaw, you can access county level data.

209
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:16,939
So let me show you. There is a slide that. Reviews that provides the link to the Washtenaw County data.

210
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,060
But I'm going to show it to you. I'm going to go through it here.

211
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:31,950
So. If I could spell it.

212
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,510
Okay. So this is the slide that you'll see.

213
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,640
This is the website that you'll see on the slide.

214
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,250
And so there again, there's the link on that slide to get you to this website.

215
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,940
And what you want to select is the hip survey database.

216
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,210
And I will ask you if you're fine with Lee leaving the site.

217
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:15,290
Yes, proceed to site. And then you want to select data and maps.

218
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:26,080
And what you'll note is on the far left, there's a long list of indicators, health indicators,

219
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:33,400
everything from access to health care to food consumption to physical activity.

220
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,130
But there's this diabetes, cardiovascular health.

221
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:44,410
So there's a real and weight status. There's a number of health indicators.

222
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:49,900
That you can use. And also there's some indicators specifically for children.

223
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:58,000
So, again, this is for individuals. Students who have their community is based in Washtenaw County.

224
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:03,940
So what you do is you would select one of these indicators.

225
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,679
So I guess like food consumption and there are four, six,

226
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:16,450
five different indicators that I can select and I'm going to select consume vegetable one or more times per day.

227
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,870
And what it's showing me here is this is adults.

228
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:31,180
The survey was conducted in 2015. That's the most recent.

229
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,340
And that's fine.

230
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:46,930
It may not be 2022, but if it's the most recent, then you present and you just let the reader know that the most recent data was from 2015.

231
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:54,929
And here we have the percentage of those that consumed a vegetable one or more times per day.

232
00:31:54,930 --> 00:32:05,880
And so here we see, 81% said, yes, I consumed a vegetable one or more times per day, and we have almost 19% who said no.

233
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:14,100
Okay. So 19% constituents concerning that means they did not consume a vegetable on a given day.

234
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:21,390
What's nice about this data is that if you scroll down, you can use some filters to stratify.

235
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:25,350
So here I can refine by demographic subgroup.

236
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:37,200
So I can I can stratify by age, race, household income, a number of factors, but I'm going to do it by region.

237
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,480
And so now you'll see that the data has been presented by Citi.

238
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:56,740
So now it's not just county, it's Citi data. And so in Ann Arbor, 85% reported these are adults consuming a vegetable one or more times per day.

239
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,050
Here in Ypsi, only 73% consumed, one or more per day.

240
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:11,180
Okay, so these tables are nice because it actually provides city data.

241
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:18,040
So you can look at the county first and then look at the city and do a comparison.

242
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:28,200
I'm trying to think of this. Anything else here I want to show you, but I think that's it.

243
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:44,530
If you generate a table and all of the data on the table is data that you feels is of interest to your report, then you can just do a screenshot.

244
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,419
Of the table. This has a bit more information.

245
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:56,650
If I'm just working on if my report or my target population is just Ann Arbor, I probably wouldn't do a screenshot of this table.

246
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:03,160
Instead, I would just create a small table where I present Ann Arbor data and Washtenaw County data.

247
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,490
But for some of you, you may create it.

248
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:18,680
You may create a table using other indicators here that you feel is pertinent to your report, and you can just do a screenshot of the table.

249
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,140
Okay. That is all I have.

250
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:31,780
There's a few more slides in the health statistics slide packet.

251
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:36,220
Those of you doing that have children as a population.

252
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,399
If you're interested in lead exposure,

253
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:52,210
there's the link for finding lead exposure concerns or stats when it comes to with respect to overweight and obesity.

254
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:58,390
For adults, you probably will need to use the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey.

255
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:08,470
But for children in your instructions for the Health Statistics section of your assignment guideline,

256
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:14,170
there is a link to find overweight and obesity stats for children.

257
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:26,440
I think that's all I have. Clearly reach out to me or Liz if you have any questions and I'll end this Panopto recording.
