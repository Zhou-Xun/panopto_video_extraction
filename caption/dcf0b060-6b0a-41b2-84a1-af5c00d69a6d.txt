1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,870
Yeah. Hey. Good morning, everybody. Morning.

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,400
I was great. Did you guys have a good Thanksgiving? Yeah.

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:22,530
Okay, so before we get started on your presentations, I just want to kind of give a rundown of what the rest of.

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,730
The semester still look like because we're so close, we're almost there.

5
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,989
So today always takes a little bit longer than I anticipate because I want to leave time for questions.

6
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:40,240
So. What I'm going to do is I'm not going to lecture on drug interactions today.

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:49,060
We won't have time. I'll post here, I'll put a link here for it is a shorter online lecture,

8
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:55,630
but we won't specifically meet for that content, so you will be responsible to view it online.

9
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:05,260
I'll record the lecture because I want to get to the pulmonary content first because you have that six page study due next week.

10
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:13,630
I would really recommend getting it in next week so that we can just move on and all you have left is that take home exam.

11
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:22,209
So hopefully Thursday I think you will be feel pretty well set to do that case study and it's a little bit shorter in my opinion,

12
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,330
just it's a little just more condensed.

13
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,170
So we'll do pulmonary Thursday, we'll do food allergies on Tuesday,

14
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:38,980
and then we will not meet on Thursday so that you can have time just to dedicate to either finishing up that case study.

15
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:44,339
And I'll also post the exam that day. So we do not have to physically be here next week.

16
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,760
Thursday. Yes. What do we have to have to do it? So the exam.

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,860
Let me just make sure. I think our dedicated exam day for this class is Tuesday the 13th.

18
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:11,150
But hold on and make sure that's the right date. So it should be Tuesday the 13th during exam week.

19
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:20,990
So by midnight on the 13th, submit your final exam so you'll have access to it on next week, Thursday the eighth.

20
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,130
I'm not your posted before then because I'd rather you just get the case study done

21
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,740
and then you can download it as of Thursday morning and get it to me by Tuesday.

22
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,129
Okay. So we're not on the canvas. Yes, I'll post it.

23
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,000
I can't remember to you. Oh, yeah. I'll put it all on canvas.

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,420
I'll put the due date so that we're. Thank you. We're all set.

25
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:53,420
So is that it? Does that work for you guys? So we're not going to submit instead of meeting on Thursday?

26
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:01,440
I've just kind of pushed everything. Up a day so that we will just this will be an online lecture to watch at your own time.

27
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,450
It is shorter it's not a full hour 20 minutes.

28
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:10,149
I'll I'll look at I think maybe it's like 40 minutes but I'll I'll check that we'll get

29
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,830
through the pulmonary I Tuesday or Thursday and then we'll wrap things up next week,

30
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,000
Tuesday. Yes.

31
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,160
Yes. So the content today is part of the exam.

32
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,049
So that's why this is really important in terms of M.A. for cancer,

33
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:35,960
because a lot of what we're doing is trying to manage our patients side effects because that often impacts their nutrition.

34
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:41,450
So your lectures will be posted today. It'll obviously be recorded as well.

35
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:48,049
But if a post your slides as well. So we are going to have questions.

36
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:54,800
So come with questions for your fellow students if you if something's not clear or, you know.

37
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,190
Do you have any specific issues you want to bring up about today's.

38
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,830
Yes. You see a format with the other ones. We have the 3 hours.

39
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:12,330
It is not time. So I say you can you can download it Thursday, spend all weekend on it.

40
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,180
Do you want me to do that? Please don't do that. But just, you know, it's not time.

41
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,910
You'll have several days to work on it. Or you could just do it on Tuesday.

42
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:29,610
You. Any other questions here?

43
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,180
Okay. So I have my the groups pulled up on my phone.

44
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,640
Who would like to go first? I have all your presentations down here.

45
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:50,800
I saw your name first. Which group are you guys? Okay, anorexia.

46
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,540
We are doing it.

47
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,680
Guys need to see present or not. Or are you okay? Just.

48
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:09,430
Oh, yeah. That's just like with my stuff.

49
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,110
Is it possible to do that? No, sure. Just relax, okay?

50
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:30,130
I. I know what it's like, but I think that.

51
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:39,490
I don't think I can see your face here.

52
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,510
I think we were all right. We're ready when you are.

53
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,649
Okay? Yeah. Good morning. Our group, we do have cancer.

54
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,070
And just talk to us and we'll talk a little bit about this.

55
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:05,050
So what is cancer? I know you talked about this on a lecture last week, so I'll just briefly run over this just as a review.

56
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:11,260
But cancer is a disease and cells in the body grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body.

57
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:18,970
And so as we talked about, in normal circumstances, cell division occurs to form new cells of the body of them and then replaces the cells that die.

58
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:26,200
And so in cancer, this process can be interrupted and abnormal and damaged cells grow and multiply, which they should not.

59
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,609
And so tumors that develop can be either either malignant or benign.

60
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,620
So malignant tumors can metastasize, so they spread to other tissues in the body.

61
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,950
And then benign tumors do not spread or invade other tissues.

62
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:47,350
And as we talked about in the course of Genesis process, there's an initiation promotion and then progression that leads to the development of cancer.

63
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:54,070
So what is anorexia? I just want to make the differentiation that this is different than anorexia nervosa.

64
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,690
These are used interchangeably often. So it's important to differentiate the two.

65
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:05,230
Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder. And then anorexia is the loss of appetite or the inability to eat.

66
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,980
And it's one of the most common symptoms reported by cancer patients.

67
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:17,020
So while anorexia is not unique to cancer itself, its association with cancer, it's a very complex process that we'll go into a little bit more.

68
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,530
And it's typically characterized by a decreased oral intake.

69
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:30,220
But other factors can cause cancer, including obstruction of the GI tract food aversions, pain, anxiety and depression.

70
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,190
So why does this happen during cancer?

71
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:44,400
So there is a reduction in all intake that occurs during cancer and cancer treatment, but it's not really it's not fully explained why Aki occurs.

72
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,459
So think other reasons anorexia can happen during cancer or tumor and host interactions

73
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,400
and metabolic abnormalities that lead to catabolism over a number of them.

74
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,690
The imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers of the activation is responsible for the devastation.

75
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:07,050
One of the issues that occurs during this side effect of cancer is that it cannot be reversed by eating

76
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,659
as both lean and fat stores are used for energy and as other alterations we propose in the course.

77
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,230
This is different than what we talk about with like malnutrition at the end of the semester.

78
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,430
And I guess one of the they talked about reduction of this activity increase in the sense of the cutaneous reactions.

79
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:32,100
There's variations in metabolic rate that occur in the anorexia and there's neuroinflammation that could impact the hypothalamus control of appetite.

80
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,410
So we talked a lot about this in the pediatric obesity, but there's alterations in that hypothalamus.

81
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:48,860
Hypothalamus control of appetite changes people's perceptions, the visual cues, changes, taste and smell that can occur during cancer and asthma.

82
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,440
So I just put this image. It's kind of words I took from the paper, but it's it's cited in the references,

83
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:02,280
but it just wanted to show that there's really a lot of different things that can lead to anorexia during cancer.

84
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,499
And so that's why it's really complex. And part of this, like when I was reading about it was a little over my head.

85
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:14,520
But there's a lot of different things that impact it, like the things that occur in your stomach to attract chemotherapy.

86
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:22,770
Lots of different medications being released from the tumor, things that happen in your brain and talk about my balance.

87
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,550
So there's just a lot of different interactions that happen during cancer that can be dangerous.

88
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:34,270
You. So anorexia syndrome doesn't occur with all cancers,

89
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:40,960
but it's really one of the most common things seen in cancer as side effects can occur mostly with solid tumors like in lung cancer.

90
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:48,670
That's a lot about GI tract cancers and how that could lead to anorexia as a side effect with neck and head cancer and pancreatic cancer.

91
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:57,280
And then often when patients are really advanced in their cancer treatment, they tend to have anorexia as well.

92
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,540
So there's no single optimal diagnostic laboratory measurement of it.

93
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:13,160
But these for a lot of the different like discussed things for nutrition assessment.

94
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:20,620
So reduced food intake and I found that that measurement came up in one of the research articles.

95
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:32,059
And then just like this lack of hunger, nausea, dysphagia and abnormal motility and then the weight loss, I saw those two different percentages,

96
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,830
but it was just generally agreed upon that a weight loss of 5% or more indicates a

97
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:43,970
need for traditional intervention and then also loss of muscle mass and strength.

98
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:52,860
There are bunch of different ways to measure this. These are some of the different ways which we've talked about these concerns that those are.

99
00:10:53,050 --> 00:11:00,350
But it's not like you have to quantify that different ones are used and then also inflammation

100
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:09,680
measured by and this I think this is the only number that they use this greater than ten kilograms.

101
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,349
Let's see. Okay.

102
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:23,040
So we talked about cancer, anorexia, Alexia Syndrome, also known as carrots as Allison wanted to.

103
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,950
It's a little bit it's a metabolic syndrome associated with underlying illness

104
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,490
and is characterized by muscle loss with or without the loss of fatness.

105
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:37,520
And unlike simple starvation, it can't be fully reversed by conventional nutrition support,

106
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,990
which eventually leads to a progressive functional impairment.

107
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,920
Some of the consequences of this is changes in body composition.

108
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:52,910
Can result in the disproportionate loss of lean muscle mass and weight loss and other consequences.

109
00:11:53,420 --> 00:12:05,600
Malnutrition due to reduced oral intake, the symptoms of cancer and systematic inflammation of the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines.

110
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,830
Their consequence is changes in nutrient metabolism.

111
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:16,069
So nutrient intake and absorption is impacted by this and nutrient utilization and

112
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:23,299
losses are also impacted which could result in some of these impacts like hypoglycemia,

113
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:29,720
hyper try this edema and exaggerated insulin response in response to the glucose.

114
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:42,420
Yeah. So the nutrition diagnosis for cancer related anorexia will vary depending on where the cancer tumor is located.

115
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:48,090
The extent of the cancer and what type of treatment the patient is receiving or just

116
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:53,460
your dietitians can make nutrition diagnoses of patients with cancer related anorexia.

117
00:12:54,570 --> 00:13:00,030
These can include an adequate oral food or beverage intake, inadequate protein,

118
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:05,940
energy intake, unintended weight loss, malnutrition, increased nutrient or energy needs.

119
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:16,169
And some, when I was doing some research, some additional diagnoses specific to cancer types could include someone with stomach or colon cancer.

120
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:26,340
Having altered GI function, someone with oral pharyngeal esophageal cancer could be diagnosed, swallowing or biting or chewing difficulty.

121
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:35,460
And some sample diagnoses include unintended weight loss related to inadequate intake, as evidenced by a 5% weight loss at one month.

122
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,959
Inadequate protein energy intake related to side effects of chemotherapy as evidenced by a daily intake,

123
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:52,320
50% baseline oral food and beverage intake and inadequate enteral nutrition infusion related to side effects of chemotherapy,

124
00:13:52,830 --> 00:14:00,780
as evidenced by inability to tolerate feeding adequate to meet estimated needs as well as weight loss of 5%.

125
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:10,139
And also the risk of cancer therapy could indicate nutrition diagnoses of predicted suboptimal

126
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:17,310
intake where you need to specify the nutrient or food matter medication interaction.

127
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:27,810
So for nutrition therapy, it's not terrible by feeding unlike normal starvation.

128
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:38,620
It's kind of like a mealtime approach. So I went over like a lot of the things that I was supposed to be targeting during nutrition therapy.

129
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:45,490
So artificial nutrition was kind of like highly debated and a bunch of research articles looking at.

130
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:57,940
But one of them found that was beneficial for those who are unable to maintain adequate oil intake looks more than 1600 times than two

131
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:11,530
weeks and then hydration throughout the day and sleep through energy and protein containing liquids and also not during meal times.

132
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:18,549
So that I'm kind of going along with that smaller,

133
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:27,610
more frequent meals to deal with the lack of hunger and to limit low energy food so as not to fill up for tea and coffee

134
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:34,930
throughout the day so that they don't or they don't have hunger for actual nutrients also to consider enjoyment.

135
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:43,900
So smell is very important because if they're already noxious and they're not able to eat and that becomes very important.

136
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:55,060
So like they don't like hot food stoking some of that and then to also increase the amount of fat and protein.

137
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:04,980
And I found that one place suggested a protein intake and a range of 1 to 1.5 grams per kg.

138
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:17,000
And then a lot of research articles explored supplementing with omega three fatty acids and they found that there was improved muscle and weight gain,

139
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,940
then also choosing types for the patients because of their confidence.

140
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:33,159
You are also suggesting that it's time for will be helpful and that it's not on there but also encouraging for people to prescribe to eat out.

141
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:42,370
But I think that's great.

142
00:16:46,480 --> 00:17:00,400
Anybody have any questions for this group? One of the specific side effects that we'll discuss today can then lead to what you all discussed,

143
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:05,230
so then kind of transition into a state of anorexia.

144
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:14,109
So that was really good. And I really appreciate the nutrition, medical nutrition therapy point.

145
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,150
On choosing a time like setting times eat.

146
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:26,020
Sometimes that sounds simple, but when there isn't a really strong hunger cues, sometimes having set meal times or like a reminder on the phone,

147
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:33,429
I use that with some of my patients that don't have cancer but maybe have a low hunger response anyways

148
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:38,860
that it's just a reminder that it is time to eat and almost think of it more as part of their treatment.

149
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:47,380
It's time for this meal. So as you guys, as future dietitians, potentially that's the chance to go.

150
00:17:49,900 --> 00:18:02,170
What would be like your approach to a cancer patient that you suspect is experiencing anorexia in terms of prioritizing your interventions?

151
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,200
How would you where would you start?

152
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:12,760
Obviously, you'll have your assessment, but what would be a way that you would approach your interventions for patients with experiencing anorexia?

153
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,370
Simply because it is very complex. Like that was a good slide.

154
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:28,350
So if we think about how we set up a nutrition diagnosis, right,

155
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:34,020
we're supposed to our interventions should target the etiology that may not be possible with

156
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:40,620
somebody with anorexia that has this really multifaceted etiology that led to this state.

157
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:51,659
So sometimes then we say, if we can't intervene on the etiology or like specifically address or resolve that we focus on those signs and symptoms.

158
00:18:51,660 --> 00:19:02,970
So kind of like that evidence in our statement. So how would you maybe approach a patient like this if you think about it that way?

159
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,850
I mean, I think that the the small frequency this is something that I would probably start with.

160
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:21,089
And also I really like you're out there in an environment and a space that is comfortable for them to even like the smell and taste like things,

161
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,049
doing things that they enjoy, like providing food they enjoy.

162
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:32,000
Because I think at that point, like, there's nothing you can really do too much to make the general symptoms go away.

163
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:36,270
So it's just like a matter of just getting food into the body and trying to make it an enjoyable experience.

164
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,400
So you have to.

165
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:48,750
Yeah, I would agree with that because sometimes, um, if you ever get a chance to work with cancer patients in a nutrition, in a dietitian capacity,

166
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:58,020
it can be very overwhelming to come in and see where these patients are in terms of their state of the disease and their nutritional state.

167
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:04,799
So focusing on what we can do for them, like how can we make eating more pleasant?

168
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,320
Maybe it's a stressor because they feel terrible every time they eat. They know they're losing weight, everyone's pushing them to eat.

169
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:18,750
So making them feel comfortable and really with something like anorexia, trying to figure out what is the biggest problem.

170
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,360
Are you is your appetite so poor because you feel nauseous?

171
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,799
So like, is it nausea then we're just going to go more symptom focused or do you feel full too early?

172
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,830
And that's leading to this weight loss.

173
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,270
In addition, everything else going on.

174
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:42,569
So really doing maybe more symptom specific interventions when a patient is really declined in terms of their nutritional status,

175
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:48,000
can help them have a plan and a priority.

176
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,950
That doesn't seem so overwhelming.

177
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:58,420
So I think that some of those empty tips that are very helpful for that and just focusing on what we can do and not, um,

178
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:04,169
not getting too overwhelmed and sometimes I'm glad you guys mentioned that you some

179
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:10,620
nutrition therapy so parental parental nutrition is controversial and highly debated.

180
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,719
You'll see some papers that really would discourage using artificial nutrition in

181
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,070
certain cancer patients depending on what the prognosis is their current state.

182
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:27,779
But there are some situations where it may be warranted, and we'll get into that a lot next semester.

183
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:35,579
In terms of when we initiate nutrition therapy, we have some guidelines and a lot of times it's therapy.

184
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:41,219
Short term, we say that's really not helpful. If somebody is only going to get a couple of days, there's no real benefit to that.

185
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:51,120
But it can be a really difficult situation where we know that they can't meet their nutritional needs should we go the artificial nutrition route,

186
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,430
which might actually make them feel worse. So with with anorexia or cancer?

187
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,200
Yeah, it is. There's not really good evidence to support it either way.

188
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:08,160
Any other questions for this group? I know. Chatting. Okay, great job, you guys.

189
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:17,760
Thank you. Thank you. I would like to know, what are your interests in which are you?

190
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:27,890
We are mucositis and stuff. Okay. Should be pulled up the.

191
00:22:42,190 --> 00:23:12,510
It might be fun. It doesn't matter if you already.

192
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:20,730
All right. Go ahead. So are cancer side effects more specifically Mucositis and Stomatitis.

193
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:35,400
So what are they? So this is the is when the mucosal lining the mouth and gas and or gastrointestinal tract is inflamed her ulcerated.

194
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,210
It's a common adverse side effect of radiotherapy and chemotherapy,

195
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,770
specifically around the head, neck and chest regions where patients receive treatment.

196
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:55,560
I also found that it is a possible side effect of drugs, side effects, but it's kind of interesting to include.

197
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,660
So Stomatitis, which I initially thought was something entirely different, is not.

198
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:12,930
It's just specifically oral mucositis mucositis and it's the information or ulceration of the oral cavity.

199
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,830
So that can include now it's time to read lips for you.

200
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,180
Do not recommend looking at photos of this. It's pretty gruesome.

201
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,000
Yeah. Yeah, it's. Yeah. No, no, thanks.

202
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:33,120
This can be caused by radiotherapy, chemotherapy, well-fitting, dentures, infection.

203
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,010
It's bacterial, viral or fungal and special medications.

204
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:44,110
Damages or. Okay.

205
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:51,070
So like you mentioned, it is caused by radiation and chemotherapy.

206
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,560
There are five different phases of the development and healing of mucositis.

207
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:04,240
So the phases are initiation, primary damage response, signal amplification and ulceration phase and healing phase.

208
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:10,930
So in those phases of the first phase, the radiation or chemotherapy causes the tissue injury,

209
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,830
which then causes the death of the nasal epithelial cells.

210
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,520
And during that time, the formation of reactive oxygen species happens as well,

211
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:27,910
and then direct cell death, which also increases the inflammatory pathways.

212
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,780
And then after all of that, that's when the ulcers begin to form.

213
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:37,570
And then the final phase is healing, which is epithelial perforation.

214
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,499
So interestingly, between radiation and chemotherapy,

215
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:50,560
there is a difference in the time of the progression of the ulcers, depending on your treatment type.

216
00:25:50,680 --> 00:26:00,110
So for example, in radiation therapy, it can start up to two weeks after the initial treatment and it takes much longer to resolve itself.

217
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,400
So up to 8 to 12 weeks after the end of treatment.

218
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:08,110
So this could last a lot longer for patients undergoing radiation therapy.

219
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,219
Meanwhile, for patients who would be undergoing chemotherapy,

220
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:19,720
it can occur as soon as five days after the beginning of treatment and can resolve a little bit quicker in 1 to 2 weeks.

221
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:31,010
And some risk factors that we came across in our research was that younger patients may be at higher risk for mucositis,

222
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:38,420
which I thought was interesting. I thought that originally older people might be more at risk, but younger patients have a much higher cell turnover,

223
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:44,270
so the chemotherapy and radiation has more opportunities to cause damage,

224
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,710
as well as poor nutritional status, which we will talk about a little bit later.

225
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:56,120
And then finally, oral hygiene during treatment can also pose a risk factor for developing mucositis.

226
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,740
So I'll dive into whatever the nutritional consequences.

227
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:11,630
Biggest thing with Stomatitis and go to this first mucositis sorry is like they're

228
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,920
going to have a pain in their mouth and all the ulcerations and all the changes there.

229
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:22,290
So there's going to be a decreased, solid and liquid oral intake due to that discomfort.

230
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,079
And then if that's prolonged, that's going to lead to moderate or severe malnutrition.

231
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,540
If we think back to our one of our first lectures,

232
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:39,090
it would fall under chronic disease related malnutrition since it is related to cancer and then also dehydration,

233
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,379
since they're not going to be drinking due to the pain as well.

234
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:51,180
So then, as we know, incidents of malnutrition can lead to certain anemia is a big thing and protein deficiency

235
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:56,520
as it's different from starvation and then more vitamin and mineral deficiencies.

236
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:00,530
And I like this kind of a gross graphic.

237
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:07,560
I tried to choose the least graphic graphic, but kind of how it progresses.

238
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:16,320
And like I grade two victims, they are eating solid foods as you go on, just how bad it is in the mouth,

239
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:22,860
you don't want to do it, but they'll go to liquids and then eventually not want to really take anything by mouth.

240
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:28,220
So yeah. It's me.

241
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:35,800
Yeah. All right. And this is Ellis Island out here, so I'm going to read a bit off of it, but some general nutrition recommendations.

242
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:42,190
The use of bicarbonate rinses before and after meals discourage intake of irritants such as tobacco, alcohol,

243
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:46,750
spicy foods, tart foods, salty or very sweet foods, and avoid things that are crunchy and might irritate.

244
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:53,110
And then I'll go into more of them. Anti but easier to chew food, soft things, period options.

245
00:28:53,590 --> 00:29:02,469
And then thinking about the temperature of food, what might be less irritating to the person especially you mentioned some vitamin deficiencies,

246
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:08,080
so crushing multivitamins into the meals and then also easy tolerated beverages.

247
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,550
So non-carbonated, low acidity, warmer cool milk based beverages.

248
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:20,320
And then just some recommendations for how to consume foods that are more are more easy to consume.

249
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:28,180
So dunking or soaking solid foods into liquid to soften them to to avoid dry foods, which is pretty self-explanatory and alcohol up.

250
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:35,110
And then there are a couple recommendations like honey to prevent this severity and then Camomile,

251
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:43,310
which I believe is the anti-inflammatory, antifungal and then perhaps also the erm but that helps with pain.

252
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:51,260
So I think it's an analgesic if I'm saying that word. Right. For the moment, here are some potential statements.

253
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:57,379
So first to address the potential malnutrition, as we have learned in class, that that's kind of the one thing to really focus on,

254
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:04,340
especially if people are not able to consume with it severe enough, like you really aren't eating at all or you're not drinking.

255
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,560
So these are can be pretty severe.

256
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:13,340
So just checking how we talked about with what's their weight loss and how much of their energy requirements are they eating to really

257
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:25,550
diagnose that and then inadequate energy intake so discomfort can be related to zero stoma but dry mouth dysphagia difficulty swallowing.

258
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,190
So this can just it can just be a lot of pain for people to eat.

259
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:36,559
So just obviously inadequate energy intake is pretty likely and then inadequate fluid intake.

260
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:45,890
So we saw in those images the oral lesions and we can we can see this by electrolyte imbalances or just the inability to swallow at all.

261
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:54,229
So the nutritional interventions, as I mentioned on the last slide, easy to chew, diet, soft foods, bananas, oatmeal, potatoes to you.

262
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:58,400
And then that goal would be to increase calories and then increase fluid diet.

263
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:03,139
So increase fluid consumption by X amount through adding foods with high water content,

264
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,680
protein shakes, water, and also mentioned protein deficiencies. So something like that.

265
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:14,030
And then if it is severe enough, intravenous fluids, electrolyte correction and then enter all parental nutrition.

266
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,720
I think I know we talked about in the anorexia, it's controversial.

267
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:21,469
I feel like in this one, if it's severe enough, it might be more appropriate.

268
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,700
But we can talk about that more. And then, yeah,

269
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:32,120
how we're going to assess those looking at their electrolyte profiles and their total energy intake in 24 hours through the Food Journal.

270
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:38,690
Or if they're in the hospital, see what they're able to eat or consume, and then assess hydration and nutrition status,

271
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:44,299
monitor their nursing, nursing flowchart and just seeing what percentage overall they're eating.

272
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,800
And then obviously like monitoring their weight, if they continue to lose weight, that could really be a reflection.

273
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:57,170
And that's a great. Okay.

274
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:01,030
So I know I wasn't here. That was her. Section.

275
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:11,940
And I can ask her to expound on this. So capsaicin, which they know a capsaicin is in peppers.

276
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:18,090
Yeah. It's like the, the component of peppers that's like really hot.

277
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:24,060
So that's mentioned as a way to alleviate some of the discomfort, I think.

278
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:34,320
I'm not. The evidence is that great if you look at it like the grade on that and I've never seen that used in practice, but it may be.

279
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,660
So like some of these alternative therapies could be helpful, but, you know,

280
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:45,780
always double check the evidence and see if that's like what the oncologist specifically recommends.

281
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,970
Sometimes you included that, but that would be something like I wouldn't automatically recommend that.

282
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:55,710
I was like, look into the writing it mentioned. Like it was not.

283
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:01,020
If it wasn't harmful, it could be worth a try is kind of what it mean. It's like risk intervention, right?

284
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:07,320
Yep. I agree. So you promised something that I also broke down.

285
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,420
So nutritional status may modulate the severity of, like, mucositis or stomatitis.

286
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:20,969
So do you guys think there is a potential place for, like, preemptive nutrition therapy?

287
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:28,770
So let's say you have a patient with a certain cancer that, you know, the plant is maybe going to be surgical resection, followed by radiation.

288
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:33,330
Do you think there's a potential place to even if they're nutritional status,

289
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:42,180
is there or even good to proactively place a feeding to prior to that planned surgery.

290
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,680
I want to say private surgery. But prior to the chemo therapy.

291
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:58,150
Yes. Because especially if they're receiving chemotherapy in that region that way,

292
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:05,430
they're not starting from ground zero when they receive the feeding tube, if that makes sense.

293
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:09,510
Sure. Yeah. Any other thoughts or when?

294
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:15,690
Is there a scenario you could think of where we might giving what we're anticipating,

295
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,070
the path the patient could go on that you would and you guys could chime in to.

296
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:30,930
We'll talk about this on Thursday with S.F. but where we might boost nutritional status perioperative or like prior to treatment.

297
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:35,340
Yeah. I mean I definitely think I mean I would trying to avoid a feeling at all possible

298
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,230
by if there's other ways to make sure their nutrient status is good checking.

299
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:47,070
Maybe we like do some extra lab work to see whether electrolytes are just making sure they're constantly thinking about these things.

300
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,170
So I don't know if people I could assume,

301
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:55,979
like getting nervous before something like this would happen and then like those nerves like interfering with my normal way of eating.

302
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,860
So I feel like putting people through that whole process with like,

303
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:06,149
let's make sure if you're in good nutritional status that you keep that up or maybe just amp up some extra, I don't know,

304
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:11,580
whatever recommendations we have more foods with a certain nutrient profile or just like I feel like the hydration thing

305
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:16,700
is just so important to you just to make sure that they're understanding that before or nutrition education before,

306
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:20,700
like here are some things that might happen. So let's start introducing you to these types of foods.

307
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,890
Now, if you're not eating like foods like that are more hydrating.

308
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:35,219
Yes. I think that's so important that trying to help patients anticipate what they may experience so they get that information.

309
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:41,550
But often they're not seeing a dietician throughout that whole process, especially before treatment has started.

310
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:50,070
So to let them know, like you can expect that you're going to probably develop some mouth sores.

311
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,910
This is why, given the nature of your surgery and treatment plan,

312
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:59,550
these are the types of foods and things that may be better tolerated so they can kind of have a plan going in.

313
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:04,170
Usually we're a little bit more reactive in medicine here.

314
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,970
It's like once they're at that point where they have the issues, they consult the dietitian.

315
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:17,219
So being part of that process throughout the whole way is really associated with a lot better outcome.

316
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:26,610
So I definitely agree with that. And you will see sometimes we do preemptively placed feeding tubes for certain patients.

317
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:31,830
They will get a couple of weeks of nutrition even if their nutritional status is fair.

318
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:39,510
If we're anticipating a rather significant post-operative process, that also may involve radiation,

319
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:48,180
especially in the head neck for removing part of the jaw, significant portion of the tongue.

320
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:52,120
They're going to get radiated here. It's a long process.

321
00:36:52,120 --> 00:37:01,949
So sometimes any way to get their nutritional status in a good place before that, we will do that and I would hope we'd see more of that.

322
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:07,080
But sometimes patients are really not wanting to and we'll talk about that with see,

323
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,450
sometimes if we're anticipating a lung transplant, these patients are at high nutritional risk.

324
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:19,860
We'll do several weeks of enteral nutrition leading up to that surgery, and I think some of that can apply to certain cancer patients as well.

325
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:29,669
So nutritional status, of course, with many of these symptoms, if they are in a poorly traditional state,

326
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:35,400
sometimes their symptoms become more severe and they tend to decline more, more significantly.

327
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:42,060
Last thing, did you guys read anything on Blue to me or.

328
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:47,999
I remember something about it. I mean, it's the most yeah, it's the most present amino acid in the body.

329
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,070
So I know that there was some comment about therapy for just including an increase in glutamine.

330
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:58,919
So there is some data, I don't know if I'd say evidence to really support,

331
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,829
but you'll see like oral glutamine supplements because cells in the GI tract really like glutamine,

332
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,889
so it can help with potential preserving or healing.

333
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:11,370
So we'll use like glue, that's all.

334
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:16,740
It's another kind of low risk intervention that may help, probably won't hurt.

335
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:20,070
So you will read different things on glutamine with mucositis.

336
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:26,100
But again, the data to really support strong recommendations is probably not there.

337
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:37,860
Yeah, Professor, there were two bombs dropped in Japan, so a lot of people heard what they were talking about after the war.

338
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:43,500
Yeah. And it was pullover piece and help that repaired the line and that has.

339
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:53,640
Sure. And that rep. And sometimes you have to get tickled best because you'll walk through all these types of receptors everywhere for that.

340
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,700
So but mainly to take that will be player that you like when you just sits.

341
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:05,790
Yeah. I mean it's, it's, it's so unfortunate to read the studies on those exposed to the atomic bomb radiation.

342
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:10,410
But we've it's we've learned a lot about the damage of radiation.

343
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:16,080
And so studies are really interesting, albeit how terrible that whole circumstance is.

344
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,130
But we've learned a lot on the side effects, long term side effects of that.

345
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:26,710
All right. Thank you guys so much. And keep on short stay. What now you have so your hand.

346
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:36,560
You guys can still be helpful and I'm.

347
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:05,210
I have one that we will be presenting on Zero Stone.

348
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:18,260
So what is zero zero? Estonia is also called dry mouth and it occurs when the salivary glands cannot make enough saliva to keep the mouth wet.

349
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,740
And it's also called salivary gland, hypo function.

350
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:28,219
And it's it's common radiation and surgical resection of this halibut gland.

351
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:36,720
And we'll get more into that as we go. And so saliva is critical for a lot of normal functioning in the body.

352
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:44,610
In overall health, for example, saliva is important for tasting, chewing, swallowing, speaking and, of course, dental health.

353
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:50,120
And so the lack of saliva can have a major impact both on health and quality of life,

354
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:59,420
because imagine having this constant perception of a dry mouth that's very uncomfortable if you can't quench your thirst, really.

355
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,520
And so anyone can experience dry mouth, but some groups are more susceptible.

356
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:13,100
Like I mentioned, those who receive radiation, some medications can put people at a greater risk of age related changes.

357
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:18,980
Oral infections and some autoimmune diseases can increase the risk of dry mouth.

358
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:29,370
So kind of going off of what Mattie said, some of the causes are there's a lot of medical side effects.

359
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:36,030
So medication or medication side effects. So medication used to treat anxiety, depression, asthma.

360
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:43,110
There was like a whole list. So I just kind of named the main ones disease and infections side effects.

361
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:46,890
So HIV, AIDS, Alzheimer's, diabetes, Parkinson's.

362
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,550
Again, there was like a huge list of these as well.

363
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,680
Like we said earlier, medical treatment side effects, mainly radiation therapy,

364
00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:00,120
any type of nerve damage to the head and neck, which I thought was kind of interesting.

365
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,860
Conditions that lead to dehydration. So fever. Sweating, vomiting.

366
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:09,010
Diarrhea, blood loss. Burns. Lifestyle.

367
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:14,939
So smoking is a really big one or any type of like tobacco use and just breathing with your mouth open.

368
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,170
So at times if you have like a cold and your nose is plugged up and you're sleeping,

369
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:26,740
that can kind of cause like dry mouth and then aging and then symptoms.

370
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,760
So it's like a sticky, dry feeling in your mouth and throat.

371
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,750
Frequent thirst. Sometimes sores can develop in the mouth.

372
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:45,030
You'll see like cracked in split, cracked lips, split skin at the corners of the mouth, burning tingling sensation in the mouth and tongue dry red,

373
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:54,510
right tongue problems with speaking, trouble tasting, chewing and swallowing person's dry nasal passage or throat and bad breath.

374
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,870
Yes. I want to talk about why it happens, kind of the physiology.

375
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:10,290
So we have a roughly about three salivary glands in our mouth, but they correctly apart way to carotid carotid gland,

376
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:15,780
the thumb manual about the man, two of them and the sublingual glands.

377
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:24,120
So basically it's just any interruption, a slight refraction sometimes that can be caused by when tumors just physically

378
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:29,579
block on the release of saliva from glands but often caused from radiation therapy.

379
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:40,590
Like we mentioned previously, our study found that roughly 64% of patients got czarist on the when they got radiation to the hair, the head and neck.

380
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,479
Then essentially it's just less production and saliva.

381
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:52,500
That's how they kind of grade the like the grade of their saumya is your saliva production and milliliters per

382
00:43:52,500 --> 00:44:01,410
minutes so the less are graded spreads to and more serious grades is if you have less than 0.1 million per minute.

383
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:09,530
And yeah so like there's a lot of medications and radiation that can just they affect the

384
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:18,470
the cells that would overall lead to less direct to saliva that's also common and like,

385
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:26,490
you know, you have, you know, conditions and diseases and autoimmune disorders that attack those cells as well.

386
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:36,600
And some, like our study, found that some patients may not recover their saliva production even up to a year after radiation treatment.

387
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:45,570
So the nutritional consequences are very similar to what Karim was saying with the stomatitis.

388
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:54,750
Some people may experience discomfort because of the dry mouth, which will cause them to not easily chew and swallow their food as much.

389
00:44:54,990 --> 00:45:04,380
And this can cause different nutrient deficiencies due to the reduced chewing ability which could limit their digestion and nutrient absorption.

390
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:11,760
So some things that I found is that there are lower carbohydrate intake due to the discomfort experienced when eating dry, starchy foods.

391
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,139
In addition,

392
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:21,570
there was a study I found in older population that showed that in comparison between those who have is there are some and those who didn't.

393
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:29,820
There was a lower overall energy intake as well as nutrient deficiencies in fiber, vitamin B, iron, calcium, think potassium.

394
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:37,979
And just like stomatitis, there could be a risk for malnutrition as well if the nutrient deficiencies are lower.

395
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:41,610
Energy intake continues over a long period of time.

396
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:50,680
Okay. So some of the L.A. recommendations, they said that liquid supplementation, this is like radiation.

397
00:45:50,680 --> 00:46:00,730
Usually liquid supplementation is suggested because of like the soreness in the mouth and the inability to like easily swallow.

398
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:10,960
Also consuming a high protein diet following radiation because it helps rebuild the tissue.

399
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:19,209
So high protein is suggested and then things like Ensure and Pedialyte are one of the things that they recommend to supplement

400
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:27,310
with because it's easy to swallow for the patients and it contains a lot of nutrients for the dry mouth and taste alterations.

401
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:37,900
They recommend that you increase fluid intake to try to combat the dry mouth and it helps food easier to swallow food,

402
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:47,080
modified diets to be soft and liquid for swallowing purposes and then consuming sugar free meant to promote

403
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:53,889
like silvery secretion and for the taste alterations using a plastic utensil rather than metal one.

404
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:57,490
Because the metal kind of makes the taste funky sometimes.

405
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:05,110
And then some things that they said to avoid or like spicy foods, salty and citrus,

406
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:13,389
just because of the dryness in the mouth and the ability for infection and also dental caries.

407
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:17,140
That's another big one to coffee, to an alcohol. They're very acidic.

408
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:25,810
They can deteriorate the enamel and cause cavities. Tobacco smoking isn't good for the dry mouth.

409
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:32,080
It can cause infections and bacteria in the mouth, foods containing sucrose, again,

410
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:37,690
all kind of for dental caries and then coverage, carbohydrate, heavy foods.

411
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:46,809
This is because they tend to stick to the teeth and then again for dental caries and then carcinogenic foods was on there.

412
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:50,500
But I was reading about it and it's kind of hard to avoid on because there's

413
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:56,440
a lot of foods that have carcinogens in them because they say to avoid them,

414
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,770
because it can be linked to cancer, it can cause cancer.

415
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:11,500
And the from having a dry mouth and the lack of saliva, it can make you at a higher risk if you're consuming carcinogenic foods.

416
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:18,430
But again, the evidence was kind of there wasn't anything specific that said it wasn't very explicit.

417
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:24,040
So that's why it was kind of so.

418
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,760
Yeah, that's right.

419
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:35,590
And I think any questions for zero stelvio group?

420
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:46,840
So I'm glad you guys pointed out this is pretty specific if we're talking about cancer to radiation.

421
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:51,169
So this is the most common long term complication of radiation therapy.

422
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:55,460
So you don't really see dry mouth from chemotherapy.

423
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:59,930
Of course, if there's going to be surgical manipulation in the head neck area,

424
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,580
near the salivary glands or causing nerve damage, that also contributes.

425
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:13,580
So sometimes also the magnitude or the damage is really dose dependent on the radiation therapy.

426
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:17,600
But what's interesting is that it can last for up to a year.

427
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:25,400
So radiation therapy is really nasty in terms of the side effects and they are prolonged.

428
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:33,200
I mean, these patients, they'll be several months out and still really struggling with some of these nutrition impact systems.

429
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:39,049
So it sounds it sounds simple when we say dry mouth.

430
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:43,840
And I think you guys did a good job of explaining like this is really problematic if you think about it.

431
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:52,670
One of the other things you'll talk about today or you have talked about if you don't have good Salisbury flow and you have this dry mouth,

432
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:55,820
that's why it's really important for clearing bacteria.

433
00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:02,840
So then in a vulnerable patient that can lead to mucositis or make it worse, lead to infection.

434
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:09,620
So it's it's really problematic. Did you guys I know we focus on the medical nutrition therapy.

435
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:15,980
Did you read anything on, like saliva substitutes or oral rinses that patients might use?

436
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:22,110
Yeah, I did a little bit. I just thought that was more on the dental side of it.

437
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,230
Yeah, I had a lot of dental recommendations.

438
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:31,400
I didn't think that those were along our lines of recommendations, but I also didn't know that was a question that interesting.

439
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:35,990
They said like mouthwash with like water soda every 2 hours.

440
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:44,930
Yeah. So we will have patients and this will be not necessarily coming from the dietician, but they'll they'll have different rinses.

441
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:51,080
There's one called like magic mouthwash that will stimulate or provide some moisture.

442
00:50:52,100 --> 00:51:00,950
They don't really last long. So sometimes we'll discuss those with the timing of their meals to like do your your mouth rinse,

443
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,720
you know, within an hour of what you're going to eat to maybe help break things down.

444
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:12,620
So it's it's really problematic and it can have a major impact on their air intake.

445
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:17,320
Is anybody ever done? And I maybe not ever.

446
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:23,540
Maybe one minute. That saltine challenge, if you've heard of that. So do you know what I'm talking about?

447
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,820
Really? So I've had patients tell me that it's.

448
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:31,920
It feels like that. Like if you've ever put a bunch of saltines in your mouth and you, like,

449
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:36,350
really cannot manipulate them at some point to a point where you could, like, swallow.

450
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:40,909
Like it's it's really difficult. So that's why I like the carbohydrate foods to think about.

451
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:44,680
Carbohydrates are just going to dry and water. It's going to make the situation worse.

452
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:52,770
So they may struggle with those foods or may even be part of our our MMT to limit really trying foods like that.

453
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:59,570
So don't underestimate the impact of something like dry mouth is what I would say.

454
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:08,140
Okay, great job. You guys would like to hear about it.

455
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:21,540
Taste and smell is a very popular.

456
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:47,050
Do you want to hear? I'm not a for them.

457
00:52:50,070 --> 00:53:02,840
There should be, like, a little icon at the top. I think it's okay.

458
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:10,830
Good morning, everyone. We're going to be presenting on taste and smell ulcerations for our patients diagnosed with cancer.

459
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:16,890
So what are taste and smell alterations or versions?

460
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:25,140
They are strong dislike or taste or smells of certain foods, and I'll get into that more in the next slide.

461
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:36,600
But they significantly impact on our ability to achieve adequate intake, and this may result in inadequate calorie intake.

462
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:41,879
They may have greater weight loss at six months when they are assessed by a dietitian,

463
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:47,910
as well as diminished quality of life and some symptoms of taste alteration.

464
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:54,030
They definitely vary by the patient and based on the type of cancer that they've been diagnosed with.

465
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:58,710
But they may experience pronounced taste sensation,

466
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:08,790
so they may taste more sweet or saltiness or bitterness or sour or whatever the taste of the food that they're ingesting is.

467
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:13,440
They also may experience no taste or a fear.

468
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:22,440
And this is a really rare condition and it can be caused by a lot of ah different cancers.

469
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:32,880
If there is like radiation therapy, there could be damage to their salivary glands based on various nerves that are within this region.

470
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:39,360
So that could be a reason why they experience a Gaussian as well as metallic

471
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:44,170
taste is a symptom that they may experience if they are having taste aversions

472
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:51,299
when ingesting certain foods and some of the foods that can really amplify taste

473
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:59,310
perversions include caffeinated beverages such as coffee or various sodas,

474
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:05,700
red meat, citrus fruits and juices, as well as chocolate as well.

475
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:18,840
All right. So why does that happen? So taste and or smell alterations can happen for many reasons, some of which I listed there.

476
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:26,240
So systemic or local effect of tumors in the oral cavity, nasal cavity or salivary glands?

477
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:34,340
Cancer treatment or surgical resection causing increased destruction of t cells or damage to the whole of factory nerve.

478
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:43,720
Decreased number of taste buds cells, infection of oral cavity interfering with taste such as can candidiasis.

479
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:52,700
I'm not sure I'm saying that right. And then I found this figure here and it shows some factors that result in taste alteration.

480
00:55:52,700 --> 00:56:01,999
So you can see on the left and or let's see, inflammation can increase damage to taste receptor cells.

481
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,830
Treatments can cause damage to taste buds cells like radio and chemotherapy.

482
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:11,299
And then also in the paper it that it required more research.

483
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:18,440
So I'm not really sure how relevant this is, but there can be some changes in carbohydrate metabolism and taste perception.

484
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:28,700
I'm not sure how how much we would use that, but and then there are also some co-morbid conditions that can be present that affect taste.

485
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:39,859
So neurologically things like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, altered endocrine function, like thyroid dysfunction or diabetes and then age.

486
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:43,730
So taste and smell changes are associated with advancing age.

487
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:51,770
So there are also some nutritional risk factors that contribute to taste alteration,

488
00:56:51,770 --> 00:57:00,830
so zinc or nice and deficiency anemia can occur and malnutrition as a result of cancer or the associated treatments.

489
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,360
So zinc has been shown to be associated with taste function,

490
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:11,570
with involvement in the taste bud, the nerves transmitting taste information and the brain.

491
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:20,719
And then certain medications can also affect taste. So things like antibiotics or chemotherapy medications like Asha mentioned,

492
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:27,080
a lot of patients report metallic taste as a result of chemotherapy medications or radiation.

493
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:35,180
So that can affect dietary intake. And then some individuals may be at high risk for taste and smell alteration.

494
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:41,870
So those that undergo radiation to the head and neck area or those who have brain malignancies,

495
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:54,840
sinus or nasal polyps or cranial nerve damage, and then I'll have to just has some examples of taste alterations in smell, right?

496
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:57,980
So going into the nutritional consequences.

497
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:06,440
So our main concern is that these taste and smell versions causes the avoidance of food, which ultimately leads to inadequate intake of nutrients.

498
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:13,940
And this is important for the dietician to know so that the treatment plan can factor in these emergent aversions.

499
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:17,660
So some example, nutrition diagnosis.

500
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:21,710
Diagnosis could be inadequate protein intake.

501
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:30,050
Like Aisha said, there is common aversion to red meat, inadequate energy intake, of course, because they're not eating enough.

502
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:41,660
This could lead to malnutrition and different vitamin and mineral deficiencies, inadequate fluid intake, which could cause dehydration.

503
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:45,230
And there could be an inadequate intake of, you know,

504
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:50,240
citrusy drinks because there's a common aversion to that and then could also

505
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,660
lead to disordered eating patterns if they have a preference for certain foods.

506
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:57,440
There was a common like for salty foods.

507
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:02,720
Yeah. Okay, so what do they do?

508
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:07,790
So of course, we want to tailor our interventions and guide the patient's food choices based on their preferences.

509
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:11,780
So we want to figure out what they don't like the most and of course what they do like.

510
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:18,620
And then we can educate them on how to prepare their foods best so that it sort of avoids their aversions.

511
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:26,000
Encourage good oral hygiene, smaller, more frequent meals can help so that they're not eating like a bunch of gross at once.

512
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:29,210
They're spreading it out. Increase fluid intake.

513
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:37,520
You can supplement if you suspect a deficiency and then you use artificial saliva for the dry mouth that we mentioned before.

514
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:43,760
And then here's some guidance on how to sort of change the food, I guess.

515
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:48,170
So if it's too sweet, you can add some resources or salt or lemon.

516
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:52,370
If it's if there's a metallic taste, don't use metal silverware.

517
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:57,589
Plastic utensils are like chopsticks. Their wooden attributes are too bitter.

518
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:03,380
You can marinate them, which I thought was cool. And then for red meat, you can switch to a different meat source.

519
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:07,580
And then for smell, you can choose colder foods because they don't smell.

520
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:15,520
As much as you can cover your cups. We put a lid on them or drink with a straw, so it sort of avoids the dose, if that makes sense.

521
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:19,480
Yeah, I think you.

522
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:27,970
Thank you for keep. I realize I've kept us from that being timely, so that was really good.

523
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:33,890
Any questions for this group I think will keep moving so that we don't fall.

524
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:37,390
But what I will say is you guys did a really good job.

525
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,959
I'm getting specific information on the alteration they're experiencing because

526
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:46,100
then we can have really specific interventions like taste and smell alterations.

527
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,630
What is it and what if it is taste? What is the problem the patient's experiencing?

528
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:56,989
And then we have like some specific recommendations so it can really be tailored to what the patient's experiencing.

529
01:00:56,990 --> 01:01:00,290
And you guys did a really good job putting that forward.

530
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:03,290
That's that's kind of the main thing here. So great.

531
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,440
However, I would like to go next.

532
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:38,700
Go ahead. Okay. What?

533
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:55,250
That's all we're going to talk about, nausea and vomiting as a side effects.

534
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:58,129
So first, what is it? It always happens.

535
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:03,740
And I think it's defined as the feeling of sickness with the explanation of what Mitt Romney is actually like,

536
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:10,459
the forcible discharge of the stomach contents that in vomiting typically occur for different reasons,

537
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,430
such as like the chemotherapy or radiation treatments.

538
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:22,640
The cancer itself, sometimes, if it's directly related to the brain or abdomen, has an influence on whether a patient feels nausea, vomiting.

539
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:29,120
But this is a discussion that everyone will feel not involving. So it's really just dependent on the patient themselves.

540
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:34,399
Some medicine, side effects. It's medicines that only work for just one thing.

541
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,700
They're just kind of a collective drug treatment.

542
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:42,620
It could affect whether patient experience is not uncommon as well.

543
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:47,690
Another fourth is just anxiety that comes along with with cancer.

544
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:51,649
And so I thought that was pretty important too. But sometimes it might not be really just things, right?

545
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:57,139
So that could contribute to the nausea, vomiting. So why exactly does it happen?

546
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,370
It's not really clear.

547
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:07,459
However, there's a bunch of like hypotheses that it's having so that some parts of the brain may be triggered with these treatments,

548
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:11,960
or especially before, with the medicines side effects that can be to not involve it.

549
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:24,100
So some clinical manifestations that can happen as a result of nausea and vomiting include constipation and intermittent bowel obstruction.

550
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:29,210
So constipation is defined as a stool frequency of less than 3000 per week.

551
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:37,279
In the interim, it involves disruption can occur as a side effect of antidepressants and all foods that are prescribed to patients.

552
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:47,390
In this situation, internal obstruction is tricky because it can also occur as the result of a hernia or some damage to the bowel.

553
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:53,510
There's just like a fibrous match seconds form sometimes in these two.

554
01:03:53,510 --> 01:04:01,340
Since that feeling of fullness can lead to a loss of appetite, which then can be a risk for malnutrition.

555
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:05,810
We also see gastroparesis in these patients, which is delayed.

556
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:08,390
Gastric emptying does damage to the vagus nerve.

557
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:18,080
This can induce early satiety and abdominal cramps, which again to lead them to have inadequate intake, putting them at risk for malnutrition.

558
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:26,540
And there's also a risk for diabetes mellitus due to hypoglycemia, since the stomach is not really digesting things in a proper rate.

559
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:30,260
So things are not getting broken down efficiently.

560
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:35,630
There's also gastroenteritis, which is an inflammation of the lining of the spine tested in the stomach.

561
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:40,010
And again, this can cause diarrhea, which is, you know,

562
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:49,190
to put them at risk for absorption of food is not really spending the adequate amount of time it eats in the small intestine to have that contact.

563
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:57,740
It can also cause abdominal cramps, increased energy needs and loss of appetite, which can put them at further risk for malnutrition.

564
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,630
We also see dehydration, which is when you lose more fluid than you take.

565
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:11,960
And again, all of the water soluble nutrients, water soluble vitamins like those in this can also lead to constipation,

566
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:16,220
started back over again and putting them at risk for loss of appetite.

567
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:28,590
So to continue on the nutritional consequences of vomiting and other can also lead to electrolyte and that which can be seen as hypercalcemia,

568
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:30,240
which is too much calcium in the blood.

569
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:37,590
Hypoglycemia which is high blood sugar levels or hyponatremia, which occurs when blood sodium levels are too low.

570
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:41,490
Hyponatremia is also the most common electrolyte disorder.

571
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,970
It can also result in esophagitis, which is the inflammation that damages the figures.

572
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:53,880
And this can cause a lot of discomfort when eating, such as painful and difficulty swelling and chest pain.

573
01:05:54,750 --> 01:06:00,930
And then this level of discomfort can lead someone to just not want to eat because they don't want experiencing symptoms.

574
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:08,370
So it can increase the risk of malnutrition. Also uremic, which is high levels of waste products in the blood.

575
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:13,950
And this can cause a loss of appetite and lead to poor malnutrition.

576
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,330
This is also a result of kidney damage. That's when it occurs.

577
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:26,070
And then lastly, vertigo, which is a sort of external or internal spinning sensation, often triggered by moving your head too quickly.

578
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:34,470
And then these effects can cause a loss of appetite, which can then further increase the risk of malnutrition.

579
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:38,009
All right. For nutritional therapy.

580
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:42,960
We actually broke it up and have you for some therapy, for nausea and then for vomiting, because it can be kind of different.

581
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:54,030
So for not specifically when it comes to food choices, limiting fatty, oily and rich foods, limiting spicy foods, limiting overly sweet foods.

582
01:06:54,030 --> 01:07:03,810
We talk about frosting and cupcakes, things like that, limiting caffeine and alcohol and then basically sticking to bland foods, liquids,

583
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:09,330
consuming foods at room temperature to avoid that smell that can a lot of times trigger nausea

584
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:14,490
and then try to eat soft foods that don't require as much chewing or as much work to eat.

585
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:19,170
Kind of it can get in and down quicker. It's not going to upset your stomach quite as much.

586
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:23,610
We also talk about kind of food related tips and tricks.

587
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:29,639
So eating small frequent meals, trying to eat in a place that is comfortable, not stuffy,

588
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:34,470
overly warm, or in any kind of other environment that might trigger or exacerbate nausea.

589
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:42,060
But using a fan or an open window if you're having to eat the common area is to avoid the smells that might be coming from other people's food,

590
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:47,100
but to include slowly and thoroughly to make it easier on your digestive system.

591
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:52,409
Rinsing your mouth after eating to help limit that lingering nausea that a lot of

592
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:56,380
times occurs when like we all like our breath still smells like what we ate that day.

593
01:07:56,420 --> 01:08:02,010
It can really help to induce that nausea. So you want to rinse your mouth out quickly after and then keeping a diary of

594
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:05,760
when and for how long you feel nauseated to help track down those triggers.

595
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:11,760
Well, then this is a therapy for vomiting isn't really fun because it's basically just nothing.

596
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:19,500
So avoiding eating and drinking during any acting out the vomiting is basically the main recommendation.

597
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:23,070
And then after a bout of vomiting gets controlled.

598
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:34,470
So you stop throwing that, and often you can start trying to move towards a clear liquid like diet consumption and it's really spaced out.

599
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:40,230
So the recommendation is, was a quarter of a teaspoon to every 10 minutes as long as you can handle that.

600
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:48,150
And then once that feels comfortable and you're really not going to be able to do anything, you want it put tablespoon every 30 minutes.

601
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:55,650
And so we do that at things like water, apple juice, sports drinks, anything you can see through popsicles are sometimes helpful.

602
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:04,450
Yeah, and then mashed potatoes broths, rice puree, fruit smoothies, yogurt cereals with milk at the top.

603
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:09,330
Those kinds of things can be started after as long as the liquids are being hit.

604
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:16,670
And then just like moving slowly and making sure not to upset, that's not after.

605
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:23,610
To keep out focus on eating food, potassium and magnesium can help to prevent that electrolyte imbalance that you're talking about.

606
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:27,839
And it's not interesting.

607
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:36,910
So 75, 89 medications to help prevent vomiting or acute or delayed vomiting, which happens because of treatments which would be followed.

608
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:42,990
But it doesn't seem helpful for anticipatory vomiting, which is like anxiety and vomiting.

609
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:48,900
It's like a conditioned response. So like you smell like the clinic and you're like, oh, I know.

610
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:57,030
It's like if I just like starts getting upset and it's out of my patient that but that is.

611
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:10,809
Any questions for this group? I think you did a really good job breaking it down because there were different symptoms.

612
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:20,440
So at times we do love them together and really trying to understand if it's happening

613
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:25,809
no matter what or are there certain food triggers that can help guide our approach?

614
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:30,969
But, you know, does it worsen with food or drinks or is it just happening no matter what?

615
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:35,680
And a lot of times these patients will be on medication like anti-nausea or an antiemetic.

616
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:39,670
But that's really interesting that for certain situations, those may not help.

617
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:43,950
So very quickly, you can see what a set that that would be.

618
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:45,970
If you see if somebody is having vomiting,

619
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:55,299
that may lose a couple of days of nutritional intake or even a day loss is is a big setback for her already nutritionally compromised patients.

620
01:10:55,300 --> 01:11:04,000
So having some really good interventions along with medication management is really crucial if a patient is prone to vomiting.

621
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:09,960
Yeah, great. Thank you guys so much. Okay, let's wrap up with our neutropenia group.

622
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:44,390
Quick slideshow. Let's.

623
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:15,020
Growth is just because you can make a difference in the way that.

624
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:34,900
Yeah. That's some people.

625
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:46,480
Oh, okay. Is it for my advice? I make my own time, so it looks like they will.

626
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:51,590
Yeah, well, it's really good that it.

627
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:58,550
Okay. Okay.

628
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:06,180
Hi, everyone. So we're going to be discussing yesterday and then you.

629
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:15,700
Okay. So what is it? It's when you have abnormally low levels of neutrophils, which are white blood cells.

630
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:23,580
So it's very common in patients who are undergoing chemotherapy, especially when you're getting your initial dosage.

631
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:36,220
It increases the risk of infection because white blood cells help with your innate immunity so that areas such as your white skin GI tract,

632
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:43,950
they become more susceptible to diseases. Symptoms include fever, mouse or skin infections.

633
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:49,150
So you're getting in low grade infections.

634
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:56,140
And then the specific way that they identify it is doing a C, p, c panel.

635
01:13:56,590 --> 01:14:01,360
And if it's under 2500 white blood cell count, that means you have.

636
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:14,400
So why does that happen? It's because chemotherapy attacks your bone marrow and bone marrow.

637
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:21,240
It makes neutrophils. So that decreases the amount of neutrophils in your system.

638
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:33,870
Some risk factors include as you age, your bone marrow is less good at making neutrophils.

639
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:37,410
So that increases the likelihood that you're going to have neutropenia.

640
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:42,570
Poor nutrition because you're not giving your body what it needs to make more immune cells.

641
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:49,470
If you get two tumors or cancer specifically in the bone marrow, this highly increases your risk.

642
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:56,910
Also, certain medications can limit the capacity of your bone marrow to make more neutrophils.

643
01:14:57,270 --> 01:15:03,260
Also, certain autoimmune diseases can increase the likelihood that you're going to have neutropenia.

644
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:14,610
Specifically to like nutritional risks, deficiencies in vitamin B12, folic acid and copper.

645
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:23,700
You need more protein to help with your recovery. So if you're under eating your protein, you can get kind of a protein, calorie malnutrition.

646
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:27,750
Of course, you have to deal with the secondary infections.

647
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:44,160
So although bacterial in the mouth, gingivitis on the skin, staphylococcus type infections, one's getting ammonia food and drug interactions.

648
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:50,160
If you're taking medications, um, you need to be careful what you eat.

649
01:15:50,520 --> 01:16:00,270
If it has a high bacterial or mold content, it can increase the likelihood that you might get have a reaction.

650
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:13,890
Right. So Veronica said something that has a lot of different causes and some are idiopathic you don't know what causes that.

651
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:17,040
But in the case when dealing with cancer patients,

652
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:26,820
there can be nutrition interventions if it's determined that that is the causative agent of the neutropenia.

653
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:34,140
So you'll get the blood panels, you can look at the absence scale, the total amount and white blood cell count.

654
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:41,430
These are just markers. And again, like you said, if it's under 1500 is an indication of HIPPA.

655
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:48,239
It's another thing to note that neutropenia can happen if you have virus.

656
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:52,379
So, you know, cancer patients could potentially be more susceptible.

657
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:57,630
And you can always check for like a fever or it's post-viral.

658
01:16:57,930 --> 01:17:05,069
That's pretty common, acute cause of neutropenia. Again, the Milo's suppressive medications.

659
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:13,260
So that suppresses the production of neutrophils in the bone marrow that's related to chemotherapy drugs.

660
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:22,660
And then another thing that is not talked about as much is you have to assess the person's food

661
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:30,810
safety knowledge because a lot of the times so since they have this decreased neutrophil count,

662
01:17:31,170 --> 01:17:38,030
they're they're at greater risk for food safety.

663
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:44,790
Yeah, food borne pathogens. Exactly. And that is going to play a role in the nutrition care process.

664
01:17:45,390 --> 01:17:55,709
So an example in nutrition diagnosis and nutrition related knowledge deficit related to new diagnoses of neutropenia as evidenced by unsafe practices.

665
01:17:55,710 --> 01:18:01,260
So something that a normal person with a normal neutrophil count would normally

666
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:06,419
not get sick from a person who's got a lower head count is at risk for this.

667
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:11,219
So some things related to nutrition education in that you could teach them.

668
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:18,300
It's just about handwashing practices, making sure they're using hand sanitizers between, you know,

669
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:27,210
when they don't have access to a sink that you can review diet to see if it can be modified, which she was going to touch on in a moment.

670
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:33,930
And then also, you know, just provide them nutrition, education, as you see here.

671
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:39,390
Yes. Yeah. So when you look at these foods, they look like something we eat every day.

672
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:50,760
But it's a no no for those patients because this well, this is one of these even yoga has a file on the package.

673
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,900
That means then they'll have to put to death.

674
01:18:55,260 --> 01:19:04,280
And this is like natural antibiotics but the plant is making this could have other contaminants still have to the

675
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:13,050
two cases before you come to see the process especially with the soft cheese it has more texture and moisture.

676
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:21,780
So also these come naturally. Naturally, yogurt is still the process could cause contaminants.

677
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:30,240
Well, these is also called diets for these patients.

678
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:43,740
First, like the cheese from pasteurized cheese or molds, detergent is pasteurized and these are the safe ones.

679
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:54,570
And American cheese is Swiss and cheddar. And if you live in the 547 open, not allowed if you want to know what's not allowed using the reference.

680
01:19:54,990 --> 01:20:00,270
Okay. In terms of meat and seafood theory shop, you think this looks so good in Japan?

681
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:03,420
You want smoked salmon, not cooked.

682
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:13,340
It just. And there's some of the need that in Italy is is all the system is not cooked.

683
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:16,410
And so it's everything that you think is normal to us.

684
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:23,510
It. Even the chopping block that you prepare for your sandwich, you will contaminate yourself.

685
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:33,319
Shellfish is definitely no. Okay. And you have to cook the meat to death when you make a hamburger, let's just say is well-done.

686
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:39,860
Has to be well done, but not chop chop. But what about putting some mayonnaise with it?

687
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:44,710
What do you think about mayonnaise? It contains from it.

688
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:50,210
Right. So that's a. How about that? Is tomato on top of, you know.

689
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:53,750
Okay. So the canned that compared cooked to death.

690
01:20:54,170 --> 01:21:02,270
Okay. So what you know, some of the cans and dirty, you must do the grain based alcohol to clean the eggs.

691
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:06,220
This is where the most nutrition comes when they're running, you know?

692
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:11,780
No. Okay, look. So what about some of the breakfast is like a little bit not, right?

693
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:15,970
I don't know. Boiled, scrambled with scramble.

694
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:20,389
Make sure the vegetable is cooked properly. Okay. I still have the cookies.

695
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:23,420
Do not admit with patriots eggs.

696
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:27,000
Let the. Yeah. Let's keep it. There's more.

697
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:30,480
Okay. Kicked out of the room. So let's get this thing moving.

698
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:35,780
Every dent, every spot on the bananas, their passengers.

699
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:42,750
No. So choose things that you can peel the outside and a nuts has to be roasted and to throw it.

700
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:48,420
And these kind of seasonings you have to cook it usually put the at lest it's not good enough.

701
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:52,090
Water has to be boiled. Maybe ultraviolet lights go ahead.

702
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:59,790
Right. So you're essentially just trying to limit exposure time to like dangerous microbes.

703
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:06,240
Limiting and avoiding cross-contamination and avoiding the necessary foods that she just explained.

704
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:13,720
So controlling and limiting those exposures to the food, we want to make sure that we are practicing proper food safety,

705
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:23,090
describing a hot meal that sits for more than an hour to avoid that danger zone, we want to label and discard foods leftovers after 24 hours.

706
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:27,120
Want to make sure that our patients aren't eating someone else's food, which is important.

707
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:33,510
Like she mentioned with like the alcohol, with like if you're opening a can of peanuts,

708
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:37,800
for example, you don't want any type of cross-contamination of the lid to the food.

709
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:43,290
And we don't want to open containers for patients because that could cross contaminate.

710
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:49,650
And another element that we read about was avoiding herbal and micronutrient supplements because there could be food,

711
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:52,410
drug interactions with chemotherapy and radiation.

712
01:22:53,490 --> 01:23:01,380
Anika had mentioned prior that there could be some type of deficiency for B-12 or folic acid or copper.

713
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:08,250
It's important to have any type of supplementation approved by a doctor because of those food drug interactions.

714
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:15,209
And instead of having a supplement, we could recommend foods that she had also talked about proteins.

715
01:23:15,210 --> 01:23:20,670
You can have a thoroughly cooked B12, fortified pastas, dairy has B12, folic acid.

716
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:26,070
We have oranges that could be peeled and for copper we talked about a roast, not for my can.

717
01:23:26,370 --> 01:23:31,590
Like avoiding the raw. You have to have it roasted from a can or in some type of vacuum sealed package.

718
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:38,999
These are eye references. So any questions for this group?

719
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:50,460
That was wonderful. There you go. I'll put my screen for these patients in the hospital like they can't go down to the cafeteria like a buffet.

720
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:53,700
That good stuff that's been sitting out, people have been touched.

721
01:23:55,170 --> 01:23:57,620
Great job, guys. I find.
