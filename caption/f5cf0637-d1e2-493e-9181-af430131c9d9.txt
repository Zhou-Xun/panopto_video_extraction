1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,089
Girls and boys it. Now you give me an example.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:12,969
You should have had a bigger and better place to introduce our guest.

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:19,650
The speaker for the next session is my colleague, Dr. Emily Martin.

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:27,720
And I'm sure many of you, if you haven't been in university music for a couple of years,

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:36,510
you've probably heard the first talk show appearance of a lot of the covers.

6
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:45,450
And Martin is the associate professor emeritus here of the epidemiology department,

7
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:55,110
and she received her Ph.D. and MPH epidemiologist from the University of Washington School of

8
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:01,890
Public Health and Graduate Science degree in Microbiology from the University of Michigan.

9
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:13,170
So I used that company for her postdoctoral fellowship at Seattle Children's Research Institute,

10
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,340
followed by a tenure track faculty position of the One State University and the University of Michigan.

11
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:35,919
She's a former health policy Center for Health and the research transformation and the advance the course.

12
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,430
You know, Dr. Martin is a recipient.

13
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:49,500
What's important, you know, you have heard a lot about, you know, her work.

14
00:01:51,090 --> 00:02:00,810
How can the state of university to control COVID 19 and the future of this school?

15
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:16,140
Her contributions this year 2021, the President's Year Award for States and the National Leadership for Health Care Policy and the Innovation Impact.

16
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,650
For her role in the COVID 19 pandemic response.

17
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:32,850
She is also director of the Michigan Center for Respiratory Virus Research and Response.

18
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,570
She, of course, for our HIV student.

19
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,020
She's also the track, and she made a lot of contributions.

20
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,850
But I think of her talk about governance of it. And yeah, thank you very much.

21
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,320
And Jan was office neighbor. Yes.

22
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,590
Oh, okay. Is this working? Okay.

23
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,280
That is my second guest lecture for today. So let's look at that.

24
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,459
So instead of teaching something more didactic, actually,

25
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:16,110
I'm going to go through a research seminar that it's a presentation that sees Chris together.

26
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,960
A couple of different presentations that I've given recently,

27
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:25,710
and it's focused on flu vaccine with some implications for COVID vaccines and some implications for the coming.

28
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,790
Oh, there are a couple of people. Those of you in my biology class do not answer what big vaccine news happened this week.

29
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:47,040
There was a big announcement that the RSV vaccine has made it through phase three trials of maternal RSV vaccine.

30
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,500
I'm going to touch on that towards the end. I could talk about that vaccine for like 3 hours, so I'm not going to do that.

31
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,260
But through talking about some of the challenges that we've had in influenza vaccine effectiveness,

32
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:07,830
when to highlight some key issues around vaccine effectiveness and how we measure vaccines,

33
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:13,140
and then what happens when when we measure vaccines, they are performing the way we would like them to.

34
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:25,410
I'm also going to talk about the university outbreak last year too. Um, so this one, you know, the quote.

35
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,530
So it's tough to make predictions especially about the future. I think it's the defining quote of influenza issues.

36
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:38,640
So we are constantly in a position where we are having to make a vaccine to fight a virus that we don't know what it is yet.

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,560
We don't ever know what virus is circulating till we've already produced and distributed and started using the vaccine for fever for the flu vaccine.

38
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,960
Now, it is especially a challenge. So this is a picture of somebody doing eyes.

39
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:01,140
This is an official CDC picture from the process that we use to try to select which vaccine, which virus goes into the flu vaccine every year.

40
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:10,290
She's looking at each, which is an assay that measures how blood cells, how antibodies block the binding of blood cells to a flu virus.

41
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:17,490
And it helps us understand whether a flu vaccine matches the circulating the strain that we're testing against.

42
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:24,480
However, the blood cells that she's looking at in there either come from guinea pigs or turkeys, they are coming from humans.

43
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:30,750
Right. The way that we measure these vaccines in the laboratory for flu vaccine in terms of

44
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:37,260
an and like the antibody match are so far away from what is what we do in humans

45
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,959
that we're trying to take ferret transmission data and turkey blood cell react

46
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,790
reactions and trying to translate that to try to understand how we predict a flu.

47
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:59,150
Flu virus or flu vaccine is going to work in a given year. So it can get really complicated this time of year, end of September, beginning of October.

48
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,080
All of us that work in flu start getting all these phone calls from hospital leadership,

49
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,030
from reporters, various people that say how good is the flu vaccine this year?

50
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:15,900
Sometimes they've even had a sprung on me like I go to a meeting and on the agenda will be like expectations for a flu vaccine.

51
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,450
I mean, I can't tell you anything else, so I appreciate this.

52
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:28,019
This is unfortunate. The flu season is here, but how effective is the 2018 shot and the paragraph?

53
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:34,710
The. The short answer is no one really knows. We don't know until we know how the vaccine is working at any given time.

54
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,510
So I'm going to talk a bit about what that process looks like,

55
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:44,250
but I'm also going to talk a bit about what some of the key problems that we're struggling with right now are.

56
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,280
So yearly vaccine selection looks like this. You have global surveillance.

57
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:57,450
One of the most concentrated areas of surveillance in the globe and especially in the United States is here in southeast Michigan.

58
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:05,790
We have the most different levels of feeds into the global surveillance system as more than anywhere else in the country.

59
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:11,100
So this is a very Michigan Michigan relevant vaccine every year.

60
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:18,900
We actually and we actually have contributed. A few years ago, there was a vaccine strain of a michigan that was asking for us.

61
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:29,120
We actually contributed. So you take the strains, there's genetic analysis of what's circulating around the globe.

62
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:36,170
And then there are also these HPI assays where you see if you inject those strains into ferrets, what kind of antibodies are elicited?

63
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,910
And do those antibodies have the characteristics that would make for a good vaccine target?

64
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:50,359
That information gets forwarded to the W.H.O. The W.H.O. has a strange selection panel that they meet and discuss the data and figure out

65
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,820
what the best the best representative strain would be to go forward for next year's vaccine.

66
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:05,720
That happens in March. Every year. That information goes to the FDA, to the VRBPAC, which ratifies the selection.

67
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:12,290
It actually goes to every country's ratifying body that every country has

68
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,370
something akin to the verb pack in the a.S.A.P that ratifies vaccine decisions.

69
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:23,820
Then it starts about a 3 to 6 month process where it gets grown in eggs, in rats and rocks like that.

70
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:31,100
Like then we sort of like reverse too many, many years ago, old technologies, like 1930s technology, right?

71
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,470
Then once we're done producing it eggs, we inject it into the arms of very happy children like this gentleman right there.

72
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:46,190
And the whole process starts over again by waiting to see who has vaccine failures,

73
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:51,500
who has successful protection, what antibodies look what the antibody levels look like in the population.

74
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,879
And then we kind of start over again trying to get enough data for the following march.

75
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,260
And strange selection has to happen.

76
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:07,850
It always cracks me up that the March Madness selection for basketball teams usually happens about the same week as a strange selection meeting.

77
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,809
And so everybody's like, Oh, did you watch? Did you watch the selection show yesterday?

78
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,190
And I was like, Oh yeah, it was webcast. And ever believe that they would select a Darwin this year?

79
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,510
And they're like, That's not what I meant. We meant basketball team.

80
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:25,160
So my husband and I have very different viewing habits. In March of every year because you can watch the streams.

81
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:32,990
All right. So here are just some of the survey I'm going to present.

82
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:39,620
When I present data to you, I'm drawing on data from a number of different surveillance networks that we run out of this for public health.

83
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,139
One is haven an I.D. so kind of superimposed behind Michigan.

84
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:56,540
I've got sort of the iceberg concept of infectious diseases haven in Ivy Poll's data for enrolls people that are hospitalized US Food Network.

85
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:08,330
This is the network that once a year you get this news report that says the flu vaccine is reported to be 40% effective this year around February.

86
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:17,670
That network is the one that calculates the number. It's us and now seven other locations around the country that do that work.

87
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:23,940
And that's an outpatient business. And then the bottom is perspective tracking of communities.

88
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,390
So we do households and we do childcare and all sorts of settings.

89
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:36,900
Most of the data that I've seen, I think all of the data I'm going to present to you today takes advantage of what's called the test negative design.

90
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:45,240
This was a very nice concept until COVID started, like making it making Twitter debates out of test negative design.

91
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:52,590
But this is the most commonly used observational design for estimating real world vaccine effectiveness.

92
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,280
It is an adaptation of a case control design.

93
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,780
Does anybody really want to posit why we would go with the case control?

94
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,440
We prioritize the case control, design and real world effectiveness.

95
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:15,440
I mean, I would guess that you really don't want to give a placebo vaccine to someone who is trying to avoid flu.

96
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:22,600
So there. Well, there are randomized controlled trials going on and human challenge studies.

97
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:29,990
So we even have trials going not only here, but places the trials going on where they are randomized and injecting them with virus.

98
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:35,179
But that's another lecture, but for an observational perspective.

99
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,820
So remember for observation. So yes, you're right.

100
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,900
You can't do big effectiveness monitoring in a randomized trial for a vaccine that's under a public health recommendation.

101
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:53,750
But from an observational perspective, remember, you use case control when you have an event that's rare.

102
00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:01,249
And although flu and COVID aren't rare per se, you have a limited amount of time to be able to get the information that you need.

103
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:06,730
So it means that your outcome density, you need a lot of outcomes in a short amount of time, so it's more efficient.

104
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:15,650
You get an answer faster by doing the case control, but instead of a traditional case control you're selecting, everybody is sick in the study.

105
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:24,320
Everybody is presenting meeting a common case definition in the ambulatory setting that's cough in in a hospital setting.

106
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:35,920
It's a it's a broader clinical syndrome. I just had a battery that's on a continuous here.

107
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:42,390
I'm going to. Okay.

108
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,670
So so so the.

109
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:54,180
So, yes, in the hospital setting, we look for people that have acute respiratory clinical syndrome.

110
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:00,960
This is in the U.S. and in most of these studies that do this well, this is done by active surveillance.

111
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,200
So you're going out and you're finding people who are sick.

112
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,930
You're seeing if they meet the case definition and then you're doing a test and getting the vaccine information, you're doing this.

113
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,729
Whether or not the clinician has decided to test that and this is a really important thing.

114
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,990
There's a big move in the U.S. and there's a lot of data from the U.K. and from Israel especially,

115
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:25,080
but other countries that are publishing very early vaccine effectiveness estimates in the literature.

116
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,630
But they're done not using active surveillance.

117
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:34,140
So they're basically done by saying who showed up to the doctor and asked for testing and using that data.

118
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,940
Do we think the vaccine is effective? And you can imagine all the different levels of bias, right?

119
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,969
There's access to care issues. There's health care seeking patterns.

120
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,060
How is that correlated with the likelihood somebody is vaccinated?

121
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,040
That gets to be a really kind of messy proposition when you get it.

122
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:54,510
Do we get into that? And so the gold standard for doing this is active surveillance.

123
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:59,130
So you could have somebody collecting a swab whether or not the clinician wants to test them.

124
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:09,450
So these slides get our PCR testing and then your cases are the ones that are positive for a virus and your controls are the ones that are negative.

125
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:14,940
So they're sick, but they're negative for the virus of interest. This is becoming problematic and I'll talk about that at the end of the lecture.

126
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,090
But remember that everybody is sick, just some some are sick with flu.

127
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,410
Some are sick with something else.

128
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:31,590
This study design, in order to be valid, in order to get a valid odds ratio that can be transferred into a vaccine effectiveness percentage,

129
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:41,160
you have to assume that all viruses that are causing a similar syndrome are causing similar levels of clinical severity.

130
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:46,590
So you basically have to assume that if I, as a frequent vaccinator get the flu,

131
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:55,350
I am just as likely to go to the doctor as if I get RSV or if I get influenza virus or any others, whoever I am.

132
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:00,120
And so that the type of virus you infected with doesn't change your health care seeking behavior.

133
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,620
This is actually, you know, we've learned a lot about severity of viruses and how that shifts and changes.

134
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:12,659
So it's kind of an old it's an assumption that's based on an older understanding of virus, viral infectious diseases.

135
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,840
That is becoming tricky study design.

136
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:21,660
But we did on campus. Yes, yeah.

137
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,890
I'll show you the data from that. And by the CDC, you mean.

138
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,090
Yes, yeah. I'll show you the data in this again.

139
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,090
So the the vaccine.

140
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,920
So what does vaccine effect actually mean?

141
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:43,829
This is a really so one of the problems with vaccine effectiveness studies is it results in a number that everybody

142
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:48,720
is familiar with and nobody actually understands what that number means except for like for people in that one.

143
00:15:49,110 --> 00:16:01,430
So the vaccine effectiveness means that it's because it's it comes from it's comes from an odds ratio and then there's a reduction in odds.

144
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,910
It gets translated in this. And what it's actually telling you is what is the percentage of illness that should have occurred but didn't?

145
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:21,299
So if you have something that is 95% vaccine effectiveness in the like the all the way to the side over here in this block right here,

146
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:30,870
over to the left, these are all of the people that are vaccinated but would have gotten infected in the hypothetical situation.

147
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,239
But because the vaccine, because they were all vaccinated,

148
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,020
the blue people did not get infected in the Green Party, only the green people got infected.

149
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:43,169
So as you lower the vaccine effectiveness, if you go over to the right, that 60% graph,

150
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:48,299
60% doesn't sound very exciting, but you actually have over half of that.

151
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,620
You've averted over half of the infections that you otherwise would have had it.

152
00:16:54,150 --> 00:17:01,350
So sometimes the vaccine effect will push all the way down to like 30% and then everybody's like 30%.

153
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,829
That's not even as good as random chance. That's not what that means.

154
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:10,200
30% means there was a 30% reduction in the expected amount of hospitalizations or illness.

155
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:18,060
If you think about some chronic disease meds, right, statins reduce your risk of heart disease by less than 50%.

156
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:30,150
So you've got you know, you've got to remember that it is a it is an averted percent and not like the risk of gaining gaining the protection.

157
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,129
So seasonal flu vaccine effectiveness has varied widely.

158
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:43,160
So these are the results from many years of the vaccine effectiveness network now varies widely from year to year.

159
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,980
We have some years where there was a complete mess like 20 1415 this past year was a complete mess.

160
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,000
But then we have years where we get off into the forties or the fifties.

161
00:17:53,780 --> 00:18:00,410
I will show you data on this, but this largely has started to reflect the subtypes of influenza that are circulating.

162
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,220
We have H1N1. It's a lot easier to do a match.

163
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,530
That virus evolves a lot slower.

164
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:15,590
If we have H3N2, then that virus evolves a lot faster and the match is much more difficult to predict six months in advance.

165
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,349
So I'm going to put more of a finer point on this idea of a burden.

166
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:35,870
Burden so averted burden is is kind of taking this concept of vaccine effectiveness and communicating it in terms of what was what was avoided.

167
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:41,750
So the 2019, 2020 season two season leading right up to the pandemic.

168
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,450
Fun fact going up January, February, March of 2020,

169
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:54,980
we were having a screaming high influenza season and we were also having an incredibly severe RSV season at the same time.

170
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,850
Both of them stopped when all of the economic restrictions and the mitigation efforts went into place.

171
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:06,530
But I don't know if you're like me. I have a lot of family members, including my parents,

172
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:13,340
who keep telling me about the COVID that they had in in December of 2019 and they had either flu or RSV.

173
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,520
I mean, there was just so much respiratory illness that was going on.

174
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,390
We've actually gone back and tested all of the specimens that we had,

175
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,130
thousands of specimens in the freezer from December, January, February and early March.

176
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:31,380
And we didn't start seeing COVID in the U of M surveillance until the second week of March.

177
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:38,060
Just like just like the hospitals. So just a fun fact to take with you into the Twitter debates of the world.

178
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:50,180
So the dome, the 20, 19, 2020 season prior to the pandemic starting the Justin V against influenza caused hospitalization was 41%.

179
00:19:50,870 --> 00:20:00,379
The adjusted against medically attended acute respiratory illness was 39% 45% against v Victoria,

180
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:08,510
30% against H1N1, but 7% against this category of drifted H1N1.

181
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:18,650
Think it's akin to a variant of COVID sort of emergent clade that came halfway through the season that actually made up the most most of infections.

182
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:26,960
So even with kind of a sketchy vaccine effectiveness list of numbers that year, if you look to see what was averted,

183
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:35,720
we are likely the use of the vaccine averted more flu illnesses than the combined population of Kentucky and Kansas.

184
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:41,930
More flu have hospitalizations than would fit in the big house.

185
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:51,800
Also, like I suggested, this, this one. So I feel really proud of this being on the infographic and then six over 6000 fewer deaths.

186
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:59,060
So even with a really moderately performing flu vaccine, because flu is common enough and it causes such a large number of deaths every year,

187
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:04,660
reducing that by any percentage and of having a big impact. So all right.

188
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:10,350
Now that you have sort of a general understanding of how we do these studies and how we interpret the numbers,

189
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:19,050
I'm going to walk through some of the major some of the major issues that we've got with the flu vaccine and with affective disorder during right now.

190
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:28,400
So one big issue. First, I'm going to talk about egg adaptations and how that impacted vaccine effectiveness in the last couple of years.

191
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,260
Egg adaptations and the production process of the flu vaccine.

192
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,540
I'm going to talk about challenges with circulation of multiple influenza strains at the

193
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:42,719
same time and then going to talk about data and whether or not this thing that you hear,

194
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,500
well, if you get vaccinated, even if infected, it will change severity.

195
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:52,680
Some of the flu data about that. So starting to talk first about egg adaptations.

196
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:58,170
So this is what the 2017, 2018 season looked like.

197
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,110
It was sort of this double bump in this season.

198
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:07,430
It's actually two different overlaid, kind of two different types of strains that were circulating.

199
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,040
Actually, this flu you use is updated weekly.

200
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,299
You can find it on the CDC's website. If you search flu, you can check this all the time.

201
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,870
It's very fun to watch the red triangles go everywhere.

202
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:27,540
I do like to point out for students that this like green line here, the 1112 line right here, where like nothing happened with flu at all.

203
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,740
That was the year of the first influenza grant that I ever got. Nothing happened.

204
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,049
It was very embarrassing. I had to write a letter to be like I was not able to do the study.

205
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:46,530
Thank you for the money, but there was no flu. And yeah, so it was a big burden year.

206
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:53,880
There were almost 50 million illnesses and there were 618 pediatric deaths that year.

207
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,930
Really huge hospitalization numbers. Lots of pressure on the hospital system.

208
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:08,900
This is also a year when vaccine use was down. So in 20 1718 there was a market decline in uptake of the vaccine.

209
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:18,110
And so there was some suspicion early on that perhaps all these hospitalizations were happening because of lower vaccine rates,

210
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:27,400
not because of lower vaccine effectiveness. When we looked at the data.

211
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:38,950
So these are separated by types of virus of types of the strain, different strains of influenza.

212
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:47,770
And if you look here in this segment here right at the top, the red piece of the pie is influenza H3N2.

213
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:54,140
And most of the circulating virus of that time was a strain that was called three two way.

214
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,149
And this was actually a category of strains that was included in the vaccine.

215
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:02,620
So the vaccine should have had pretty good vaccine effectiveness that year.

216
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:10,450
But if you actually do the test negative design analysis, so the genetics was telling us that it was a match.

217
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,290
The serology studies is telling us it should be fine.

218
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:22,059
But if you actually look to see what was happening around the country, the vaccine was not preventing H3N2 to any appreciable degree.

219
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:27,250
I mean, it was causing it at most probably a 20% reduction.

220
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:39,220
What was happening is there was a massive egg adaptation problem in the production process that year caused by this chicken that looks mean.

221
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:49,929
So as it is a quick kind of precursor for me, for me explaining that, I want to explain that it's it, you know,

222
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:56,049
the whether or not a vaccine strain is going to protect a virus that's picked for

223
00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:00,730
the vaccine is can be injected into the body and prompted immune response that will

224
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,110
recognize future versions of that virus as more to do with just the sequence of the

225
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:12,610
virus and the protein antigenic proteins of the egg like protrusions from the virus.

226
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:23,470
It actually has a lot to do with these glycans, which are these sticky sugars that stick to the outside of the the the the protein that antigens.

227
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:31,090
And depending on very, very minor genetic changes, these glycans will move to different spots.

228
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:36,850
And what the glycans do is they basically block your body's ability to recognize the antigen.

229
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:45,220
And if the antigen it's blocking is the antigen that the vaccine originally trained your body to recognize and it puts a glycan on top,

230
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,510
it's like your body feels like it's never seen that virus before, right?

231
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,700
Your body's going to react like there's no memory response.

232
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:59,230
It's sort of like my daughters have like this hat and then these sunglasses with a little mustache attached to them.

233
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,860
It's sort of like the virus puts on a disguise, and I have no idea who you are anymore.

234
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:08,050
So what happens during the egg production process?

235
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:14,050
Is that for the vaccines specifically that were produced in eggs,

236
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:22,930
the glycan structure of those those proteins ended up being different than what was the naturally circulating virus.

237
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,780
And so when we look at this is a study we did of people that were hospitalized with flu.

238
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:36,950
And when we and here in the red are these very minor changes that happened during the egg period,

239
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:42,190
the product, the production process that ended up changing how the glycans sat on top of that protein.

240
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:50,740
And so when we looked at people that were admitted to the hospital with severe respiratory disease and we looked at people that were vaccinated,

241
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,470
they early in their right,

242
00:26:53,500 --> 00:27:00,219
even before they were mounting a de novo response to the infection at baseline we were seeing they vaccinated people were already

243
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:08,890
carrying around this fairly high titer 160 is pretty high a high titer of antibodies to the egg version of the Hong Kong strain.

244
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,970
But then you look at and that's sorry, I keep forgetting you can't see this era.

245
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,810
So that's this this triangle right up here.

246
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:26,590
Now, if you look at the exact same virus but grown in cells instead of grown in eggs, that's this triangle right here on the bottom.

247
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:34,090
So their antibodies were not recognizing the cell version of the virus, but they were recognizing the egg version of the virus.

248
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:38,739
Right. By administering the vaccine. The unvaccinated people are pretty flat.

249
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,879
The open triangles, the vaccinated people, by administrative administering the vaccine,

250
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:50,320
we basically gave people that had people mount a very protective response to the egg grown virus only.

251
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:57,670
So we were very protected against an attack by eggs, but not so much the naturally circulating version of the virus.

252
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,350
Now you don't I.

253
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,950
I marked on here the place that this is happening.

254
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,219
That small change site is what's called antigenic site B.

255
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:14,500
This has been a particularly difficult part of the protein for us to plan vaccines around this.

256
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,720
This antigen is, say, B is going to rear its head again later in the presentation.

257
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:25,660
So remember that so 20 1718 was also notable because it was one of the first years where

258
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:31,600
we started to see distribution of a vaccine that was produced in cells and that in eggs.

259
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,630
It was a very new vaccine at the time. There wasn't a ton of people that had been receiving it that year had been ramping up.

260
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:46,450
So the results of this analysis are really wide confidence intervals, very strong, very small numbers.

261
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:51,910
But you can see if you look for H3N2, which is the problematic strain of influenza,

262
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:59,050
and we look at people vaccinated with a cell produced vaccines, we saw that versus an egg produced vaccine.

263
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:06,460
We follow it to the adjusted vaccine effectiveness. What we found is people that were vaccinated with a cell based vaccine,

264
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:13,480
their vaccine effectiveness was almost twice as high as the people that were vaccinated with an egg based vaccine.

265
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:22,780
So in these years where you have eggs, specific glycan changes in the proteins, the cell based vaccines end up performing better.

266
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:28,510
Now, do we know in any given year ahead of time when it's vaccine season like, oh,

267
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:32,500
this year it's going to be a year when the glycan structure is going to matter? No, don't know it ahead of time.

268
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:40,500
But in years where that is true, the cell base does better. Maybe later you can wear to court off.

269
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,620
You can ask me what vaccine I get so.

270
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:50,260
All right. So we've ah, so we've learned we learned that year very clearly that adaptations can reduce

271
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,770
influenza vaccine effectiveness through changes in the glycosylation sites.

272
00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:01,600
And we were feeling pretty good about understanding how vaccine effectiveness work was working.

273
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:08,709
Now we have to account for Glycans and the big focus around as we moved into 2018, 2018,

274
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:15,040
scientifically was this idea of let's get better at predicting the strain of influenza that's coming.

275
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:22,420
This flu forecasting idea, people were making these fancy like three dimensional models to try to understand where genetics was traveling.

276
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:29,110
If we could just predict what's coming, then we can start to design vaccines in anticipation a little bit better.

277
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,870
And because of the time in 2018 19,

278
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:41,980
we were operating on the assumption that most of the time we have one predominant virus that circulates in any given season.

279
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:48,879
So then 2018, it happened so early in 2018, 18.

280
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:56,740
By February 2nd, we finally have enough data to draft outcomes to be able to do a test negative design analysis nationally.

281
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:04,690
And we published the influenza vaccine effectiveness that we thought was going to be that year.

282
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:08,800
So I just wanted you to kind of take a look at the sample size for this.

283
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:15,760
So we published by February 2nd, we published when we got to 465 positive cases.

284
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:19,960
We met our sample size requirements to be able to do our analysis.

285
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:26,980
And in Michigan, all of the surveillance we do in Michigan, there was only 76 of those came from Michigan.

286
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:32,790
Right. So these are not huge these are huge studies, but they're actually don't have a very high event rate.

287
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,409
So we had 3000, just over 3000 total patients, but only four in 65 influenza patients.

288
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:42,850
So remember that number for later when we do the test negative design analysis,

289
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:53,799
we found that overall combining influenza A and B, we had a 47% vaccine effectiveness.

290
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,080
That's the top line result right here.

291
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:07,930
And if you look at down further in the table to the sub strains, H3N2, H1N1, you've got 44% for H3N2 and 46% for H1N1.

292
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,879
This felt like a win. Right.

293
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:21,610
We've got finally got a vaccine this year that seems to be preventing H3N2, the difficult virus in H1N1, the easier virus at kind of similar rates.

294
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,070
So that report was published for the New Year.

295
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,240
It's about it. So these are nmw r rates which came up from new.

296
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:39,720
So about right here, we cut the data, we get very excited and we publish the report.

297
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:45,630
Look what happens after that point. We're like waiting for influenza season.

298
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,260
So the orange influenza season was supposed to end and then we were going to be done, right?

299
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,190
There's a second influenza season that started a second claim.

300
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:59,550
So the red influenza season then takes off, switch it to influenza season superimposed on top of each other.

301
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:06,330
One in this red one I'm going to show you. And the second, this red one right here, the vaccine didn't match.

302
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,410
So for the first half of the first and fourth season we had the vaccine did fine.

303
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:22,110
And then it then we had a drifted inflate. So if you look at so when we published the second paper where we said okay, different number.

304
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:27,239
Now this is the data that got published in the interim report and you see the

305
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,750
distribution of colors here going to show you which remember the orange virus is one,

306
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:41,040
the one that the vaccine worked against. The red virus is the one that the vaccine didn't you see this late shift towards this this red virus?

307
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:49,440
So this is really the first season that we saw this. We actually had two different strains with different vaccine profiles at the same time.

308
00:33:51,090 --> 00:34:02,310
So when we redid the study and calculated the test negative design, again, the H1N1 was similar to before 44% with all the new data,

309
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:08,000
but the H3N2 production dropped basically to now all the way down to 5% and.

310
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:17,350
So I don't know if anybody watches next string next to make people know about extra.

311
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:24,309
Now they didn't need to know about next train so that stream before COVID next train tracks flu viruses and you can

312
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:30,460
actually track real time throughout the year what's happening with various flu viruses and where the vaccines are.

313
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:38,740
The axes are where the vaccines fall in the phylogeny. So this is where the 2018, 2019 vaccine was strain wise.

314
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:42,790
This is where the spring circulating strain was.

315
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:51,340
And so for 2019, 2020, going into that season, the vaccine selection committee moved the vaccine strain down to match that.

316
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:56,350
So we're sort of chasing the virus on these like six month intervals.

317
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:10,909
So what did we learn in that year? We learned that that multiple influenza strains can happen in a single season and strains of a specific B can vary.

318
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:15,350
And you can have you actually have to be paying attention to strain specific vaccine effectiveness.

319
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:23,190
Right. Third kind of key question that we've been going after nationally.

320
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,990
Is this question about whether or not vaccination changes severity.

321
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:36,770
So looking at I'm going to start with this question.

322
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:43,129
Looking at the 2014, 2015 data, this is a year it was a bad year for the influenza vaccine.

323
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:47,510
It was like a complete mess in terms of match.

324
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:53,570
Here we've got all of our U.S. TV network data over that whole big period.

325
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:59,810
NBC for H3N2, it was pretty, pretty a pretty poor match.

326
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:09,180
And the reason for that is because here we've got the vaccine down the side of the genetic tree.

327
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:13,110
And up here, these were all the viruses that were circulating up on the very top.

328
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:23,819
But oddly, when we did our analysis against protection against hospitalization.

329
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,830
So those numbers were does the vaccine protect against medically attended respiratory illness?

330
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:34,379
So does that reduce doctor's visits? But when we look to see if there's reduction of hospitalization,

331
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:39,209
there was but there was not in that reduction doctor visits but reduction in hospitalization.

332
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:48,870
So a reduction against the most severe disease. So we were seeing a, um, adjusted figure overall of about 43%, 33% reduction of hospitalization.

333
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:58,290
He's not here anymore, but I'm still going to use the site. So previous faculty member that's now moved to another institution, Josh Petri,

334
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:07,560
famously wrote that paper and then gave an interview where his takeaway, quote for the reporter was last season's flu vaccine, not entirely worthless.

335
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:20,490
And so media training is a real thing. So it was really at the time this was a really controversial concept.

336
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,269
And it's funny to talk about it now because I think people are very comfortable with this idea

337
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:31,079
now because the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has this profile and it is is like it is very strong.

338
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:39,060
It's a smoking gun. When you look at how the vaccine works in prevention of death or ICU admission or ventilator usage,

339
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:43,800
the protection is much, much stronger than protection against milder illness.

340
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,469
At the time, though, that was that was a very controversial concept.

341
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,890
Everybody was like, are you sure? Maybe you did the numbers wrong.

342
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,700
Is there something, you know, CDC almost didn't approve the paper to go out because they were like, it seems weird that it would be this strong.

343
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:04,320
So it's interesting to see the effects, the differences of the effect when you look at SARS-CoV-2 is even more striking than it is with flu.

344
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:15,479
What we actually did is we ended up doing a season analysis over multiple seasons later, and in 20 1516,

345
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,010
we actually had the vaccine effectiveness levels in the in the vaccine to be able to do this.

346
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:27,450
While we looked at other locations around the country that monitor hospitals and monitor outpatient clinics like we do.

347
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:33,300
And the if you just take the data from those locations,

348
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:47,220
there is like a 27 to 31% or 31 points increase in vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization compared to protecting against outpatient visits.

349
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:57,660
So giving data to the fact that vaccination against a poorly matched strain may still protect against severe disease.

350
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,000
All right. So this brings me to.

351
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:15,600
2021 to 2022, which is what I like to call the year after the year with no flare.

352
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:22,459
So this is you know, we had had a year where influenza and RSV circulation was completely gone and it

353
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:29,420
had started to come out towards the end of the year in 2021 to 2022 right here.

354
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:41,040
There was no remember this cyclical, cyclical policy system that I described where you need the surveillance to pick the vaccine,

355
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:48,269
to make the vaccine to prevent the illness, and then you do more surveillance and you go around like this because we had a year with no flu.

356
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:51,480
So now we've added another like flat line.

357
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,530
Let's see, it's it's the pink line on here. Right?

358
00:39:55,530 --> 00:40:03,270
So no flu going on here at all. We actually had very little data to go on when it was time to pick pick the next flu vaccine, very little data.

359
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:14,490
So it means that there were massive strain selection challenges to try to figure out where to place the vaccine in that coming year for H3N2.

360
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:19,920
So everybody just sort of hoped that H3N2 wasn't going to circulate because it was kind of a black

361
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,440
box and trying to understand what the vaccines should try to predict for the following year.

362
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:32,309
Unfortunately, H3N2 circulated so many lessons that I can tell you about this,

363
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:37,830
and I will I can tell you more things about it after I get through the main part of the lecture.

364
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:47,820
This came about because I was on we have every other week phone calls with the CDC, just like for the vaccine effectiveness monitoring.

365
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:57,000
And every week we all report on how many how much flu is in our area because it helps us prioritize resources in terms of where surveillance happens.

366
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:02,710
And I had a call at noon where I said, yeah, that helps us.

367
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:09,330
Is that seeing a lot of flu? But oddly enough, there's like 100 cases of this due to the health service today.

368
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,880
And they were like, That's strange.

369
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:17,849
And then I got back on my 1230 meeting a half hour later and I said and it was like kind of a slightly different group of people,

370
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:22,229
but the same CDC officials and they said this health system isn't seeing a whole lot of flu.

371
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:26,250
But oddly enough, the Student Health Service has 250 cases now.

372
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,790
And they were like, I'm sorry, you just said it was 100.

373
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:33,270
I was like, Yeah, there's a lot more. And they're like, We're going to call you back.

374
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:38,670
Yeah. What is this, 528 cases that, like, confirmed one kind of positive.

375
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,840
At the end of the day, it was 735 cases or something like that.

376
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:47,310
It was over 700 cases. Yes. Laboratory confirmed.

377
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,990
Like there were probably a lot more of us. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

378
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:57,660
Now, remember the number that I showed you when I showed you our interim estimate the week

379
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:02,040
it made it to 400 flu cases and said we were going to publish national level data.

380
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:08,550
Right. So now I'm here in, like small town Michigan with like, you know,

381
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:16,500
100 getting like 100 more cases every time I update the CDC or not even UHC was I have a really close relationship with UHC.

382
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:22,919
We were in touch and we thought this was an opportunity to get in early because.

383
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,719
Right. Nobody knew what was going to circulate.

384
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,780
We had kind of we but the powers that be it kind of done strange section out of the blue but wouldn't it

385
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:36,360
be a great opportunity for CDC to come out here and we're going to do an early test negative analysis,

386
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:44,849
figure out how well the vaccine is working, and then we can use that to say, great, the vaccine is 50% effective or 60% effective.

387
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:51,390
Everybody go get vaccinated because it might be a bad flu season. So with The New York Times, you view it that way.

388
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:56,670
So that that was that was a sticky situation I got myself in.

389
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:04,799
But so this this was like a really amazing like we pulled this off in a matter it probably about 48 hours.

390
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:12,780
So they got here in like four days. The team from CDC that we usually work with came UHC and all of the like health sectors

391
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:18,510
at U of M like gathered all their resources to be able to approve this study on our end.

392
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:22,470
And we, you know, warned all the leadership that it was going to happen.

393
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,700
And we pulled off a whole the study in the matter of like two weeks.

394
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:34,420
So here's the AP curve right here. We enrolled a ton of people.

395
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:38,979
We did all of these extra swabs. We got blood samples. There were like hundreds of students.

396
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,550
They gave us blood samples at the university, a health service while they have the flu.

397
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:45,760
They were like, amazing. You're really sure we didn't even have any money to pay them?

398
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:50,920
You know, my blood was fantastic. The CDC laughed, and they were like, You have the best students.

399
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:56,020
They were just they were really excited about it. So they went back to analyze the data.

400
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,120
They called me at like 10:00 on a Wednesday night and said, we have some bad news.

401
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:09,760
They analyzed the data and the percentage of people positive for influenza in the vaccinated

402
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,000
group was they are sorry flip it around because the case control the percentage of

403
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,139
vaccinated people in the influenza positive group is exactly the same 27% as the percentage

404
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:29,020
of people that were positive or that were vaccinated in the influenza negative group.

405
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,580
And it's like exactly the same fraction, like it reduces down to the same fraction.

406
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:42,580
We had three different groups independently analyze this data and it is it is like it is zero and it could not be more zero.

407
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:48,669
I had a I got some fan mail from somebody who accused me of doing the math wrong because this couldn't possibly happen.

408
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:52,750
And I was like, No, we literally counted all the cases. Like, it really is the result.

409
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:58,750
So, so, okay, so that that doesn't look good.

410
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:05,380
Why is this happening? Is it because it's a congregate setting? Most of these students were residence hall students and there are other reasons.

411
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:13,209
So we took all of the swabs that we collected and we sequenced and we actually the lab at the medical school had a boring slide,

412
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:17,770
the sequence of them in a matter of days. So we had a sequence within days on the outbreak.

413
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:24,280
And here in the blue dots are the U of M sequences from the students.

414
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:32,140
And the vaccine is all the way down here, this red dot, that's how far away that vaccine is.

415
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:38,950
There's actually some samples in here. University of Maryland was having an outbreak at the same time, so University of Maryland had the same.

416
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:47,170
But here is Cambodia all the way down here. Interestingly enough, what was here is closely matched to a Darwin.

417
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:52,780
This is what had just been picked for the Southern Hemisphere vaccine just a couple of weeks before our outbreak.

418
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,800
Everybody was like, What do we have to do to get our hands on that vaccine?

419
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:02,829
But with the production process the way it is, it wasn't going to be available for another six months.

420
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:04,090
It's in the vaccine now.

421
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:12,070
So if you were to go to a vaccine vaccinated, now you're going to receive a Darwin and that is the strain that was in last year's outbreak.

422
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:22,990
So genetically it makes sense that there was a big direct now genetic distance trying to translate genetic distance to how well an antibody matches.

423
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,370
Protection is really difficult to do and it's hard to predict.

424
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:33,670
So what the next step was, as we look to see the structure of the protein and we looked to look at the blood samples

425
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:38,710
to sort of see what the what the evidence was from actual antibodies in people's blood.

426
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:50,230
And when you look at the structure where those genetic changes are, we actually have the same problem that we saw in the 1718 year.

427
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,310
That same site, the antigenic c.p had a glycosylation change.

428
00:46:54,460 --> 00:47:04,630
So the difference between in Cambodia and Darwin is that when you put these two viruses into the into egg production system,

429
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:14,440
the there's a glycosylation shift. And so there was a sticky sugar that changed the antigen, a city of the the protein in the Cambodia vaccine.

430
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:29,799
So as an adaptation problem. So that actually egg annotation problem had been seen in some of the laboratory studies and had

431
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,030
been kind of carried forward to anticipate what to do with the Southern Hemisphere vaccine.

432
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:36,550
But obviously that was going to be too late for what we needed.

433
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:50,500
So the serology data that came from that, so 111 students really gave gave blood for the serology study with with flu like symptoms.

434
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:57,490
Very impressive. And a and a doctoral student of mine collected all of the she's also a trained

435
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:00,880
phlebotomist but collected all of the blood from all the people with flu like symptoms.

436
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:08,710
PRESS Now, she works for the CDC. That's president. So we look at blood.

437
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:14,020
This is not the this is the first preliminary run of the serology data.

438
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:20,529
But all the way to the left, this is the antibody,

439
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:29,080
the quantities of the antibodies that recognize the Cambodia grown version of the Cambodia strain right here.

440
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,790
So the the egg based version of the vaccine strain here, the second panel,

441
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:40,750
those are the one piece of antibodies that recognize an egg based version of the vaccine strain.

442
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,560
So because you see a difference here between the first panel and the second panel,

443
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,350
this is basically telling you that people that received the vaccine are actually having

444
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,690
a decreased recognition to the Wildtype virus circulating virus compared to the virus.

445
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:04,630
But they are having almost no antibodies whatsoever to what was actually in the community, which was the diamond virus.

446
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,470
So this is the virus that we found in the in the phylogenetic analysis.

447
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,840
We checked to see if antibodies in the blood could recognize that virus among people that were vaccinated in the community,

448
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:18,700
we didn't see any recognition. If it was working, this bar would have been higher.

449
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:31,120
Right here is what we wanted to see and we were not seen. So, yes, so the serology data, the phylogenetic j data,

450
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:36,339
all the other data matched the fact that and also I just literally had the

451
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,930
same number of people infected between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.

452
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,820
I mean, just by numbers, it was not effective.

453
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:52,329
We're still working on this analysis because there is some feeling in the flu field that maybe there was just a lot of bias.

454
00:49:52,330 --> 00:50:01,210
And I was like, no, literally we had 700 people. We had a fairly well vaccinated, you know, 30% flu vaccine is not a terrible number.

455
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,060
And to have no effect of the vaccine is not good.

456
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:13,300
So because you stayed late of late or stayed awake until this late point on a Friday, the lecture also tell you where the outbreak came from.

457
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:17,730
So the CDC did okay.

458
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,570
Well, we're recording it, but just for your class.

459
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:25,270
So the CDC we have who publishes at the CDC did interviews, interviews for the first couple of weeks of cases,

460
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:29,780
including the very first case they interviewed, the very first case you and about.

461
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:38,530
After they finished the first ten interviews, they we had our regular daily situation meeting and they were like, so something keeps coming up.

462
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:43,030
That's kind of strange since you just had a fall break and really. Yeah, we just had to everybody kind of came back from fall break.

463
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,650
We were like, Have you ever heard of just college scars?

464
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:52,330
And I was like, No, tell me about it.

465
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:57,230
And there were there was a lot of attendance at just cut.

466
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:02,620
This is a common theme amongst the early phases of the outbreak was either people that went

467
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:08,080
to this trip or people that lived with or interacted with people that go to this trip.

468
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:12,399
And honestly, this trip was a bargain, $349 to go to Las Vegas.

469
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,410
Like I can imagine myself at a different point in my life going on this trip.

470
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,330
Like, I don't blame them, but like look at the pictures from it.

471
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:25,660
They're all like exchanging, right respiratory secretions, like all over the place in that picture.

472
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,320
So there we have it. Just college stock.

473
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:33,970
How we actually got the health department to put out a warning about just college dot com.

474
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,190
This happened in the health department world where we all like saw it and nobody else in the world.

475
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:43,540
So but it also like, you know, of course,

476
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:47,700
the next question that happened was all those sequences that got posted from University of Maryland or was like,

477
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:51,190
is the University of Maryland there, you know, infect each other?

478
00:51:51,610 --> 00:52:02,860
It's like this Big Ten controversy. So we are now we're still analyzing actually, if there was an impact on severity of disease in that group,

479
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:10,030
there's actually a student working on that for her capstone project. So still looking at that data.

480
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,610
All right. So that is that is sort of wrapping up the early part of my presentation,

481
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:22,629
but before I and I wanted to say a few things to kind of connect the world of flu vaccine effectiveness to

482
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:29,230
what has what we've taken from that to be able to look at SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness and RSV vaccine.

483
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:34,799
So. It's interesting that what was originally, as I mentioned,

484
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:47,940
a very controversial concept is now a very common conversation that is even come to lay public understanding that vaccines may moderate meat.

485
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:54,570
Many vaccines operate through moderation of severity of disease, more so than through complete blocking of disease.

486
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:59,159
And that moderation of severity might mean taking somebody from symptomatic illness

487
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:03,270
to asymptomatic and might mean taking somebody from hospitalization to like,

488
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:07,350
Oh, my throat hurts today. I don't know why. And then they feel better on the day later.

489
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:14,220
But it's this vaccines move you along this scale. And instead of a complete sterilizing.

490
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:26,059
Immunity many times. And for these respiratory viruses, one thing that we had just begun to struggle with,

491
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:31,430
with the flu vaccine is this idea, this this idea of virus chasing.

492
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:36,229
So it's like, how often can we update the vaccine if the virus is changing?

493
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:40,490
Is one year often enough to do these updates? How do we best deal with that?

494
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:45,290
And then what do we do if we have multiple CO circulating clades at the same time?

495
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:49,730
So there started to be conversations with the oh, so fun fact.

496
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:57,770
There's four strains in the flu vaccine which you all probably know is H one, H three, B, Yamagata and B Victoria B Yamagata.

497
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:05,780
We actually haven't seen it for years. Nobody's cultured it like we've gotten some PCR detections, but nobody's been able to actually recover it.

498
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:09,860
It might be a PCR. In fact, there's been a handful of detections worldwide.

499
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:13,489
It may we may have accidentally eradicated it or totally.

500
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:20,840
We're not sure we're still looking into it. But especially in an era where one of these might have been accidentally eradicated,

501
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:29,479
should we actually put more h three strains into the flu vaccine to try to maximize our odds of getting it right,

502
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:38,690
basically, and boxing immune, but then a little bit more so you can see how this translates to this idea of variant booster updates for SARS-CoV-2.

503
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:44,150
To what degree and at what cadence should we be updating based on what we're seeing in surveillance,

504
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:48,440
where the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development is going is,

505
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:53,090
though, towards this idea that we shouldn't be like virus chasing has not been working for influenza.

506
00:54:53,630 --> 00:55:03,290
And so because the timing simply doesn't work, you can't find a virus and produce it and deploy it and get it into arms fast enough to actually do it.

507
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:09,019
And plus, if you've got this scenario where it's like we can't tell you what the vaccine schedule is, American public,

508
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:13,820
we're just going to tell you when there's a need for a booster and you've got to get it like that message is not playing well.

509
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:21,110
Right? So the strategy for SARS-CoV-2 and the strategy around the booster is starting to think

510
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:26,870
about covering as much antigenic space from a multi-dimensional perspective as possible.

511
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,700
So the reason they pick the four or five SARS-CoV-2 strain for the booster was not

512
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:36,890
because they thought that that's the variant that was always going to be around,

513
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:44,840
but because it had antigenic distance from the previous strain in a way that they we thought we could triangulate.

514
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:50,450
It would have it would it would basically train your immune system to start prompting the

515
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:55,189
development of a broader B cells by having something that had that much antigenic distance.

516
00:55:55,190 --> 00:56:00,260
And so this is the kind of vaccinology strategy that's going to start to come into play.

517
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:05,840
It's too early to see to to be seen whether that's going to translate to influenza in a meaningful way.

518
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:12,020
But for SARS-CoV-2, that's true. It's a threat strategy, not a this is the right vaccine.

519
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:17,000
Now, at the moment, it is the right mix in the Bivalent vaccine still matches what is circulating.

520
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:24,140
And so it's a good bet to get it. But should a new owner start to take over?

521
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:28,640
That's still the vaccine that's going to be used for a little while. They're not going to immediately start switch it out.

522
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,250
And this question of how old geography may actually have a side. I'll show you about how geography will matter.

523
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:47,640
So we've also translated from flu this idea of how infection, history and waning factors into vaccine schedules in our understanding.

524
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:52,530
So notice some countries the vaccine schedule is dependent on whether or not you got COVID before,

525
00:56:52,530 --> 00:57:00,000
and that was based on flu research that tried to look at infection vaccine history to try to predict how a vaccine will work.

526
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:11,650
So, Mary, I told you that protection against mild to moderate outcomes versus severe outcomes was way stronger with SARS-CoV-2.

527
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:16,620
So this is a study that we did with a network of we're one part of this big network of hospitals.

528
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:29,660
And if you look at severity of outcomes in unvaccinated, the adjusted odds ratio.

529
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:37,350
So basically, by the way, this journal, I think this was JAMA, they don't let you present vaccine effectiveness numbers as a percent percent.

530
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:42,870
You have to give the odds ratio. But basically you've got 70% protection here.

531
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:50,850
When you're looking at prevention of death and if you look at it at the same time period,

532
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:54,600
if you were to look at milder outcomes, you would see lesser protection.

533
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,530
But you see the strongest sector for protection the more severe the outcome is.

534
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:05,820
So for instance, looking at progression of death to r invasive mechanical ventilation, you get 70% protection.

535
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:12,330
You get lower protection when you're looking at, for instance, general hospitalization.

536
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:23,140
So. Second thing I wanted to share.

537
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:30,290
Third thing is the idea of how do we plan for vaccine updates in the future?

538
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:35,590
Like, are we going to continue planning for these iterative single variant updates in the future?

539
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:42,550
Or are we going to start to think about what do we do when we inevitably get to the situation where we have circulation of multiple variants?

540
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:48,940
Right. We're still in a situation where the whole country gets overrun by four or five at once.

541
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:56,290
What happens when half the country has a form being five and half the country has XP or whatever the new variant is?

542
00:58:56,290 --> 00:59:01,870
And it starts having that same geographic patterning that I was showing you in the flu, the flu data.

543
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,910
I mean, you already seeing some of this kind of come to fruition.

544
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:10,810
So this is the current CDC language. The current.

545
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:14,570
So to be up to date. Are you up to date with the CDC?

546
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:21,160
Right now you're up to date if you've gotten your primary series and not a booster, the most recent booster.

547
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:27,370
So we've gotten out of the realm of we were like, I've got my primary series and four boosters of this type and one booster that's died.

548
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:34,149
It's now about did you get your primary series? And then the most recent booster that works like flu vaccine policy, right.

549
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:42,130
For the vaccine policies that kids the first flu vaccine get to two doses and then have you have the most recent booster.

550
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:47,370
So it's starting to reflect flu policy.

551
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:53,640
But then on the back of the current most recent boosters, it's one that continues on what kind of variant four and five?

552
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:58,500
This is a U.S. thing only in Europe.

553
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:03,360
What they ratified is a one stop variant of vaccine.

554
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:07,560
So the European Union and the U.S. have now diverged.

555
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:14,490
A remember I talked about in the strain selection thing with flu. The W.H.O. comes up with the recommendation and then all the individual countries

556
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:19,140
boards reviewed it and ratified it this time that they didn't use the same process.

557
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:21,569
They left every country up to make their own decision.

558
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:27,299
And sure enough, as we do in this world, the Europeans make a completely different decision than the American body.

559
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:33,720
And so now what is considered an up to date booster is different if you're in Europe versus in the U.S. and it means

560
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:40,530
also that the manufacturing power is now split between prime like the American market and the European market.

561
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:48,360
So really interesting situation developing. So then if we think about like what is this rat race between we're vaccinating with

562
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:52,200
something and the virus is evolving beyond it and we're vaccine viruses rather.

563
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:57,240
But now we have actually two different sets of vaccine pressure happening in two different parts of the world.

564
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:04,070
It's it's going to get really complex. So the world needs people that have taken vaccine passports.

565
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:13,520
And then we have to we've got this change in variant pattern that's affecting vaccine effectiveness from an ongoing basis.

566
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:18,040
But it's layered on top of the fact that we know that normal weaning happens.

567
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,709
And for sars-cov for flu, you have one strain a year.

568
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:31,640
You look to see how waning happens over a year. Yet you do definitely get lower vaccine effectiveness as you get out towards like May or May June.

569
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:40,459
This is why I got really worried when Ashish Jha came out in like in September, August and was like, you know,

570
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:46,220
God gave you two arms, this COVID vaccine and one won the other for the flu vaccine and you should get it right now.

571
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:56,240
But that was really early to get vaccinated for that. So I tend to get vaccinated in October, but we definitely know that waning happens over time.

572
01:01:56,510 --> 01:02:02,870
So we've got this change in effectiveness that happens over time, and then you've got the variant changing all the time as well.

573
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:13,490
And so now we're having to subset our vaccine effectiveness evaluations, the Google of the various Subanalysis to be able to have to evaluate it now.

574
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:18,470
So we've got two doses versus three doses. Was it during Alpha or Delta or Omicron?

575
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:23,120
Was it 150 days from the dose or more than 150 days from the dose?

576
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:29,600
This is like an incredibly dynamic situation now, trying to figure out where try to track vaccine effectiveness.

577
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:43,100
Right. The last point I want to make is one thing I have not gotten into is during during the whole pandemic.

578
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:46,579
And this is really I mean, last season we got into this a little bit,

579
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:49,970
but this season has been a very is going to be a very relevant season to look at it.

580
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:56,090
We have to remember that vaccination behavior is correlated.

581
01:02:56,090 --> 01:03:00,470
So your flu people get the flu vaccine and the people get the COVID vaccine,

582
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:06,350
that's likely to be correlated, but then your infection risk is often correlated, right?

583
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:08,120
These are the same mode of transmission.

584
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:15,709
So if you have a baseline risk of getting infected with a respiratory virus, somebody that's at high risk of being infected, somebody it's low risk.

585
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:19,100
It's going to be high risk for both viruses, low risk for both races.

586
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:25,640
So as good epidemiologists, you should recognize that this is a problem for causal inference, right?

587
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:31,310
In terms of like if you were to make a DAG, there's a lot of like cross correlations happening here that are problematic.

588
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:37,670
This is already problematic with evaluating the COVID vaccine and the flu vaccine.

589
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:44,120
Right. If you're doing a COVID vaccine effectiveness study, what do you do with other flu positive people?

590
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:48,049
Are they controls? All right. It doesn't really seem like they should be controls.

591
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:53,240
Does their vaccine matter if it was a flu vaccine, even though you're studying COVID vaccine, like how do you deal with that data?

592
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:59,209
So the hot topic that I gave you at the beginning of class becomes very relevant here.

593
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:03,080
So we're already struggling with how to best analyze this data and I'll show you a few things.

594
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:08,750
But there is a new vaccine about to come out so that we are about to have a

595
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:13,880
third vaccine preventable respiratory disease once we start vaccinating for RSV.

596
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:21,710
But that vaccine is only going to be available for older adults and for infants who receive antibodies through maternal vaccination.

597
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:27,260
So the pregnant person gets vaccinated and that sends the antibodies to the infant.

598
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:33,410
So now we have three vaccine preventable diseases with vaccines that all affect different age groups.

599
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:36,890
There's it's a the it's going to be a really complicated thing.

600
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:46,490
So one thing that we are spending a lot of time scrambling to do from an EPI methods perspective is I needed a meme side.

601
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:50,120
So can a test negative design handle multiple vaccines?

602
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:58,790
Probably. We don't know how to do it yet. Just mathematically, we don't know how to incorporate a third vaccine into these models yet.

603
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:00,709
And these vaccines are ready.

604
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:10,730
So this is what the artist vaccine landscape if you Google path RSV vaccine, you can get this picture and here are the phase three.

605
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,809
Pfizer just announced the results from their phase three maternal vaccine,

606
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:18,680
but there's a couple different elderly vaccines that are about to get announced as well.

607
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:30,470
And here is a great recent methods paper that looked at the confounding bias that these situations are going to create.

608
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:33,049
Basically the dogs.

609
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:42,830
What happens with the dogs when you've got this correlation between seeking influenza testing and seeking SARS-CoV-2 testing, right?

610
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:46,340
There's a correlation between that. Who actually goes to the doctor.

611
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:55,880
There's going to be correlation between positivity and there's going to be a correlation here between the vaccine seeking behavior as well.

612
01:05:56,180 --> 01:06:00,320
And so how do you disentangle all of that to try to get to a vaccine effectiveness?

613
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:08,390
The the kind of upside of this simulation and we've been able to replicate this in some of our data so far,

614
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:18,469
is that if you exclude the people that are positive for the alternate vaccine preventable disease, then you are sorry.

615
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:23,850
If you don't exclude it. If you just evaluate the data as a straight test negative design,

616
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:30,590
then you're going to underestimate the effectiveness of the vaccine just because of the way the confounding pathway works.

617
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:36,230
So in order to do this correctly, you need to exclude everybody that was positive for flu.

618
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:42,860
If you evaluate COVID test negative yes or no and you exclude everybody that was positive for COVID, you got to exclude.

619
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:50,240
But now that we're going to have a vaccine for RSV, now you're excluding the two most common respiratory viruses.

620
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:55,549
You know, when you're doing your evaluation and it starts to make your control group less and less and less

621
01:06:55,550 --> 01:07:00,890
representative of the larger population of people that are infected with respiratory viruses.

622
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:07,700
So we are in an era where we're running into kind of critical methodological problems with that as a design.

623
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:11,180
That's going to be a really big focus going forward.

624
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,960
So from there, I'm done.

625
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:26,060
Is that all the people that worked on all the things and the money and I'm going to pause here and has a recording and.
