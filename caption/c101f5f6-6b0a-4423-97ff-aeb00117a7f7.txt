1
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:04,791
The approach just described for

2
00:00:04,791 --> 00:00:09,548
binary outcome would be applicable to cohort data.

3
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:14,397
However, a modification is needed for case-control data.

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,400
For example, consider that the logistic regression

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,298
consistently estimates the parameter that would be

6
00:00:28,298 --> 00:00:33,319
obtained in a cohort study, except they intercept.

7
00:00:33,319 --> 00:00:40,729
However, the linear regression for the mediator in a case control design,

8
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:45,839
cannot be directly applied to the case cohort data.

9
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:49,344
Can you think why that might be the case?

10
00:00:49,344 --> 00:00:54,487
Why the parameters that we would obtain from fitting the linear

11
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:59,059
regression for the mediator model would be incorrect?

12
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,399
If our sampling mechanism is a case control.

13
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:12,441
Think about it in the context of the genetic epidemiology example.

14
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:17,328
So, since lung cancer is a rare outcome,

15
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:20,129
we over sampled cases.

16
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:26,506
So, if we over sample cases, do you think that the distribution

17
00:01:26,506 --> 00:01:33,002
of smoking intensity that we observe in this case control study,

18
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:41,293
will represent the distribution of smoking intensity in the overall population?

19
00:01:41,293 --> 00:01:43,145
Most likely not.

20
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:46,699
In particular, it will be sorry,

21
00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:51,237
most likely the case went a little further.

22
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:56,184
It will be most likely the case that we will overestimate

23
00:01:56,184 --> 00:02:00,185
the mean of the smoking intensity variable,

24
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:04,940
say the average number of cigarettes smoked per day.

25
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:10,439
Because we have a high prevalence of lung cancer cases and

26
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:15,605
we know that smoking is a strong risk for lung cancer.

27
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:17,954
So, given the prevalence of the outcome.

28
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:20,219
So, if we talk to expert and

29
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:25,832
if they can give us a good estimate of the prevalence of lung cancer,

30
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:31,051
we can obtain estimates that we would have from a cohort study,

31
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:35,104
by waiting the mediator model by this pie over p.

32
00:02:35,104 --> 00:02:37,756
Where P is the sampling fraction.

33
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:43,033
And the controls would be weighted by one minus pi over one minus P.

34
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:50,400
Of course if we are waiting the mediator model, we will need to obtain robust

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,218
standard errors that account for the extra correlation that we use by the waiting.

36
00:02:56,218 --> 00:03:02,679
Because some people are gonna be counted double or triple.

37
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:06,685
In particular, if you think about it, who are we gonna wait?

38
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:09,338
We are going to up wait the controls.

39
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:18,062
Just as alternative approximation to waiting, if the outcome is rare,

40
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:24,103
which is an assumption that we make anyway, we could simplify the fit

41
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:29,640
of the mediator model by simply fitting it among the controls.

42
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,716
So, we would simply run this mediator model, but

43
00:03:33,716 --> 00:03:37,317
now conditionally on y being equal to zero.

44
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:41,845
Under a rare outcome assumption,

45
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:46,581
this would approximate the regression for the mediator in the overall population.

46
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:56,266
An important point to also consider when we have a binary outcome,

47
00:03:56,266 --> 00:04:00,250
is that the way we can compute the very famous and

48
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,134
popular measure of the proportion mediated,

49
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:10,826
should be different than what we do when the effects are on the different scale.

50
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:13,509
So the proportion mediated,

51
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:18,884
is a measure that in our mind related to an additive effect.

52
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:22,424
That is of this additive effect, the total effect.

53
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:28,451
How much of this additive effect is explained by the indirect effect?

54
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:32,228
So, the immediate pathway.

55
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:37,376
When we have effects estimated on a multiplication of scale,

56
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:43,415
such as the odds ratio, we still would like to have a proportion mediated

57
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:50,060
measure that can be interpreted on the different scale or in an absolute scale.

58
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,642
So, this is what this measure achieves.

59
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:01,201
Again, this measure is already built in,

60
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:06,646
in all our macros and our packages that we will discuss.

61
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:11,622
And again, it makes sense only if natural direct and natural indirect

62
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:15,940
effects on the observation scale are in the same direction.

63
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:24,036
We can now proceed discussing the suite of statistical

64
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:29,617
software available to conduct the mediation analysis.

65
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:33,817
And in particular, implement this parametric

66
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:37,917
regression approach that I just introduced.

67
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:44,349
I worked extensively on developing such software that is now available in SAS,

68
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:49,155
SPSS, STATA that is gonna be covered in the lecture today.

69
00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:54,294
And the command is called pyramid as well as the a package CMA verse,

70
00:05:54,294 --> 00:05:58,188
that we will cover today as well as in the live labs.

71
00:05:58,188 --> 00:06:03,862
And these macros handle either continuous or binary mediators,

72
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:08,407
continuous binary count or failure time outcomes.

73
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:11,866
And they also accommodate randomized styles for

74
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:15,334
designs and unmatched the case control design.

75
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:22,680
Let's start discussing the salient features of the Stata of command for

76
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,806
mediation and then we will have more time for

77
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:28,863
you to become familiar with this command.

78
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:36,132
So, the Stata command paramed, was developed in the Stata version 12.

79
00:06:36,132 --> 00:06:41,267
And can be directly downloaded in Stata using

80
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:45,733
this line of code SSC install paramed.

81
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:49,057
The commander can be used with the following statement.

82
00:06:49,057 --> 00:06:54,335
So, you first call the name of the macro paramed.

83
00:06:54,335 --> 00:06:59,247
You then specify the variable name for your outcome.

84
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:01,706
And then you specify what's your exposure.

85
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:06,293
And again in this parenthesis you would include the variable name,

86
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:11,686
the mediator, the co-variants, that you can include in these parentheses,

87
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:14,118
simply separating them by a space.

88
00:07:14,118 --> 00:07:18,427
a0 and a1, are the levels of the exposure at which you

89
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:21,904
are interested in estimating the effects.

90
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:27,290
And we call them a0 and a1 because when the exposure is binary,

91
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,799
your a0 will be 0 and your a1 will be 1.

92
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:33,577
But if your exposure is continuous,

93
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:37,527
you can use whatever contrast you may wanna choose.

94
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:44,163
You could consider for example, that a0 is the mean of the exposure and

95
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:50,588
a1 is ten units higher than the mean or 2 units higher than the mean.

96
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:53,635
You need to think about your context and

97
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:57,244
what's the relevant change in the exposure.

98
00:07:57,244 --> 00:08:01,826
The option m is required.

99
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:06,374
And is the level of the mediator at which you want to

100
00:08:06,374 --> 00:08:09,850
evaluate the control direct effect.

101
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,425
Because as we said all along,

102
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:15,215
the control direct effect is the effect of the exposure on the outcome.

103
00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:19,941
When you fix the mediator m at an arbitrary level chosen by

104
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:21,623
the investigator.

105
00:08:21,623 --> 00:08:26,543
And then importantly we need to specify what type of regression models are you

106
00:08:26,543 --> 00:08:29,959
interested in for both the outcome and the mediator.

107
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:34,695
And we have several options that you can specify as I said before.

108
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:44,499
So here, it explains what I just said, so you can have it for your reference.

109
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:49,112
We also have other options, for example, an option of nointer option,

110
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:53,134
which will exclude the mediatory interaction from the model.

111
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:54,782
We have the option case,

112
00:08:54,782 --> 00:08:59,426
which will be specified if the data arises from a case control design.

113
00:08:59,426 --> 00:09:06,631
And we have an option full, which gives a more complete output.

114
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:09,431
Including, not only natural direct and

115
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:14,369
natural indirect effects as I just defined them here, but as we will see

116
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:18,999
shortly there are alternative definitions that we can consider.

117
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:23,800
And this will become even more clear when we talk about how

118
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,515
we can unify mechanisms of mediation and interaction.

119
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:33,743
And further decompose the total effect, not only in direct and

120
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:41,153
indirect effects but also considering the independent contribution of interactions.

121
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:46,170
And for that there will be an additional Stata

122
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,792
macro metaphor way that we developed in my

123
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:55,562
lab to conduct disorder the composition.

124
00:09:55,562 --> 00:10:00,991
We also have the option boot, which gives the bootstrap standard errors,

125
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:05,136
where the [INAUDIBLE] 1000 bootstrap replications.

126
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:09,327
And you can also change the number of replications but

127
00:10:09,327 --> 00:10:14,555
we would recommend not to go below the one 1000 replications.

128
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:19,567
And also you can change the seed, because it's very important whenever

129
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:25,331
you run a simulation procedure like the bootstrap to obtain the standard diverse.

130
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:28,298
Because again with our parametric approach,

131
00:10:28,298 --> 00:10:33,621
you can either obtain the standard derives using the delta method as I mentioned but

132
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:35,840
you could also use the bootstrap.

133
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,773
So, if you use a simulation-based approach like bootstrap,

134
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:46,178
please remember to set the seed coherent with your whole procedure.

135
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,941
If you are only running this once,

136
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:53,912
your mediation analysis once, we already set a seed for you.

137
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:58,406
But sometimes it happens that you are running many other analysis that required

138
00:10:58,406 --> 00:10:59,418
bootstrapping.

139
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:01,970
So, you might wanna keep the same seed.

140
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,925
Option level, indicates at which

141
00:11:08,925 --> 00:11:13,953
the confidence interval should be site.

142
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:18,840
Imagine that you are considering multiple mediation analysis because

143
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,943
you have more than one exposure of interest.

144
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:25,962
Well if you are testing all these mediation effects for

145
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:30,863
different exposures, you should account for multiple testing.

146
00:11:30,863 --> 00:11:35,188
So, you might want to consider more stringent alpha level.

147
00:11:35,188 --> 00:11:40,345
We usually consider 0.05, but it could be set to lower levels.

148
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:47,219
The R package CMAverse which I'm very proud of doctoral

149
00:11:47,219 --> 00:11:52,148
students working with me at Columbia just completed it and

150
00:11:52,148 --> 00:11:55,881
we just published it earlier this January.

151
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,130
Provides a suite of functions for

152
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:03,361
reproducible causal mediation analysis and it comprises three functions.

153
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:08,790
The first one that is cmdag, used for mediation DAG visualization,

154
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:13,563
to make clearer what are our identify ability assumptions,

155
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:16,757
what's the structure of your problem?

156
00:12:16,757 --> 00:12:21,554
cmest which is the core function for statistical modeling and

157
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:25,337
cmsens that conducts a sensitivity analysis for

158
00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:29,041
a measure confounding and measurement error.

159
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:34,597
The vignette of R package with several examples, can be found at this link and

00:12:34,597 --> 00:12:39,740
I highly encourage you to have a look at this link prior to our live long.

161
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:49,526
The core functions cmest handles methods covering in class but also much more.

162
00:12:49,526 --> 00:12:54,728
So, it covers the regression-based approach that we just discussed,

163
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:59,673
but also weighting- based approach that I will talk about briefly in

164
00:12:59,673 --> 00:13:02,334
the context of multiple mediators.

165
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:07,602
The other approaches that unfortunately don't have time to discuss but

166
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:12,179
they can be implemented by the CMAverse package are the inverse

167
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:17,361
old-ratio weighting approach, the natural effect model approach,

168
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:23,265
the marginal structural model for mediation and the g-formula for mediation.

169
00:13:23,265 --> 00:13:27,911
We will practice the use of the CMAverse R package again

170
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:31,045
together in the live long sessions.

171
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:38,338
Finally, the procedure causalmed SAS really translates

172
00:13:38,338 --> 00:13:44,745
our initial like 2013 mediation macro in SAS.

173
00:13:44,745 --> 00:13:49,369
And it now allows all outcomes like

174
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:54,960
continues binary count and figure time.

175
00:13:58,946 --> 00:14:04,251
Again, proc causalmed provides standard errors and confidence interval

176
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:09,229
of the estimated components using the delta method or the bootstrap.

177
00:14:13,177 --> 00:14:19,099
So, somebody comparing statistical versus counterfactual approaches for

178
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:20,835
mediation analysis.

179
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:26,419
For linear and long-linear models, statistical and counterfactual

180
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:32,571
approaches will coincide when there is no exposure-mediator interaction.

181
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:36,259
For logistic outcome models, they will coincide when there is

182
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:40,168
no exposure-mediator interaction and when the outcome is rare.

183
00:14:40,168 --> 00:14:45,916
Therefore, before investigator proceeds with one of the traditional methods,

184
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:50,746
either the product method or the difference method, he or she should

185
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:56,661
consider whether control has been made for confounders of the exposure-outcome,

186
00:14:56,661 --> 00:15:00,845
exposure-mediator, mediator-outcome confounders.

187
00:15:00,845 --> 00:15:05,821
And then there are no mediator-outcome confounders affected by the exposure.

188
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:10,255
They should check whether there is an exposure mediatory interaction that should

189
00:15:10,255 --> 00:15:12,128
be included in the outcome model.

190
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:17,008
And if the outcome is binary and the logistic regression is used,

191
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:19,148
the outcome should be rare.

192
00:15:19,148 --> 00:15:23,332
Otherwise the log-linear model should be used.

193
00:15:23,332 --> 00:15:29,370
I mentioned before that I gave you a certain definition of natural direct and

194
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,443
natural indirect effects, but there are others.

195
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:39,916
So here on top of the slide I rewrite the definitions of natural direct and

196
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:45,131
natural indirect effects that we have been considering.

197
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:46,849
The natural direct effect.

198
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:48,435
Looks at the change in the outcome.

199
00:15:48,435 --> 00:15:53,308
Y for changing the exposure when fixing the mediator to its natural level.

200
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:58,355
In the absence of exposure, the natural indirect effect

201
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:04,994
considers changing the outcome that is due only by changing the mediator.

202
00:16:04,994 --> 00:16:09,602
The changes in a particular way from its natural level in the absence of

203
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:13,988
the exposure to its natural level in the presence of the exposure.

204
00:16:13,988 --> 00:16:19,714
Now, while the mediator changes in a particular

205
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:24,749
way the exposure is fixed, at what level?

206
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:26,047
At level one.

207
00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:31,343
So in the presence of the exposure, we could actually have

208
00:16:31,343 --> 00:16:37,950
an alternative an alternative considered the following definitions.

209
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:43,211
The natural direct effect where now the mediator is fixed.

210
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:47,796
That it's not reliable in the presence of the exposure.

211
00:16:47,796 --> 00:16:52,443
And then we could have considered an alternative indirect effect.

212
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:59,667
Where now the exposure is set to zero rather than one effectively.

213
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:06,342
How are these two different natural direct and natural indirect effects obtained?

214
00:17:06,342 --> 00:17:12,346
Well, the first one that we have used all along is obtained by adding and

215
00:17:12,346 --> 00:17:18,971
subtracting this crossword nested counterfactual Y one and subscript zero.

216
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:23,155
Whereas the 2nd 1 is obtained by adding and

217
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:28,821
subtracting this nested cross work on the factual Y0M1.

218
00:17:35,624 --> 00:17:39,689
So Robins and Greenland called the natural direct and

219
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:43,853
natural indirect effects on top in the following way.

220
00:17:43,853 --> 00:17:50,298
The pure natural direct effect and the total natural indirect effect.

221
00:17:50,298 --> 00:17:54,907
Whereas this second one called the first one the total

222
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,606
natural direct effect and the second one.

223
00:17:58,606 --> 00:18:01,385
The pure natural indirect effect.

224
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:08,926
So what does the total versus pure terminology here mean?

225
00:18:08,926 --> 00:18:14,492
So I've said and hinted to this many times since we started

226
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:19,718
the course I hinted that together with the mechanism of

227
00:18:19,718 --> 00:18:25,870
mediation a mechanism of interaction might be also operating.

228
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:30,845
So when we refer to an effect as being a pure effect,

229
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:37,462
it means that that effect is purified by an interaction mechanism.

230
00:18:37,462 --> 00:18:42,512
And when it's called total is because together with

231
00:18:42,512 --> 00:18:50,901
the mechanism of mediation there could be also a mechanism of interaction operating.

232
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:56,108
So the definitions that I chose to present to you here effectively

233
00:18:56,108 --> 00:19:00,748
purified the natural direct effect by the interaction and

234
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:05,783
the let the interactive mechanism operate within mediation.

235
00:19:05,783 --> 00:19:10,622
Let's understand with in the context of

236
00:19:10,622 --> 00:19:16,317
continuous outcome and continuous mediator,

237
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:23,447
why I decided to choose to present this composition first.

238
00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:26,997
So let's look at what would be the estimator for

239
00:19:26,997 --> 00:19:29,942
the total naturally indirect effect.

240
00:19:29,942 --> 00:19:35,301
So the indirect effect that I chose to present to you thus far which as I said

241
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:41,361
is total natural indirect effect because it includes the interactive mechanism.

242
00:19:41,361 --> 00:19:47,561
Versus if I chose to show you the other version of the inter indirect effect

243
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:52,971
that attributes the interaction to the direct effect instead.

244
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:56,293
So the indirect effect is purified by the interaction.

245
00:19:59,027 --> 00:20:03,587
So consider that we have a continuous outcome and mediator as well is

246
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:08,235
continuous but that the exposure is binary and changes from 1 to 0.

247
00:20:08,235 --> 00:20:12,394
Now the total natural indirect effect is defined and

248
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:17,307
these are the forms that I gave you before by the product matt to

249
00:20:17,307 --> 00:20:23,093
the indirect effect plus A term that includes 2 to 3 and v to one times A.

250
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:26,936
Where a set one.

251
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:33,269
Now we see that if I use the total naturally indirect affected definition.

252
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:38,422
We have to some theta two times with a one plus

253
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:44,701
the interaction terms times theta 2 times theta 1.

254
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:50,790
So what is this second term, times 2-1 is the multiplication

255
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,963
of the interaction between the exposure and

256
00:20:54,963 --> 00:21:02,200
the mediator times the strength of the exposure effect on the the mediator.

257
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,952
And we know that this beta one is very important to assess whether

258
00:21:06,952 --> 00:21:08,893
mediation is plausible.

259
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:13,561
Because mediation mechanism is plausible when there is

260
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:18,041
both an effect of a on in and then effect of them on one.

261
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:23,042
Now let's see what would happen if instead I gave you an alternative

262
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:28,407
definition where I purify they interrupt affected by the interaction.

263
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:34,358
So now we would have 2 to 2 times theta 1 plus again this to one term.

264
00:21:34,358 --> 00:21:40,249
Now multiplied by a star, which a star for us is 0.

265
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:44,583
So in the case I wanted to purify the natural indirect effect from

266
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,875
the interaction.

267
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:50,950
This term is theta 3 times beta 1 would be multiplied by zero here.

268
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,652
So this term this second term would go away.

269
00:21:54,652 --> 00:22:03,056
But that means that this whole term would be moved as part of the direct effect.

270
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:08,828
But it doesn't make sense to include in the direct effect

271
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:16,054
it term that involves the strength of the exposure media association.

272
00:22:16,054 --> 00:22:20,410
So that's why we prefer to use the terminology that I

273
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:24,968
described before of a total natural indirect effect.

274
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:29,259
And yes, we have here pure natural direct effect.

275
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:33,308
This is a very complex concept.

276
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:34,610
I get that.

277
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:38,210
And please ask me questions if you have any.

278
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:43,771
And we will also go through an exercise where we will understand better.

279
00:22:43,771 --> 00:22:48,046
What is the distinction between the total and the pure effects.

280
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:53,449
And this will become even more clearer when I talk about did

281
00:22:53,449 --> 00:23:01,403
the composition of the total effect into the mediating and interactive mechanisms.

282
00:23:03,187 --> 00:23:08,017
I would like to continue now putting in practice all we have

283
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:09,998
talked about thus far.

284
00:23:09,998 --> 00:23:16,531
And going in depth into the understanding of the mechanisms explaining the effect

285
00:23:16,531 --> 00:23:22,699
of genetic variants of lack cancer potentially through smoking addiction.

286
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:27,410
So, as I was mentioning at the beginning of the course,

287
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:34,439
around 2008 independent research groups published in high impact journals.

288
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:39,702
The evidence that certain genetic variants on chromosome 15 Q 25.1.

289
00:23:39,702 --> 00:23:42,949
Were risk factors for lung cancer and

290
00:23:42,949 --> 00:23:48,292
other group of investigators identified those same genetic

291
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:53,227
variants as being associated with smoking addiction.

292
00:23:53,227 --> 00:23:58,170
Moreover, other scholars identify the gene

293
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,853
environment interaction in particular,

294
00:24:02,853 --> 00:24:10,276
found that those genetic variants on chromosome 15 to 25.1.

295
00:24:10,276 --> 00:24:14,981
Seemed to modify the effect of smoking and in particular,

296
00:24:14,981 --> 00:24:19,975
individuals who smoked and carry those genetic variants were

297
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:24,504
at disproportionate increasing risk for lung cancer.

298
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:30,262
Then people who carried the genetic variance but did not smoke.

299
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:33,941
So there have been essentially three explanations proposed for

300
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:37,697
the associations between the genetic variants and lung cancer.

301
00:24:37,697 --> 00:24:42,614
First, the genetic variant may have an effect on lung cancer through

302
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:45,593
smoking behavior, an indirect effect.

303
00:24:45,593 --> 00:24:50,167
Second that the variant may increase the risk of lung cancer

304
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:53,469
independently of smoking direct effect.

305
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:58,216
Orchard that the variant may increase the vulnerability to the harmful effect on

306
00:24:58,216 --> 00:25:01,376
smoking, which is a gene environment interaction.

307
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:06,689
Which is a different mechanism than mediation because for

308
00:25:06,689 --> 00:25:09,509
an interaction to be present,

309
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:14,941
two factors that interact can be completely independent.

310
00:25:14,941 --> 00:25:21,548
So even in the absence of mediation, there can be immediately mechanism.

311
00:25:21,548 --> 00:25:26,418
We will attempt to evaluate the evidence of

312
00:25:26,418 --> 00:25:31,160
each of these now together and then a lot.

313
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:36,849
So the researchers enrolled 1836 cases and

314
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:44,847
1452 controls at MGH Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

315
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:48,639
This is a sample of adults who for

316
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:53,133
the cases included only people who had

317
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:57,909
their first diagnosis of lung cancer and

318
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:04,667
controls were enrolled among their spouses or friends.

319
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:09,399
This is the description of the study sample that was used to evaluate

320
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:11,566
these potential mechanisms.

321
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:16,050
As expected cases a smoke on average,

322
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:21,101
much higher number of cigarettes per day.

323
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:23,060
They smoke for a longer time.

324
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:29,353
They are older college education is pretty similar and

325
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:33,606
there is some difference in agenda.

326
00:26:33,606 --> 00:26:38,687
Here we have the information about one of the deals from

327
00:26:38,687 --> 00:26:43,326
this chromosome and we see that cases are at higher

328
00:26:43,326 --> 00:26:48,204
risk of having at least one earlier for the disease.

329
00:26:50,703 --> 00:26:55,286
So how would we go about studying this?

330
00:26:55,286 --> 00:27:01,957
First of all, we can study associations between lung cancer smoking intensity and

331
00:27:01,957 --> 00:27:06,734
the adjusting for co variants using logistic regression.

332
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:12,312
So what we see here is that there is a very strong

333
00:27:12,312 --> 00:27:17,459
relationship between these variants and sorry,.

334
00:27:17,459 --> 00:27:21,751
The variance for the and the outcome

335
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:26,473
also smoking intensity and duration or

336
00:27:26,473 --> 00:27:33,643
smoking are strong predictors of lung cancer as expected.

337
00:27:33,643 --> 00:27:38,835
We can also look at the association between the genetic variants and

338
00:27:38,835 --> 00:27:40,851
the behavior of smoking.

339
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,960
So in this case control study.

340
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,919
So let's think about whether it makes sense

341
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,430
to just fit this model on the case control stat sample.

342
00:27:55,430 --> 00:28:00,417
So, by fit, simply fitting this model in this case for example,

343
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:05,133
we see the positives of association between the variants On

344
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:09,141
chromosome 15 to 25.1 is smoking intensity.

345
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,473
So to use our approach with the genetic value and

346
00:28:16,473 --> 00:28:21,096
we need to assume non measure confounding of the exposure outcome,

347
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:25,100
mediator outcome and exposure immediate relationship.

348
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,391
And actually assumptions.

349
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:31,562
One and three are very plausible because you know,

350
00:28:31,562 --> 00:28:36,703
since the population in this case control studies caucasian,

351
00:28:36,703 --> 00:28:42,717
there is not not originating in ethnicity, it's unlikely that there's

352
00:28:42,717 --> 00:28:49,930
any confounding of the genetic factor and the outcome or the relationship.

353
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:55,241
However, we might be concerned about mediator outcome from family here.

354
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:03,150
Another potential problem is how do we take into account smoking duration and

355
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:08,795
because smoking duration can be taken founder of the effect of smoking

356
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:14,080
intensity on the outcome, but it's also a mediator potential.

357
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,051
So we will think about how to address that towards the end of the course.

358
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:26,496
So this is the direct drastically graph that we assume in this case to be

359
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:28,393
able to identify direct and

360
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:33,930
indirect effects that I just mentioned could be subject to criticism.

361
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,330
And we will talk more about that in the lab.

362
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:42,278
And we want to proceed estimating natural direct natural indirect effects as

363
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:44,951
well as gene environment interactions.

364
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:50,670
So we proceed by fitting the logistic regression model allowing foraging

365
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,351
environment interaction.

366
00:29:52,351 --> 00:29:58,221
We fit the model for the mediator which we transform to make it more

367
00:29:58,221 --> 00:30:04,654
normally distributed, we transform The average number of cigarettes smoked per

368
00:30:04,654 --> 00:30:09,638
day using the square root transformation and we use this formula here.

369
00:30:09,638 --> 00:30:16,900
And importantly, since the outcome is rare, but we are in a case-control design,

370
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,313
we fit the mediator model only among the controls.

371
00:30:24,588 --> 00:30:25,410
Okay.

372
00:30:28,066 --> 00:30:32,786
Here, I would like also to think about a little bit if this measures

373
00:30:32,786 --> 00:30:36,343
the average number of cigarettes smoked per day.

374
00:30:36,343 --> 00:30:41,905
The best way to measure smoking is to capture the lifetime exposure

375
00:30:41,905 --> 00:30:47,386
to the smoking of this person who ends up developing lung cancer.

376
00:30:47,386 --> 00:30:53,549
So there are also potential issues of measurement type during this analysis.

377
00:30:55,745 --> 00:31:01,625
So the Association between the square root of cigarettes per day and

378
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:04,939
the exposure is the genetic variant.

379
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:10,332
We see that after accounting for the case-control design

380
00:31:10,332 --> 00:31:15,297
is much lower and non-statistically significant.

381
00:31:15,297 --> 00:31:20,296
And Combining the results from the outcome regression, which is what we have seen

382
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:25,238
before, and this mediator regression, adjusting for case-control design.

383
00:31:25,238 --> 00:31:28,361
What we find is that an increase in one or

384
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:33,191
Leo on a genetic variant on chromosome 15 to 25.1 leads

385
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:38,135
to a stronger natural direct effect on the outrageous scale.

386
00:31:38,135 --> 00:31:43,695
And the pretty small and non statistically significant

387
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:48,780
odds ratio of natural indirect effect that amounts

388
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:53,404
to about 3.6$% of proportion mediated.

389
00:31:53,404 --> 00:31:54,542
We then also test for

390
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:58,368
an additive interaction and the multiplicity of interaction, and

391
00:31:58,368 --> 00:32:02,747
we indeed find that there is a significant exposure mediatory interaction.

392
00:32:02,747 --> 00:32:07,310
So we proceed the revisiting the mediation analysis including

393
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:10,162
the exposure mediatory interaction.

394
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:15,717
So what happens once we do that not really many changes,

395
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:21,863
we see is likely a smaller alteration natural direct effect,

396
00:32:21,863 --> 00:32:27,201
basically saying the same natural indirect effect.

397
00:32:27,201 --> 00:32:32,046
But since the natural direct effect is estimated as likely smaller now

398
00:32:32,046 --> 00:32:35,742
the proportion mediated goes from 3.6 to 5.4,

399
00:32:35,742 --> 00:32:39,288
which is still non-statistically significant.

400
00:32:42,192 --> 00:32:45,831
So at the end of every mediation analysis,

401
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:50,781
as in every academic logical study, we need to think about

402
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:56,865
the potential violation of the unmeasured confounding assumptions.

403
00:32:56,865 --> 00:33:01,103
So as I said before, we are particularly concerned about

404
00:33:01,103 --> 00:33:05,609
confounding of the mediator outcome relationship by lack of

405
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:10,224
information on socioeconomic status in particular income.

406
00:33:10,224 --> 00:33:15,407
So we would expect there's some measure confounding

407
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:20,937
here to be positive that is lower socioeconomic status,

408
00:33:20,937 --> 00:33:25,556
higher smoking, and higher lung cancer risk.

409
00:33:25,556 --> 00:33:31,269
That is the direction of the effect of the measure confounder on the mediator and

410
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:34,010
the outcome is in the same direction.

411
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:39,755
So that means that if this confound is not measured,

412
00:33:39,755 --> 00:33:45,771
our mediator could act as a proxy for that confounder.

413
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:51,301
Therefore, it will lead to another estimation of the effect of the media

414
00:33:51,301 --> 00:33:57,211
on the outcome leading to an overall overestimation of the indirect effect.

415
00:33:57,211 --> 00:34:01,774
We, therefore, think that with regard to in a major

416
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:05,617
confounding due to socioeconomic status,

417
00:34:05,617 --> 00:34:11,120
our results are actually cost potential conservative because

418
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,724
we might be already overestimating in, the effect of smoking or

419
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:23,406
lung cancer which is already leading to a nonsignificant indirect effect.

420
00:34:23,406 --> 00:34:28,656
So in conclusion our application of causal mediation analysis

421
00:34:28,656 --> 00:34:33,907
to this genetic epidemiological example leads us to think that

422
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:40,644
there is very weak evidence that mediation is an important mechanism explaining

423
00:34:40,644 --> 00:34:46,014
the effect of genetic variance on lung cancer through smoking.

424
00:34:46,014 --> 00:34:52,454
Interaction mechanism could be playing an important role,

425
00:34:52,454 --> 00:35:00,041
and the majority of the effect of the variants of lung cancer is direct.

426
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:04,460
These conclusions appear quite robust to confounding.

427
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:15,856
Other studies, recently found no association between variants and

428
00:35:15,856 --> 00:35:18,546
lung cancer among nonsmokers.

429
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:26,448
So let's talk a little more about the role of the exposure media for interaction.

430
00:35:26,448 --> 00:35:31,322
So the variance may not affect lung cancer primarily

431
00:35:31,322 --> 00:35:35,209
by increasing the cigarette addiction.

432
00:35:35,209 --> 00:35:40,677
But there might be a biological mechanism involving interaction

433
00:35:40,677 --> 00:35:46,544
where smoking plays a very important role in explaining the mechanism

434
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:51,617
through which the genetic variants influence lung cancer,

435
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:57,000
but this mechanism is not mediation, it might be interaction.

436
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,138
So we will shortly revisit the way to compose the total effect

437
00:36:02,138 --> 00:36:08,284
in mediating the interactive mechanism to understand better the role of

438
00:36:08,284 --> 00:36:14,752
smoking in explaining the effects of this genetic variance online cancer.
