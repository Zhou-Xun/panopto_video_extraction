1
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:42,520
okay my first question is you don't.

2
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,120
so

3
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,060
usually can do

4
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:00,143
we have yet to start today and

5
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:05,923
the person I was hoping would take this. bye. thank you.

6
00:01:05,923 --> 00:01:11,523
since it has been finalized. the name of the person or even the janitor. bye.

7
00:01:11,523 --> 00:01:16,543
I think you very much. I'll

8
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:21,603
be standing material. for no personal skills. alright.

9
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:27,283
okay. second is did the homework

10
00:01:27,283 --> 00:01:34,483
time. show up today is

11
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:40,103
wrong.

12
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:45,163
yeah I wanna I wanna ask you one thing about

13
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:50,443
that homework assignment. if not do I think this the second right.

14
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:55,943
okay. you in a_while. I was thinking about

15
00:01:55,943 --> 00:02:01,127
you later. bye hey Steven if you Homer.

16
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:06,407
I really decide and if you like to go

17
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:11,547
through you. it's very important return our call to try this

18
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:16,887
out to you. really what what was found and whether

19
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:22,667
how strong you think there is an apartment for Sandy's Apollo relationship here.

20
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:27,727
nine dollars. again the number three or four. you haven't

21
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:34,267
done or are doing everything right now. so whenever you

22
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:39,967
try if you are Gerard call me.

23
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:44,987
what would be like reasonable and just leave time. questions will be the same questions about this

24
00:02:44,987 --> 00:02:51,047
chart. so if you have any anything work from

25
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:56,847
which I think will help the people on that. so

26
00:02:56,847 --> 00:03:01,901
if you want probably gonna do something it's due February second in the next week anyway but

27
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:08,821
you might wanna wait to see the example. try to make sure you have that part of class on Tuesday.

28
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:14,141
alright. and

29
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:19,421
we're working with the new DSI. I hope to have sex put it regular

30
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:24,621
regular hours. the campus set up for this it's all very

31
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:29,681
clear. you'll have going forward is doing exactly what's gonna happen. and

32
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:34,761
actually on Tuesday. for the Tuesday class. we may we're probably

33
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:40,101
gonna try to do in class exercise dialog about a problem that I

34
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:46,441
sent you before the before the weekend. I'll send it to you tomorrow.

35
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:52,161
okay think that covers all that. so

36
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:57,919
if I remember will you. this is what was up on the screen when we stop

37
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:03,019
before right. and I don't and I think we just are talking about this we really didn't get

38
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:08,099
finished. bye. remember the part about it. we talked about in some detail

39
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:13,479
of concept of the position. but I don't think

40
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:18,959
we had an opportunity to do that. so just remind everyone

41
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,459
what we're looking at here is we're saying. there's only three possible

42
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:29,699
ways in the whole universe. that person could end up with disease

43
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:35,699
ask and if they have

44
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:41,099
all these factors combined at the same time. they will get the disease.

45
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:46,099
so there is one way it can happen if this is ABC D

46
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:51,899
E R all through the same time. probably statements of the statement about the individual

47
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:56,973
about their level of exposure to the agent we're interested in and so on. bye

48
00:04:56,973 --> 00:05:02,613
for the moment we're not talking to discuss the details. so I second way. this is

49
00:05:02,613 --> 00:05:08,333
a D F G and H are all through the same time. that person will get this disease.

50
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:13,493
and the third way. this is ACS I and Jay and all through at the same time that person

51
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:19,433
will get that. okay. so we're talking about. supposed

52
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:24,493
Gee doesn't actually exist. it was a hypothetical but in fact there is no

53
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:29,533
GE in the real world. so that would mean that. Roman numeral two here

54
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:34,713
dropped out. that would mean in the real world that there would be only two sets

55
00:05:34,713 --> 00:05:39,833
of the patient positive for this person to get this disease the right. either they have_to have these

56
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:45,373
five gallon D5 on Saturday through the same time. or alternatively needs five dollars.

57
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:51,153
everybody. but the diagrams and spoke to me. okay. so

58
00:05:51,153 --> 00:05:56,259
might the question their number one that she did not actually said

59
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:01,799
be in half way it always sometimes or never by logically interact

60
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:08,499
in the car station disease. what I mean by contract. I mean that.

61
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:14,759
this is the half way. one of these diagram.

62
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:20,219
not to diagrams or eliminate the middle on for the moment. halfway where

63
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:27,979
you need both be at simultaneously. in order to

64
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:34,179
direct me. bye alright. okay. so

65
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:39,447
is anyone willing to say what they think is the correct answer two

66
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:44,527
number one. you know always

67
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:51,287
sometimes and never interact because they said yes.

68
00:06:51,287 --> 00:07:03,227
you say never. okay. would you explain your reasoning.

69
00:07:03,227 --> 00:07:08,227
okay. I here's the reasoning. I think it's perfect. nothing

70
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:13,847
bad. with everyone. see what you say.

71
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:19,167
bye. okay. getting back to you just tell me know that means that that shows up in the same pile.

72
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:24,707
in regards to everyone. part a both show up and we got eliminated right.

73
00:07:24,707 --> 00:07:30,047
so they have_to be in there. okay. so how about it. Gee.

74
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:36,347
we're presents and allergies real. let's see. does not exist.

75
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:41,614
so that means of course you could get the disease by having all five of what's under Roman numeral

76
00:07:41,614 --> 00:07:47,094
two. or alternatively all five of us on the Roman numeral three. but you can have it from

77
00:07:47,094 --> 00:07:52,094
one. I'm sorry I'm lying to you. I'm not actually that only leaves you

78
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:57,314
with which one was to write Roman numeral two. because he is present

79
00:07:57,314 --> 00:08:02,954
in both one and three and our saying see doesn't actually exist.

80
00:08:02,954 --> 00:08:08,114
so now with somebody else answer this question.

81
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:13,774
would you say me at all I sometimes are never logically interacting home patient.

82
00:08:13,774 --> 00:08:20,774
in that situation.

83
00:08:20,774 --> 00:08:25,874
everyone is bored.

84
00:08:25,874 --> 00:08:31,374
bye. yeah. okay and

85
00:08:31,374 --> 00:08:38,014
can you say that that is why you say all.

86
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:43,586
bye okay. I agree with that completely as well.

87
00:08:43,586 --> 00:08:48,846
bye. so we said see doesn't exist. you never have wanted three. you're laughing too.

88
00:08:48,846 --> 00:08:54,626
it has both be in happiness. and I just told him go to consider

89
00:08:54,626 --> 00:08:59,766
an interaction mean you have_to both be in that same time again. that

90
00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:06,866
makes sense to everybody. okay good. so this gonna be quick.

91
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:11,926
so usually the way we think about calling you today to talk about the genealogy

92
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:17,266
uses the concept of counter factual and.

93
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:22,446
so if you're still in that time. the person they received exposure act

94
00:09:22,446 --> 00:09:27,706
and then develop the CDs. we just fine. accept the call.

95
00:09:27,706 --> 00:09:33,606
the for the person at that moment. yes. only the following

96
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:39,126
County fax those true. if that person they had not received that exposure

97
00:09:39,126 --> 00:09:44,552
at at that moment. she or he would not have developed

98
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:49,692
a disease. so. bye. didn't realize that the person did receive the exposure. but this

99
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:54,832
is saying remove the exposure. you get a different out_of town. even though we obviously

100
00:09:54,832 --> 00:09:59,932
don't have a tire machine to go back and redo it. we can't test that that's what counts actual.

101
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:05,592
alright. so we talked a long time.

102
00:10:05,592 --> 00:10:11,172
you're already about you know my pinnacle trial and to be a very strong

103
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:17,192
study designer designers. I left like we get better from certain types of policies.

104
00:10:17,192 --> 00:10:22,272
potential concern to pick to start a relationship between exposure and disease

105
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:29,432
out_of our treatment for the same thing. so

106
00:10:29,432 --> 00:10:35,414
I just maybe talk about seventy now. I just wanna point something out to you

107
00:10:35,414 --> 00:10:40,494
we we expected me to be in a large enough sample size five randomly assigning

108
00:10:40,494 --> 00:10:45,634
people to either let's go back to the situation we had two treatments standard one

109
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:51,614
and that potential new one for some disease. so in that situation.

110
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:57,234
we're saying that we're. when we enroll each person in the study. we're randomly

111
00:10:57,234 --> 00:11:02,594
assigning that person to either receive

112
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:07,834
old established treatment or the new treatment. so because it's random. it's not

113
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:13,734
possible that the person exposure meaning the treatment is associated

114
00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:18,794
with any other characteristics of individual right. I mean you better

115
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:23,814
hot let's at least around five. you know you said the clients actually

116
00:11:23,814 --> 00:11:29,194
decide which one put the person that's gonna be a large group like that.

117
00:11:29,194 --> 00:11:34,646
you expect that you not gonna have you hope you not have problems with in founders with

118
00:11:34,646 --> 00:11:40,326
I think the rest of day both of exposure the treatment in the case and the disease.

119
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:45,806
it's a very urgent. these are the course of the disease in the future. at the same time

120
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:52,586
which might send the store. the relationship between the exposure and the disease.

121
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:57,766
so when you say you're not gonna have problems in founders. look at what's under line

122
00:11:57,766 --> 00:12:02,926
at the bottom. basically you're sitting in a big counter factual which is

123
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:08,666
supposed to talk. bye. this is not Randall Martin. to receive

124
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:14,566
the standard treatment. and you switched all of the new treatment. and he

125
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:19,686
actually ran my new treatment. you switched them off to the older standard treatment. and

126
00:12:19,686 --> 00:12:24,846
you did the W again. the County tax office can't do that everybody to get the treatment but

127
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:30,246
the whole idea behind it is that you would expect to see. essentially exactly the same all.

128
00:12:30,246 --> 00:12:35,256
if you switched everybody at the counter back from Karen about clinical trial

129
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:40,396
you heard all this before. okay. it makes sense to people what we're saying. okay.

130
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:45,656
great.

131
00:12:45,656 --> 00:12:50,736
alright. we've already talked about this several times but the

132
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:56,736
issue is. when you write about our special environmental exposure

133
00:12:56,736 --> 00:13:01,816
be possibly related to somebody. we can do. I'm in

134
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:07,496
my clinical trial. so we instead

135
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:12,636
have_to serve what happens. and that means that there's a_lot. especially in

136
00:13:12,636 --> 00:13:18,282
standing by. not the only one but especially in family bye. there's a_lot_of other time probably

137
00:13:18,282 --> 00:13:23,982
Bob. could potentially be introduced this study. which by the store.

138
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:29,722
what is the true relationship between the explosion that he could go either way. bye.

139
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:34,762
to be there with type wanna talk to you there either. yeah you concluded

140
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:40,082
for Thursday really or Thursday possibly he said if possible. when they are

141
00:13:40,082 --> 00:13:45,522
actually or you may know there's no association here nothing possible

142
00:13:45,522 --> 00:13:51,222
in fact they are. and so there's a higher bar

143
00:13:51,222 --> 00:13:56,402
for interpreting. alright. hire bartenders it's paying a_lot_of attention to

144
00:13:56,402 --> 00:14:01,762
how carefully. the people that designed to carry out the study. did

145
00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:06,882
their study to see whether they really take care of all the issues that come up that like

146
00:14:06,882 --> 00:14:11,962
to start that relationship. which is what you're gonna be doing homework one. alright. thanks. what you think

147
00:14:11,962 --> 00:14:17,255
about that. okay. I

148
00:14:17,255 --> 00:14:22,335
and so we won't gonna do this now that you did. anyway never you how far

149
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:27,635
you got. I would even mention. they had talked about structural equations and

150
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:33,555
or time very in exposure. did that come up.

151
00:14:33,555 --> 00:14:38,695
so this is really not gonna question you about this

152
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:44,875
is already part of course but just so you have a little head about what this is

153
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:50,015
make it our event. and I think I can convince all of you. you

154
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:55,035
did a typical application about like because it's good to know that supposed to

155
00:14:55,035 --> 00:15:00,075
do an occupational study and use for that. so

156
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:05,155
in the work place. you later. bye. bye.

157
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:10,335
this is only only small part

158
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:15,657
with you today. this is agent Pot heart disease

159
00:15:15,657 --> 00:15:20,897
or aggravate her be you know regarding the right corner. okay.

160
00:15:20,897 --> 00:15:26,157
and so you're more likely to dive in my heart. Mark in a heart attack. if you have exposure.

161
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:31,617
alright. now. hi Kenzie this is few people.

162
00:15:31,617 --> 00:15:38,437
is part of the seating perfectly fine.

163
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:44,317
have a heart attack on call.

164
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:50,097
technically. this is the long prime illness.

165
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:55,477
bill is eight. before they end up

166
00:15:55,477 --> 00:16:00,497
actually. so why am I telling you about this because we're

167
00:16:00,497 --> 00:16:07,597
gonna a facial study. and here's here's the issue. the

168
00:16:07,597 --> 00:16:12,657
person you suppose it was true. this is agent Paul

169
00:16:12,657 --> 00:16:18,255
Hartley. have my car fortune I suppose you're trying to do an exposure

170
00:16:18,255 --> 00:16:23,975
response relationship. that's it. anyway did you want

171
00:16:23,975 --> 00:16:30,795
estimate to move exposure for each individual on the study and see whether it's limited exposure.

172
00:16:30,795 --> 00:16:37,835
the likelihood of having a heart attack. okay so far. now here comes the Rob.

173
00:16:37,835 --> 00:16:42,955
what happens. person starts working. if the person

174
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:48,095
had not spoke with the person who actually would not

175
00:16:48,095 --> 00:16:53,955
have the dog part of the day for the fact that they're in the department that has hesitation

176
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:58,955
that actually does. okay. and if

177
00:16:58,955 --> 00:17:04,395
they have got hard to see. they would work thirty years in that department before they reply.

178
00:17:04,395 --> 00:17:09,555
but instead what happened was start around here ten. they started having heart problems

179
00:17:09,555 --> 00:17:14,635
because of exposed because of the explosion in the department and regarding the doctor

180
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:19,935
and by the year eleven or twelve. they were to do be located if you continue working that part.

181
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:26,155
even if they do not have anything to do with an agent to do part of this is we're able to work tomorrow.

182
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:31,355
wanted to have it in their exposure. now certainly they only have about

183
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:37,735
one third of the two new exposure. same kind of actual they would have had. if

184
00:17:37,735 --> 00:17:42,895
this person has been exposed to that. alright honey. so happy deal with that

185
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:48,075
that the potential buyer. thanks. how you deal with that. so this I think you probably heard

186
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:53,355
in your first course. you told.

187
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:59,435
when you have a chance. bye. these are usually maybe

188
00:17:59,435 --> 00:18:05,515
you might. also with the exposure ventures and you have_to

189
00:18:05,515 --> 00:18:10,655
job for them. so you know either match on. you

190
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:15,919
asked that if all the way or you stranded bye on this is Mister very

191
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:22,199
to try to make sure it's not stored in the relationship between

192
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:27,459
you all know that. okay. and Sunday. so you

193
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:32,639
so you probably you say you know of any regression model. I think you almost done that have it right.

194
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:37,759
so you put in this third variable. and by putting it in you've adjusted for us and now

195
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:44,559
you. I controlling that effective the third only look at the second exposure of interest.

196
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,619
now did they tell you. I'm sure they did. ever. they said you can just Willy

197
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:55,179
Nelly. so anything and everything in here. you actually

198
00:18:55,179 --> 00:19:00,979
make the wrong thing.

199
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:06,079
issue. what happens in intermediate variable on the pathway

200
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:11,119
from the exposure to the DC meeting. yeah the exposure is because

201
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:16,925
of the disease but I still have_to wait because hi this is other fax.

202
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:22,485
if you strata chiropractor. put in an outback model. you won't make the true

203
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:29,485
actual possible relationship between exposure and the disease disappear.

204
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:34,625
that's why you don't put in an interview because now it's like basically everybody you're looking

205
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:40,885
at out an immediate variable because you because you just for

206
00:19:40,885 --> 00:19:46,005
the entire year. this is a very very boy of a reason thing you can't put it in and

207
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:51,105
I just put like a second founder. just checking every course of I lost

208
00:19:51,105 --> 00:20:00,881
anyone yet. they both sound familiar. okay

209
00:20:00,881 --> 00:20:05,881
working with an agent. please call

210
00:20:05,881 --> 00:20:10,881
me please. and what happens a_lot_of word. who

211
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:15,961
are the ones that get sick from it. if they leave work early. so when you do

212
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:20,961
if you do change of exposure. they're systematically receiving less

213
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:26,701
exposure. when you expected. if they hadn't gotten sick. so

214
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:31,881
you got to charge. you interviewed very well because

215
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:38,141
you're getting exposure from work. we were all

216
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:43,141
wrong. to join us for and I was a very awful day. what happened to your

217
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:48,301
on the job for it because it's it's actually the total

218
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:53,341
amount of exposure and the disease .com. you should a job for you should put in your

219
00:20:53,341 --> 00:20:58,436
moderation to confirm what time did

220
00:20:58,436 --> 00:21:04,696
you get the wrong answer both ways. would you do one or the other. you will underestimate

221
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:10,256
the relationship between the exposure of the disease. it's very fact but I don't use it.

222
00:21:10,256 --> 00:21:15,816
okay. you. you will get the wrong answer. and so this is other approach

223
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:21,236
that has_to do with only comparing people that have. except for a very

224
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:26,656
like every year except up to. you wanna look at what happened here twenty one up to your twenty.

225
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:31,656
you only compare people that have successfully worked for twenty years and the plan that you talk

226
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:36,956
about the factory. you don't ever compare people that left earlier. the people

227
00:21:36,956 --> 00:21:42,356
are still there. because if you do that. you gonna have this problem. so I just want you know that

228
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:48,236
that this is something if you went back to the nineteen

229
00:21:48,236 --> 00:21:53,798
ninety eight. nobody well maybe some people

230
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:58,898
that actually because I have_to leave probably nobody was recognizing

231
00:21:58,898 --> 00:22:04,078
this is an issue. so we'll come back to at some point. I just want you to be aware of what that's about. because you

232
00:22:04,078 --> 00:22:09,238
because we do run into it. okay. so we

233
00:22:09,238 --> 00:22:14,918
talk about that. I have_to pay some positions among others. they special conditions

234
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:20,598
have an important role to turn in because there. we went through these considerations

235
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:26,798
especially the one from Hill which is what you can use in your home work and

236
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:33,918
determination specific conversation not agent just a just hey.

237
00:22:33,918 --> 00:22:38,958
see if this person. this individual in front of you. do they

238
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:44,318
today. Cos this person. please be at areas. there's guidelines

239
00:22:44,318 --> 00:22:49,618
for that. they're little bit more complex. so you should.

240
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:54,618
I think you all do by now I understand the difference message between the association because nation

241
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:59,798
you should be aware of these criteria you can get to practice with it understand the difference between general and specific

242
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:04,938
conversation and we talked about. when

243
00:23:04,938 --> 00:23:10,258
people things out they should know that and I think of in terms of counter factual definition

244
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:16,058
action. okay. any other comments or questions about that.

245
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:23,598
alright. so

246
00:23:23,598 --> 00:23:29,198
for now we're moving to something quite different. we're gonna we're now

247
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:34,358
for this whole section which goes on for a little bit of time. we're

248
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:39,798
gonna be concentrating on this is the right time.

249
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:45,098
they can be part of our occupational agents especially. this is a long

250
00:23:45,098 --> 00:23:50,178
no over for another call. try tracking time. this

251
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:55,216
is it makes sense to get this organ system

252
00:23:55,216 --> 00:24:04,356
some extra time as compared to most of the other. this is something you're talking about.

253
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:09,796
not all but the vast majority of situations. certainly in the workplace and

254
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:15,336
in many situations. it's actually in highly developed like you.

255
00:24:15,336 --> 00:24:21,916
when you talk about the general public. the major route of exposure.

256
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:27,136
these are invoice. not not through direct skin contact. yes.

257
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:32,616
okay. and

258
00:24:32,616 --> 00:24:37,936
why you trying to get from any you get very good at door and. I

259
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:43,436
think that you breathing reach the air checked out the online end up in the blood stream and

260
00:24:43,436 --> 00:24:49,156
other agent that directly affect the long long as the target organ.

261
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:54,322
obviously that's where that goes is been delivered. so there's lots of issues with long disease

262
00:24:54,322 --> 00:24:59,462
in environmental and occupational studies. alright. so we're gonna

263
00:24:59,462 --> 00:25:04,462
talk about pulmonary lung structure and function. so

264
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:09,902
what what do you want for their purpose is to take

265
00:25:09,902 --> 00:25:15,242
for you to inhale with our twenty one percent oxygen the normal air.

266
00:25:15,242 --> 00:25:20,722
and you take that oxygen to the alley over at Aaron and have it cross

267
00:25:20,722 --> 00:25:25,942
the basement membrane in the Capital Area in the blood stream and get distributed to all the tissues

268
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:31,642
in the body that require oxygen for the production of energy.

269
00:25:31,642 --> 00:25:37,882
through various manic cycle. okay. and the waste product.

270
00:25:37,882 --> 00:25:43,582
that is part time. so you can just

271
00:25:43,582 --> 00:25:48,682
build up the tissues either. when you ask how you act the online increase

272
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:54,362
concentration apartment outside compared to what you inhale. that's how you're eliminating the card.

273
00:25:54,362 --> 00:26:01,718
so that's what your monster supposed to do with the really for in terms of the anatomy

274
00:26:01,718 --> 00:26:07,198
vocal voice about here. anything above Nathan's parents

275
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:12,838
doll now. so we we tend to refer to upper airway.

276
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:18,558
anything below. which is basically in the trachea down in the long. we called the lower airway.

277
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:24,438
okay. we'll see picture that is in minute. that we have a_lot_of

278
00:26:24,438 --> 00:26:29,438
branching in at the airways in her lungs. alright. so this is just

279
00:26:29,438 --> 00:26:34,668
a diagram showing what I just said it just shows side view the person in the dotted

280
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:39,848
line. it's a cut off this is blank voice box. you know we're about right

281
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:44,928
here on me and blow that is the beginning of the trachea and

282
00:26:44,928 --> 00:26:50,468
so that the cut off between upper airway and lower airway. and

283
00:26:50,468 --> 00:26:55,568
this is you don't have_to know any specific factor in this but this is just showing you that you start with

284
00:26:55,568 --> 00:27:00,948
the trachea. it's split into the main right. and then last

285
00:27:00,948 --> 00:27:05,968
broadcast and then there's more splitting splitting and so and it is important to

286
00:27:05,968 --> 00:27:11,068
take note of is that the trachea but especially when you get to

287
00:27:11,068 --> 00:27:16,388
that thing tomorrow. take care. go Broncos the typical to

288
00:27:16,388 --> 00:27:21,848
Karen air. it has a layer surrounding smooth muscle.

289
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:26,868
it's under automatic control. you can close it or open it on your home but that's very important thing

290
00:27:26,868 --> 00:27:32,028
I got not chronic obstructed pulmonary. these are the problem. you get bronco

291
00:27:32,028 --> 00:27:39,445
spasm. my phone quick closing down and making airway to Nero.

292
00:27:39,445 --> 00:27:44,585
alright. so. average human has about

293
00:27:44,585 --> 00:27:49,825
three hundred million out_of Illinois. Eric Sachs. and if you look at

294
00:27:49,825 --> 00:27:56,725
total. basically where

295
00:27:56,725 --> 00:28:02,026
we're going. I'll be online and the cafeteria in the blood stream

296
00:28:02,026 --> 00:28:08,065
that surface area in your lawn. is about the size of the tennis court

297
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:13,306
date. if you could mind it all. and so we got

298
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:19,146
opportunity for exposure and you'll notice even though e'er of course doesn't the way it much food or water.

299
00:28:19,146 --> 00:28:25,646
we actually just even kilograms when we inhale

300
00:28:25,646 --> 00:28:30,806
higher quality weight air. then we can we inject

301
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:36,199
for water. okay. hey it's Mark. hey we should be worried about it

302
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:41,419
hey this is Charmaine. the

303
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:46,459
all the different wires and basically what those numbers at the bottom of. same by the time you get

304
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:51,519
out to the last I'll be online last

305
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:57,579
that. this is Route twenty three or twenty four time. first that would be

306
00:28:57,579 --> 00:29:02,759
the right name wrong. last name Robinson. and

307
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:07,899
you should know a little bit of terminology here. you have the Bronx High when you get

308
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:13,059
smaller to call Bronco. these are non- respiratory bronco's because they don't

309
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:18,139
there's no gas exchange there. but when you get the rest of Terry Brown you don't even know there's still two.

310
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:25,039
there is gas exchange and you get very and I'll be over Doug's. your gone and

311
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:30,619
that their offer. basically gas exchange. okay. so

312
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:35,899
here in Dayton Court and they injected

313
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:41,484
something so that they could see all the different on the on this side all the different

314
00:29:41,484 --> 00:29:46,884
airways and on the side also we're looking for the

315
00:29:46,884 --> 00:29:52,264
arteries and veins because there maybe this is mentioned

316
00:29:52,264 --> 00:29:58,183
that that picture. you.

317
00:29:58,183 --> 00:30:03,884
you need to because you get part

318
00:30:03,884 --> 00:30:09,284
part through the law. in order to get that but

319
00:30:09,284 --> 00:30:16,683
just needed at the at the left side talked about the rest. goodbye. okay.

320
00:30:16,683 --> 00:30:22,004
and this is just showing you it's Danny latch on my property that you can see

321
00:30:22,004 --> 00:30:27,464
the respiratory Bronco. sort of like here in here sort of ending in

322
00:30:27,464 --> 00:30:33,738
this network. I love you. bye. here's zack's

323
00:30:33,738 --> 00:30:39,057
here's on. Long structures let me talk hopefully soon. this session.

324
00:30:39,057 --> 00:30:45,057
we don't have that at that. we're gonna talk about this related spiral disease.

325
00:30:45,057 --> 00:30:50,297
the floral or the membrane line. the long another version

326
00:30:50,297 --> 00:30:55,358
and the bedroom floor.

327
00:30:55,358 --> 00:31:00,838
this role been working. alright so this road floor. the membrane lines

328
00:31:00,838 --> 00:31:05,917
outside of the long and the pride of for the

329
00:31:05,917 --> 00:31:11,098
membrane line. the chest cavity. they actually can fight over each

330
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:16,398
other smoothly your lungs can inflate the slate and have things move quickly

331
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:21,498
and when you. you also the right highland last time

332
00:31:21,498 --> 00:31:26,557
on that. basically where the artery in the thing. returning to.

333
00:31:26,557 --> 00:31:31,677
okay. and this is Allied heart. you probably

334
00:31:31,677 --> 00:31:36,698
know that on chest x-ray please this is the right diaphragm. last time

335
00:31:36,698 --> 00:31:41,878
from. okay. so you probably thought

336
00:31:41,878 --> 00:31:46,998
it might have been exposed record. I'm gonna be very brief about it. but

337
00:31:46,998 --> 00:31:52,537
you would give me interested in whether agent

338
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:58,278
now. if this is mother.

339
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:05,318
hey actually pocket in the repertoire track and if they do where

340
00:32:05,318 --> 00:32:10,358
we think the deposit are more like

341
00:32:10,358 --> 00:32:17,177
we have a potential contact versus that. so this is quite important and I

342
00:32:17,177 --> 00:32:22,417
saw this is talking about the fact that there's different ways that particle gets captured

343
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:29,478
in the airways and the long and it depends. it's a large extent on their side.

344
00:32:29,478 --> 00:32:34,917
there's diagrams this coming up and I'm not gonna repeat it here and

345
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:40,197
it talks about the fact that the impact of these three different ways. depends on the particle

346
00:32:40,197 --> 00:32:45,297
size density velocity. just wanna disturb you. actually for as best

347
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:51,597
as you can also add as well as the shape long skinny particles

348
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:56,597
are more likely to deposit. and here's a couple other ways

349
00:32:56,597 --> 00:33:01,817
that particles in deposit just deadline and reception is what happens and things I guess that's

350
00:33:01,817 --> 00:33:07,697
it. here's the diagram. so you got the air flow going this direction. and

351
00:33:07,697 --> 00:33:13,974
this is the same that and you may get an show action to this meeting.

352
00:33:13,974 --> 00:33:19,874
please send in to airway and stop their deposit there.

353
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:25,654
you actually have long enough and if you have the right size particles some of that can.

354
00:33:25,654 --> 00:33:32,354
bye. Gravity. can end up hitting the side of airway and staying there.

355
00:33:32,354 --> 00:33:37,693
you need that shit you got a long skinny particles of our life you get trapped and then the last one

356
00:33:37,693 --> 00:33:43,134
is supposed be brownie motion. we have extremely small. they actually bounce around

357
00:33:43,134 --> 00:33:48,414
from the air from the nitrogen oxygen

358
00:33:48,414 --> 00:33:53,534
and they may end up reaching the wall from there's a random walk getting

359
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:58,634
moved around. so just need to hear

360
00:33:58,634 --> 00:34:06,234
from you today. so

361
00:34:06,234 --> 00:34:12,438
call this is Princeton

362
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:18,138
Court. basically the pot

363
00:34:18,138 --> 00:34:23,219
in the Bronx. not real tired

364
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:30,499
problem. but larger bronco or higher. it doesn't really do much.

365
00:34:30,499 --> 00:34:35,739
Reese is Jeff exchange region. red door brought the old

366
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:40,938
Valley on our van. if you can set up shop in because

367
00:34:40,938 --> 00:34:47,618
the hotel. so it's actually extremely important.

368
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:53,578
bye. real.

369
00:34:53,578 --> 00:34:59,418
anyway I'm going to the beach and enjoying it. maybe you have someone very very

370
00:34:59,418 --> 00:35:05,378
partly on the beach. you know. I don't know it's mostly just the world.

371
00:35:05,378 --> 00:35:11,745
more than anything. bye you

372
00:35:11,745 --> 00:35:18,205
part on our way. are you there. haven't reached

373
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:23,305
you no longer

374
00:35:23,305 --> 00:35:30,425
maybe we get that far. we're at. if you have somebody who

375
00:35:30,425 --> 00:35:35,805
just small this is Angie and he had mentioned

376
00:35:35,805 --> 00:35:40,945
that she reported now and now stop in at all you don't want

377
00:35:40,945 --> 00:35:45,945
that on your engine. you have_to grind it off using your

378
00:35:45,945 --> 00:35:51,025
electric grinder. very powerful. let's do it fast. bye. one of the things you

379
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:56,425
get you get it. excellent great thing. very very far apart.

380
00:35:56,425 --> 00:36:02,065
so that's the situation. we're we're

381
00:36:02,065 --> 00:36:08,685
very lightly. also because because they're gonna be in here. very my

382
00:36:08,685 --> 00:36:13,838
reach long to. okay.

383
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,878
so I'm skipping through this long. this is. so I'm

384
00:36:18,878 --> 00:36:24,539
in interesting diagrams I just say one thing about it. alright. basically got a curve.

385
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:29,539
it's deposition out_of the old region and it solid like her

386
00:36:29,539 --> 00:36:34,878
deposition. anywhere in the respiratory tract and noticed this is

387
00:36:34,878 --> 00:36:40,579
this is the size of the particles and notice it's on the lot right next to Gail. that's one micron

388
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:46,138
point my my content my accounts okay. and this is the percent deposition.

389
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:53,158
and would you see if you look at what's gonna deposit out to you. bye. actually

390
00:36:53,158 --> 00:36:58,178
it is very high percentage and it actually gets low. the third of around

391
00:36:58,178 --> 00:37:03,618
point two point three microns in diameter and then starts going up

392
00:37:03,618 --> 00:37:09,138
and it takes around maybe two micron. and then it dropped off rapidly

393
00:37:09,138 --> 00:37:14,466
by the time you get the ten micron really man. I need you here at dynamic diameter

394
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:19,486
or not in going to that. but if I you get a chance. basically nothing's reaching out the

395
00:37:19,486 --> 00:37:24,546
only region. so that's what we're saying. we're seeing. they're

396
00:37:24,546 --> 00:37:30,066
smaller than ten but bigger than say three. a_lot_of the deposit

397
00:37:30,066 --> 00:37:36,706
but the deposit in the you.

398
00:37:36,706 --> 00:37:41,947
alright. alright. so I have a question for you just give me a holler. tell everybody

399
00:37:41,947 --> 00:37:47,947
knows what

400
00:37:47,947 --> 00:37:54,386
the probably there. so

401
00:37:54,386 --> 00:37:59,606
if I told you that you have for some reason

402
00:37:59,606 --> 00:38:04,706
special that we had set up for taking the uniform side. it's all

403
00:38:04,706 --> 00:38:10,163
about ten micron. anyhow that and like I have it's agent

404
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:18,083
that actually set the parking space for people to be here.

405
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:23,163
so we'll reach

406
00:38:23,163 --> 00:38:28,242
the part. we'll try to connect again.

407
00:38:28,242 --> 00:38:33,302
if you are ready got an agent. this is Mike call

408
00:38:33,302 --> 00:38:38,563
ten micron. talk to you okay. now right. because

409
00:38:38,563 --> 00:38:44,482
a_lot_of it depends.

410
00:38:44,482 --> 00:38:49,943
so if this is obvious when you said people don't sometimes don't think about it.

411
00:38:49,943 --> 00:38:55,123
you it to pass on the mechanism of action and where the respiratory tract action

412
00:38:55,123 --> 00:39:01,183
takes place. in fact how

413
00:39:01,183 --> 00:39:07,245
the size of the particular and the likelihood of causing to see this place out

414
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:12,725
changes from one type of disease another. okay.

415
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:17,865
glad Sarah's backing is in the mechanical one. there's also

416
00:39:17,865 --> 00:39:23,245
line fluid that have bacterial fidelity detox for five days a week.

417
00:39:23,245 --> 00:39:28,385
you go to hearing clearance. the job talk about this at six oh one. ideas

418
00:39:28,385 --> 00:39:33,584
that you have that you got all these affiliate beating together and moving.

419
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:39,485
you could put your truck. talk to you now. that's where a_lot_of things are cleared

420
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:44,804
and so on. you system down here and everybody will talk

421
00:39:44,804 --> 00:39:50,159
about and I'll be alert for done especially looking for back for fashion. so

422
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:56,659
for example.

423
00:39:56,659 --> 00:40:02,399
so that hey just

424
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:07,799
just particular positive and usually I spoke to break apart.

425
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:14,719
destroy. unfortunately Chris

426
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:19,799
bye. my reason for

427
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:26,198
this it's a big problem with doing. alright.

428
00:40:26,198 --> 00:40:31,919
oh and the other day. it's good to know that that inspiration is active

429
00:40:31,919 --> 00:40:37,799
in fire. actually fusion models just a little of the dogs are done. and he's a little bit of your mid bottles.

430
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:44,779
and if you relax you out. actually expire. alright. and

431
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:49,800
we're gonna talk about a few times. so I'm getting I'm up in

432
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:55,440
a minute. two major category long. he's very interested.

433
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,700
I've and wanted to see where you have instruction air flow. so that would be like

434
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:06,420
asthma products. phone ID two nine one that is restricted.

435
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:11,420
wanted to see where either you actually have the instructions one you ones aren't

436
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:17,580
as big but more offense. my brother

437
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:22,760
and Gary Morris this is dandy. use more work

438
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,000
to expand survey keep talking about structure versus restricted disease.

439
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,240
so hey I just said what would you say

440
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:39,220
people get one free from smoking cigarette here.

441
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:47,481
you missed it.

442
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:52,701
I'm trying to call

443
00:41:52,701 --> 00:42:00,921
you. okay you can answer that. bye

444
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:06,741
call.

445
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:13,781
alright. usually this is the instruction. by the way

446
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:18,862
is not a disruption in relation. you get dynamic collapse

447
00:42:18,862 --> 00:42:24,042
of airways when you ask Hail. so if you're gonna have a problem with the air flow on your airways.

448
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:29,261
when it's gonna show up. it's not in here. when you try say. but of course you can ask

449
00:42:29,261 --> 00:42:35,781
quickly. you're having trouble.

450
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:40,901
so I will come back to that.

451
00:42:40,901 --> 00:42:45,926
alright. so you get it. so you have more it's you. if you have

452
00:42:45,926 --> 00:42:51,505
till close for example fibrosis. so the exposure use of glasses to the complaint. you long.

453
00:42:51,505 --> 00:42:57,605
so you need more pressure to move thanks. okay.

454
00:42:57,605 --> 00:43:02,625
alright. so and they have one.

455
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:07,646
if this is the fight. not just artificial. but all to see how does

456
00:43:07,646 --> 00:43:13,585
one go about that and pulmonary diseases. well it's very important that people about sentence.

457
00:43:13,585 --> 00:43:18,765
things might today. just gimme. just calling reading today.

458
00:43:18,765 --> 00:43:25,485
Franklin Smith. end of the night customer here that shortness of breath.

459
00:43:25,485 --> 00:43:30,646
so I got people about. so the things with the Department_of_Labor

460
00:43:30,646 --> 00:43:35,725
do slam when I start popping. whether you have problems meeting chest tightness and

461
00:43:35,725 --> 00:43:40,765
so on. so that was really important call. don't underestimate how important they are even

462
00:43:40,765 --> 00:43:46,146
though the quote on quote on objective we do a physical examination listen for certain things.

463
00:43:46,146 --> 00:43:51,625
thanks. someone's in the middle but I have you here. you put your stethoscope

464
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:56,746
on person's back. you'll hear a_lot_of wheezing sound asleep high

465
00:43:56,746 --> 00:44:02,426
pitch sound which is basically you name it. you getting it down because his instructions and explanation.

466
00:44:02,426 --> 00:44:07,605
you know maybe Wednesday. thanks a_lot especially and

467
00:44:07,605 --> 00:44:12,646
if they have decreased back down in Salon. then there's pony

468
00:44:12,646 --> 00:44:17,825
function testing. okay. so we're gonna talk about the calendar. this is

469
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:22,986
really important. way basically get a handle

470
00:44:22,986 --> 00:44:28,466
on how well functioning which is the exchange.

471
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:33,686
okay. and you will talk a_lot more about that and then there is chance

472
00:44:33,686 --> 00:44:38,738
Brady. Brady passed check x-rays where we

473
00:44:38,738 --> 00:44:44,018
look for things like that Judy infiltrate. like if you had an ammonia in the area

474
00:44:44,018 --> 00:44:50,278
where you're having a pneumonia. if you haven't filled up fluids out_of the woods. an example of an acute infiltrate.

475
00:44:50,278 --> 00:44:56,018
Pass it is like fibrosis is being present. tumors will show up as well. high parish.

476
00:44:56,018 --> 00:45:01,018
okay. now I know you were actually our clinicians are about to graduate the

477
00:45:01,018 --> 00:45:07,298
nation. you know the answer that. so if you get a recommendation. I hear from someone else first.

478
00:45:07,298 --> 00:45:13,478
this is Matthew. when when you

479
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:18,478
were. so do you think

480
00:45:18,478 --> 00:45:24,158
people and that's in the middle of a nap

481
00:45:24,158 --> 00:45:29,658
too hyper aeration. that means more air in your longer

482
00:45:29,658 --> 00:45:39,036
than normal. you should not have back. bye

483
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:44,236
when you get a chance. that's right. nine zero. this

484
00:45:44,236 --> 00:45:51,036
is the

485
00:45:51,036 --> 00:45:59,936
law platform live

486
00:45:59,936 --> 00:46:05,016
with me. love

487
00:46:05,016 --> 00:46:11,036
you. bye..

488
00:46:11,036 --> 00:46:16,156
this is with COPD as well at air track. because you can help

489
00:46:16,156 --> 00:46:23,956
he's leaving. we actually tend to end up with extra air. okay.

490
00:46:23,956 --> 00:46:29,334
and then there's a high resolution CT scans and MRI.

491
00:46:29,334 --> 00:46:34,634
so those were making specific diagnoses. those could be

492
00:46:34,634 --> 00:46:39,814
in valuable. you can find out the. my phone may not show up

493
00:46:39,814 --> 00:46:44,814
very well or at all Plainville of the chat. I haven't that time

494
00:46:44,814 --> 00:46:49,914
about Virginia allergy. we hardly ever use something like HR CT

495
00:46:49,914 --> 00:46:55,834
or MRI. well they're expensive.

496
00:46:55,834 --> 00:47:01,374
they're very fancy equipment. in the case of CDs again that's a substantial does radiation

497
00:47:01,374 --> 00:47:07,374
you don't wanna get the people. I was kinda working out right now and

498
00:47:07,374 --> 00:47:12,814
you want something that you got the. have lots of people in your study for Tuesday to and it's portable

499
00:47:12,814 --> 00:47:18,154
and easy to use and not not dangerous but extra rate.

500
00:47:18,154 --> 00:47:23,234
know I do radiation as individual. so you sleep your chest x-ray is

501
00:47:23,234 --> 00:47:29,019
very very low level radiation mag many magnitude.

502
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:34,479
orders less than that. high resolution CT. okay.

503
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:39,619
so you probably not gonna use it and I can study. so what we do to attend

504
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:44,779
appointment function to call for Rama tree. and that should be done at labs

505
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:49,959
and I'll be done in the field because there's small portable devices in hour almost most

506
00:47:49,959 --> 00:47:54,999
accurate rate for giant flat equipment. quite light and

507
00:47:54,999 --> 00:48:00,739
you can use and when we're looking it's brother Chaney.

508
00:48:00,739 --> 00:48:06,179
there's many things are gonna work at our site diagram and that in a minute. bye.

509
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:11,239
you see what you're interested in having the purses

510
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:17,919
and accessories on usually.

511
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:22,999
so I show you the maneuver. you have_to get people to do. if

512
00:48:22,999 --> 00:48:28,303
you wanna accurately phone this is Josie.

513
00:48:28,303 --> 00:48:33,343
I don't know what to get with you to help you do. take a

514
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:38,563
deep breath I possibly can. and then you wanna blow out last

515
00:48:38,563 --> 00:48:44,003
air out and it's hard and as fast as they possibly can. and

516
00:48:44,003 --> 00:48:49,083
even when I feel like you know I love you long. you wanted them to keep blowing until you tell

517
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:54,703
them to stop. if you want if you get it four four. bye.

518
00:48:54,703 --> 00:49:09,423
baby. bye. love you.

519
00:49:09,423 --> 00:49:15,683
hey. hey. hey what's up.

520
00:49:15,683 --> 00:49:23,623
see. this is Ashley. bye. love you.

521
00:49:23,623 --> 00:49:30,787
hello so why don't capacity.

522
00:49:30,787 --> 00:49:35,987
wrap for me. you're going out it's hard and fast as you can

523
00:49:35,987 --> 00:49:41,227
you guys go out. if you don't but out_of heart fast as you can. first extra

524
00:49:41,227 --> 00:49:50,047
towards but I have one second. so that's how much here. you long.

525
00:49:50,047 --> 00:49:55,847
call me in someone with

526
00:49:55,847 --> 00:50:02,887
normal people are wrong. you're the audience

527
00:50:02,887 --> 00:50:07,907
that SCE one of the ratio there. this

528
00:50:07,907 --> 00:50:15,907
is for that.

529
00:50:15,907 --> 00:50:20,907
so in other people that are along. you

530
00:50:20,907 --> 00:50:26,087
that be the one that beat the racial as well or you actually get out Morgan

531
00:50:26,087 --> 00:50:31,425
for if you have normal on the air out in the first second

532
00:50:31,425 --> 00:50:36,785
that last six seconds is not invited. painful very painful

533
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:41,825
lives in a little bit. but if you wanna get the full busy. first of all longer.

534
00:50:41,825 --> 00:50:48,345
alright. so I just seen a second.

535
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:56,165
clinically need a very important message. hey Ron it's me..

536
00:50:56,165 --> 00:51:02,785
bye. call me.

537
00:51:02,785 --> 00:51:08,365
so does that not all they look at those are usually the three things were most interested in

538
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:13,365
in in evaluating some of on function. I think it's on another five.

539
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:19,145
so I don't know. love you. so

540
00:51:19,145 --> 00:51:25,103
my daughter is Donna Norman. I'm people that

541
00:51:25,103 --> 00:51:31,243
I have never had anyone to see that you're aware of the list posting. you know normal. and

542
00:51:31,243 --> 00:51:37,323
you know what normal. depending on your age height

543
00:51:37,323 --> 00:51:43,823
is extreme. ready. all patients normal don't actually use the wait.

544
00:51:43,823 --> 00:51:48,983
it depends on a bit on your race and yesterday. I message

545
00:51:48,983 --> 00:51:54,083
you're already in gender. okay. so. so do

546
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:59,123
that all time. we have all your expectations and actually I wanted to

547
00:51:59,123 --> 00:52:04,283
ask you. well you probably want to use for various reasons

548
00:52:04,283 --> 00:52:09,403
because he stable to place a very large population to touch ups and hang out. I

549
00:52:09,403 --> 00:52:14,883
talked about earlier you know that there's these repeated survey samples

550
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:21,163
of US population to see what the hell status is. so wanna that people do from

551
00:52:21,163 --> 00:52:26,477
by the way. I didn't say that either. you don't know that message condition

552
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:31,877
which is find out it already anyways. you just do it while you do it repeatedly

553
00:52:31,877 --> 00:52:37,337
and look at whether the person

554
00:52:37,337 --> 00:52:42,397
giving you better. but if I could help with it. you wanna see on two different maneuver

555
00:52:42,397 --> 00:52:48,217
that are very close to each other. so at case okay. I have with this person is too long function.

556
00:52:48,217 --> 00:52:53,397
at this moment. alright. so. so I haven't

557
00:52:53,397 --> 00:52:58,477
gotten Robert. hey if you can do. which again people hardly

558
00:52:58,477 --> 00:53:03,477
ever do for field studies the yard because it's expensive and hard

559
00:53:03,477 --> 00:53:09,175
to do right and text time. but you can look at absolute long time Mimi

560
00:53:09,175 --> 00:53:14,835
here. long time

561
00:53:14,835 --> 00:53:20,535
no long. bye. see what what I do out

562
00:53:20,535 --> 00:53:25,855
and there we're gonna be interested in. total on the path of your TLC

563
00:53:25,855 --> 00:53:30,995
that's not tender loving care. we're gonna be interested in residual by. so tell us

564
00:53:30,995 --> 00:53:36,195
best how much when you call back.

565
00:53:36,195 --> 00:53:41,655
okay. this is the bottom is when you blog not share as you possibly can.

566
00:53:41,655 --> 00:53:46,695
how much air is still left in your lines. that's right free digital and so I got a

567
00:53:46,695 --> 00:53:52,175
thing to get measured there at the fusion capacity. so you know you have

568
00:53:52,175 --> 00:53:57,215
all of our performing pretty well. you can

569
00:53:57,215 --> 00:54:03,175
call

570
00:54:03,175 --> 00:54:09,552
between the product from now. I know I probably remember the counselors

571
00:54:09,552 --> 00:54:15,092
it's you said another thing is wrong as well. but there can be a problem

572
00:54:15,092 --> 00:54:20,992
with gas exchange that's due to other things they have do just with with the basement membrane.

573
00:54:20,992 --> 00:54:26,132
so D L C O is the CEO and there's carbon monoxide. we don't

574
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:31,772
use much. love you.

575
00:54:31,772 --> 00:54:36,892
bye. two. and the reason are you tired outside because it it normally moves across

576
00:54:36,892 --> 00:54:42,112
the basement. very very rapidly. much more rapid breathing oxygen or carbon oxide.

577
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:47,252
that's it. that's another test to look at your capacity. so here's a nice diagram this is Wanda

578
00:54:47,252 --> 00:54:52,312
probably remember. so we're now on ask me how much years

579
00:54:52,312 --> 00:54:57,512
in law. so is titles

580
00:54:57,512 --> 00:55:02,652
you. this is just normal relax reading and you actually only uses. it's

581
00:55:02,652 --> 00:55:07,832
pretty small percentage of capacity obviously we get much bigger. if you

582
00:55:07,832 --> 00:55:12,886
were exercising vigorously and this. so here's

583
00:55:12,886 --> 00:55:17,926
the first to take to keep this best they possibly can. this is where they end up and this

584
00:55:17,926 --> 00:55:23,286
is. zero. this is like nowhere and all along. so the total lung capacity

585
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:28,526
here. is that high. it's at our main leaders that is okay.

586
00:55:28,526 --> 00:55:33,646
and then the person asked help and as much as I possibly

587
00:55:33,646 --> 00:55:39,106
can would you strongly do all that you can get a little bit more if you don't do it quite so violently and

588
00:55:39,106 --> 00:55:44,586
so in the end they still have some left in a month or longer to complete the update that the residuals are you.

589
00:55:44,586 --> 00:55:52,926
okay. so I got a question for you. I just tell you. we just

590
00:55:52,926 --> 00:55:58,606
need to verify and that part two. thanks hale.

591
00:55:58,606 --> 00:56:03,786
when you have an account you have more of a problem vaccination. and as

592
00:56:03,786 --> 00:56:09,406
an example of an obstructed lung disease. so if someone has instructed one in the

593
00:56:09,406 --> 00:56:15,904
afternoon. I can come and go a different times what would you expect to

594
00:56:15,904 --> 00:56:21,044
be part of the TLC ratio to be part of the residual boil.

595
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:26,044
how much is left when you bought that she can divide it by total capacity on the chairs in the

596
00:56:26,044 --> 00:56:31,564
lobby. bye and the middle of

597
00:56:31,564 --> 00:56:39,384
normal

598
00:56:39,384 --> 00:56:45,164
floor. okay.

599
00:56:45,164 --> 00:56:50,464
okay write that who

600
00:56:50,464 --> 00:57:02,164
answers that you think I read it. you wanna tell me why.

601
00:57:02,164 --> 00:57:07,424
okay. appreciate it. we're doing absolute long time. not would you blow

602
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:12,652
up this diagram is of what inside your lungs for different time

603
00:57:12,652 --> 00:57:17,972
hi. so that RV is still inside

604
00:57:17,972 --> 00:57:22,972
your long after you bought best you can. I want you

605
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:28,852
get the office today. you tell me. alright to see how the races the entry

606
00:57:28,852 --> 00:57:33,972
weekend. can you get back to her and you can't get all

607
00:57:33,972 --> 00:57:40,152
my papers were normal. you can get this message. should

608
00:57:40,152 --> 00:57:45,832
you have done nine o'clock. the ratio are. you

609
00:57:45,832 --> 00:57:53,012
should be increased.

610
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:58,432
alright. there's other things on here but those are the big ones.

611
00:57:58,432 --> 00:58:03,932
but it's TLC and what are be interested in a ration.

612
00:58:03,932 --> 00:58:09,792
okay so this is neither important thing as well. see two diagrams up here.

613
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:14,910
so this is two different ways of looking in our back on for.

614
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:20,670
we're back on what you saw. I'll explain. that's my mobile.

615
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:26,330
they use people that are actually use the gas the Bob.

616
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:31,330
and at three two eight if you have

617
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:36,470
any reason that out to do maneuver and they can calculate how much air in

618
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:41,630
your lawn. bye. seeing how pressured in the box changes.

619
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:46,830
by using again. alright. thanks.

620
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:52,110
got a way to do it has_to do it do it. I wish and it's not quite as accurate. okay.

621
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:57,410
so that's why you know you need to Sandy set up perfectly sealed very accurately

622
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:03,250
measure and pressure to do the absolute long time. Roger you just need to go ahead and help design.

623
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:08,470
and I most of these days. must actually measure

624
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:14,016
flow and it's to get but you can do either way.

625
00:59:14,016 --> 00:59:19,816
some of them measure them directly. alright. so on this diagram.

626
00:59:19,816 --> 00:59:24,936
what you have here. you got the baby. actually thought about

627
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:30,396
this one first because it's more straight forward. so this is a time and second and this is volume

628
00:59:30,396 --> 00:59:35,896
in leaders. so this is Jane at Forest Experts revenue. what you saw him in June

629
00:59:35,896 --> 00:59:41,336
and Time zeros when you started sailing and

630
00:59:41,336 --> 00:59:46,516
so one second after you start whatever the volume issue fixed hail with that

631
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:52,330
hit come over here. it's looks like about maybe four point three liter. that you're

632
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:58,270
one four five two one second. okay.

633
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:04,330
and this really should have an ass in front of it because it's supposed to be a forced maneuver.

634
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:09,590
the Ford if I don't to pass the SEC. there's a total amount you blew out. so guess what is

635
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:14,830
your definition you wanna be happy about. you got real data from the person in sales

636
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:19,950
but it's really easy to get married for. it's probably data and it's

637
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:25,090
very useful if you get good it's probably due date. as part of what why you talk about this.

638
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:33,030
you want this to be perfectly flat right. you want the person be selling any more

639
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:38,170
because then you think we said at noon or I have the two four side of capacity. that's still

640
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:43,390
going up and stuff on Wednesday. okay. so that's.

641
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:48,731
so I am versus time. bye. what's often more revealing is to do flow

642
01:00:48,731 --> 01:00:54,351
rate versus via next hail. so this

643
01:00:54,351 --> 01:01:00,211
is normal on this as a typical picture we got a very fast. take off.

644
01:01:00,211 --> 01:01:05,291
here's the tickets for Tori Flores. this case is about eleven to twelve

645
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:10,451
liters per second. just in Centennial. right that's where it takes and then

646
01:01:10,451 --> 01:01:15,571
use it should come down in almost a straight line. pretty smoothly. and by the time

647
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:20,651
you get out to something like five to six liters. you. if you have normal but it's not

648
01:01:20,651 --> 01:01:26,091
blowing out air any more because you did failed everything in detail. that's why I went back to zero. okay.

649
01:01:26,091 --> 01:01:31,091
and we're not. this is in relation to done but we got to pay much attention

650
01:01:31,091 --> 01:01:36,111
in relation to those cars. when you read about these long property next

651
01:01:36,111 --> 01:01:41,431
election you're interested in. right about things like construction of the level of vocal card.

652
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:47,031
then you're very interested in in relation but we won't spend a_lot_of time on that. alright. so.

653
01:01:47,031 --> 01:01:53,281
so that's like that looks like normal and here is abnormal.

654
01:01:53,281 --> 01:01:58,301
so first two. alright.

655
01:01:58,301 --> 01:02:03,501
so these are the flows one. we just looked at the one I just mentioned second. I need

656
01:02:03,501 --> 01:02:08,921
to. first part is with Phyllis about instructions at one one seven

657
01:02:08,921 --> 01:02:14,901
zero stretch and we're only gonna look at the expiration stuff it's about zero lines. so

658
01:02:14,901 --> 01:02:19,901
this person takes off. actually they go up a little bit

659
01:02:19,901 --> 01:02:25,261
slower and I probably should. they don't get nearly. bye. peace.

660
01:02:25,261 --> 01:02:30,621
alright. talk to you later. bye-bye.

661
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:36,041
okay. well. and then the other thing that said tell tell

662
01:02:36,041 --> 01:02:41,721
you see how wanna Bob. I was messing this is almost a straight line.

663
01:02:41,721 --> 01:02:47,121
right normal long. you see this one. it's time Kate right. that's

664
01:02:47,121 --> 01:02:52,273
that's payments and the boat have been instructed long. anyway looks like and if you

665
01:02:52,273 --> 01:02:57,533
have very severe disease. dad. you have a

666
01:02:57,533 --> 01:03:03,353
great week. your peak flow is decreased that much more. and you

667
01:03:03,353 --> 01:03:08,833
come back down slowly as well. so

668
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:16,633
there's one thing to do tomorrow. okay.

669
01:03:16,633 --> 01:03:24,573
you call me. I

670
01:03:24,573 --> 01:03:29,953
you have something wrong with me. painful. yeah. you're right. well

671
01:03:29,953 --> 01:03:36,213
you not have it here. got a message.

672
01:03:36,213 --> 01:03:41,653
if you have certain laundry. you maybe in about ten fifteen seconds with no problem

673
01:03:41,653 --> 01:03:46,753
because you still have. Eric Jackie. I

674
01:03:46,753 --> 01:03:52,097
can't remember if this is on here. yes nine. okay

675
01:03:52,097 --> 01:03:57,617
yeah it's not so when you go back. so someone with the instructor lung disease.

676
01:03:57,617 --> 01:04:02,757
instead it looking like that. it would take up much more slowly because they have instructions

677
01:04:02,757 --> 01:04:07,937
and when you got out the nine seconds if it's bad instructed to see. it would not be flat. it would still

678
01:04:07,937 --> 01:04:12,957
be going up because I still haven't got all the air out because they have an instruction there. so

679
01:04:12,957 --> 01:04:18,217
call my cell. alright. so here the people

680
01:04:18,217 --> 01:04:23,237
with here just restricted busy probably busy. I just had one

681
01:04:23,237 --> 01:04:28,297
more thing. okay. so when you get this from a tree. the

682
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:33,377
hallmark of stockton disease. our big Hallmark. it's

683
01:04:33,377 --> 01:04:38,537
fifty. S if you want think the ratio is decreased with me. fraction of

684
01:04:38,537 --> 01:04:44,057
the falling out and blow out the table. it's much lower than it should.

685
01:04:44,057 --> 01:04:49,077
have trucks in there that's important to remember.

686
01:04:49,077 --> 01:04:54,209
so you have_to be one it's usually decreased and

687
01:04:54,209 --> 01:05:00,349
yeah PC. gonna be normal or decrease but it's not decrease as much as as if you want.

688
01:05:00,349 --> 01:05:05,509
yes you're doing after a long time. you like your University Michigan and you have a lab

689
01:05:05,509 --> 01:05:11,729
body box you can answer them because it is useful if you wanna understand what's going on. clinically

690
01:05:11,729 --> 01:05:16,929
Hallmark is that the residual body and divided by the tele capacity. how much

691
01:05:16,929 --> 01:05:22,649
about the lawn when you Bob as much as you can compared to how much is in your lives when you can help us as you can

692
01:05:22,649 --> 01:05:28,629
that increase because of air traffic on vaccination. and

693
01:05:28,629 --> 01:05:33,789
usually boat RV and the TLC increase to Chelsea's office increase

694
01:05:33,789 --> 01:05:38,949
because of air trapping. bye the process is not increased nearly as much as the residual

695
01:05:38,949 --> 01:05:44,049
by the fusion capacity might be low. it might be normal.

696
01:05:44,049 --> 01:05:49,409
remember that's that. imagine how fast you exchanging gas between

697
01:05:49,409 --> 01:05:54,473
the lines of line. alright. so

698
01:05:54,473 --> 01:05:59,913
Alan instructor restrictions on disease. if I long this is mom.

699
01:05:59,913 --> 01:06:06,773
usually you have power and

700
01:06:06,773 --> 01:06:12,293
more. take care. alright.

701
01:06:12,293 --> 01:06:17,293
so this is what this is what it would look like in this case

702
01:06:17,293 --> 01:06:23,373
there's a normal line down here. you got to be a restriction air flow. so the person

703
01:06:23,373 --> 01:06:28,479
can't get nearly as much of a. ask for Tori flow so don't go that high

704
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:33,599
but it comes back down to the whole loop. looks small but it doesn't remember right.

705
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:38,879
we said my name started is easier. look on cable still a straight but it's small

706
01:06:38,879 --> 01:06:43,899
dog beach very strict disease. so the hallmark of

707
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:50,099
restricted see that you had to say it's restricted to see from Bronson

708
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:55,499
DC. so compare

709
01:06:55,499 --> 01:07:01,019
to somebody. bye.

710
01:07:01,019 --> 01:07:06,399
bye. normal people cigarettes no longer. what are they able to do.

711
01:07:06,399 --> 01:07:11,479
so compared to somebody the same page. high gender and race that

712
01:07:11,479 --> 01:07:16,919
this an is you who had not read that long.

713
01:07:16,919 --> 01:07:21,979
it's really large group such people because it's a protection equation. how did you do. compared

714
01:07:21,979 --> 01:07:27,039
to that. so when it. so for all these when I say decrease NBC's. it's really

715
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:33,262
decreased happy. date

716
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:38,462
Tom that's it. so

717
01:07:38,462 --> 01:07:43,562
and this thing is. you got the FCC is a decrease but it's very

718
01:07:43,562 --> 01:07:48,662
important notice debt ratio. if you wanna the ratio. how much what

719
01:07:48,662 --> 01:07:53,842
fraction of that you able to get out the first second is gonna be there. if it's Paris check to see

720
01:07:53,842 --> 01:07:59,662
this could be either a normal even increase. remember a minute ago.

721
01:07:59,662 --> 01:08:05,402
this big part as well. this

722
01:08:05,402 --> 01:08:10,702
is where it's even know that this is decreased it's normal

723
01:08:10,702 --> 01:08:15,722
or increase. for long time. the hallmark is that total

724
01:08:15,722 --> 01:08:20,742
on capacity is decreased Tom area you can get into your lungs

725
01:08:20,742 --> 01:08:25,882
and the RV to Chelsea re shows either normal or decreased. we have

726
01:08:25,882 --> 01:08:31,122
been instructed to see that was increased. alright. alright. so

727
01:08:31,122 --> 01:08:36,822
I'm realizing as I stand here saying all the things it sounds like. why they going I don't know not about this.

728
01:08:36,822 --> 01:08:42,282
again three going on and on about this is Raji. is your single strongest

729
01:08:42,282 --> 01:08:47,322
subject is to just quickly evaluate what some of our function is like and how

730
01:08:47,322 --> 01:08:52,342
you doing. that moment in time. and if the two of you. all the time.

731
01:08:52,342 --> 01:08:58,982
we're doing respiratory e-mail object. whether it's for environmental or occupation.

732
01:08:58,982 --> 01:09:04,342
this is extremely useful to look at.

733
01:09:04,342 --> 01:09:09,842
okay. so we talked about this form and instructions are to

734
01:09:09,842 --> 01:09:15,042
this thing I didn't say bye anyway you can get it next picture

735
01:09:15,042 --> 01:09:20,862
car. I just think that she she can have a picture referral for options on prescriptions.

736
01:09:20,862 --> 01:09:26,302
we won't we're not gonna go into all the details right now. alright. so asthma

737
01:09:26,302 --> 01:09:33,174
and COPD chronic obstructed primary disease which is conversation to see chronic bronchitis

738
01:09:33,174 --> 01:09:38,474
you I know that it's difficult to improve the air out_of the long. you know that our PTO

739
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:44,134
fees increase. and give me general vibration.

740
01:09:44,134 --> 01:09:49,134
alright. bye. bye. there's a_lot_of agents taking work

741
01:09:49,134 --> 01:09:54,154
places. that can cause this problem as well.

742
01:09:54,154 --> 01:09:59,214
so my restrictions. so you got a vision in transit law Franklin.

743
01:09:59,214 --> 01:10:04,434
you don't recommend the big long fancy word for tissue or actual tissue

744
01:10:04,434 --> 01:10:11,174
floor. okay. you got lesions today too long itself.

745
01:10:11,174 --> 01:10:16,214
that decreases compliance makes it harder for the longer expands the list

746
01:10:16,214 --> 01:10:23,354
and restricted and purified brought in someone and never smoke cigarettes..

747
01:10:23,354 --> 01:10:28,374
hey got a garden variety still process. it's not gotten real

748
01:10:28,374 --> 01:10:34,076
complicated I'll explain a little bit later when you get

749
01:10:34,076 --> 01:10:39,296
most likely you will be Mister

750
01:10:39,296 --> 01:10:44,576
Hatter. just wanna know if you're also cigarette smoker. you're also

751
01:10:44,576 --> 01:10:53,456
gonna get a mixed picture. looks on that was somewhat restrictive.

752
01:10:53,456 --> 01:10:58,496
so here's always examples of things like because only restriction we're gonna talk about

753
01:10:58,496 --> 01:11:04,156
access to us as soon a call us as you can even get problems from Helen about how

754
01:11:04,156 --> 01:11:09,196
hard metal disease is actually an issue around here just a I'm not busy.

755
01:11:09,196 --> 01:11:14,996
when you make two attempts. like for the auto industry.

756
01:11:14,996 --> 01:11:20,236
sheet. you actually you used Thompson

757
01:11:20,236 --> 01:11:25,516
carbide with a small percent of cobalt and you see

758
01:11:25,516 --> 01:11:30,556
that it's form and it's very far. it's not quite as part of the diamond but

759
01:11:30,556 --> 01:11:35,876
it's like right behind other metal. and will cut the palm all

760
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:41,176
cotton records and help my workers causes all kinds of problems. bye.

761
01:11:41,176 --> 01:11:47,056
let's call her I. both both

762
01:11:47,056 --> 01:11:52,056
side process but also can call as well and we'll talk about hyper sensitivity Newman

763
01:11:52,056 --> 01:11:57,896
and I this as well that's it that's a allergic disease and the long

764
01:11:57,896 --> 01:12:06,256
the tissue disease and air ways. okay.

765
01:12:06,256 --> 01:12:11,276
bye. and I already said just that you can get it. you might be an obstructed remix pattern as the person is

766
01:12:11,276 --> 01:12:19,636
more than one thing going on that's causing a line disease.

767
01:12:19,636 --> 01:12:26,296
so sorry about the occupational work related for Maggie this is tomorrow. so COPD

768
01:12:26,296 --> 01:12:37,170
is a big issue..

769
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:42,310
this is from the work environment but there's also evidence that just started garden

770
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:47,910
variety. just in hell and a_lot_of dust over time you know it doesn't have some

771
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:53,890
toxic effect that has_to do with his composition. that even that

772
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:58,970
can increase your risk for having COPD over many years. so that's important now that you

773
01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:05,510
can get you get COPD just like cigarettes smoking from work for not smoking

774
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:11,070
we're gonna talk about that. hi this is Julie. give me logic diseases we're gonna talk about lung cancer

775
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:17,890
and we're gonna talk about these dust related diseases. so I'm

776
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:22,890
not gonna go. I think through all this detail. reason you don't

777
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:28,710
have_to know the definition the reason that that this is a long time

778
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:35,150
here on for the Mark Twain you call. call you.

779
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:41,350
I think I'll spare you on that one.

780
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:46,490
but it's saying here at COPD. happy summer. your reversible components needed.

781
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:52,730
you know if you just wanna pass on this and not having too bad attack and inhaler albuterol.

782
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:58,270
they made clear completely and so I have normal on functions. but this is.

783
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:03,370
you may get it. please I wanna see if you deem it you won't get them all the way to normal. because they

784
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:09,278
have a part that probably not gonna go away.

785
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:14,678
so I we also use the term chronic bronchitis and sometimes and that.

786
01:14:14,678 --> 01:14:19,778
so that you're a patient. the Bronx time. and usually

787
01:14:19,778 --> 01:14:24,917
that's what you see a_lot_of pop pop. usually quote

788
01:14:24,917 --> 01:14:30,598
the quote we have_to do some slam. and there's a definition.

789
01:14:30,598 --> 01:14:35,798
that is based on the questionnaire

790
01:14:35,798 --> 01:14:40,838
and questionnaire and he's all over the world. so that's why it says we're gonna do fine you

791
01:14:40,838 --> 01:14:47,598
was having chronic bronchitis. if you have a chronic for copper doctors names with

792
01:14:47,598 --> 01:14:52,678
for at least three of the year. because if you have a problem where in the winter the another month at least

793
01:14:52,678 --> 01:14:57,738
two consecutive years. if you have that need conference.

794
01:14:57,738 --> 01:15:04,023
if you have questions that way and cigarette smoking some of the single most common cause again

795
01:15:04,023 --> 01:15:09,423
so emphysema has is a different definition. yeah do it permanent

796
01:15:09,423 --> 01:15:15,403
in large minute gas exchange airways distraction out_of your wall. big holes in your lungs

797
01:15:15,403 --> 01:15:21,383
and because of you get instructions from that because of that you have

798
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:26,743
more dynamic class when you ask hail. the last gas exchange for a job

799
01:15:26,743 --> 01:15:31,743
at my job the over surface any more and so you have a couple

800
01:15:31,743 --> 01:15:37,303
of reasons be short of breath. I can't remember the name.

801
01:15:37,303 --> 01:15:42,303
I'm not really tired and hot. that's why we need

802
01:15:42,303 --> 01:15:47,903
to try to say something. e-mail something about chronic bronchitis. different reasons I had trouble

803
01:15:47,903 --> 01:15:53,283
breathing. but usually clinically. you just say that COPD which is

804
01:15:53,283 --> 01:15:58,343
which covers both of those. alright so this

805
01:15:58,343 --> 01:16:03,724
is normal versus answers medicine. calling to shoo

806
01:16:03,724 --> 01:16:08,824
so here's the bigger picture. you know I got lots

807
01:16:08,824 --> 01:16:14,144
hold. not all night tell me all I hear is more magnified. so you had always

808
01:16:14,144 --> 01:16:19,384
nice little air sack on the line. just had to structure. I love you all bye.

809
01:16:19,384 --> 01:16:24,523
missing. this is

810
01:16:24,523 --> 01:16:30,483
talked about natural history and COPD focus on the natural history. he COPD

811
01:16:30,483 --> 01:16:35,664
five five cigarettes smoking. so here is

812
01:16:35,664 --> 01:16:40,904
your STD one how much you about the first second and leaders.

813
01:16:40,904 --> 01:16:46,164
and here's how old you are age twenty five to seventy five and refer people abnormal

814
01:16:46,164 --> 01:16:51,463
once never smoked. there is a date and be in this Dan. I mean it's it

815
01:16:51,463 --> 01:16:57,204
has_to be just the front yard and so I but in advance and you know it is

816
01:16:57,204 --> 01:17:02,844
probably a straight line isn't quite right. if you get up to my age. you will function more quickly.

817
01:17:02,844 --> 01:17:08,374
when you do it a young age. start of Ken it's Pete. around

818
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:13,833
twenty eight twenty two twenty five and start probably going down. I cut out faster

819
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:19,154
when you get up around sixty or so now. if this

820
01:17:19,154 --> 01:17:24,194
person has been smoking thirty cigarettes a day for years. they may bought

821
01:17:24,194 --> 01:17:29,594
the same pass. if you're not too susceptible to cigarettes but they're gonna have us non-functioning.

822
01:17:29,594 --> 01:17:35,914
if you're one of our lucky people small have a chance. see you all.

823
01:17:35,914 --> 01:17:41,074
they're more susceptible to it. say they have a really fast decrease. you see the

824
01:17:41,074 --> 01:17:46,134
blind here that says Disney having difficulty reading activities daily learning. so

825
01:17:46,134 --> 01:17:52,274
this is basically saying when you're actually wanna get some

826
01:17:52,274 --> 01:17:57,814
time sheet for

827
01:17:57,814 --> 01:18:02,814
kids. really probably by that

828
01:18:02,814 --> 01:18:08,018
point so you let you that and then the other thing is on here is pointing out.

829
01:18:08,018 --> 01:18:13,038
even if you've been a smoker and you're very susceptible. if you stop smoking. you wanna

830
01:18:13,038 --> 01:18:18,278
go back to normal. but you did high. start to look much more like

831
01:18:18,278 --> 01:18:23,338
this. this phone mobile. well I cannot smoker. so instead of getting that

832
01:18:23,338 --> 01:18:28,418
condition. where you can't do hardly anything before you sixty five you might get it after seventy

833
01:18:28,418 --> 01:18:34,378
five. so it's always good to stop smoking. if you can.

834
01:18:34,378 --> 01:18:39,498
alright. and know the definition I think.

835
01:18:39,498 --> 01:18:45,698
so common. probably everybody. this is easy for people.

836
01:18:45,698 --> 01:18:50,758
so I think everyone knows people have. they don't have it. so but it's at

837
01:18:50,758 --> 01:18:55,818
the Sonic right. you this message if there's an agent or situation that triggers

838
01:18:55,818 --> 01:19:01,198
and you get proper construction. just call breathing. but

839
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:06,784
you maybe had a perfectly normal lung function. when you have an asthma attack

840
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:12,003
Lot of operations are affected. we call extra anything. if the agent

841
01:19:12,003 --> 01:19:17,244
that you sent the time to find. bye. it's Cathy that. we'll

842
01:19:17,244 --> 01:19:22,684
talk more about this how about as mother that usually give a call. he related

843
01:19:22,684 --> 01:19:27,904
in terms of what happens. high Insurance again. was was not

844
01:19:27,904 --> 01:19:32,963
allergic. so people get it. they have asked the guy at the tax

845
01:19:32,963 --> 01:19:38,284
I'm trying to exercise vigorously for breathing and very cold there. either reaction

846
01:19:38,284 --> 01:19:43,399
emotional stress. so sometimes I talked about

847
01:19:43,399 --> 01:19:48,739
so is also respiratory tract cancers. lung cancer

848
01:19:48,739 --> 01:19:53,999
is the biggest one biggest killer. to return my parts back not the most common conflict.

849
01:19:53,999 --> 01:20:00,079
here's a test on a complete list. here's the list of occupational we would provide additional exposure.

850
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:05,259
better known on cancer. this is from excess premium on

851
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:10,539
six Main Street. three males date is not the person engine nickel

852
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:15,599
compound arsenic and hanging compound. so parts and things like

853
01:20:15,599 --> 01:20:21,219
that. you know people that are laying

854
01:20:21,219 --> 01:20:27,059
laying on asphalt all day long in getting life coming off and half of that sort of thing.

855
01:20:27,059 --> 01:20:33,419
so and hear that and the left chest is a

856
01:20:33,419 --> 01:20:38,419
large lung cancer tumor and it's radio graph.

857
01:20:38,419 --> 01:20:43,563
you can also get of course upper airway cancers.

858
01:20:43,563 --> 01:20:49,063
various times. the most common causes the job hydration again it's been smoking.

859
01:20:49,063 --> 01:20:54,063
but you can get it from a_lot_of different agents in the work

860
01:20:54,063 --> 01:20:59,083
place. you can see a list there. even hard with job. if you do lost and you

861
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:04,203
have a job that can cause it. and this is a fixture.

862
01:21:04,203 --> 01:21:11,143
the system is developed a tumor here. alright.

863
01:21:11,143 --> 01:21:16,203
so I'll send you something in the next forty eight hours about what our plans are for this coming

864
01:21:16,203 --> 01:21:21,303
week and week after. any last questions or comments only

865
01:21:21,303 --> 01:21:26,442
covered today. you can tell Vicky about

866
01:21:26,442 --> 01:21:32,143
this. it's actually very very important. interesting.

867
01:21:32,143 --> 01:21:38,063
I spoke to possibly doing that and we're gonna talk about

868
01:21:38,063 --> 01:21:43,932
the next actions.. at this time. so talk to you some songs

869
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:49,152
this is the law major issue. okay.
