1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:09,470
I want to try a question for Scott concerning business models, because we're talking here.

2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,570
I have to say, I think it's really terrific to have the focused, individual, patient,

3
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:20,269
personalized medicine and then the idea of population health, but kind of within a health care system.

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,670
And then over here, we've got the whole. The whole world and the whole world.

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:30,499
Sure. That's right. So the business model that Marianne was talking about is a challenging one to get a real focus on

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,480
population health within what we call health care systems that are basically medical care systems.

7
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,660
Personalized medicine has always seemed to me as having the opposite kind of set

8
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,800
of incentives from what we see as the business model for most of health care,

9
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:52,100
for pharmaceuticals in general. For example, pharmaceutical companies want blockbusters.

10
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:00,050
They want a drug that treats a huge range of people who have varying degrees of a very common condition.

11
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,820
Personalized medicine is very different. How do we fit that into a business model?

12
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:16,430
So I think there's lots of ways to to fit that in, and there's been lots of successful ways to fit that in in terms of business success.

13
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,960
And so I think exactly as you said, most pharmaceutical companies are looking for a blockbuster drug.

14
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:28,130
And again, sort of speaking in cancer, that can be really hard to find a blockbuster drug.

15
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:37,100
There was actually a recent cancer or a recent drug that was approved for a subset of patients with lung cancer.

16
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,320
On the day the approval was announced,

17
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:47,870
the pharmaceutical companies stock dropped because it was only approved in a subset of lung patients who had the molecular marker.

18
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,960
And so that that shows that that's what analysts were hoping that they were going to have, and that was priced in.

19
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:03,220
On the other hand, a different pharmaceutical company testing a very similar drug and a very similar patient population did not pre

20
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:10,190
specify and select patients based on the molecular test and their drug failed overall and their stock dropped as well.

21
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:15,409
So I think there's lots of ways you can actually incorporate that.

22
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:22,220
And there are companies that are developing now and they're certainly much more of the smaller biotechs than pharma,

23
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:29,389
large pharma that are focused on we're going to find the 5% of lung cancer that we know this is the molecular change.

24
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,920
We can make a great drug to that and we expect to have very strong responses.

25
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,409
And so we don't need to spend as much doing a very large phase one,

26
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:45,799
phase two and phase three trial, taking years to do and complete that and get approval.

27
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,120
And instead, we're going to find the subset of patients. We're going to spend more money to find those patients.

28
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,820
And we can do a much smaller trial and get the drug approved even from a phase one study.

29
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:03,200
Wow. That was speaking as an all payer. That's going to be an enormously expensive drug when that's when that goes to market.

30
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,030
Yes. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

31
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:13,610
But I you know, I think that speaks to our health care system where cost of the drug is not factored in to whether the drug gets approved or not,

32
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:20,240
and largely whether particularly from the public, Medicare or Medicaid, whether the drug is covered.

33
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:26,490
Yeah. And that's very different than in other systems where the cost benefit is incorporated.

34
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:32,329
Yeah. So and even now, some of the not just looking at subsets of the population but some of the brand new.

35
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:37,790
So immunotherapies, we're going to take the body's own immune system and let it help fight cancer.

36
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,729
And that's really been a focus and just incredible benefits for patients, some of which had some diseases.

37
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:49,790
For example, melanoma, once that sort of spread from the primary site, almost uniformly fatal.

38
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,020
There are now patients that are five or ten years out after immunotherapy that are probably cured.

39
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:01,070
So incredible potential for benefit for that drug. A combination of two drugs that turn on the immune system.

40
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,400
$200,000 a year for that drug. Yeah.

41
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:11,450
And so the question, though, is, you know, you have a real chance that patients are not only going to benefit, but maybe cured.

42
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,660
So how much should they be able to charge for that?

43
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,150
And that's what when you hear people say, well, we have the cure for cancer.

44
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,590
Pharmaceutical companies don't want it. You know, they do.

45
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,160
And they would have it and they would charge hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars.

46
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,020
And maybe you can make a good argument that they should or you can make an argument that, well, they should for that.

47
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,300
But for these drugs that only allow people to live a few months longer, they shouldn't be able to charge very much for that.

48
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:41,960
This is this is going to be a huge public policy debate because we're already at 18% of gross domestic product for health care.

49
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:48,709
And you add these drugs. And many consumers now have very high co-pays and deductibles and they're going to have to pay for it.

50
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:55,640
So we're going to have a lot of haves and have nots, I think in that model where some people won't be able to afford even their co-pays.

51
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:03,620
Yeah. Wow. That's going to be a real challenge. Will that support with the subpopulations targeted for certain drugs, are they found?

52
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:11,410
Globally or are they found amongst the top 10% of Western countries earners?

53
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:18,830
Right. So it seems like there would be an incentive there to look for diseases and target.

54
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,160
Therapies for diseases to people who can pay for them. Yeah.

55
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,840
So is that a reasonable statement? It is. And so it's the cancer, again, provides a really great example in that area.

56
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:38,680
So some of the molecular changes that occur in lung cancer are much more frequent in Asian populations in Asia.

57
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:48,340
And so for a while, the FDA wanted the vast majority, if not all of the patients, to be treated for a drug in a clinical trial to be done in the U.S.

58
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:59,050
And that's changed. So the the specific alteration I'm talking about is about 5 to 10% in Asia and maybe 1 to 5% in the U.S.

59
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:06,850
And so if you're a pharmaceutical company and you have to screen thousands of patients to find the patients to go into the clinical trial,

60
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,560
it is worth it to go open that clinical trial in Asia.

61
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,850
And actually, for one of these, the vast majority of the patients that were treated on this sort of the pivotal

62
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:20,230
trial that led to the approval were found and were treated in actually Korea.

63
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,629
And so pharma will certainly go over there and will do that.

64
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,030
And then the issue is a lot of these, you know,

65
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:37,480
they they have to make their money in the U.S. And so that's why we pay more for for drugs in the US than we do than other countries do.

66
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,860
But certainly there are certain populations that may have different frequencies of these alterations.

67
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:47,469
And we kind of again, we're so sort of hyper focused on the US population and the types of actually even the

68
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,879
people that come to say an academic medicine academic medical center like U of M,

69
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,430
they're much more likely to get this kind of testing and to have the really comprehensive assessment

70
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:03,010
done than patients that are in a rural community who don't have access to that kind of of testing.

71
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,779
And, of course, you're touching on one of the big problems in our health care system is the,

72
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,820
uh, the diversity of responses that we see in different parts of the system.

73
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,960
I must say, I'm going to start stuffing my piggybank to save up for when I need the $200,000 for the test or what have you.

74
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,440
But but it's it's fascinating.

75
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,999
It's intriguing. And it's worrisome. Something that the students in this course have heard throughout the course is that we do

76
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,260
spend a whole lot more on our health care system than any other country in the world.

77
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:41,650
And yet, if you look at the OECD, countries were ranked roughly in the middle of them in terms of standard health outcomes.

78
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:49,070
And we just know that there are a lot of public health issues, population health issues that aren't getting addressed.

79
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,680
So it's this is going to be a tough one for some time to come.

80
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,899
You know, this this is really the core challenge in health care, right?

81
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,969
Because every other country in the world spends far more on social services than the US does.

82
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:08,500
Right. So they spend more on child care, early childhood development, on housing and food and those kinds of things than we don't.

83
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:13,240
And yet we spend a tremendous amount on very high tech care.

84
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:20,020
And for some people, you know, it's the US is the only place that's doing this kind of innovative work.

85
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,900
Right. And we're supplying that for the rest of the world. But other countries have have made different priorities.

86
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:32,870
They want to do more funding of those basic services, prevention services, and less on this high tech end of things.

87
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:38,680
So it's a real dilemma. So it really intrigues me about this is getting back to the climate change area.

88
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,950
Climate change really is a public health issue with a big P and a big age.

89
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,480
Absolutely right.

90
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:55,660
And personalized medicine sounds like it has public health policy implications that are huge, but it's focusing narrowly on individuals.

91
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:02,640
And I'm just wondering when when you're listening to this is somebody who's focused on climate change.

92
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,420
How do you react to this kind of discussion? What is what do you make you think about?

93
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:14,830
So it makes me I mean, it actually makes me think about, uh, kind of differentiating, um,

94
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:22,299
health crises into kind of long term chronic versus short term acute personal versus public.

95
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:30,880
So I'm thinking, okay, if you're, if you're stricken with cancer, that's something that will be diagnosed at some point.

96
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,980
Hopefully you will have, you know, will be slow growing and you will have years to treat it.

97
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:44,259
And and so there's a, you know, the time constant, if you will, for responding to it is longer and it's very personal.

98
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:49,300
And I can imagine, you know, if we're talking about a disease outbreak, you know, it's unanticipated.

99
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,980
And if it's a viral disease where the response would be a vaccine, then you have, you know,

100
00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:01,599
a much shorter time constant over which you need to develop that vaccine or you need to do something in order to quell the spread of the disease.

101
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:09,790
And so I for for me, I just I don't see them necessarily as in conflict, being in conflict as just being operating on different time.

102
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:18,729
Right. But you know, what you were talking about earlier about pathogens now developing that didn't exist before or were suppressed by the permafrost,

103
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:24,889
for example. You know, you're you're almost talking about a situation where if we don't invest in the prevention,

104
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:30,200
in the broader sense and the public health protections for stopping this from happening,

105
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,450
we're going to release a whole bunch of diseases that are going to end up needing these new treatments.

106
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,780
And we're again, we're not having that dialog about how do we how do we spend our resources.

107
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:47,780
We should be where we should we invest. Yeah. In order to minimize cost and minimize harm.

108
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

109
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:56,569
That's a really the scenario you painted before was so scary about this, about these new pathogens developing and coming out into the environment.

110
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:01,340
It's kind of, you know, makes you think of Ebola and all those viruses that are now, you know, much more prevalent.

111
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:13,190
Sure. And and certainly in this day and age and going forward, you know, fortunately for for people not directly impacted by Ebola,

112
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:18,110
it generally isn't well isn't and wasn't transmissible long distances.

113
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,530
But, you know, if you look at SA's sudden acute respiratory syndrome and Murres,

114
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,829
you know you have people who are infected and and you know, those are the only viral diseases that have that characteristic.

115
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,920
But, you know, they travel halfway around the world. Right.

116
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:38,029
Yeah. Potentially infecting all the people that are around them on the plane and infecting people far away from the initial outbreak.

117
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,929
So I think, you know, kind of the again,

118
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:50,120
it's it's it's so much more complicated than perhaps a disease outbreak might have been, you know, a century or two ago.

119
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:57,380
Yeah. Yeah. You could also imagine that we probably have the technology now where we could go to the Arctic or areas of permafrost.

120
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:02,690
We could use incredible cutting edge next generation sequencing to find out what are all those microbes?

121
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,829
We could make vaccines, several of them, if that was an important priority.

122
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,400
And you really see that, you know, that we're sort of the Zika virus outbreak,

123
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:16,790
that there had been work on a Zika virus vaccine that was done before, but that wasn't at that time a priority.

124
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:23,149
And then the problem is with, I think particularly we talk about these sort of crisis health care things as they become an immediate priority.

125
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:28,610
And then the public doesn't understand why we can't just have a vaccine turned on tomorrow.

126
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,480
Right. And we probably have the technology to, you know, any any new outbreak.

127
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,510
We will have the technology to track that at incredible detail.

128
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:42,540
We can figure out what the viruses, you know, almost immediately there are now three or four FDA approved tests for Zika virus.

129
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,510
You know, that that that accelerate that you can really compress that timeline when that becomes a priority.

130
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:56,240
And but, you know, your point is so right when we spend as a public sector when I was in state government and when you look at the federal government,

131
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,020
we spend money on crises. You know, I think we talk about climate change.

132
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,350
We're spending money on hurricanes and repairing places.

133
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,479
But prevention and early intervention, those are those always get cut first, right.

134
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,480
Because they're not the most immediate need for resources.

135
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:18,390
And historically, we've not been, especially in this country, not been willing to tax ourselves to invest for the future.

136
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:26,030
Right. And that's another difference with other countries. They have much higher taxes than in the US, but they believe in making those investments.

137
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:32,599
And we we don't seem to do that in this country. And if you believe the surveys, they're happier in other countries.

138
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,100
In other countries, that's right. Yeah. With the higher taxes and they're a greater concern with the health and well-being of the community.

139
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,370
Yes.
