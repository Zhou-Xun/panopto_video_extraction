1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:07,520
Okay. So let's go and get started here today.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:24,200
So just a few little logistical issues. I just want to note that the exam is just going to cover material through chapters, class notes, eight.

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:36,530
So stuff we'll discuss today. Today and and Wednesday we'll get into the sort of sensitivity analysis discussion for the direct and indirect effects,

4
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:42,049
but that's not going to be on the exam. So kind of limit it to this piece here.

5
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:54,530
That should be plenty. So also, I am I'm going to post a little thing on the quiz sections, just sort of try to global feedback on the class.

6
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,609
I apologize. I haven't done this yet. It's been on my to do list, so I just haven't gotten to it.

7
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,499
But I like I said, the first time we're doing this in person and it's the second time doing the class.

8
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:10,790
So it's still a bit of a work in progress. So I've got a little bit of informal feedback, but but maybe just get it a bit more structured.

9
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:16,009
It'll be anonymous so I can speak freely and also apologize.

10
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:21,919
They don't have the homeworks quite done and very close, but we will review those Wednesday.

11
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:29,510
I should have them posted later today. So you can see so far it's pretty good to be on top of stuff, more or less as a few issues.

12
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,470
Okay. So any questions before we push forward?

13
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:49,390
All right. So last week, we played into this definition of direct and indirect effects.

14
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:55,010
Yes. Thanks for putting your cards up. I do look at them and I'm slowly starting to get names and faces connected.

15
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:05,629
So, yeah, so we we then discussed sort of the different ways that the sort of underlying

16
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:12,740
assumptions that go into estimating these these causal from first of all,

17
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,560
finding these causal effects and then, well,

18
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,580
the defining the causal effects in the potential outcomes framework and then going through the assumptions

19
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:33,410
required to actually come up with estimates from observed data of these causal effects defined in that fashion.

20
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,590
So we come to this idea of the direct effect,

21
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:48,590
which is essentially the effect of a exposure or a treatment on an outcome that does not pass through a mediator.

22
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,810
And then the indirect effect as the effect that does pass through the mediator.

23
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:06,530
So we, we then finish up with a little discussion of of different ways to relate these to.

24
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:20,780
One of them is, of course, mediated. So if we have a linear model, then these natural, direct and natural indirect effects add up to the total effect.

25
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,050
So a natural measure is the proportion mediated.

26
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:32,569
So again, if we, we actually were starting an example which I'll get into a bit more detail in a minute,

27
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:40,160
but sort of the effect of childhood poverty on on an outcome maybe say survival at some at some age,

28
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:47,030
keeping the experience of adult poverty at the level of would have been experienced had there been no childhood poverty.

29
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,969
So that's the direct effect, right?

30
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:56,480
That's part of the childhood poverty effect that doesn't pass through the effect of putting yourself at risk for poverty as an adult.

31
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:03,260
And then the indirect effect, the effect of adult poverty among individuals fixing their childhood poverty level.

32
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:19,490
So if we could somehow fix everybody to have some common childhood poverty level and then look at this effect of adult poverty changing on survival.

33
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:29,240
So again, linear model, these add up and so proportion mediated is a logical way to think about this.

34
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:38,030
So essentially the indirect effect divided by the total effect, so the direct effect of zero.

35
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:50,120
So all of these effect is mediated and the total effect, the indirect of natural indirect effect will be equal if the natural effect is zero.

36
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,520
So the total effect equals the direct to subtract effect, proportional mediator to zero.

37
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:10,670
So when the outcome is binary, there is a definition that's not exactly a proportion, but has a kind of a flavor of that,

38
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:17,270
which is basically the odds ratio of the natural direct effect times,

39
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:24,620
the natural indirect odds ratio of minus one divided by the product of those odds ratios and minus one.

40
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:32,660
So again, the proportion mediated, if the odds ratio for the natural indirect effect is one.

41
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:42,430
So basically there's no effect. He's the mediator holding the treatment constant.

42
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,390
Then that proportion obviously should likely be zero.

43
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,470
Conversely, if the natural direct effect is one.

44
00:05:54,100 --> 00:06:00,760
So all of the effect is essentially mediated. There's if you hold a mediator constant, there's no effect of the treatment.

45
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:10,299
And this is one. And so the portion media just becomes the odds ratio, you know, minus one over odds ratio.

46
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,920
In a human, it's one or just one. So.

47
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:21,120
Again, if the outcomes where this kind of forms a proportion. Why is it so?

48
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:29,620
It is slightly more difficult to interpret. Okay, so it's a natural measure, but it's subject to limitations.

49
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,170
It can be unstable. It's a fraction.

50
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:39,890
Maybe more importantly, it's it's no longer meaningful of the natural direct effect of natural effect kind of in different directions.

51
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:47,180
In that case, it becomes a little hard to interpret in this idea of and is a bit odd because that could be negative or greater than one.

52
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,639
So it's somewhat extreme.

53
00:06:49,640 --> 00:07:01,190
I guess one might imagine the setting, but it does occasionally hurt, particularly if the effects are not well estimated a very large or very small.

54
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:08,600
So if an alternative is to consider this linear model setting is proportionate, eliminated.

55
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:27,590
So this now goes back to the control direct effect and requires the looking at the total effect minus the control direct effect that in of course,

56
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,250
those are defined at some level of mediator divided by the total effect.

57
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:39,500
So in this example, the proportion of the child poverty that could be eliminated by intervening to set everyone to the population was familiar value.

58
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:50,660
So this zero or one terms of this adult poverty experience and then and then competing that portion eliminated under that.

59
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,760
So you have the control direct effect here is equal to the total effect.

60
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,310
The mediation is basically zero. Give this control, direct effect is zero.

61
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,460
And we're basically saying it's all going through the mediator. So the question eliminated is.

62
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:18,410
Right. Sorry. So it's all the way around it. So if the control direct effect is equal to the total effect, then.

63
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,870
Right. Proportional limit. It would be one. So.

64
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,980
Sorry. He told direct effect zero. Then the proportion eliminated as one.

65
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:40,260
Right. It's all going through the meter and the control direct effect is equal to the total effect.

66
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,070
And this is zero. And so nothing's repeated. Lose a proportion eliminated to zero.

67
00:08:51,910 --> 00:09:04,070
And again, in the binary outcome, we can look essentially at the proportion eliminated as this total effect odds

68
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:12,080
ratio minus the odds ratio for the control direct effect if we have any.

69
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,540
So this control direct effect is one the odds ratio scale that's basically no control directive directive treatment.

70
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:29,170
So the portion eliminated becomes one. And again, so the control direct effect basically equals the total effect.

71
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,520
Then there's no indirect effective treatment proportional to zero.

72
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:41,589
And so these variance estimates can then be obtained, be left here through a series of Delta method, right?

73
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:50,770
So these are all functions of odds ratios and their own variance estimation components.

74
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,280
And then we could look to see how these some of these then.

75
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:04,680
Take two derivatives and compute the two territories of Delta method estimation.

76
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,210
So I think Bender will go through and does these in detail, but I'm not going to take the time for that.

77
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,760
Okay. So what I really wanted to get into here is this Alameda County study example,

78
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:25,350
because this also will bring up some or packages that could be used to do so just to get around.

79
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,200
This is a somewhat old study, but but it's good. For example,

80
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:39,180
it started in 1965 with a stratified random sample of about 7000 respondents in which essentially Oakland and

81
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:46,739
the Bay Area around there sort of covered a whole bunch of different health and health behavior conditions,

82
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:52,470
sort of an early and early kind of social epidemiology work.

83
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:59,640
And so importantly, respondents were followed into adulthood.

84
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,330
Well, young child respondents were were followed into adulthood.

85
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:19,240
And survival in the year 2000 was then obtained for the 430 for 3350 respondents, along with a few covariates here to look at to adjust for.

86
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:29,160
So so the particular question we're going to we're going to put ourselves to here is

87
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,120
to what extent adult poverty mediates the effect of childhood poverty and survival.

88
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,799
So these are all going to be binary variables, pretty much. So we're not we could fit a fancier time to event model.

89
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,190
I'm not going to get into it at this point, but we will, I think, cover that before we extend the class or at least touch on it.

90
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,250
But we're just going to use it as a single binary outcome. Survival, yes or no.

91
00:11:51,270 --> 00:12:04,889
Year 2000 which for the purposes of this, is a fairly straightforward causal interpretation of childhood poverty, because again,

92
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:14,280
binary variable is adult problem or assuming essentially you're not accounting for any sort of survival loss before adulthood.

93
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:21,810
So basically assuming that virtually everyone survived with the two experiences and then with their survival 35 years later.

94
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:32,670
And then finally, my guess age is continuous and the gender and race are going to be important.

95
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,620
Covariates, we're trying to do adjustments to kind of at least maybe hopefully approximate some of these

96
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,420
assumptions about independence of the at the counterfactual level that we need to make.

97
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:50,240
Right. But we're first going to start with this classic bear and accounting model. So this is going to be a linear model.

98
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:55,620
I'm just going to be getting some point estimates here, so I'm not going to worry about variance estimation with zero one outcomes,

99
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,920
although I could use robust variance estimate to deal with that.

100
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:09,240
So the first thing we're going to do is, is predict adult poverty as a function of childhood poverty.

101
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:15,540
And then we're going to predict survival as a function of adult poverty and childhood poverty.

102
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,060
So. Well, actually, the very first thing I'm want to do is is just look at the total effect.

103
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,570
Right. So just predicting adult survival.

104
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:36,950
On the experience of childhood poverty. So here the total effect is about -0.65 or 6.5% reduction in survival.

105
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:45,890
It's basically 83% among the children who didn't experience childhood poverty and 76.5% among those who did.

106
00:13:51,890 --> 00:14:04,459
And then if we do the bare to model so we can first of all see obviously there's a pretty strong relationship between adult poverty and child poverty.

107
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:22,040
So about 28% of the children who didn't experience poverty did experience adult poverty versus, what, 20 plus 16 or was it 44%?

108
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,700
Kids in child poverty went on to experience adult poverty.

109
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:40,590
And so if you put survival into the model and look at these independently, these effects of childhood and poverty on survival,

110
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:50,040
you can see the direct effect is obtained here as a sort of data one from the.

111
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,460
More on the outcome in an indirect effect.

112
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,100
He's basically going to take this component up here. Multiply it by adults.

113
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:13,160
Yes, you get about .007 and so proportion mediated is about 11%.

114
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,280
So in some sense, this might be the easiest thing to interpret.

115
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:30,710
It suggests about 11% of this overall effect of of poverty on survival is mediated through experiencing adult poverty.

116
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:42,650
In the other 89% would be through some other experience of childhood poverty that other than just increasing their risk for adult poverty.

117
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:53,790
Questions at that point. Just real simple. Okay.

118
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,760
So and I have an error here on the slide, so I see that in seven.

119
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,500
So of course this was unadjusted. Assume no interaction between the mediator and exposure.

120
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,330
So fitting a linear model allowing for interaction and controlling for age, race and gender.

121
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,590
Right. So now this is getting under our control direct effect.

122
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:26,960
So. Remind everybody should write it down on the board.

123
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,890
So I'm just opening the linear model here. Right.

124
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,930
So basically the control direct effect.

125
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:50,660
Well, you can see it is basically going to be beta one, this effective trial.

126
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:56,600
That is. Yes. Plus. Beat it three times a mediator value.

127
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,410
So if I set the mediator value to zero, right.

128
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:09,260
So no experience of adult poverty, then the controlled direct effect is about negative .0.005.

129
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:15,440
Just this piece here. Otherwise, I need to take the sum of these two.

130
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,090
So the interaction that dropped to the bottom here, we still have a dumb error.

131
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,730
So should be the child as he has, plus this interaction plus the spate of three.

132
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:36,120
So so it's still the the unmediated effect of childhood poverty is going to be much stronger and the poverty is present than when it's absent.

133
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:51,400
So holding that constant experience either in zero or one, the effect of poverty, the direct effect of that childhood poverty does seem to interact.

134
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:05,790
Which makes some sense. I think one might imagine that you could be sort of multiplicative effects of of of

135
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,810
childhood poverty experience if you're also having the adult poverty experience.

136
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:20,670
Okay. So. Right questions there.

137
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:26,930
Again, I'm just sort of getting point estimates. Because this is a zero win outcome.

138
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:34,470
So in some ways it's kind of better to use the odds ratio approaches that we discussed and to do that.

139
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:45,090
I'm going to go to this R package rig, which is with the models that are outlined in the class notes.

140
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:57,540
So code here, it's fairly straightforward, but I'll just kind of go through it, give it some sort of data frame,

141
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:08,880
and then you have to describe the outcome, the treatment or the a variable in the mediator or the variable.

142
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:20,950
And finally, any covariates you're going to adjust for. So that puts together the model.

143
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:30,490
Then you have to give the values for the treatment. So we're going to just have trial experience as a01 variable.

144
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,940
So we'll just write zero for control and one for treatment.

145
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,090
It's going to give you this control direct effect among other estimators.

146
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,080
So you've got to tell it, you know, what value do you want that mediator set it?

147
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:54,530
And finally, because some of these estimates require fixing the values right here.

148
00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:01,389
So these are directed in these indirect effect estimates for the odds ratios essentially are functions

149
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:07,240
of covariates because of the reality and comparing from a lot of odds to the probability scale,

150
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,440
we need to define those as well.

151
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:29,980
And I'm going to use so for the the first stage model, the model relating the mediator to the treatment poverty of childhood poverty,

152
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,690
I'm going to use logistic because in zero one and the same thing for the outcome variable

153
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:42,460
outcome is death is or know it by the year 2000 or 35 years after the initial interview.

154
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,590
And that will be also a logistic regression.

155
00:20:49,880 --> 00:21:01,310
So it it outputs just just a general logistic regression model looking at Goldilocks and childhood issues.

156
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:08,570
So, you know, these estimates are going to be different because they're now log odds rather than linear percentage.

157
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:20,330
But we still see the strong relationship. So does seem that the covariance may be doing something here because they're also having impact on

158
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:28,940
age and race or have an impact on the experience of poverty based on the person who's interviewed.

159
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:43,750
And for the outcome model we then it's going to include our direct effect estimate of.

160
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:56,630
It is, yes. This interaction. And of course, adjusting to the recovery age, obviously an important predictor here.

161
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:03,140
Older people more likely to be obviously at greater risk for death 35 years down the road.

162
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:12,860
Well, gender also important. As you know, women tend to have more lives than men on that race also having an impact.

163
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:36,640
So. So the mediation analysis can kicks out what what we we've discussed about before, plus some experts.

164
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:45,920
So here's the control direct effect. This.

165
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:53,720
PND kind of corresponds to the natural, direct effect that we discussed above.

166
00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:00,740
So in tea and irony is our natural indirect effect.

167
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:12,660
So these natural, direct and natural indirect effects were defined in the case of the direct effect by holding

168
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:18,110
immediate or value or constant increase of the indirect effect of the treatment constant.

169
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:29,120
So these TMD and P and i.e. measures to split what value are going to be holding the mediator.

170
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:46,220
So rather than holding the mediator at it's control value, you now hold the mediator at its treatment value and then change the the the treatment.

171
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:57,630
And again, instead of holding the treatment value at the sort of treated value and changing the mediator,

172
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:03,410
we're going to hold the treatment at the control value and change the mediator.

173
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,600
So. And then, of course, the total effect.

174
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,080
And of course, we need to correspond to these.

175
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:23,460
16 years ago. So I guess there's some explanation because these these are all on a logistics scale.

176
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:32,430
And this is not relevant because this is actually back to the to this original proportion measure.

177
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:41,670
So wouldn't expenditure. Okay.

178
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,340
So I guess the control direct effect.

179
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:56,550
You set this at zero is corresponds to about a 9% reduction in survival.

180
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:08,040
Setting poverty zero and then changing the child poverty experience this natural, indirect effect.

181
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,770
So this is I'm sorry, the natural direct effect.

182
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:24,420
This holds an individual with whatever their adult poverty experience would have been had they not had childhood poverty,

183
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,250
and then looks at the effect of switching to childhood poverty experience.

184
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:46,889
So about a 10% reduction in survival odds are natural indirect effect switching mediator

185
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:52,830
values holding at the experience of a door of childhood poverty being experienced,

186
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,229
a 6% reduction in survival. And then we sort of see these flip things.

187
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:03,959
If we sort of change the values, they're not radically different. The total effect,

188
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:15,960
about a 17% reduction in while the odds of survival sorry should be long odds that we can scale and that you can see the scales over here.

189
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:24,240
So and then proportion mediated about 37%.

190
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:33,870
So suggesting about 37% of this effect of of of.

191
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:47,260
Childhood poverty is mediated through adult poverty. All right.

192
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:54,850
So. So to see this versus this puter on an automation scale.

193
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:05,459
So what about two issues? Okay, so changing the cover values shouldn't have any effect on the CD total effect,

194
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:12,480
but it doesn't affect the indie and and AII right, so above I used a 30 year old white male.

195
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:19,360
Sorry, I should mention that. So this is basically young age gender.

196
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:23,550
One is female and black another.

197
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:36,960
So if these are both zero, then it's white. So here I switch this to 20 year old female black, keeping everything else the same.

198
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:47,490
So model fits are identical. But just what we get out in terms of radiation helps us to see the control.

199
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:58,410
Direct effect doesn't change, but are very natural, indirect and direct effects change a little bit as well.

200
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,040
And seven versus ten and six.

201
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,830
So not not huge differences. Bush mediated stories stayed around the same.

202
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,820
And that I can change, you know, whether I want to have the controlled direct effects at zero one.

203
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:33,510
So here I set it to one. So now I'm looking at what happens when I change the effect of change.

204
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,510
Childhood poverty, holding adult poverty constant is being experienced.

205
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:44,920
So, you know, it's going to total effect here.

206
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:51,340
Runs around an odds ratio of 24.

207
00:28:52,090 --> 00:29:00,100
So about a 60% reduction in survival rate, odds of survival, given the experience of childhood poverty,

208
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:12,940
that the age of not quite reaching statistical significance the control direct effect so.

209
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:19,080
In fact, not through dire poverty, about a 9% reduction.

210
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:27,150
If we have low poverty set to zero.

211
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:31,710
And then. A stronger effective. It's that one.

212
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:37,860
So neither one of them reach significance for immediate it runs around 35 to 40%.

213
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:48,520
There's something that seems to be a reasonably stable number. Questions.

214
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:29,540
Correct. So.

215
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,860
Essentially finishes are an introduction to direct and indirect effects.

216
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:47,830
So but you know, as we noted, there were a lot of assumptions made here, particularly that we just were able to get rid of all this confounding,

217
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,010
not only with the treatment and the outcome, but also with the mediator and the outcome.

218
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:00,700
So that in particular the second one in particular really might be an issue.

219
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:11,590
And so we're going to look at basically sensitivity analysis, which basically comes into assuming some degree of unmeasured confounding.

220
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:15,280
Let's see, what if we make that assumption? What is that?

221
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:18,530
What does that do to our risk benefit?

222
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:24,970
So we'll start out in the simplest case of looking at sensitivity analysis for measured, confounding and total effects,

223
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:33,010
and then we'll go on to look at could measured confounding and control direct effects in a measured,

224
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:41,050
confounding or natural direct or indirect effects. So it's a little a little more math, I guess, for lack of a better word.

225
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:47,680
I'm sort of going to have to because we're going to sort of lay out assumptions on this and derive results under these assumptions.

226
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,790
It's going to be a little more discussion around that,

227
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:59,380
but sort of try to get down to leads a little bit and then come back out and try to keep things sort of linked to the conceptual parts as well.

228
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:08,730
Okay. So. Right.

229
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:16,250
So, again, this whole issue of confounding and I think I hinted at this just what I just said, but just to get someone to repeat it back.

230
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,830
Why is confounding particularly an issue in the estimation of direct and indirect effects?

231
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,160
I sort of think about randomized trials versus non randomized trials.

232
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,470
What that fixes and what it doesn't fix is a mediation estimation.

233
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,650
Maybe try to put it another way. Where's confounding?

234
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:15,160
More of a problem when we're trying to look at mediation effects and we're trying to look at total effects just very broadly.

235
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:27,620
What can I do, at least in theory, to to deal with confounding for total effects that I can't do.

236
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,930
It's a mediator component. In practice.

237
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:46,570
It might be a problem either way, but. That's right.

238
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:51,160
You work instrumentally. Well, yeah, that's. That's right. Or I could even randomize.

239
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:57,910
Right. Or I could try to find an instrumental variable that relates to my exposure.

240
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:02,350
That really is a good instrument. Of course, randomization being the best instrument.

241
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,600
But I can't do that on the mediator. Right.

242
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:11,860
Because I can't randomize mediators to assist the mediation outcome relationship.

243
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,790
So you might noticed its principal stratification kind of avoids this issue and just

244
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:33,250
kind of leads the problem by not defining direct indirect effects in the same way.

245
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,080
But if you really want to think about this,

246
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:46,030
this sort of potential outcome framework in the structure that leads to the mediation estimation we talked about, you're kind of stuck.

247
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:56,389
So that's least, you know, settings where you might be worried.

248
00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:02,810
There are unobserved confounders required for the control between treatment outcome and mediated outcome.

249
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,140
And so we can look at sensitivity analysis,

250
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:13,820
sort of posit the existence of some kind of unobserved confounder and obtain an estimate of bias as a function of the given degree of confounding.

251
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,760
So we might ask ourselves,

252
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:23,690
what's the degree of confounding required to bring the estimated total effects or this estimate directly into effect to zero,

253
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,750
or to maybe give an associated confidence interval include zero.

254
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,780
Know if that's reasonable, then we can maybe conclude that the estimated causal effect is real.

255
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:40,610
If if this kind of confounding does seem like it would be plausible and then maybe the included cluster.

256
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:47,180
And so again, not really a formal dag but the idea here.

257
00:35:52,310 --> 00:36:03,700
Total effect. So we're actually sort of the moment to sort of simplify the problem.

258
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:11,920
Don't even think about mediation, but just get some treatment or exposure.

259
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,130
We have some common covariance.

260
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:31,490
That we observe that we think might affect both the treatment assignment of exposure experience to our observed compounds.

261
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:46,660
And then there is sensitivity analysis. And I do suggest maybe we have some things here that we haven't observed.

262
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:09,450
So we're going to sort of posit these things exist and think about some kind of association here.

263
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:15,720
And how would that have to do with the sort of the strength of the size of those arrows, if you will?

264
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:27,710
How would that have to be? How would that impact our overall estimate of this effect of a B on Y potential outcome experience?

265
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:39,510
So I guess I'll just mention one, when classic this actually sort of started a lot was with you estimate the effect of smoking on lung cancer risk.

266
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,630
Some of you may have heard this. Maybe all of you. I don't know.

267
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:50,640
I it's a good example of the saying that like this the shoemaker's children have no shoes.

268
00:37:52,530 --> 00:38:06,350
Ronald Fisher horse core behind randomization and that much of our causal inference design also kind of a jerk in real life I think,

269
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:15,540
and was also a big smoker and he didn't like the fact that it looked like smoking was was

270
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,979
was leading to he's actually I think more of a more of a paper cigar than a cigaret smoker,

271
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,270
but nonetheless didn't like these associations.

272
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:33,960
And so he was also done a lot of coursework in genetics was sort of convinced there maybe some of his unobserved confounder was was basically genes.

273
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:40,380
There's basically some tendency for people who like to smoke to also develop lung cancer.

274
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:47,069
And there were some sort of sort of these also a bit of a eugenicist and was really, really thought that was important.

275
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:51,870
And so probably he thought, I have this gene and so there's nothing I could do about it.

276
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,240
So it's just the way it is.

277
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:04,200
So but so that actually that was, you know, that was sort of also the way obviously for tobacco companies to sort of try and say,

278
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,050
well, look, you know, there's this sort of debate going on. Who knows?

279
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,690
And it actually drove a lot of this initial work to say, okay, well, let's say there is such a thing.

280
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:20,400
How strongly that effect have to be? The answer, as it turns out, enormously strong, like wildly unrealistically big.

281
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:25,080
So that kind of shot down that theory even even before they were able to sort of get into some

282
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:30,510
of the underlying biology that really sort of proved that sort of more mechanistic level,

283
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:38,640
these kinds of associations. So so that's essentially we're going to be looking at variations on that in this section.

284
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,770
So how big would these how big this these this effect for the use have to be?

285
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:58,850
So the first derivation we're going to look at. Maybe all we have time for today is.

286
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:09,900
Looking at this issue and the total effects. And we're going to assume that we're going to start with a binary confounder here.

287
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,629
Actually, it's going to drive the results a more general one.

288
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:19,420
But then we're going to say in the binary case that if we assume that these unobserved ones to go,

289
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:26,820
the observed really does control for everything, right? So we get this independence between the exposure and the potential outcome.

290
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:36,840
I guess I'm going to keep it in here, but for the moment we really override this about why.

291
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:41,130
So they should cut that out.

292
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,810
Probably ignored them for the first few pages.

293
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:07,200
So so this bias is basically going to be the product of.

294
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:17,610
Three functions. It's really a view, if you will, the average of.

295
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,230
Gamma and delta averaged over the distribution of X.

296
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:36,480
Kim of x is essentially the expected difference in the expected values of Y, expected values of y fixing.

297
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:43,560
Subjects at the treatment level a and.

298
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:56,500
Covering Value X and then changing this and observe covariance and then delta B.

299
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:07,059
The difference in the probability of the observed Kilby have been equal to one right between the treatment and control groups,

300
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:15,190
again controlling for X. So basically, if either one of these components is zero, we have no bias, right?

301
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:21,880
So effectively that's saying that, right? Once we controlled for X, you doesn't matter, right?

302
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:32,469
So we don't have an answer confounder or maybe it might matter with respect to the outcome, but it's balanced, right.

303
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:45,010
So one of those two arms fails, right. Gives you two y arm doesn't exist with Gamma zero or the U two arm doesn't exist if Delta zero.

304
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,850
So otherwise those are two exist.

305
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:54,340
And we're going to have some bias in our estimation. All right.

306
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,300
So go through this.

307
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:18,790
But. Once we have it down for total effects, the extensions to the direct to the direct indirect effects are going to be pretty straightforward.

308
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,620
So. Dimension.

309
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:37,160
This is an important area. So. Truthfully the fact that the.

310
00:43:50,510 --> 00:44:04,170
Well, it's essentially going to be. Williams helps to control for observed confounders.

311
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:19,059
So. We want to look at the difference between the potential outcome under treatment and potential

312
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:25,090
outcome control averaged over our population and based on the elements of the population,

313
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:29,200
perhaps. Actually 50%.

314
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:38,670
So. So we have unobserved, confounding.

315
00:44:39,690 --> 00:45:04,010
All right. You can basically write this as. The control or condition.

316
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:17,410
You finally put some value. So.

317
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:40,050
And then actions over that. Observe Father again.

318
00:45:51,930 --> 00:46:08,890
So this is really what we want. It's.

319
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:10,860
So firstly great John to his point. Clear on this.

320
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:22,310
So bias is going to be the difference between the estimated total effect ignoring observable accounting and the truthful fact.

321
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:31,710
So it's. Or bias.

322
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:49,390
And it's at a specific value that is a chance.

323
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:15,180
And so they ask me why the treatment level and the control level controlling for x the observed data.

324
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:41,350
And then to subtract off. Potential outcomes given access to potential outcomes now as we have observed stuff around it.

325
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:49,450
So. Okay.

326
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:58,900
So I've already had a computer disappear. I'm going to run out of room, so I'll probably.

327
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,560
So. Yeah, this is absurd. Just make sure that you're.

328
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:55,660
So. Now when I hit this part here.

329
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,810
Thank. I can right this again. It's my unobserved encounter.

330
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,990
You know, I'm concerned always about.

331
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:45,320
So I can just average out over this desert compound of.

332
00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:02,590
Now. Same thing over here.

333
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:06,640
Now condition on it when it starts to fall.

334
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:47,760
So I think it is resolved to kind of let the other one up here.

335
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:52,870
And I think it is resolved the thing I raised. We can put the bias pieces together.

336
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:52,980
Here. But look at the expected value of Y at the treatment level out of these two components.

337
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:03,770
I have the conditional probability of you.

338
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:12,950
Have you given treatment level peg x minus this?

339
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:18,190
Distribution due now averaging over the treatment levels.

340
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:43,560
So they take their value survey so patient like X and this sort of mysterious you but now saying to the control well you pick up these pieces.

341
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:55,120
It's the same thing with the now dispersed pieces.

342
00:53:56,710 --> 00:54:03,100
And so there's no finishing any start.

343
00:54:55,340 --> 00:55:09,360
So I think. And so, you know, here is if you want to just get the marginalized.

344
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:17,510
It just means. Essentially a radio.

345
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:26,550
Some things that are going to go over the distribution of the population.

346
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:47,280
So this is sort of the most general formula. What do you got to specify?

347
00:55:47,280 --> 00:56:21,570
You specify specified, understaffed. I'm sorry.

348
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:43,350
Sorry. There's an extra piece for.

349
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:56,339
So. The two parties come down.

350
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:00,390
And here we also have this little, little piece here. So if we choose.

351
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,290
You find some sort of reference?

352
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:18,550
Value. But you know, there.

353
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:43,500
So if we respect people, the expected value of why they can use it to some value prime.

354
00:57:48,890 --> 00:58:14,570
I mean, some of us up over this. So we're fixing our expectation here.

355
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:26,030
Fixing this at some value, then the situation.

356
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:30,680
This is this is confidence, actually. And so the situation becomes.

357
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:53,740
There's something over and over. You know, whether we're conditioning on doesn't really matter here.

358
00:58:53,740 --> 00:59:05,020
The summation is always going to be. So this goes for one by one.

359
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:15,240
This man goes to zero. So. The faculty then.

360
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:53,650
So two things together here. It's going to subtract off.

361
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:55,590
Here. Okay.

362
01:00:57,430 --> 01:01:06,770
So. We need to start here.

363
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:29,420
Especially in this country, this undeserved, confounding round. And our bias is going to be a function of these differences.

364
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:41,780
But these differences. So.

365
01:01:45,970 --> 01:02:03,270
And I raised this particular concern. So we're going to specify those little things and observe.

366
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:42,460
We've going to specify these things. Right.

367
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:52,570
So it's pretty easy, pretty straightforward creation at the bottom so when general form to here.

368
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:04,050
And of course, level of X. Right.

369
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:10,080
This we can see from the population. But this appears to get better in the next.

370
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:37,400
And we also have to specify. This distribution of new and different treatment.

371
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:49,390
And once we have this, you can then get this market distribution by just.

372
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:13,940
This we actually know. This was specified over here.

373
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:35,280
So. It specified essentially four different.

374
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:49,020
Things is different than this. Well, it was two differences in expectations and redistributions of the focus of.

375
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:03,830
So. All right.

376
01:07:03,830 --> 01:08:32,630
So what happens now is used by binary. Binary equals one.

377
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:38,840
You start with zero equals one with primeval zero.

378
01:08:43,920 --> 01:10:19,290
And I'm biased. Sorry.

379
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:39,370
So. He's here.

380
01:11:41,490 --> 01:13:52,209
From. Okay.

381
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:55,750
So basically we can assume that this.

382
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:10,120
The expectations differences is constant. Different levels of aid, then we're going to cancel out.

383
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,060
The component in the general bias formula that.

384
01:14:48,260 --> 01:15:25,050
It involves the merging distribution of new. So we're just gonna be left with this.

385
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:38,990
But this thing here involves the difference in, you know, traditional attacks at a store and the difference why you go to you.

386
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:54,410
So if you prime's also. Run between zero one than.

387
01:16:05,000 --> 01:17:01,210
Bias piece. That.

388
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:30,470
This is your prime time right now and sort of pulling out from there.

389
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:41,690
So I'm going to set you to zero. You prime is always going to be zero.

390
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:43,490
What's going on. All right, so this.

391
01:18:47,520 --> 01:19:27,410
This whole thing is just going to. This is not going away.

392
01:19:51,040 --> 01:20:13,300
We do this from this is constantly respecting. All right so that's Pacers going to be able to do this whole thing has gone away.

393
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:29,100
I just get an x ray, so it's a bit overexcited.

394
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:34,310
So we'll go to work to get that.

395
01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:54,990
So basically this is assumed this this gamma then just boils down to the difference in the means and wise at a given value of X,

396
01:20:56,190 --> 01:21:05,790
we assume A doesn't matter. So the expected values of X and Y, the value of X and we change you.

397
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:12,600
And then this delta as the probability equals one under the treatment in control.

398
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:18,570
Those differences between the probabilities of one treatment of control again holding x constant.

399
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:26,040
And if you want to establish that, we do that piece there.

400
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:43,540
So obviously the larger the effect of this unobserved confounder on Y, then the larger the bias,

401
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:48,700
the larger the effect is unobserved, confounder, next, larger the bias.

402
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:57,610
And so basically, if we can get bias equal to the treatment effect in the opposite direction, right?

403
01:21:57,730 --> 01:22:02,709
When we average out this out over some X, then we have essentially you can see, well,

404
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:09,430
this is the kind of level of unobserved confounding we have to have for our treatment effect to go away.

405
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:14,950
You know, conversely, again, you're assuming these are no values.

406
01:22:15,790 --> 01:22:23,740
So you could just get the bias up to the level of whichever the lower the upper end of the confidence interval you need to bring to zero.

407
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:32,680
And I would say, well, this level of, of confounding would eliminate or ah, you know, significant treatment effect.

408
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:37,540
So the a treatment effect, but it would not be significant. So.

409
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:43,940
Again. This is totally made up. Right. You're just going to have to to consider it.

410
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:49,880
So you could you can sort of fix one, let's say, and move the other and vice versa.

411
01:22:54,530 --> 01:23:01,190
So there's there's always a lot of flexibility in that and the degree to which these are meaningful.

412
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:07,370
That becomes more of a scientific issue. Right. That's really where you're sort of maybe with your collaborators say, is this kind of effect?

413
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:12,730
Can we expect this little confounding reasonably? No.

414
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:27,210
Given observed confounders. And so if you sort of get away with assuming some of these things are concerned over X and Y,

415
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:37,180
you just sort of say is in this overall effect of an observed effect on a and an observed effect on Y.

416
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:44,560
And if you just multiply those together, that's all assuming kind of these kind of linear models.

417
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:52,430
Or, you know, expectations won't fly out of some transformed version.

418
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:03,300
So a lot there. I know we're going past time, so.

419
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:10,770
Take questions now. Take questions that we get in class Wednesday.

420
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:25,830
I have office hours today. Basically the trick is you sort of have to assume something about these conditional distributions of

421
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:34,920
the unobserved confounder and then work out what that is marginally in terms of the actual bias.

422
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:49,220
Okay. So I'll stop here. The U.S. will look at this applications as well.
