00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:09,260
Okay. Hello, I'm Donele Wilkins, I am the founder of the Green Door Initiative.

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,360
I actually am the current director of the organization.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,600
The Green Door Initiative is located in the city of Detroit. Before I go into greater detail,

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:29,340
I would like to just let you know that today's topic will be focused on environmental justice and basically the foundation of environmental justice.

5
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,450
So the topics title is Environmental Justice 101. The mission of the Green Door Initiative is,

6
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:45,500
is to ensure that every one, every person is environmentally literate, capable of practicing and promoting a sustainable lifestyle.

7
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:58,520
This is regardless of race, income, and zip code, everyone should be able to breathe clean air, drink safe water, have access to water,

8
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:11,850
to attend school buildings where they are able to learn, to worship in churches without issues and other faith based organizations.

9
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,620
The organization has been around for since 2010, for over 10 years now,

10
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:26,120
and we continue to do the work around achieving environmental justice by advocacy,

11
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:36,860
ensuring that public policy is adhering to the idea of equal protection under the law when it comes to environmental protection.

12
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:42,950
We provide job training in the environment, green collar sector.

13
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,110
We also work to build capacity among young people, youth especially.

14
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:54,140
So there is an easy transition for leadership around environmental justice,

15
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:04,720
and we work to build capacity among residents in the community so they are able to

16
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:11,230
navigate the environmental protection regulatory systems at the local level,

17
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:22,780
the state level and a national level to ensure that their rights and the rules that apply to the issues around environmental quality,

18
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:31,060
that they have access to that. That's what the Green Door Initiative does. Today's course will be focused primarily,

19
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:43,750
the objective is to ensure that there is an understanding about the history of environmental justice movement. When this course is completed

20
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:50,680
participants would learn about major issues and events that have occurred in the environmental justice movement.

21
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:57,130
Participants will be provided the definitions for environmental racism and environmental justice,

22
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,030
which will also include the principles of environmental justice.

23
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:12,120
Participants will also learn about the health impacts that may occur as a result of being exposed to a negative environmental mix,

24
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:26,150
a negative or harmful environment. And finally, participants will learn about the local environmental concerns that occur in the city of Detroit.

25
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,870
That's it. So we'll begin the lesson

26
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:38,380
one, focuses on the legacy of the environmental justice movement.

27
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:44,650
And I want to acknowledge the collaborators on this curriculum, Dr. Beverly Wright,

28
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:59,660
who is the executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, myself, Dr. Robert Bullard, who is a professor at the Texas,

29
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:05,170
I'm sorry, Texas Southern University in Houston

30
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:18,340
Texas. And actually, he's just been awarded an opportunity to launch another environmental justice center out of Texas Southern University.

31
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:26,890
I also want to acknowledge that the funding for this training really comes through the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences,

32
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:33,910
through its Minority Worker Training Program, formerly known as the Minority Worker Training Program,

33
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,490
now known as the Environmental Careers Training Program.

34
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:51,130
Environmental justice is an impact that many communities have been struggling with for a long time, and it's very simple.

35
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:56,860
I believe that pictures speak a thousand words, as the saying goes.

36
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:03,880
But this is an example of the kinds of impact on the environment,

37
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:19,510
when industry is allowed to pretty much do whatever they can to produce the materials, resources, products, that they're known for. This act,

38
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:32,590
the skyline actually is a skyline within New Orleans, Louisiana, along the petrochemical corridor, also known as the Cancer Alley.

39
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:49,540
This is a bad day, clearly, where the production of petrochemicals that many of us used to operate our automobiles and other mobile,

40
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,620
you know, just to be mobile in this country and around the world.

41
00:05:53,620 --> 00:06:04,130
This is a production of energy that does have some kind of impact on health outcomes,

42
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:18,190
and the key around this particular issue is in communities of color, African-American communities, Latino communities and others,

43
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:25,570
there is a disproportionate impact when it comes to those types of exposures,

44
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:37,840
and often times these communities are struggling to even understand who protects you when there is an exposure such as the one I just shared with you.

45
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,780
So our work is really focused on ensuring that people in the community get the right

46
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:51,910
information, understand how to navigate systems so that they are able to protect themselves,

47
00:06:51,910 --> 00:07:05,160
their families, their communities. So this disparate impact really is a spatial distribution conducted to show a disparate impact on people of color.

48
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:18,060
It is, unfortunately, when we talk about disparate impact, we're talking about a huge share of the burden when it comes to exposures

49
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:29,640
to bad environmental issues such as air pollution, which you saw in that.

50
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:37,050
So let's talk a little bit about what got us to this point to even begin to address environmental justice.

51
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:47,610
We first have to understand what caused us to proceed into address these issues.

52
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:58,800
And the term "environmental racism" was used and introduced before the term "environmental justice" even was identified,

53
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:06,690
and you'll just have to forgive me, but I need to read this definition in order for us not to miss a thing.

54
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:11,970
Environmental racism is racial discrimination and environmental policymaking.

55
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:16,470
It is a racial discrimination in the enforcement of regulations and law.

56
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:26,160
It is racial discrimination and the deliberate targeting of communities of color for toxic waste disposal and the siting of polluting industries.

57
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:35,140
It is racial discrimination in the official sanctioning of the life-threatening presence of poisons and pollutants in communities of color.

58
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:42,180
And it is racial discrimination in the history of excluding people of color from the mainstream environmental groups,

59
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:48,090
decision making boards, commissions and regulatory bodies. I know that's a mouthful.

60
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:53,100
Today you hear the term Black Lives Matter.

61
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,710
You've been hearing the term of "racial profiling".

62
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:06,300
These are not new to folks who've been addressing environmental racism and environmental justice.

63
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:15,330
We see that there is a pattern, and we'll talk later about that, of who gets the most polluting facilities and

64
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:23,490
offensive land use activities and often time that's based primarily on race.

65
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,060
Income is a second predictor of that,

66
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:36,030
but race is the number one predictor, and we have some research that really helps to back that statement up.

67
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:42,840
So here's environmental justice as a definition, because that's what we're working to achieve.

68
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:48,300
Environmental justice is the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures and income

69
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:54,990
with respect to development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws,

70
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:01,260
regulations, programs and policies. Fair treatment means that no racial,

71
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:11,520
ethnic, or socioeconomic group should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences resulting from the operation of industrial,

72
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:18,840
municipal and commercial enterprises, and from the execution of federal, state

73
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:31,800
local, and tribal programs and policies. This is really key because when we talk about the location and decisions about what goes where.

74
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:39,110
When we think about that race is the primary factor for making those decisions,

75
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:46,620
then it really gets down to whose life is more important. All lives should be valued.

76
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:56,820
Unfortunately, there is not that kind of consideration when it comes to decision making around these these activities.

77
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:07,530
And that's something we really need to address. That's what the environmental justice movement has set out to address,

78
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:13,440
and we'll go a little more in detail about that.

79
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,650
And a lot of times there is this idea that, well, what we're looking for is equity.

80
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:29,180
Equity really does not really meet the issue, because

81
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:45,300
justice is what we're really focused on, one, acknowledging that there has been this legacy, this long history of this disproportionate burden.

82
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:52,190
And when you start talking about equity, equity does not consider the legacy of these decision makings.

83
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:56,510
So environmental justice is a much broader in it's

84
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:06,410
scope, it's about, wait a minute. We have to think about ways to assure that there is support for sustainable communities

85
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,430
through which people can interact with confidence that their environment is safe,

86
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,190
nurturing and productive.

87
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:32,720
It considers the cultural norms of a community, of the ethnicity that the traditions that a culture holds in terms of living out their lives.

88
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:40,640
Yet environmental justice considers that it considers the values that are defined in a particular culture.

89
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:48,000
The rules, regulations and policies have to

90
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,480
take into account that the disproportionate burden has

91
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:03,730
negative impacts on the cultural norms of a community. So,

92
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:09,370
this is a place that I want to really place some emphasis. See,

93
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:16,900
environmental justice movement didn't just start because somebody thought it was a good idea.

94
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:29,380
There was a long sort of effort underway where people have had some interaction with,

95
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:34,160
let me stop here, Molly, because really this I got this, I got...
