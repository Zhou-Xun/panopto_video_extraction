1
00:00:03,445 --> 00:00:07,370
In this session we'll learn about recombination fraction and

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,490
genetic markers.

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:15,152
Learning objectives include, defining recombination fraction, describing

4
00:00:15,152 --> 00:00:20,989
how recombination fraction can be used to characterize linked and unlinked loci.

5
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:27,348
And describing the optimal characteristics of genetic markers for linkage studies.

6
00:00:27,348 --> 00:00:33,189
Recombination fraction is a measure of the genetic distance between genes and

7
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:33,991
markers.

8
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:37,588
Its metric is in center Morgan's.

9
00:00:37,588 --> 00:00:41,974
Alleles that are physically close together to one another on

10
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:46,876
the chromosome tend not to be separated by recombination as often as

11
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:50,918
alleles that are physically far away from one another.

12
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:55,229
Theta is the probability that the alleles of two loci,

13
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:59,174
will recombine during the formation of gametes.

14
00:00:59,174 --> 00:01:03,876
So, the proportion of recombination gametes that we see is

15
00:01:03,876 --> 00:01:07,457
equal to the probability of recombination.

16
00:01:07,457 --> 00:01:14,382
And, the recombination fraction which we characterize as theta.

17
00:01:14,382 --> 00:01:17,594
Please note that the probability of recombination

18
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:22,083
is only true when we're looking at relatively small genomic regions.

19
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,385
So about less than 15 cent organs.

20
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:30,127
If we get regions that are a lot bigger than 15 cent

21
00:01:30,127 --> 00:01:34,886
organs then we might actually see parental gabby.

22
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:38,937
It's even if there was recombination, because there might have been two

23
00:01:38,937 --> 00:01:42,019
recombination between the low side we're looking at.

24
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:46,137
Which would actually make the gametes appear to be all

25
00:01:46,137 --> 00:01:49,990
parental even though there was a recombination.

26
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,508
So, we're gonna think about theta for small distances and

27
00:01:54,508 --> 00:02:00,201
say the proportion of recombination gametes, is equal to the probability

28
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:04,738
of recombination in general and that's going to be theta.

29
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,308
When you have loci that are inherited independently of each other,

30
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:15,229
so they follow the law of independent assortment.

31
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:18,649
Then you'll see, recombinase and

32
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:24,007
non recombinase in equal proportions in the gametes and

33
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:28,118
in that case theta will be equal to 0.5.

34
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:33,457
So there will be an equally likely chance that the child will inherit

35
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:39,743
any one of the four possible gamete probabilities that we talked about before.

36
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,670
Because there's all this recombination between alleles.

37
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,095
So the probability that the child will inherit a recombination

38
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:51,446
haplotype is 50% and that's why theta is equal to 0.5.

39
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:56,991
So this concept holds for loci that are on different chromosomes and

40
00:02:56,991 --> 00:03:01,864
loci that are physically far apart on the same chromosome.

41
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:08,926
When you have two loci that are inherited together because of chromosomal location,

42
00:03:08,926 --> 00:03:14,042
then you'll have more non recombinant than recombinant in the offspring.

43
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:19,116
So if you've got two loci, that are let's say five killer bases apart

44
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:24,025
from each other, they're really close to each other physically.

45
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:27,160
They're probably not gonna recombine as much, right?

46
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,962
And so in that case theta will be a probability

47
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:36,574
somewhere between zero and 0.5.

48
00:03:38,253 --> 00:03:42,885
It will be more likely that recombination will not occur between the allies because

49
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:45,411
they're close together on the chromosome.

50
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:51,094
So it'll be more likely that the child will inherit a non recombinant haplotype.

51
00:03:51,094 --> 00:03:55,949
And the probability of inheriting a re competent haplotype then,

52
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:57,556
will be less than 50%.

53
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:01,930
So when we're looking at the recombination fraction,

54
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,776
when theta equals 0.5 it implies no linkage between the genes or

55
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:10,076
between the low side that we're looking at.

56
00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:13,770
They're physically separated from each other enough

57
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,552
that recombination just happens freely between them.

58
00:04:17,552 --> 00:04:22,408
If we have a theta equal to zero, it implies complete linkage.

59
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:27,026
That there is never an instance where recombination will separate

60
00:04:27,026 --> 00:04:28,440
those two low side.

61
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,313
So they have to be like very close together on top of each other to get

62
00:04:33,313 --> 00:04:34,801
theta equals zero.

63
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,930
And if you have a data between zero and 0.5,

64
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,091
it implies that there's some kind of linkage.

65
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:46,845
So it implies that the center Morgan distance between

66
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:50,549
the two of them is less than 50, right?

67
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:55,907
So low side that have a recombination fraction of less than 0.5,

68
00:04:55,907 --> 00:05:03,575
because they're physically close together on a chromosome are called linked loci.

69
00:05:03,575 --> 00:05:08,130
We can use a variety of genetic markers to do our linkage studies.

70
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,927
So snips the NTRs and other polymorphisms can be used

71
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:16,753
as our chromosomally landmarks, okay.

72
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:19,860
Or are markers that we're gonna look at?

73
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,680
We want these markers to actually tag specific areas on the chromosome.

74
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,928
So, what that means is that we're gonna choose markers all across each

75
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:35,613
of the chromosomes and we're gonna look at is the disease linked to the marker

76
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:40,527
at this location on the chromosome, how about the next location?

77
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:41,649
How about the next location?

78
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:46,907
So if we have markers that are spread out across all of the chromosomes,

79
00:05:46,907 --> 00:05:52,800
we can look at whether those markers are linked to the disease causing alleles.

80
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,750
So we're gonna choose markers that kind of mark or track areas along the chromosomes.

81
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:05,331
And then we're gonna look at how they're segregating in families to see if they're

82
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:10,317
associated with the disease or if they're linked to the disease locus, sorry.

83
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,627
That will give us information about where we get recombination.

84
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:24,450
So, markers are only useful or informative when there's enough variation in them to

85
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:30,590
actually be able to track the chromosomes and the families through segregation.

86
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:36,323
So, if each parental chromosome has a different allele at each marker location,

87
00:06:36,323 --> 00:06:40,311
it'll be obvious how that chromosome is recombining and

88
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:43,732
segregating when you look across generations.

89
00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:48,588
So the informative nous of a marker is determined by the number of alleles at

90
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:50,986
the locus, more alleles is better.

91
00:06:50,986 --> 00:06:56,340
So in VNTRs you can have the NTRs that have multiple alleles.

92
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,414
So they have three copies, four copies, five copies, six copies.

93
00:07:00,414 --> 00:07:04,870
Those are all different alleles for the VNTR for example.

94
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:12,414
And, alleles frequency is so you want your marker to have lots of alleles,

95
00:07:12,414 --> 00:07:17,710
which are all relatively common in the population.

96
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,730
So a V N Tr that had four alleles.

97
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:27,220
We would want them all to Be present in the population at the frequency of 0.25.

98
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:32,790
Rather than having one of them have a high frequency say 0.85.

99
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,625
And the other ones only have 0.5 because we want as much

100
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:42,380
variation as possible in the alleles that people have.

101
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:42,463
So here is a marker map of V.

102
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:45,470
N. T. R. S.

103
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:52,016
So when people started doing linkage studies, they developed these maps that

104
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:57,074
have markers at different locations along the chromosome,

105
00:07:57,074 --> 00:08:01,960
the spacing of the markers is measured in centrum organs.

106
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,860
So the probability of recombination between them remember center morgen

107
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,310
tracks the probability of recombination.

108
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:15,246
This is an example from the Marshfield clinic where there was 360 markers and

109
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:20,280
their average spacing was about nine center morgan's across the chromosomes.

110
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,491
So chromosome one had 28 markers and the spacing was about 9.7 centimeters across.

111
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,830
Here's another look at it.

112
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:34,689
This is showing each of these little tick marks on the chromosome is

113
00:08:34,689 --> 00:08:36,961
showing the location of the V.

114
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:37,960
E. N. T. R.

115
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,380
And remember the spacing between them is about nine or 10.

116
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,039
Center morgan's and this distance is showing

117
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,770
the center morgan distance of the entire chromosome.

118
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:55,760
And this shows the locations of the markers in this particular marker map.

119
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,866
So if you have a disease of interest that's segregating through the families,

120
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:01,540
you're gonna for each marker.

121
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,345
Look at whether the disease is segregating along with the illegals for

122
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,780
that particular marker.

123
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,610
And you're gonna do that for every marker through the genome.

124
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,481
And maybe, let's say you find that the alleles are segregating with this marker.

125
00:09:14,481 --> 00:09:19,379
So you, would know that maybe this region on chromosome eight is the region

126
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:22,031
that harbors the disease causing gene.
