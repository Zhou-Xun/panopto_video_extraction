1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,720
Hi, everyone. Hey. People are settling in.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,990
I was just going to remind everybody. Please sign up for your policy challenge groups if you haven't done so already.

3
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,220
I'm still seeing some empty groups. And unless so, please sign up for a group.

4
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,340
If you go to the people tab on canvas, you'll see the policy challenge groups are there at the end of this week.

5
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:38,100
If you're in a group with on your lonesome or with two students, I'm going to move you to a group with a few more students.

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:46,169
So don't be surprised if that happens. If you see that the you're not in already in a five or six person group, it's just a reminder,

7
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,570
we aren't going to shift back the deadline a little bit for the formative report.

8
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,030
So don't worry, it's not a graded report. You're just telling us what you're going to do for your policy challenge.

9
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,840
I can't shift that deadline back too much because I really need to know pretty much by Thanksgiving

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,310
what your group is doing so that I have a clear idea of whether it's in scope or not.

11
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:20,550
I'm sure most things will be in scope, but the point of doing that formative report is to show us whether or not we're able to grade that properly,

12
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,690
get into it because we can't be experts in every policy that there is.

13
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,160
Right. So it's helpful to know who's in your group, what you're doing.

14
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,190
It's not graded, but then we can hopefully discuss with you if we think it needs any refinement.

15
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,139
And then you're going to have those forecast sessions with us once again,

16
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,790
we will be here in this room or the teachers in the teaching team will be here at the same time.

17
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,530
So we'll be doing one on one with each group. The point is to give you time,

18
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:56,909
dedicated time on your schedules to work on this because we want to see really good policy challenge packets at the end of this.

19
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:02,910
Okay. We do have a pretty high standard for this assignment, but that's why we're giving you lots of class time.

20
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,840
So I think I think you're going to be great at it.

21
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,059
I always look forward to reading these. They're always really innovative and creative and interesting.

22
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,010
So if anyone has any questions, now is a great time to ask.

23
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,390
Otherwise you can come to the policy salon on Thursday or you can email the teaching team.

24
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:29,660
Okay. Yeah, please. I also got the recording on for folks who are at home.

25
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:38,960
So how do you recommend we go about selecting a topic or in like how broad or specific of a topic I know you've laid out,

26
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:44,149
you know what we're doing, what we're creating like a video and a white paper and things like that.

27
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,620
But in terms of selecting the topic, could you give us examples or tips or things like that?

28
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:55,370
I would pick something that you're passionate about. I would do a short list of topics in your group and do some brainstorming.

29
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,610
Specifically, you need to have a policy topic where you're able to come up with some good solutions,

30
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,860
because the whole policy challenge package is about providing a solution to a policy problem.

31
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,560
So it's not just about which problem is the most urgent or compelling or important.

32
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,710
It's also about where do you think you actually have something to offer in terms of the solution?

33
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,380
Because everything you're writing depends on you having a strong solution.

34
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:29,390
In most of the components of this policy challenge packet are a call to action.

35
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,700
Does that help? A little bit. So do pick something that you care about a lot.

36
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,439
I think that makes it easier to work on.

37
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:44,030
But think carefully and strategically about can we actually provide a solution to this policy problem that we can talk about in the materials?

38
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,620
Yeah. And should it be like, do we have to hold on?

39
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,470
Should it be like at the federal level or could it also be at the state or local level that we're proposing?

40
00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:00,410
Any level is fine. Go to local, no problem. But we're providing that.

41
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,790
We think we can grade it well which we get. Be able to give you some feedback.

42
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,580
Yeah. Thanks very much. Any more questions on that?

43
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:17,720
Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Okay.

44
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,780
Today, we're going to be having a look at.

45
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:28,630
Evaluation and measurement. So this is the second half of our evaluation sequence of classes especially.

46
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,010
I wanted to put this in the context of a really juicy case study, which is Justice 40.

47
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:41,450
So how many people in the room have already heard of Justice 40 before I mentioned it in this class.

48
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:51,079
A few folks, okay, more than my other class, which is good. But it's interesting to see how many people actually in the health policy world

49
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,900
have not really strongly considered the implications of Justice 40 as a policy.

50
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:08,809
So we're going to talk about this a little bit, especially in the context of how might we evaluate justice 40 what are the components

51
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:14,930
of measurement or accountability actually even for the Justice 40 framework?

52
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:21,590
And talk about what that measurement and evaluation could look like in this context.

53
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:32,300
We can have a little bit of a group exercise towards the end. So of the folks who have heard about Justice 40, do you think you can describe it to me?

54
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,050
So anybody want to have a go and tell me what this policy is?

55
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:52,510
What is this all about? Seeing a lot of puzzled faces.

56
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,520
Come on, have a look. What do we think? The justice part is.

57
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,000
What is the photo all about? Well, what's the general principle hit show?

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,760
If you get whoa! Oh, no. That's the first time this semester I've ever missed.

59
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:22,570
Well, I've got two guesses. It's either, like social, environmental and civil justice goals by 2040, or it's 40 goals by some date.

60
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,670
Oh, good guess. It's really close. You're right. With the social environmental sciences.

61
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,040
I think the other one is actually economic, although I wish it was also civil.

62
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:39,730
I think that would be be good. Yeah. Did you want to come in with that 40%?

63
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,440
Yes. It's a percentage. See, this is why we're really close.

64
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:49,150
So it's not a 2040 goal, although I think that probably would be a good time frame.

65
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,290
Um, it's actually 40% of federal investments.

66
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,569
Thank you. So just as 40 is a whole of government policy.

67
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:04,930
So the idea here is that we are engaging all of the different government agencies here,

68
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:18,970
and it's described in the relevant policy documents as a whole of government approach to advancing environmental, racial and economic justice for all.

69
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:28,360
So, um, the idea here is that 40% of federal investments under a range of covered programs,

70
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,460
and we will talk about what government programs are actually included in this and which ones are not.

71
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:42,160
In just a moment to 40% of those benefits should flow to, quote unquote, disadvantaged communities.

72
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,770
And there's quite a lot of effort being put into defining what a community is,

73
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,379
what a disadvantage community is in policy and in the policy documents themselves.

74
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:59,710
This is from the executive order that outlines this policy and disadvantaged communities that are marginalized,

75
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,220
underserved and overburdened by pollution.

76
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,330
The thing to realize about this is it is an aspirational goal.

77
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:16,980
So it's the executive orders from the Biden administration when Biden first got into office.

78
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,270
One of the things that he did was pass this executive order along with a huge package of measures.

79
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:33,239
This is a quite extensive list of different executive orders doing different things and executive orders,

80
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:40,200
as we've discussed before, of instructing various parts of the federal government to do certain things.

81
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,520
In this case, I'll talk about some of the specifics in a minute,

82
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,350
but it's asking agencies to identify programs that make investments in communities

83
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,380
and then take steps after that to ensure that they're moving towards this 40% goal.

84
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,100
The 40% goal is not a minimum floor, though.

85
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:09,030
It's not requiring by a certain date that all federal agencies should meet this 40% goal for investments in disadvantaged communities.

86
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,900
It's an aspirational goal, not a hard floor.

87
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:19,679
And the reason I'm harping on about that point is there are a number of different social justice groups,

88
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,580
advocacy groups, who would like to see it be a hard floor.

89
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,780
And this is one point on which their opinion difference with the Biden administration.

90
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,120
So. This was implemented by executive order, as I said.

91
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:40,080
It's supported by a coalition of NGOs and academic partners, some of whom are listed down here.

92
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:49,620
These guys collectively produced this year a report, an evaluation on progress of Justice 40.

93
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,890
And a number of them talk about how they have pursued Justice 40 in different state settings.

94
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:02,430
So this is a federal translational realization of something that's happened at the state level previously.

95
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:12,300
I think as we will see, some of the problems here pertain to federalism and trying to translate that state context into the federal government.

96
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:21,100
So. And the other very important factor here is the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council.

97
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,160
So the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council, which has the not very great acronym, WE Jack,

98
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:35,500
is not just involved in trying to figure out how to implement this target,

99
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:40,300
this aspirational goal of 40% investments going to disadvantaged communities.

100
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:49,600
It's actually also looking at a number of equity focused, racial justice focused policies across the Biden administration.

101
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,320
But the key word here is obviously advisory.

102
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,950
So I do urge you to go and have a look at the advisory council.

103
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,930
There's some really great people on there. Very interesting to see them represented in government.

104
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:10,870
I think it is partly not the usual picture of government officials that we see, but they're advising the administration on this.

105
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:20,260
And they've produced a really long report with like 175 different recommendations, a lot of which pertain to how to implement Justice 40.

106
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,740
And, you know, as we will see, they some of those have been acted upon and some not so much.

107
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:34,820
What I want us to consider here is what is the justice here that's being delivered?

108
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:43,630
So whenever I hear a policy with a snazzy name like Justice Forti, I want to think about, well, what is the concept here that's being pushed for?

109
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,920
What does justice mean in this context? What kind of justice is this?

110
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:56,709
I also want you to think about, and this is one of the reasons why I assigned the really great reading by my colleague Dr. Melissa Cleary.

111
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:01,510
If you haven't read it, I strongly recommend it on bounded justice.

112
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,660
You know, justice in this context has limits.

113
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:16,690
We're trying to deliver the concept of justice which is poorly defined, maybe even in this policy, through a system which has a lot of limitations.

114
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:27,790
And what Melissa Cleary is arguing in her article very astutely is that the systems that we have, the political systems, the bureaucratic system,

115
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:36,220
these have limitations where even if the intent of the policy is to improve situations for marginalized populations,

116
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:43,000
to correct racial injustice, we are limited by the systems that we use to implement those policies.

117
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,750
I think that's really important to recognize from a theoretical perspective.

118
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:54,490
And so I want you to think about to what extent does Justice 40 really address some of these concerns?

119
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,920
It is a whole of government policy. It has that going for it.

120
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,790
There's lots of different federal agencies that are having to act under this umbrella,

121
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,040
but it is still using those same systems and tools to try and realize this goal.

122
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:15,230
So that's the theoretical framework for today.

123
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,230
On the on this site here you can see a screenshot of the actual executive order.

124
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:30,139
I do recommend going and looking at some of these documents firsthand, which has the more pedestrian title.

125
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:35,810
It's not called Justice 40. It's called Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad.

126
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:45,560
So unless you're really on the board here and paying attention as as I had to be, because I was teaching all these executive orders in January 2020,

127
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:49,550
you might not necessarily be absorbing straight away that this is actually a

128
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,290
quite expansive program that's not just about climate change and environment.

129
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:59,240
It's also about housing and homelessness. It's about economic disparities.

130
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,969
It is about health in various different ways.

131
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:09,470
There are multiple health programs that are included here, particularly health programs that target low income communities and populations.

132
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:19,400
And so I think the executive order underplays how expansive this policy could be and how much potential it could have to change things.

133
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:26,120
So the executive order itself, this is the kind of thing that you see written in an executive order.

134
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,030
It's requiring executive assistance,

135
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:36,290
so requiring different federal government agencies to publish their recommendations on how to achieve this target.

136
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:42,470
Importantly, it defines these categories of investments. So note it's not just climate change.

137
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,370
There's energy, transportation, housing, workforce development.

138
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:56,260
There's a lot of federal training programs that fall under this remediation of pollution and development of clean water and wastewater infrastructure.

139
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:05,850
So sanitation as well. And the executive officials are supposed to come up with recommendations if legislation is necessary.

140
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:10,700
So this is, again, Biden using the tools that were available to him,

141
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,550
which is predominantly this kind of executive order, instructing agencies to do things.

142
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:24,580
But in some cases, it is likely that these programs would require further legislation, which is messy.

143
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:30,799
It's already an implementation problem because Congress has to actually act to pass something in order for

144
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:39,170
the agencies to be able to have the right authority to actually conduct implement this policy in some cases.

145
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,580
And we'll see later on that that becomes actually quite an implementation problem.

146
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:50,149
And the heads of agencies and this is really important have to consult with

147
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,900
affected disadvantaged communities when they're making the recommendations.

148
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,180
So one of the things that you've seen over the last couple of months,

149
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:05,750
probably the last nine months or even maybe a little more, a lot of agencies are holding listening sessions.

150
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:15,140
So if you go to the HHS website, you can see they held something like ten or more listening sessions in different parts of the country and online.

151
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:25,370
What do we think about that? I think some of the issues with that are in theory, this is rather unprecedented consultation.

152
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,760
Agencies don't always they have to consult in various ways,

153
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:37,420
but they don't always go as far as to hold meeting hearing sessions that are targeted at the population that they're supposed to be affecting.

154
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,520
And so they've done the normal federal consultations that they would normally hold.

155
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:52,759
But these listening sessions are extra. But I think you have to question a bit the ability of people to actually access these sessions.

156
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:59,330
So it might require travel, it might require being online, which not everybody is.

157
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,920
It might require time and resources that you don't necessarily have.

158
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:12,739
So my expectation with things like those listening sessions is that there might not be so many ordinary members of the public there.

159
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,920
What you're probably going to find is a lot of advocacy groups,

160
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,490
groups say that say they represent the communities that will be affected by this policy.

161
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:32,049
And so after they've made they've done the consultation and they've made recommendations,

162
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:37,030
these agency heads have to identify applicable investment funds.

163
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,220
Then the Office of Management and Budget, which we've encountered before,

164
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,840
has to publish and we haven't got here yet, but will have to publish an annual environmental justice scorecard.

165
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:56,380
So one of the concerns has been, particularly from NGOs looking at this policy.

166
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:01,840
They want to see an accountability framework. So if you think about it.

167
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:10,850
The executive agencies are promising that they will take action to divert investments towards disadvantaged, marginalized communities.

168
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:20,840
How do you make sure that they actually do that right? So the accountability framework here that NGOs are requesting is about, well,

169
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:28,640
how can we actually measure progress or evaluate progress towards this 40% goal?

170
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,700
It's a really tricky ask, right?

171
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,570
And I think you'll see in a minute when I talk a bit about some of the progress that's been made, what some of the problems are in doing that.

172
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:47,920
It is interesting to see them explicitly requesting this accountability framework, a measurement and concrete evaluation from the Federal Government.

173
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:56,600
It's quite unusual, I think. So the first step was this executive order.

174
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:04,570
What's actually in scope here. This so there's some definitions about the kind of spending.

175
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:14,930
So it's grants, procurement, spending, various financing, paying for staff or any direct spending maybe in the form of a block grant.

176
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:19,900
BLOCK grants are included to to individuals for a covered program.

177
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,660
And these covered programs are the federal programs in those seven core areas that I just described.

178
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:34,740
Which are these ones on the slide here? Plus, this also covers some of the big time top line legislation that we've seen,

179
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,720
for example, the Inflation Reduction Act or the American Rescue Plan.

180
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,680
So each of those pieces of big pieces of legislation that we've encountered in

181
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,540
this class before also include programs that fall under this Justice 40 category.

182
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:56,530
So collectively, that's quite a lot of spending. Let me break it down even further.

183
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:01,870
Gives you some examples just taken from HHS. So this is just one agency.

184
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:12,010
Some of the things covered include training programs. So the National Institute of Environmental Health Science Sciences, for example,

185
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:17,240
has a program to try and train people to take up environmental careers.

186
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:22,420
It is targeted at people who are dis economically disadvantaged or low income.

187
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:30,730
And the idea there is to provide them with help and support to get into careers like climate preparedness

188
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:39,070
and climate construction or other careers that might be related to climate change mitigation.

189
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:45,340
So that's the kind of training program that's included this low assistance.

190
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,330
So, for example, programs that help people pay their rent,

191
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:54,520
that help people with their energy bills, which HHS has a couple of those different programs.

192
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,480
One example is the low income Household Water Assistance Program.

193
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,530
All of these links on the slide go through to the programs themselves.

194
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,020
So if one of these things is particularly interesting to you.

195
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:15,400
You can follow up. And so that's to do with people helping people pay their water bills, basically to ensure they have a consistent supply of water.

196
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,400
And infrastructure programs are covered.

197
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:27,190
So this is paying for big construction, new infrastructure that can provide people with their basic needs, like, for example, sanitation.

198
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,810
So the Indian Health Service has a sensation for cities construction program,

199
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:39,490
and that's specifically targeted targeted at American Indians and Alaska Natives who may not have adequate sanitation.

200
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,100
The Administration for Children and Families has a community services block grant.

201
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,320
So this is the kind of grant where there are specific aims to the grant.

202
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:58,990
A big chunk of money is transferred to the local level with the aim of of meeting certain policy goals.

203
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:04,090
But then some of the ways in which that can be spent are left up to the jurisdiction in question.

204
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:11,330
So this kind of block grant spending is pretty common. And that's included in these programs.

205
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:21,870
And then finally, things that don't necessarily provide material benefits but do help in terms of supporting mapping assessment, again, evaluation.

206
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,240
So one of the things that we like to do in public health, right, is a needs assessment.

207
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:32,840
And so a lot of local government departments do needs assessments on a regular basis with the Affordable Care Act.

208
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,110
Lots of parts of the health system also do forms of needs assessment.

209
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,510
This is quite similar but happening on the community level.

210
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:48,739
So the CDC, for example, has a climate ready States and Cities initiative, which is supposed to help either states or cities figure out,

211
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:55,640
well, what do we need to prepare for climate change that will reduce population harm in the event of a climate disaster?

212
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,770
And then there's, of course, something you might be more familiar with, the Flint,

213
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:07,130
the exposure registry, which is documenting cases of exposure in Flint, Michigan.

214
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:17,330
So this kind of knowledge gathering and problem definition almost is also important for this and is covered under this program.

215
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:22,140
So you can start to see that this is quite expansive in its scope.

216
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:29,180
It's an ambitious policy, which is part of the reason why there are quite a few implementation challenges here.

217
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,770
So after the executive order, what happens next?

218
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,780
Well, the executive branch issues interim guidance.

219
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,270
So this is like the next step in trying to implement this policy.

220
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,780
So agency heads have been asked and instructed to.

221
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:50,300
Pick up target programs, figure out how they're going to get towards those goals.

222
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,150
The interim guidance does this in a bit more detail,

223
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:01,370
but some of the things I think are really important here actually relate to the definition of key terms or actually measurements.

224
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,560
So here, for example, they're giving a definition of community.

225
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:14,389
And note, I feel like sometimes in public health we use and abuse the term community and we

226
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,230
sometimes don't always agree on what we're talking about when we talk about community,

227
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:22,070
I think that's important here. The defining community in two ways,

228
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:29,990
a geographically defined community of people who live in the same place and community in the sense of populations

229
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:38,000
that might not be co-located but are have have had the same experiences or have the same characteristics.

230
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,070
So that's another reason why this is a very broad program,

231
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:48,260
which is a very ambitious thing because you're trying to tackle both things at once, using the same policy.

232
00:24:52,370 --> 00:25:00,359
All right. I won't go through all of this, but. The definition of disadvantaged here is also provided in this guidance.

233
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,590
So I think this is really interesting because somebody actually has to sit down,

234
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:10,620
probably he's saying the White House Advisory Committee's recommendations and figure out, well, what does disadvantage mean here?

235
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:16,140
And we have we get to the fun part in a minute. We get to look at some maps and some data.

236
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:25,860
They've actually started implementing this or turning it into sets of statistics with decision rules for all you disadvantaged,

237
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,170
yes or no in your geographic location?

238
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:38,670
I think it's a lot harder maybe to define disadvantaged in the non geographically co-located communities as defined in this policy.

239
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:50,910
But for example, they list in this guidance income, unemployment, residential segregation on racial and ethnic lines, linguistic isolation.

240
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:59,400
There are various things to do with housing and neighborhood quality, this to do with your tract, things to do with the transportation access,

241
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:07,080
environmental stressors, water and sanitation, impacts from climate change that are disproportionate.

242
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:11,370
And boy, oh boy, do we have a lot of communities in the U.S. who are facing that right now.

243
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,430
Energy costs and energy access, jobs lost through the energy transition.

244
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:26,730
So they're trying to figure out what's happening to places where traditional energy industry has declined over time,

245
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,170
like mining communities and then things like access to health care.

246
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:36,180
This is a huge amount of what government does in one policy.

247
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:45,120
So I think one of the things that I, I wish they had dealt with a bit better is that you can see down the bottom in my bullet point here,

248
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:54,210
tribal jurisdictions should be included. There's a lot of tentativeness in the guidance about how to address tribal communities.

249
00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:00,270
There is a separate negotiation that's happening between the federal government and tribal communities,

250
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,000
but there's not a lot of information on how that negotiation is proceeding, what the outcomes are.

251
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,410
So I think they probably could have done a better job of that so far.

252
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:22,360
So. This question of accountability on the on the one side here on the slide,

253
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:30,850
I've got the summary of recommendations from that group of NGOs that I showed you earlier who have been practicing justice, 14 different states.

254
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,950
And some of these recommendations, I think, are really sensible.

255
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,340
Other ones, I'm a bit disappointed because they're so basic.

256
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,450
Right. And the federal government hasn't been able to achieve those yet.

257
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:52,690
So on the one hand, we've got they want to see a minimum floor, not an aspirational goal for Justice 40, which I think is reasonable.

258
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:58,450
Secondly, they want to figure out and they use the phrase strong guardrails.

259
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:05,679
I don't quite know what that means, but I think they're thinking they don't want these investments to bleed over or leak over into other things.

260
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,690
They should be used for the purposes of supporting disadvantaged communities.

261
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:17,260
They're requiring agencies to be explicit about how they're changing practices.

262
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:22,810
That's a really important point, right? You.

263
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,450
This kind of speaks to Professor Curry's concept of bounded justice.

264
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:34,740
So. They're saying, well, how is the system going to change in order to deliver climate justice to these communities?

265
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:44,160
Because you're trying to retarget or reshape how investment happens across the federal government, across multiple programs.

266
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:53,880
But one important question here is, well, what does that mean for the ways in which programs are constructed in the in the first place?

267
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,279
We're using the existing programs of which these NGOs do have a lot of complaints

268
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:05,340
about those in order to try and deliver this new distribution of resources.

269
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:15,330
So Professor Currie's take on this would probably be we're using the same system and the same programs to try to deliver justice in a new way,

270
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,570
in a in a better realized way.

271
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:27,630
And I guess the problem with that is if those existing programs don't work well and you're trying to use the same delivery mechanisms,

272
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:40,040
is that going to work in ten? And they say, especially here, don't sacrifice accountability for agency level flexibility.

273
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,029
Almost certainly the some of the conversations that are happening within the

274
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:49,370
government that have been happening all year are around what agencies can do.

275
00:29:49,550 --> 00:30:00,170
And agency heads have an incentive to argue for greater flexibility in fulfilling these requests or these orders from the executive.

276
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:07,400
So they are almost certainly negotiating a bit behind the scenes to see how this can be put into practice.

277
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:15,800
What NGOs would like is for that flexibility to not overwhelm the actual progress towards the goal.

278
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:23,830
This other set of recommendations over the other side is from we just saw the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council.

279
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,060
And here I thought they've made lots of specific recommendations about different programs,

280
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,330
but I thought these were important because they're about process.

281
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,140
So please note that touching on what?

282
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:46,950
Who are the advisors in government? Right. I mentioned already that we check as an advisory body is, I think on the whole,

283
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:53,490
more diverse than the advice advisory bodies that you would find as typical across the federal government.

284
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,079
So what does that mean?

285
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:02,970
They want to see different perspectives, particularly from people who are used to doing things like community outreach and communication,

286
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:11,640
who are used to thinking about justice and how it might be achieved, who are used to communicating with this target population.

287
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:17,549
And they want to see they want to require states and localities.

288
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:26,360
And I think this is a complicated and difficult ask to use some of the tools that are being created, especially the map.

289
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,760
There's a map with statistics that we'll look at in a minute.

290
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:36,660
They would like to require jurisdictions to use that data in order to make allocation decisions for resources.

291
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,410
So in other words, in that case, you're relying on, well, we're going to set contingencies on this investment.

292
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:47,430
If we're going to give you the money. Here's the things you have to do in return,

293
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:54,360
which is a lot of how government works when there's communication between the federal level and states and localities.

294
00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:00,060
But it is it is rather tricky, especially when we're talking about disadvantaged communities.

295
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:06,600
Does that leverage really hold? Are you going to stop this investment from happening?

296
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:11,730
Because enough progress has not been made on changes in practice on the ground.

297
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:20,700
Is that ethical in circumstances where this is needed, money going to, I don't know, rebuild a community after a hurricane?

298
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,430
I think I have big questions about how to use that leverage.

299
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:36,790
So this is the one that makes my heart hurt. They're going to they want to see agencies measuring the dollar amounts of investments.

300
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,760
So this is a very important point.

301
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:50,030
We don't necessarily have the basic data and measurement, but with enough clarity to actually see progress towards our Justice 40 goals.

302
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:51,730
In some cases,

303
00:32:52,690 --> 00:33:01,240
they also want to prioritize local businesses and require fair wages and working conditions where the federal government is paying for this this work.

304
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:07,840
They want to improve communications, which is part of recruiting a different body of advisors and staff.

305
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:18,250
And explicitly this is really weird to me. This federal advisory body says explicitly in their report.

306
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:25,930
Since we produced our first recommendations, the Biden administration has invested in fossil fuel generation.

307
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:34,690
We don't think you should do that. And they use very strong language to say we strongly oppose what the Biden administration is doing on this point.

308
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:42,440
And that really stuck out to me because they were really like, no, just just none of this place again.

309
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:50,920
I'll remind you that they are advisory. Now, the environmental justice scorecard we will talk about in just a minute.

310
00:33:52,430 --> 00:34:00,139
Oh. So this is a lot of detail on how the policy works, but I hope that you can see that this is complicated.

311
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:05,510
Yes, but full of potential and also full of implementation and evaluation challenges.

312
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:12,170
Here is an evaluation done a little bit earlier this year from the Federation of Scientists,

313
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:17,970
which is a non-governmental group, which does advocacy around government use of science.

314
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,179
So we can already see and I think maybe because you've taken this course,

315
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,080
you might be able to predict some of these things, some of the implementation problems here.

316
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,950
So they went and they counted,

317
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:37,700
which I'm very glad they did it because I didn't want to do it if progress towards all of these different recommendations.

318
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:49,790
The White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council made 175 specific recommendations in the documentation produced by federal agencies.

319
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:57,170
This group, the Federation of Scientists, found evidence for progress on about half of that 175 targets.

320
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:04,070
So part of the problem here, why did we not make more progress so far?

321
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:09,110
There are a couple of different things. So.

322
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,580
First of all, there are barriers like statutory authority.

323
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:22,360
That means a lot of heads of agency said, well, we need new legislation in order to be able to change this program.

324
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:29,380
So that was a big problem because Congress might not be amenable to passing new legislation on this right now.

325
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:39,390
The next thing is lack of resources. So the executive order doesn't come with additional money to actually change any of these programs.

326
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:42,870
That appropriations process happens again in Congress.

327
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:52,320
So agency heads were reporting that they did not have sufficient resources to really change this program in order to achieve the Justice 40 targets.

328
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,820
And then thirdly, lack of clarity on what implementation means.

329
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:04,290
So even after the interim guidance and these recommendations,

330
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:11,070
agency heads were still sometimes unclear on what actually doing this would mean and doing it well.

331
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,870
The other point that was raised here by the Federation of Scientists,

332
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:24,299
I think is really important is the progress reported by the agency doesn't necessarily match what might

333
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:31,800
happen to you in terms of your lived experience changing if you are in one of these target communities,

334
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,370
either geographically or in terms of shared experiences.

335
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:42,130
If you think about it, the change in the program, then that has to filter through to investment changes.

336
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:49,000
A lot of these investments will take time to take effect, even if they are successfully and fully implemented.

337
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:57,100
So you on the ground might not see these changes as one reason why continued consultation might be really important here.

338
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,150
But that's that's one evaluation. We're part of the way through this.

339
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,570
I'm going to skip that for the moment and get you to the map, and then we'll come back to that in conclusion.

340
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,090
So. Take a look at this map.

341
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:20,959
This is one of the tools that's been created to try and define, according to all that policy detail,

342
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,650
what a disadvantaged or marginalized community actually is in this context.

343
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,430
Right. So. First things first if you.

344
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:37,840
Well, that was. This is what?

345
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:42,660
Oh, good. Am I going to have to show again?

346
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,870
I. Right. Oh. Okay.

347
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:53,690
I will not move. Sorry, everyone. So what do we.

348
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:57,620
What do we see when we look at this map? Give me your first impressions of the map.

349
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:04,250
What I can tell you is that the gray areas are supposed to represent jurisdictions that are,

350
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:09,770
according to these statistics, disadvantaged or marginalized.

351
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:14,809
What do we say? Yeah. Okay.

352
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:21,050
I'm going to hope that both of these like at once we get. Can you hear me?

353
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,110
Oh, yeah. It's very concentrated.

354
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:27,600
Concentrated in like the south east United States.

355
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:32,690
And then also it looks like northern Michigan kind of.

356
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:40,910
Right. You know, folks who are from Michigan, does this map on to how you think about disadvantaged or marginalized communities in Michigan?

357
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:47,320
What is this map actually showing? Please connect.

358
00:38:52,480 --> 00:39:02,139
Comfortable shoes are really important part of teaching this class. Please. It seems like it's showing more rural areas like we typically think of.

359
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:07,840
Disadvantaged communities in Michigan is like Wayne County area, but that's not what's being shown on the map.

360
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,500
Right. So thank you very much. You are just right.

361
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:21,710
So. First thing to observe when you think about any of this data, is this map consumed out?

362
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:26,960
This map is showing you large rural jurisdictions predominantly.

363
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,660
It doesn't mean that the smaller jurisdictions aren't represented in the dataset,

364
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:40,549
but the way that and this is what you see when you first go as a member of the public to look at this screening tool.

365
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:43,010
When you get to this website, that's the first thing that you see.

366
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:51,260
So you might ought to automatically say, you know, my community is not represented here, but you might have to zoom in.

367
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:58,370
So if you zoom into Michigan, you see how big some of these jurisdictions are up in the north of the state.

368
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:08,870
If you then zoom into southeast Michigan, you start to see maybe also some of the urban jurisdictions that are considered disadvantaged.

369
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:16,280
So my first critique here is the way the data is presented initially to the viewer might be really confusing.

370
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,720
So I want you guys to have a look at this tool.

371
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:24,410
If you have a device, if you don't have a device, look over someone's shoulder.

372
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:29,390
We're going to deal with these questions in a minute. But first of all, let's just take.

373
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:34,340
Come on. Yes, I want to continue.

374
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:37,640
There we go. This is the tool in real life.

375
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:42,470
Can you just start with what are your initial impressions of the tool?

376
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:50,600
And then what exactly are the criteria for designating any of these jurisdictions as disadvantaged?

377
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:54,170
Let's just start with that. To start with. I'll give you say.

378
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:59,610
5 minutes. Give me some of your first impressions. Talk to your neighbors.

379
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:05,280
Johno and I will do a little circulating, and then we'll come back as a group and see what you think about this.

380
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:11,390
Stop formulating some opinions about how this data is presented and how it is constructed.

381
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:40,790
So it's the. Okay.

382
00:41:53,140 --> 00:43:20,430
In. Yeah.

383
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:56,950
Or. Is.

384
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:21,520
You're just here. A little bit of that.

385
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:37,880
She was. If you concentrate.

386
00:44:49,550 --> 00:45:23,780
I. Supreme.

387
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:10,140
I don't. Yeah. Yeah.

388
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:39,720
Mr. I just think.

389
00:47:45,830 --> 00:48:19,060
Tell us. Yeah.

390
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:18,870
Yeah. Here. I know someone.

391
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:36,410
Yeah, I. And this one story.

392
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:46,080
I think. Yeah.

393
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:59,080
I think one of the. And that's.

394
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:22,170
You. It wasn't.

395
00:50:40,490 --> 00:51:09,320
Yeah. Okay.

396
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:25,020
This is. Tell me if this Mike is.

397
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:31,110
There we go. All right. So I managed to visit a few groups I think needed to join.

398
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,610
I wonder if anybody wants to share some of their initial reactions to this map.

399
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:40,710
What did you think about the layout? What did you think about the data?

400
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:47,370
What do you think about the concept of measuring disadvantaged or marginalized communities in this way?

401
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:53,860
Who wants to go first? I am not scary.

402
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:57,640
It's going to be fine. Yep.

403
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:08,960
Thank you. I think that we were trying to find like or like reasons why,

404
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:15,769
like a lot of the disadvantaged populations are kind of concentrated in the south and

405
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:22,130
then also main like which sets it apart from the rest of the states in that area,

406
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:29,120
had a little bit more of like a disadvantaged population. I think the map is helpful, but at the same time,

407
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:40,459
like there's so many different factors that go into like contributing to like disadvantages that like it was kind of difficult to like establish like

408
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:48,710
trends or like understand like a general idea of like why it is a certain way or concentrated in certain areas because of the different factors.

409
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:56,720
Yeah. So there's a lot in this map and several groups were mentioning like you've got multiple ways of measuring disadvantage.

410
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:04,340
So there are usually two or three criteria that have to be met simultaneously to be considered a disadvantage jurisdiction.

411
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:12,260
So what you're seeing on this big map is that the biggest jurisdictions are showing up because you're not zoomed in.

412
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:20,030
But there are lots of when you zoom right into cities, there's a lot of jurisdictions that also disadvantage there.

413
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:29,360
The difficult part is, what does this mean for communicating with the public on in terms of this these criteria and justifying why

414
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:35,630
you're making this policy decision to do investment in this way or change investment in communities in this way?

415
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,680
Good thinking. Who else wants to come in on this conversation?

416
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:49,620
So I look ridiculous now with my two cubes, but. What do we think?

417
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:57,810
Is there anything you would have done differently if you had had to been given this task of designing something that

418
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:06,600
can show to the public and to the communities themselves that these decision criteria for being disadvantaged.

419
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,649
Thank you. Oh I was going to comment more visually.

420
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:20,219
Like representing the. Oh, please do. Yeah. Something that bothered me was that there was no gradient for population density that like some

421
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,630
of these areas shaded in are very large geographical areas but don't include a lot of people,

422
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:31,590
which could be misleading if we're trying to prioritize, like what changes we can make that would affect the most people.

423
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:34,110
Yeah, I think that's a really good point.

424
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:41,750
So one of the things that we're struggling with maybe in terms of the policy is, as I said, the policy, it defines community.

425
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:51,840
Two different ways. One is geographic. So there's to some extent geographic representation of marginalization or disadvantage here.

426
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,480
But also they're trying to get at populations where you are.

427
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:59,760
So you see people with the same experiences, but they're not co-located.

428
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:06,330
So some of these indicators when you dig down are really about the first kind of community, the geographic community.

429
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:11,670
The second set of indicators are about experiential communities.

430
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:17,430
So it's difficult to show both of those things in the same graphic, I think.

431
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,669
And then this is a really good point you're referring to here.

432
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:28,890
Like what if our starting point is thinking about, well, we should distribute resources according to population in some way.

433
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:33,510
There are a lot of policies across the country, social policy, social supports,

434
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,630
where the the social support, the money is distributed according to population.

435
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:48,780
Does this break that rule? And if so, what does that mean for the redistribution of resources and how they would be rolled out?

436
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:54,870
The reason we're paying thank you so much attention to this map is this is going to form the

437
00:55:54,870 --> 00:56:03,059
basis for potentially for whatever comes next in terms of spending to mitigate climate change,

438
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:10,200
to mitigate economic disadvantage. So we need to pay really good attention to how this is being built, I think.

439
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:17,460
Who else wants to talk about the map? Did anyone dig down into like the health criteria or anything else?

440
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,830
On. Want to comment on some of the data that was being used to make these decision rules.

441
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:34,720
Because I've had a few people tell me that, for example, they felt that the education criteria were not so great that were being used.

442
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:38,710
Let's dig in and show you that. So.

443
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:44,549
One of the things I think is really interesting here. In this base map.

444
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:50,070
Right. Is you can zoom in. You can actually download the data.

445
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:57,840
But you can go through this methodology, methodology and data tab.

446
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:03,360
So this is what I mean here by different criteria. So you've got all these different categories.

447
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:09,110
Let's take climate change on the one hand. And then down here, health burdens.

448
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:14,660
So if we pick the health burdens, communities are identified as disadvantage.

449
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:27,200
If they are at or above the 90th percentile for asthma or diabetes or heart disease or low life expectancy, and there's an income measure.

450
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:37,490
So you also have to be above the 65th percentile for low income and 80% or more of individuals, 50 or older, not enrolled in higher education.

451
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:43,340
So some of the critiques around this have been, you know, asking the question,

452
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:50,720
what's the Biden administration deliberately setting a low bar in picking these particular thresholds for disadvantage?

453
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:59,990
And I think that's important when you add criteria like a number of these communities could be considered disadvantaged based on,

454
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:06,830
oh, now they're going to interact wonderful disadvantage based on one of these criteria alone.

455
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:15,140
When you add criteria to the decision rule, you're lowering the bar effectively for what constitutes a disadvantage community.

456
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:23,240
And so some critics have come from NGOs around that and especially like people asking what is the causation here?

457
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:28,100
Because this map doesn't show that. So it's not really exploring causation.

458
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:31,580
And I think the third set of critiques is really around. Well.

459
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:39,000
What does this show that and does this show the data in the way that is accessible to the public?

460
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:44,370
Meaningful to the public? Because these policy decisions will have to be justified to the public.

461
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,300
Or is that meaningful for people in those communities?

462
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:53,250
Will they recognize themselves as disadvantaged communities according to these criteria?

463
00:58:54,900 --> 00:59:02,790
One more problem that has been brought up in critique of exercises like this is what happens if you just above the cutoff.

464
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:14,459
So you see this in a lot of social policy. We set the federal poverty level at a particular in a particular place, a percentage of low income.

465
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:20,850
And then above that, if you just for slightly above that, you might not be receiving the benefits of the investment.

466
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:28,290
So there's always a question with these kinds of policies, how do they taper off or is this a hard cutoff?

467
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:34,370
And then if you fall slightly above the line on one of these criteria, for example, you know, if you're.

468
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:43,099
Just slightly below, let's say your 89 percentile for asthma or and then you the other ones don't count.

469
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:48,320
Does that mean you're just not disadvantaged quite enough to receive that investment?

470
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:53,510
So there's always these questions of what should the decision will be in these circumstances?

471
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:59,030
So I'm going to ask you to do something slightly more complicated on this basis.

472
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:04,430
I want you to discuss a slightly more complicated question for the next 10 minutes.

473
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:15,190
So. If there's an accountability framework here, what do you think should be some things that are included in this accountability framework?

474
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:22,760
If you were one of the NGOs that was calling for accountability in meeting that 40% goal for federal investments,

475
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:31,309
what are some of the things you think must absolutely be included? I'm going to give you, oh, we don't have a ton of time, maybe a 5 minutes.

476
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:35,720
I'm going to visit the groups I didn't visit before. If we can swap China, that would be great.

477
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,620
We want to. There is a jam board if you want. I don't know if you've got a lot of time because we haven't got a lot of time to go over it.

478
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:49,940
But maybe about 5 minutes. Just one or two things that you think should be included in an accountability framework for this policy.

479
01:00:56,470 --> 01:01:11,710
Okay. I'm going to go this. Yeah.

480
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:33,430
US. Yes.

481
01:01:53,720 --> 01:05:05,000
You. We?

482
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:25,390
Was. I.

483
01:05:53,420 --> 01:06:06,820
Yeah. So.

484
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:37,060
So. Well, thank you.

485
01:06:53,900 --> 01:07:12,110
The. I know.

486
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:35,210
Yeah. Yeah.

487
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:51,030
Right now. I.

488
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:57,410
Was. Interesting.

489
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,410
It's like an orphan. But.

490
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:11,700
Oh, yeah.

491
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:44,620
Transgender. You know, it's.

492
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,380
I. I.

493
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:18,400
Guy. I was very glad that it's having.

494
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:23,920
I think that my concern is that despite. Oh, there we go.

495
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:28,930
I think when I send in a certain position, it works. It's never done this before the entire time.

496
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:33,880
Of because we have lovely observers today. It's because it's decided to not work so well.

497
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:37,390
All right. I just want you to think about this.

498
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,380
Right. An accountability framework requires a process.

499
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:50,800
It doesn't just require data. You need to think about what are the points that which you as a member of the public not only could see this data,

500
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:55,810
see how much of this investment actually has flowed to certain places or communities,

501
01:09:57,070 --> 01:10:01,870
but what are the effects of of that spending, which might take a long time?

502
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,960
You also then have to be able to do something about it.

503
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:11,290
Who do you contact if you can't if you don't like the way that these investments are distributed?

504
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:21,250
Right. So this all goes back to thinking about the political system, thinking about individuals access to authority and power within that system.

505
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:29,260
And so it does tie in to the rest of the class in that regard, in terms of you need that process to be fair,

506
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:36,099
equitable and accessible as well as maybe you need this data so you can see what the problems are,

507
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:44,740
where they're located, who is affected, and then try to construct an agenda to try and change that distribution for yourselves.

508
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:50,200
All right. Thank you so much for being patient. We'll be back in the next class to talk about the election.

509
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,690
So I will see you then. Bye for now.
