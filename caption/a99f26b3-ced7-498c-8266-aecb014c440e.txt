1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,541
In this session, we'll learn about pedigree analysis.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,036
Learning objectives are to define founder genotype probability,

3
00:00:10,036 --> 00:00:14,265
genotype transmission probability, and penetrance.

4
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:18,670
Use the seven steps to calculate the probability of a pedigree, and

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,088
describe how pedigree probabilities are or were used in practice.

6
00:00:26,328 --> 00:00:31,743
In pedigree analysis, what we know are people's phenotype or their traits

7
00:00:31,743 --> 00:00:37,750
that we're interested in studying and the configuration of the pedigree.

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,810
We don't know people's actual genotypes.

9
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,698
Using the laws of Mendel, we can estimate the probabilities for

10
00:00:45,698 --> 00:00:49,953
the offspring's genotype from the parents if we know or

11
00:00:49,953 --> 00:00:54,220
assume a particular mode of inheritance.

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,391
And using Hardy-Weinberg,

13
00:00:56,391 --> 00:01:00,915
we can estimate the genotype probabilities for the parents.

14
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:08,620
Finding the probability of the pedigree is assessing the likelihood

15
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,716
that the disease distribution or the trait or phenotype distribution

16
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:19,160
seen in the pedigree could happen under a particular inheritance model.

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,138
The models that we could consider are things like autosomal dominant,

18
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:25,931
autosomal recessive, or X-linked recessive.

19
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,366
If we compare the probability of a certain pedigree under different models,

20
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:36,922
we can determine which model of inheritance is most likely to explain

21
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:40,285
the pedigree's pattern of disease that we see.

22
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,980
There are seven steps to calculating the probability of a pedigree.

23
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,363
We're going to go through all of them one by one.

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,849
There are several different probabilities that we're going to be thinking about when

25
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,160
we analyze pedigrees.

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,610
One is the founder genotype probability.

27
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,692
So that's the probability that any person in

28
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:08,187
the population would have a particular genotype.

29
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:13,430
This is just the relative genotype frequency for anyone in the population.

30
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,270
We calculate that under Hardy-Weinberg.

31
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:22,201
Next, for the offspring generation, we have the genotype transmission

32
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:27,055
probabilities, or the conditional probability that an offspring will

33
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:31,289
inherit a particular genotype given the genotype of their parents.

34
00:02:31,688 --> 00:02:34,491
Finally, we'll consider penetrance,

35
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:38,970
the probability of a particular phenotype given a genotype.

36
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,662
This is the probability that an individual who has a specific genotype will

37
00:02:43,662 --> 00:02:47,021
actually have the trait that you're interested in.

38
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:55,460
Step one in analyzing the pedigree is we want to choose a mode of inheritance.

39
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:00,266
So for example, if you have the pedigree shown on the slide, you could think

40
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:05,147
that maybe the most likely mode of inheritance here is autosomal recessive,

41
00:03:05,147 --> 00:03:07,701
because both parents are unaffected and

42
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:11,790
the offspring that they have are both affected and unaffected.

43
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,390
So using the Medelian logic,

44
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,530
sometimes we can use the phenotype to infer the genotype.

45
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,210
In other cases, it's a more complex process.

46
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:27,518
And we might want to test different modes of inheritance for the same pedigree.

47
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:36,247
In the second step, we're going to want to establish the penetrant of each genotype.

48
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:41,356
The penetrance is the degree to which a certain phenotype being affected

49
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:45,900
by disease is exhibited by someone with a particular genotype.

50
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,705
So if you have genotype whatever, the penetrance is the probability

51
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:57,520
that you'll actually get disease based on that genotype.

52
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,397
If a genotype has complete penetrance,

53
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:05,410
anyone with the genotype will always exhibit the disease phenotype.

54
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,648
For example, if you have a small a small a genotype for an autosomal recessive

55
00:04:10,648 --> 00:04:15,254
disorder, you'll always get that autosomal recessive disease.

56
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:20,322
Under a model of complete penetrance, the probability of someone having

57
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:25,740
the affected phenotype given that the person has the affected genotype is 1.

58
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,405
So the probability of being affected by the disease or

59
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:35,031
trait given the genotype small a small a is equal to 1 under complete penetrance.

60
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,712
Under an autosomal recessive model and the complete penetrance assumption,

61
00:04:42,712 --> 00:04:47,776
the probability of affected or the probability of disease given the small

62
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:52,460
a small a recessive genotype, for example, is always gonna be 1.

63
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,140
And the probability of having the disease given any other genotype will be 0.

64
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,517
And the converse,

65
00:04:58,517 --> 00:05:04,379
the probability of not having disease given the small a small a genotype, is 0.

66
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:09,845
And the probability of having no disease is 1 for the other genotypes.

67
00:05:09,845 --> 00:05:15,685
Under the autosomal dominant model and complete penetrance assumption,

68
00:05:15,685 --> 00:05:18,834
if you have the small a small a genotype,

69
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:22,660
the probability that you have the disease is 0.

70
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,306
If you have at least one copy of the dominant allele, and here remember that

71
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:32,470
the dominant allele is the disease allele and it's going to be the big A.

72
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,294
The probability of having a disease given that you have at least one

73
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:38,690
copy of big A is 1.

74
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,687
And the probability of not having disease under that scenario is 0.

75
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:50,610
Some genotypes have incomplete penetrance.

76
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,625
So individuals with the affected genotype or say, for example,

77
00:05:55,625 --> 00:06:00,274
an autosomal recessive two copies of the recessive allele,

78
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:06,041
maybe they don't actually exhibit the recessive or affected phenotype.

79
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,227
This can happen when the development of the phenotype is controlled by more

80
00:06:12,227 --> 00:06:15,950
than one gene or is modified by environmental factors.

81
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,675
So just for example, if only 80% of the individuals with

82
00:06:20,675 --> 00:06:25,116
a small a small a genotype have the albinism phenotype,

83
00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:30,150
the penetrance of the small a small a genotype would be 0.8.

84
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:37,000
Or the probability of having albinism given the small a small a genotype is 0.8.

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,054
Of course in the same logic, the probability of not having albinism

86
00:06:42,054 --> 00:06:47,791
given the small the small a small a genotype would be 1 minus 0.8 or 0.2.

87
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,838
If you know the penetrance for the genotype, then you know the probability of

88
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:56,440
being affected and the probability of not being affected.

89
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,199
So the probability of not being affected given the genotype is 1 minus

90
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,980
the probability of being affected given the genotype.

91
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:12,428
So here for example, you have the penetrance function of this genotype,

92
00:07:12,428 --> 00:07:16,796
it gives you the probability of being affected and

93
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:22,640
not affected given all of the potential genotypes here.

94
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,925
So if the probability of being affected given that your big A big A is 0.1,

95
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:33,058
you know the probability of not being affected given big A big A is 0.9.

96
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:38,439
This set of probabilities for

97
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:42,784
given genotype is called the penetrance function.

98
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:47,890
In step 3, we'll determine the potential genotypes of each person under

99
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,161
the mode of inheritance from step 1.

100
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,377
So for example, here we have the pedigree that we saw before, and

101
00:07:56,377 --> 00:08:00,586
we know that if we're using an autosomal recessive model and

102
00:08:00,586 --> 00:08:06,130
we're using complete penetrance, that the parents must be heterozygous.

103
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:12,031
This child must be homozygous affected, and each of these other two children

104
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:18,220
could either be homozygous unaffected or heterozygous for the disease allele.

105
00:08:21,954 --> 00:08:26,115
In step 4, we'll determine the founder genotype probabilities.

106
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:32,365
So the founders of the pedigree are people whose parents are not in the pedigree.

107
00:08:32,365 --> 00:08:37,659
So in this case that's person 1-1 and person 1-2.

108
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:42,521
If we assume that the founders could be any randomly mating individual in

109
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:43,717
the population,

110
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:49,355
we can get their genotype probabilities by assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

111
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,099
So for example, if you have two alleles, the allele frequency of big A,

112
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:58,530
as you remember, is the probability of big A, and we can call that p.

113
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,530
Where the allele frequency of small a, for example, would be q.

114
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:07,900
To get the founder genotype probabilities, we just use Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

115
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,660
The probability of big A big A is going to be p times p or p squared.

116
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,142
The probability of big A small a is 2pq, and small a small a is q squared.

117
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,241
In practice we probably won't know what the allele frequency of big A and

118
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:24,790
small a actually are.

119
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,115
So we'll have to make some guesses as to what we think the allele frequencies

120
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:33,253
are in the population in order to calculate the founder probabilities.

121
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:39,210
In the fifth step, we'll determine the transmission probabilities.

122
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,810
This is the probability of transmitting particular genotypes to the offspring

123
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,540
generation.

124
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,026
You have already assumed that the parents have a particular genotype.

125
00:09:50,026 --> 00:09:55,083
Now, we'll just use the Punnett square or Mendel's law of segregation to

126
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:59,991
figure out the probability of each child having a particular genotype.

127
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:05,558
So for example, if you want to know the probability

128
00:10:05,558 --> 00:10:12,289
of this transmission that the person I-1 is small a small a,

129
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:18,010
that's a function of the genotypes of the parents.

130
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,777
So given that the parents are big A small a, the probability of having a small

131
00:10:22,777 --> 00:10:28,030
a small a individual is one-half times one-half which is one-fourth.

132
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:31,187
Remember, the transmission probabilities for

133
00:10:31,187 --> 00:10:36,661
each of the offspring are independent of the probabilities of the other offspring.

134
00:10:38,842 --> 00:10:43,616
So now transmission probabilities are determined using Mendel's laws.

135
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:47,391
Here when we're doing the transmission probabilities,

136
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:52,030
no information about the phenotype is necessary, only the genotype.

137
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:57,287
So again, what we're showing is, here's the probability that this

138
00:10:57,287 --> 00:11:02,700
first child is small a small a, and that's what we just saw before.

139
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,974
The probability of inheriting a small a from I-1 and

140
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:08,250
a small a from I-2 is one-fourth.

141
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,239
The probability that this person is heterozygous is one-half, and

142
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:16,320
the probability that they're homozygous dominant is one-fourth.

143
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,957
We're not using any information about their phenotype,

144
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:20,700
whether they have the disease or not.

145
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,950
We're just calculating the genotype transmission probability.

146
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,759
And because the transmission probabilities for

147
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:33,280
the offspring are independent, we can calculate the overall probability for

148
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,140
a set of offspring by multiplying their probabilities together.

149
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,553
So for example, the probability that this person is big A big A,

150
00:11:41,553 --> 00:11:45,882
this person is small a small a, and this person is big A small a,

151
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:50,870
given the genotypes of the parents, are going to be the probability that

152
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,940
this individual is a big A big A, which is one-half times one-half.

153
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,710
The probability of small a small a, one-half times one-half.

154
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,643
And the probability of big A small a,

155
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:07,680
which is 2 times one-half times one-half, is 1 over 32.

156
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,508
We just multiply all those probabilities together, because each of

157
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:16,461
the offspring's transmission probabilities are independent of the other offspring.

158
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,275
In step 6,

159
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:22,919
we'll calculate the probabilities of each pedigree member given their phenotype,

160
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:26,420
their potential genotype, and the penetrance of the disease.

161
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,283
So the total probability for a member of the pedigree is going to

162
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:35,781
be the probability of having the genotype and phenotype,

163
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:40,003
which is gonna be the probability of the genotype times

164
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:45,460
the probability of having the phenotype given the genotype, right?

165
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,900
So the probability of a certain pedigree member for

166
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,980
founders is gonna be the founder genotype probability times

167
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,662
the probability of the phenotype given the genotype.

168
00:12:56,662 --> 00:13:02,092
From the penetrance function, the probability of having the genotype for

169
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:05,560
founders is gonna be the founder probability.

170
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,724
And the probability of phenotype times genotype is gonna be from penetrance.

171
00:13:09,724 --> 00:13:12,334
For the offspring, it's the same thing,

172
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:16,615
except this probability comes from the transmission probability and

173
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:21,189
again, this part of the probability comes from the penetrance function.

174
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,810
Now we wanna calculate the total probability of the pedigree.

175
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:29,720
This is going to be done by multiplying all of the probabilities

176
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,960
of the pedigree members together.

177
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,848
The way that we've set this up in the way that we've done our conditional

178
00:13:36,848 --> 00:13:39,260
probabilities already.

179
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,112
We can actually just multiply the probability of

180
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,266
each of the members together to get the total.

181
00:13:44,832 --> 00:13:48,450
Here, n is the number of people in the pedigree.

182
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:54,842
And this formula just says the probability of the pedigree is the product

183
00:13:54,842 --> 00:14:01,782
of 1 to n of everyone's probability of the genotype times their penetrance.

184
00:14:04,471 --> 00:14:10,977
So let's just give an example, assume we have the following penetrance function.

185
00:14:10,977 --> 00:14:16,213
Someone has a probability of being affected given a big A big A genotype

186
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:21,182
of 0.1, probability of affected given big A small a is 0.3,

187
00:14:21,182 --> 00:14:23,424
and small a small a is 0.8.

188
00:14:23,424 --> 00:14:28,526
Let's say the probability of the small a allele in the population is 0.1.

189
00:14:28,526 --> 00:14:33,900
So let's calculate this overall probability for the pedigree.

190
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:39,330
To do that, we're going to use the founder probabilities and the parental generation.

191
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:46,630
So here I'm using Hardy-Weinberg 22 PQ essentially two times 20.9 times point

192
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:51,498
one And here's the penetrates the probability of being not

193
00:14:51,498 --> 00:14:56,756
affected given big a small E I've calculated here the remainder

194
00:14:56,756 --> 00:15:01,850
of the probabilities for each of the other pedigree members.

195
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,341
Using for founders.

196
00:15:03,341 --> 00:15:07,491
The founder genotype probability times their penetrates and for offspring.

197
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:10,380
The transmission probabilities times their penetrates.

198
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,252
After that we can multiply the probabilities of each of the pedigree

199
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:17,240
members together.

200
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,380
And we come up with a final pedigree probability of 3.03 times

201
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,147
10 to the negative sixth in practice calculating pedigree

202
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:32,849
probabilities forms the basis of what we know as segregation analysis,

203
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:38,363
segregation analysis is the process of fitting formal genetic models

204
00:15:38,363 --> 00:15:44,190
to a biological family to determine the most likely mode of inheritance.

205
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,163
So when these when we calculate these pedigree probabilities,

206
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:52,990
it's not the actual probabilities in the pedigree that are important.

207
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,514
It's the comparison of those probabilities across different

208
00:15:57,514 --> 00:16:02,670
models that gives insight into the most likely mode of inheritance.

209
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,804
So in practice, the model parameters like a legal frequencies,

210
00:16:06,804 --> 00:16:11,691
penetrations functions can be examined across a range of values to determine

211
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:13,290
the best fitting model.

212
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:20,690
So this kind of analysis was done when we couldn't actually measure Jenna types.

213
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:25,397
So researchers would collect families, they would get the pedigrees of

214
00:16:25,397 --> 00:16:30,795
the families they'd understand who had the phenotype and who was related to who and

215
00:16:30,795 --> 00:16:35,502
how and they would run these really complex models under different modes

216
00:16:35,502 --> 00:16:40,364
of inheritance with different assumptions about the model parameters and

217
00:16:40,364 --> 00:16:45,303
compare the probabilities under each of those scenarios to see what the most

218
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:48,510
likely mode of inheritance was for the disease.

219
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,818
And so they would they would use this to come up with estimates of polio

220
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:57,427
frequencies in the population of what they thought the penetrates was and

221
00:16:57,427 --> 00:17:01,470
how they thought the disease was inherited in the populations.

222
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,146
And then it wasn't until we could measure genetic information that we

223
00:17:06,146 --> 00:17:11,060
could really test a lot of the a lot of the hypotheses that were generated by

224
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,741
segregation analysis.
