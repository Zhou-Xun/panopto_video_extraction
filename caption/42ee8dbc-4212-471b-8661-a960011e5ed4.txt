Hello, and welcome to Public Health 509,
Introduction to Qualitative Methods.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,310
My name is Elizabeth King.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,880
I'm an assistant professor in
the department of Health Behavior and

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,990
Health Education here at
the School of Public Health.

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,020
The goal of Public Health 509
is to provide an overview of

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,560
qualitative research methods as commonly
used in the field of public health.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,170
This introductory course will cover topics
such as, what are qualitative methods?

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,350
When we might use them in public health?

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,770
What shall we consider in
designing qualitative studies?

10
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,000
How do we analyze qualitative data?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,545
And what are some of the ways of
presenting qualitative study results?

12
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:41,736
By the end of this course, my hope is
that you will come to appreciate the role

13
00:00:41,736 --> 00:00:45,540
that qualitative research methods
play in studying pressing public

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,691
health problems and evaluating public
health interventions and policy.

15
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:54,301
The course is designed to appeal to
students from a variety of disciplinary

16
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:55,259
backgrounds.

17
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:00,219
And I invite you throughout this course
to think about ways that you may apply

18
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:04,409
qualitative research methods in
academic research studies and

19
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,099
public health practice.
