1
00:00:14,150 --> 00:01:39,270
We're going to get started in just a couple more minutes. Then come in and then we'll get going if that's not.

2
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:49,050
OK. The lecture today is on bioterrorism, and this is a very, very serious subject.

3
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:56,430
And then when we finish this, we're going to go over the test results and I'll be heading out and getting them back again.

4
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:06,450
So when I was at the state health lab and they were having anthrax letters sent places in the United States,

5
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:16,660
we opened up this first one container and it said there on the test request form, you will be dead in two days.

6
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:23,260
You have no idea what that does to your staff, to a laboratory was all a hoax.

7
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,300
But it still scared everyone such that people were talking about quitting.

8
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:34,780
It is very, very serious subject. I cannot overemphasize that.

9
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:44,110
So please read the chapter in your textbook on on terrorism, bioterrorism and get all the information that you can.

10
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:52,540
You might want to look at the CDC website also, because everyone needs to be educated on this.

11
00:02:52,540 --> 00:03:03,250
So what is it? It's the use of biological agents to cause catastrophic and destabilizing disease epidemics,

12
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:10,120
generally by individuals or groups of people who are motivated generally by political reasons,

13
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,820
but perhaps religious, ecological or other have other objectives.

14
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:22,540
And they don't care what happens. They want their whatever it is they're pushing.

15
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:30,690
They want it. So let's define select agents.

16
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,700
So all of the information going to be hearing today primarily comes from the Centers for Disease Control,

17
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,810
but some from the Infectious Diseases Society of America,

18
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:48,810
some from CDC, some from the American, the Infectious Diseases Society, as well as American Society for Microbiology.

19
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:57,690
So CDC regulates the possession, use and transfer of select agents and toxins.

20
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,550
So if you don't get the permission,

21
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:12,860
you better not send it anywhere and select agents and toxins that have the potential to serve to to cause a severe threat to the public's health.

22
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:24,320
CDC has a select agent program, it oversees all these activities and registers all laboratories and other entities in the United States that possess,

23
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:33,950
use or transfer a select agent. And I have a list of some select agents should be also on the handout.

24
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:41,360
So here are potential bioterrorism agents, bacterial agents, anthrax, which I know we've all heard of,

25
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:50,990
but also brucellosis, cholera, Flanders plague, tularemia and Q fever.

26
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:56,090
We have viruses, smallpox, which scares me to death.

27
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:03,520
And I was vaccinated for smallpox when I was a baby. Venezuelan equine encephalitis,

28
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:15,720
then the Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever and then the toxins that are shown here botulinum toxin Steph and Ruby Bryson and T-2 mycotoxins.

29
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:28,530
When I worked for the state, we did the testing for botulism. It was all done in a secure facility and with a lot of safety precautions.

30
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:40,780
We didn't have the state patrol come in and watch us do the testing, and they were satisfied that what we were doing was safe and effective.

31
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:47,410
One case of smallpox anywhere in the world would be a worldwide epidemic.

32
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:56,360
That's how serious it is. That's because people are no longer vaccinated for smallpox.

33
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,720
Next slide. So these are high priority agents, and you need to know that term,

34
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,540
these are organisms that pose a risk to national security because they can be easily

35
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:14,690
disseminated or transmitted between persons and when they transmit between persons.

36
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:23,030
Person doesn't know that they've been infected until a few days later. They result in high mortality, high mortality rates.

37
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:30,500
They have the potential for rapid spread and the major public health impact they will.

38
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:41,350
They're not may they will cause public panic and social disruption, and they require special actions for preparedness.

39
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:52,070
So every health department in the United States. As plans in case there is an outbreak of a select agent.

40
00:06:52,070 --> 00:07:01,310
Hospitals have some. It depends on the hospital, on how prepared they are, they're more prepared for a staff outbreak.

41
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:12,600
Staph aureus outbreaks that perhaps perhaps something much more serious, but they would be the partners with public health.

42
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:22,770
So these are high priority or category agents, Clostridium botulinum toxin toxin, Brunetti,

43
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:34,260
Yersinia pestis causing plague burial, a major causing smallpox, Francisella tularensis, rickettsia, Prozac.

44
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:47,010
I know any of the viral hemorrhagic fevers are in this group of listed Ebola, Marburg, Lassa and acouple in those eastern equine encephalitis.

45
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:52,710
And then the Reisen toxin. These their high priority agents.

46
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:59,790
They're hard to diagnose. Yeah, we could certainly diagnose Yersinia pestis if we knew a patient came in.

47
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,860
They've been somewhere in the southwest.

48
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:09,300
You know, they had a typical fever IDs calling us and saying, when we get an identification, we'll be on the phone with public health Corbet.

49
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:18,000
But to have a whole community or whole part of a state come down with something that is unmanageable,

50
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,500
although every facility would do the best that they could.

51
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:32,260
There are also Category B agents that what what classified as category category B diseases or overlap agents.

52
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:42,370
These are moderately easy to disseminate. They result in not the high morbidity and mortality rates, but moderate morbidity and mortality.

53
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,320
So they're kind of not quite so bad if you can believe that.

54
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:55,270
They do require specific enhancements of Siddiqui's diagnostic capacity and enhanced disease surveillance.

55
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:04,740
So CDC would be all over this, as would public health in the states. So here are some of the select agents and toxins.

56
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:12,600
Another list that we have Bacillus anthracis and the Pasteur strain of Bacillus anthracis that's used to make the vaccine.

57
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,840
We have Bacillus species, and yes, we do see Brucella in patients brucellosis.

58
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,370
There's the epsilon toxin, a cluster of the fringes.

59
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:36,900
Burkholderia Malley and pseudomallei staphylococcal antitoxin toxin b Rift Valley fever virus, which is not native to the United States.

60
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:47,760
Hendra virus and Nipah virus and some of these viruses you may have heard about the last few years outbreaks in other other countries.

61
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,270
Next slide. So then we have Category C diseases.

62
00:09:52,270 --> 00:10:02,170
So Category B was not quite as bad as Category A, Category C are emerging pathogens that could be engineered for mass dissemination.

63
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:08,140
Because they're available, they can easily be produced and disseminated,

64
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:16,030
and they have once again that potential for high morbidity and high mortality rates and major health impact.

65
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:27,060
And here they're the examples of two viruses that we've we've already talked about Nipah virus and hantavirus.

66
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:35,470
So why why are we worried about these agents? They are easily spread via aerosol.

67
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:43,470
They get it into the air handling system of some building or a hospital. And you have a disaster.

68
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,740
The organisms are very fairly stable in an aerosol.

69
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,570
We are all susceptible. We are all susceptible.

70
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:59,300
As I said, they stopped vaccinating people for smallpox years ago.

71
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,380
There is. Person to person transmission of some of the diseases.

72
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:12,910
Certainly smallpox, plague and the viral hemorrhagic fevers. Some of these are very difficult to diagnose.

73
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:18,190
Now, if it's going to play Yersinia pestis, we can identify that in the micro lab.

74
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:23,650
We have the first clue that it might be a case of playing a Dr. Collins, and this is really weird.

75
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:30,820
This is what this patient looks like. We go into our BSL three at Beaumont and the lab here.

76
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:38,530
The Michigan lab has a BSL three lab also normally used for fungal and michael bacterial cultures,

77
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:45,460
but it could be used for other types of for other diseases that need containment.

78
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:52,780
So many people have not seen these diseases many physicians, many nurses and so on, and they don't know how to diagnose them.

79
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,580
They don't know how to treat patients.

80
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:08,440
And then, of course, some of them previously weren't developed for biowarfare BW biowarfare, as bad as that sounds.

81
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,540
So I've already mentioned the laboratory response network, but I want to bring it up again.

82
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:19,720
This is a laboratories both public and private across the United States and other countries.

83
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:27,640
We test according to consensus protocols, so we all use pretty much the same guidelines for our procedures.

84
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:38,800
We have timely and accurate testing and reporting generally by computers, and we're linked with local, state and national and federal agencies.

85
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:51,090
So if we have something major, our state police will know about it right away, as well as the health department as well as other states.

86
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:57,870
So more on the laboratory response network, you have this nice pyramid, the lron structure for bioterrorism.

87
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:05,250
So it's a diverse laboratory network, as it says once again, national network of local,

88
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:13,290
state and federal public health labs, hospital labs, food testing labs, veterinary labs, environmental testing.

89
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,260
We all work together on something like this.

90
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:26,880
They provide laboratory diagnostics and the capacity to respond to biological and chemical terrorism threats and other public health emergencies.

91
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:35,700
So that's part of the diverse laboratory network as part of the is the in the lower end, it's also multi-agency collaboration, as I've got here.

92
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:44,950
It's a partnership. It is a partnership with key stakeholders in the response and preparation to biological and chemical terrorism.

93
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:50,640
So who is included in this besides the the actual laboratories, the hospital and public health?

94
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,330
Certainly CDC. Absolutely. CDC would be involved.

95
00:13:54,330 --> 00:14:09,560
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Social Association of Public Health Laboratories are all founding partners of this collaboration.

96
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:16,550
Next line, what's the mission of the LRA? The mission of the Lawrence for the partners,

97
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,540
the people who are part of the labs and other facilities participating is that they

98
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,150
will maintain an integrated national and international network of laboratories.

99
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:34,850
So it's not just United States, it's our laboratories are in the Caribbean nations and Mexico and South America, in Europe, you name it.

100
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:41,240
We have partners everywhere. And so we're going to respond.

101
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,370
Everyone will respond quickly to acts of chemical or biological terrorism,

102
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,740
emerging infectious diseases and other public health threats and emergencies.

103
00:14:51,740 --> 00:15:03,350
So in this box, down below our mission in action, Betty preparedness timely detection of Bacillus anthracis during the anthrax attacks in 2001.

104
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:11,970
And then we have bio watch the laboratories are connected to and they'll say, Hey, my lab isolated this.

105
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,010
Are you seeing this? So we all talk to each other.

106
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:23,150
There's also public health emergency response, and they have developed rapid tests, for example,

107
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:28,790
for detection of SARS-CoV-2, the severe acute respiratory syndrome and also monkeypox.

108
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:34,310
We don't see monkeypox for the most part, not an endemic disease in the United States.

109
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:42,230
However, somebody is working in a zoo and they get a new shipment of monkeys in there could be monkeypox.

110
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:48,560
So you always just because it's not native to the United States, you can't say that you will never see it.

111
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:58,340
Hopefully, you won't. But who knows? So here's our laboratory network, and it's basically there's a lab in every state.

112
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:04,670
There's more than 140 federal, state and local labs in all 50 states and abroad.

113
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:11,960
They're national labs. As I said before our CDC, the military labs, and they perform definitive testing.

114
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,670
There are reference labs that have BSL.

115
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:22,220
Three laboratories are capable of confirmatory testing for agents such as Bacillus anthracis and Clostridium botulinum toxin.

116
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:29,090
If you have the reagents, if you don't have the reagents, you can't do the confirmatory testing,

117
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:34,550
but you can certainly call your state public health laboratories. This is what we got.

118
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:41,800
We're sending it off to you or send us a QR courier card. We'll bring it to you directly.

119
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:53,440
Next slide. So once again, a partnerships CDC, founding partners of the Association of Public Health Labs and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

120
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,430
And yes, when I was at the state lab for 17 years, I got to know several FBI agents and I will tell you they don't.

121
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:06,430
They don't joke around. They're very, very serious and several state patrolmen also.

122
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:13,580
But we're all in this together. We're all trying to do the best thing for everyone.

123
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:18,740
So partnerships, that's the name of the game, they shape the scope of the LRA.

124
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:27,530
So international laboratories LRA membership includes, as I said before, labs in other countries such as Australia and Canada.

125
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,280
And there are even more countries that have national labs now in the LRA.

126
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:40,970
And they are they on the environmental front, the aliens working with the EPA to build testing capacity for measuring biological

127
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:47,880
and chemical samples from biological and chemical agents and environmental samples.

128
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:54,180
Because you have to know where it came from. You have to know that and stop that spread.

129
00:17:54,180 --> 00:18:00,180
Food and water bill already includes food and water testing labs such as the public health labs

130
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:06,840
and some of the private commercial labs that test food and water to guard against contamination.

131
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,670
And then finally, last but certainly not least, the veterinary labs are tremendously important.

132
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,420
The National Animal Health Laboratory Network,

133
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:25,770
through USDA and the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnostics, is a great partner in this effort.

134
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:39,460
They're all working together on this. OK, so here we have national labs and you can see they do the definitive characterization.

135
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:48,310
OK? And then as I said, this is going to be a repeat because I really want you to know this through national labs,

136
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:53,560
including those at CDC responsible for a specialized strain characterizations,

137
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:03,480
the bio forensics select agent activity and handling highly infectious biological agents and toxic chemicals.

138
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:10,930
So it is not at all unusual if your lab should have an unusual isolate.

139
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:15,100
You send it off to the state public health lab, a column for say, Hey, this is what we got.

140
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,630
I think this is what it is, but I'm sending it to you. I need your confirmation.

141
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:24,130
Send it down on a career path and then your phone rings.

142
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:34,300
Couple of hours later, and it's an FBI agent and you end up talking to the FBI and you're hoping that you don't say anything wrong.

143
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:41,750
But that's I mean, everybody's in it together. So that's national lives.

144
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,400
Then we have reference labs and they do confirmatory testing.

145
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,900
So if a hospital lab sees something unusual, they send it off to a reference lab.

146
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,600
That reference lab will confirm the identification or say No, it's not that.

147
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,590
So once again,

148
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:06,920
reference labs are responsible for investigation and or referral of specimens made up of more than 140 state and local public health laboratories,

149
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:14,810
military labs, federal labs and local public health, also including veterinary agriculture, food, water testing.

150
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:22,040
The whole list is up there. They're in the U.S., they're in Australia, they're in Canada, the UK and so on.

151
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:31,460
And there are even more across Europe now. So this is not just in the United States, this is worldwide.

152
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:41,180
And then we have Sentinel Labs and these recognize and rule out or refer on and that's that the statement you have to know,

153
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:51,610
rule it out or refer it on to a higher level laboratory. So setting the labs as it says here, provide routine diagnostic services,

154
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:57,970
these are are your hospital laboratories, these are your commercial laboratories and so on.

155
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,880
We rule it out or refer it on.

156
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:08,260
These labs may not be equipped to perform the same tests as something a higher level lab in the lower end reference lab,

157
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:17,880
but they can test samples and decide what needs to be sent on for additional testing.

158
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:26,340
OK, so here's a basic signal clinical app has to be licensed under clear Abbott for microbiology

159
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:34,290
has to be successfully inspected by a CMS approved organization for clinical labs.

160
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:39,360
It's generally the College of American pathologists do the inspection for public health labs.

161
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,040
It's usually another public health laboratory that's doing the inspection.

162
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:53,310
The lab has to have policies and procedures for referral of diagnostics, first specimens to advanced set in the laboratories.

163
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:56,640
And if your lab clinical laboratory is licensed, they will.

164
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,180
They have to have these procedures, and the lab has policies and procedures for a direct referral of suspicious,

165
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,700
suspicious specimens or isolates to the nearest reference lab.

166
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:18,410
That's in the lower end. And certainly that would go along with the call that you get, but I had a few of you will be there in 24 hours,

167
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:27,870
media call for the state police immediately call to the public, the state public health laboratory.

168
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:35,760
So there's also advance and allege that these are class two or higher fire and have to have biological safety cabinets in a classroom facility.

169
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:48,450
They have to comply with all the biosafety guidelines and practices and have procedures and practices for use of additional risk for protection.

170
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:59,550
And when it's necessary. So if you're in a clinical lab, clinical microbiology lab and you do Michael Bacteriology testing,

171
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:07,320
you need to be doing it at a laminar flow fluid with very little traffic in the room, preferably in a BSL three facility.

172
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:17,910
And so if one of those suspicious type specimens came in, it would go directly into the BSL three four higher level containment.

173
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:27,450
So as I said, you have to have principles and procedures and and shown and demonstrated competency in all those procedures.

174
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:33,060
Personnel have to be trained for packaging and shipping guidelines for infectious substances,

175
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:38,760
and that goes for every clinical lab that sends a specimen to another laboratory for testing.

176
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,080
They have to follow national guidelines for packaging and shipping.

177
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:51,960
You have to have procedures to to manage decontamination of of laboratory biological waste.

178
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,960
And sometimes it can go out in bins to be autoclave and very large autoclave,

179
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,960
and sometimes it has to be autoclave right within the laboratory itself before it can be sent out,

180
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,850
depending on what what testing is done in that laboratory.

181
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:14,340
The lab has to be under negative air pressure, so if you have a BSL three lab,

182
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:22,090
it has to be negative air pressure to the surrounding laboratories or buildings surrounding laboratories or offices.

183
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:28,770
OK, so generally it's got a double door walk or you walk in and generally it's a locked facility.

184
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:33,150
You can only get in if you are approved to get into it.

185
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:37,170
Generally, card access or key get go in.

186
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:47,910
You put on the gown, the surgical gown I put on your mask, gloves and then knock on the door to the inner chamber.

187
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:54,030
And if there if nothing's open, they'll say, come on in with tubes or anything is open to somebody working in the hole,

188
00:24:54,030 --> 00:25:00,570
you have to wait until the point where they can stop. You can then get in and do whatever you need to do in there.

189
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:09,780
And once again, you have to have terminal decontamination for BSL three or swap agents.

190
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:18,110
So let's talk a little bit about anthrax, it's primarily a disease of herbivores.

191
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:25,210
Her humans may become infected by contact with animals or contaminated animal products.

192
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:29,440
It does live in the soil and it causes a disease.

193
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:36,520
It causes something called Warsaw's disease. It's also known as inhalational anthrax.

194
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:48,640
So when the sheep were out in the fields and they get their get clipped for the wall, oftentimes they have spores in there.

195
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,170
And if it's, say, down into Mexico or someplace like that,

196
00:25:53,170 --> 00:26:02,050
the wall can be contaminated and the people doing the sharing of the sheep get inhalational anthrax called wolf authorities disease.

197
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:10,870
There is no person to person transmission of inhalational anthrax.

198
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:20,320
So there are three forms of human disease with anthrax, patient can have cutaneous and cutaneous infection.

199
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,490
They're working outside. They get cut by something it's contaminated the.

200
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:29,670
Live cutaneous anthrax there can be gastrointestinal, and this can either be oropharyngeal beef,

201
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:42,130
something that's contaminated or it can be abdominal, and then we've already talked about inhalational or wolf's orders disease.

202
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:53,980
So more about cutaneous anthrax so far from certain terror events in the United States.

203
00:26:53,980 --> 00:27:08,230
There was contaminated mail that was sent out and it was contaminated on purpose with anthrax and people opened up the mail and they got infected.

204
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:13,840
Incubation period is somewhere between one and 10 days, so most people don't know what they did 10 days ago.

205
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,600
Some people don't know what they did two days ago.

206
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:24,310
And if you're just doing your normal work and opening up mail, who would think that it was contaminated, intentionally contaminated?

207
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:30,970
The initial symptom here was a periodic or itchy feel, but painless.

208
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:35,770
Then it was related. Some became hemorrhagic.

209
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:44,980
They developed into depressed ulcers with local edema, a local swelling, and the final stage was a scar, which is like a black scab.

210
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:53,790
And patients may have systemic signs of illness. With cutaneous anthrax.

211
00:27:53,790 --> 00:28:00,840
And so here is this whole development on day two. And here's the scar formation on day four.

212
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:12,260
And you can see all the redness around it. So then we go on to a more serious form of anthrax, which is inhalational.

213
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,230
And as I said, that's due to inhalation of spores.

214
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:25,460
Incubation period is quite variable anywhere from one to 43 days, depending on how much of a load of anthrax that you inhale.

215
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:35,750
The initial symptoms, though, generally show up within two to five days, would be a fever, cough, malaise or or myalgia.

216
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:41,630
So I got influenza. I'm not going to worry about it. I feel a bit more serious of that.

217
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:47,330
Terminal symptoms can develop one or two days after that. High fever.

218
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:54,680
And here we're talking three hundred and five very high fever, shortness of breath or dyspnea,

219
00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:01,370
cyanosis not getting enough oxygen in hemorrhagic mist mediastinum just so you're bleeding

220
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:10,180
inside in your mediastinum with an effusion and rapid progression to shock and death.

221
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,570
Mortality rate.

222
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:22,180
We really don't know what the actual mortality rate is if if the patient can get on antibiotics and other supportive care, they have a chance.

223
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:38,750
But oftentimes it's not knowing what's causing it. So there were in 2001, 11 patients with inhalational anthrax from the letters that were sent,

224
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:44,450
median age was 56 years, but it ranged from forty three to ninety four years.

225
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:49,490
Average incubation was four days, but it ranged a little bit from four to six days.

226
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:57,890
Common symptoms were fever and chills. That's not very unusual, drenching sweats sounding a little bit more serious.

227
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:02,420
Profound fatigue to the point where they couldn't get up and walk around.

228
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:09,810
Minimally productive cough, which doesn't go along with the fever, chills and drenching sweats, nausea and vomiting and chest discomfort.

229
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:15,260
Remember, it was mediastinal involvement in inhalation anthrax,

230
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:26,080
but noted notes that refinery are a runny nose and a productive cough were really uncommon in this.

231
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:35,800
So if you were to compare anthrax and influenza because it kind of sounds like influenza, the history of influenza vaccination is not useful.

232
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,740
OK. Yes, it's useful to have influenza vaccine, but when you're trying to differentiate,

233
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:46,030
this is anthrax or is this influenza really doesn't help viral respiratory diseases,

234
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:59,260
as I shall here have a sore throat, runny nose and can be transmitted from person to person in a lethal anthrax has shortness of breath.

235
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,560
Vomiting and no person to person transmission.

236
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:10,600
So there are some differences, but I would guess that if you show up at an urgent care or you go to your doctor's office,

237
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:21,220
somebody calls your doctor and says, my wife is or my spouse, someone is so sick and has this, they won't think about anthrax.

238
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:34,790
So in the initial assessment, chest x rays and the changes may be very subtle compared to the symptoms of patients having mediastinum a widening.

239
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:41,600
Fullness of the pair of tracheal area. Pilar Falmouth's.

240
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,350
And pleural effusions are infiltrates, so there's clearly something going on in the lungs.

241
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:56,890
Blood cultures can be done, and Bacillus anthracis was isolated in the eight patients who had not received prior antibiotics,

242
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:04,460
so the blood cultures were positive. Obviously, if they got appropriate antibiotics, blood cultures would have been negative.

243
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:10,850
And you can read all about this in emerging infectious diseases. I'm giving you the reference.

244
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:17,250
What about treatment? Well, penicillin is the organism is penicillin susceptible.

245
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:23,700
That's the which is a form of tetracycline or Cipro. OK.

246
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,710
Supportive care, and that is so important because patients may need to be put on respirators and so on.

247
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:35,770
We can use standard precautions in the hospital, no need for quarantine in the hospital,

248
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:45,220
and the duration of therapy is somewhat variable depending on the form of anthrax and whether or not the person has had the vaccine.

249
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:51,590
Certainly, therapy will be longer if the patient has not had a vaccine against Bacillus anthracis.

250
00:32:51,590 --> 00:33:05,300
And to no one's surprise, early treatment improves the prognosis, but they have to suspect it first.

251
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,670
Post-exposure prophylaxis now.

252
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:16,850
So if someone is exposed to anthrax or to the spores or potentially the spores of anthrax, 60 days of antibiotic prophylaxis,

253
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:23,900
or two months of antibiotic prophylaxis, or 100 days of antibiotic prophylaxis,

254
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:31,790
or 100 days of antibiotic prophylaxis plus anthrax vaccine as post-exposure therapy.

255
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:40,460
So it depends on how the they think you became infected or exposed and your normal health.

256
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:50,130
And I think that most physicians would go for the full hundred days and vaccine.

257
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:57,120
So what do we do in the laboratory if we suspected or if we if we.

258
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:03,480
Even if we don't suspected somebody makes a call, we don't have to be vaccinated for anthrax.

259
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,320
However, laboratory coats and gloves must be worn.

260
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,790
And that is true throughout any clinical microbiology laboratory.

261
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:16,890
You have to wear laboratory coats, and if you're working with specimens, you have to wear gloves.

262
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,500
Normally, you don't wear gloves to work with cultures.

263
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:29,940
But in this case, the would safety glasses and shields face shields were are recommended no hand or finger contact with any mucosal surfaces.

264
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:34,380
So hand-washing is absolutely critical and not OK.

265
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:43,890
I'm done is a full 20 to 30 seconds washing your hands with warm water and soap, and you never leave the lab without washing your hands.

266
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:52,080
What about hand sanitizers? I don't think people use them for long enough, long enough contact time.

267
00:34:52,080 --> 00:35:03,930
So really, you need to have enough time that it takes a little bit of rubbing to have it be effective.

268
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:13,010
So what about? Yes. I don't think so, is it because it?

269
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,810
Application have to make sure it hits all surfaces of your home.

270
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:22,160
Yeah, until it's dry. Level eight tests.

271
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,110
So this is what can be done. Level tests can be done in a routine clinical lab gram stain.

272
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:32,990
We look at the micro morphology gram positive rod whispers.

273
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:41,390
Does it have a capsule? We can see this by putting a drop of any ink on a slide, as we would look for later on.

274
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:45,140
We'll talk to you about looking for a capsule with Cryptococcus neoformans

275
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:51,500
to drop of any on the slide and a drop off of your organism in a suspension.

276
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:58,940
And if there's a capsule formation, the indeed will show the capsule around the cell.

277
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:07,160
OK. Because he is blocked out from getting all the way up to the south because of the capsule.

278
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:14,990
We have to look at the whole routine culture. The morphology of the organism is a hemolytic or not.

279
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:19,310
Is it moral or not? And does it make spores? And what's going on?

280
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:25,730
We're looking for the spores on the grandstand or a spore saying if you if you do it.

281
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:35,090
So presumptive identification going on, some of the species are non-mobile.

282
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:39,770
OK, so Bacillus anthracis, bacillus serious variety.

283
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:44,660
My point is and actually mandatory and also are all non modal.

284
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:50,240
So when we think of these three organisms, I don't worry too much about the self-serious or marketeering.

285
00:36:50,240 --> 00:37:01,590
But I do worry about anthrax. So we did would do a motility test for any organism that we suspect of being anthracis.

286
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:12,450
It should be not hemolytic and blood auger. And if you drop a penicillin dose is known to be 15 to 20 mm and should have a capsule once again,

287
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:17,610
you can demonstrate that capsule within the ink that is presumptive B.S. anthracis.

288
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:24,670
That is a call to the state public health lab, to CDC, to the state police.

289
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:33,120
OK. What about susceptibility testing?

290
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:43,980
It's not routinely done. There are there are studies that have been done using 65 historical isolates, as well as the isolates from the patients.

291
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:51,180
They did brought micro dilution and seal assay has established break points.

292
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:58,230
If you have to do susceptibility testing, but it is extremely hazardous and would not be done in a hospital laboratory,

293
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:09,740
it would only be done through public health and maybe at the federal level. So once again submitted to public health for testing.

294
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:19,880
So when we had the want to call the anthrax outbreak in 2001, but when the letters were sent out, the contaminated letters were sent out.

295
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:27,680
The isolates were susceptibility, testing was done on the ice and they were all susceptible to ciprofloxacin and doctors i.

296
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,780
There's limited information about the use of the other drugs shown on this slide.

297
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:38,120
We don't want to use chloramphenicol unless it's the only agent available because of the side effects.

298
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:47,330
But there's limited information about the use of clindamycin, rifampin, vancomycin, any kind of meropenem or the aminoglycosides.

299
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:57,900
So basically, it's Cipro and doxy unless there is additional susceptibility testing done.

300
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:10,080
What about the vaccine? The vaccine is great. It is FDA licensed, it is a culture supernatant of an attenuated, non encapsulated strain.

301
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:20,400
OK, it's protective against cutaneous anthrax based on human data and possibly inhalational anthrax based on animal data.

302
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,260
We don't have human data for that. There are a series of injections.

303
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:34,530
You see a lot of injections at zero, two and four weeks, then at six, 12 and 18 months and then yearly boosters to keep your immune response up.

304
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:42,330
But there are a number of shots you have to have just for your initial immunization series.

305
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:46,260
There is some data that says the three dose schedule may be effective,

306
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:51,510
and that would be a zero time, two weeks and four weeks, and it may be effective.

307
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:59,790
So after three doses, there was 83 versus 83 percent of the people tested had a serologic response.

308
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:06,960
After five doses, 100 percent of them responded, so you get some response after three doses of five or better.

309
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,010
However, there is limited availability of the vaccine,

310
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:21,430
so it's saved in the national stockpile only for those instances where it's absolutely necessary.

311
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:28,660
OK, we go from bad to worse. Smallpox.

312
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:36,580
This is a BSL four agent. It doesn't get any more infectious or any more dangerous than smallpox.

313
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:42,130
The name of smallpox virus is very old major. OK.

314
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:52,540
That includes ordinary smallpox, modified smallpox, flat smallpox, hemorrhagic smallpox and the variety virulence in the European.

315
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:58,150
And then there's very all a minor also. OK, whatever it's called, it's serious.

316
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:04,130
It's smallpox. This is an absolute emergency.

317
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,570
There's no question about it.

318
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:18,590
If it's suspected it's an emergency, the state public health, federal public health, federal officers would much rather have you be wrong.

319
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:25,010
I think we've got a case of smallpox and be wrong about that. They're not calling at all and missing it.

320
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:32,690
OK, so notify state public health officials immediately if you suspected the diagnosis must

321
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:40,880
be confirmed in a BSL four laboratory whose staff have been immunized for smallpox.

322
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:47,100
I don't believe there is a DSTL for laboratory in state of Michigan.

323
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:57,820
We're talking federal testing here. OK. State public health officers will contact CDC about this, CDC will contact World Health,

324
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:03,220
and there must be the strictest airborne precautions that you can ever imagine if you've ever involved

325
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:16,430
been involved him and as well as contact precautions for everyone who possibly could have been infected.

326
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:22,280
Fortunately, we don't see smallpox anymore, but there are.

327
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:35,510
The virus has been maintained at minus 70 in certain locations, so there is a program of the illness program.

328
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:41,870
The incubation is anywhere from seven to 17 days, depending on how much of what the infectious dose was there.

329
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:51,650
Then there will be an acute onset of fever, malaise, aching headache, backache, body and patient may be delirious also.

330
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,450
There could also be a transient erythema.

331
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:59,630
This rash, which is what you may be able to see all this poor lady because it was the only picture I could find.

332
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:06,560
Then the rash starts the exam anthem and it begins on the face, the hands and the forearms, which is strange.

333
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:12,440
It spreads to the lower extremities and then the trunk over about seven days.

334
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:22,100
There is synchronous progression of the lesions, so they go from macula to vesicles to pustules and then finally scab over.

335
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:31,190
So they go from macros to vessels where they have more fluid in them to have pustules which have even more fluid and then eventually this gavel over.

336
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:37,550
And what is very unusual that there will be lesions on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

337
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:45,600
Most infections don't do that. So there are lesions on the palms of the soles.

338
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:54,050
So how do we compare smallpox with chicken pox? How many people here have had chickenpox?

339
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:58,190
Yeah, a lot of us have had it. Unfortunately, there's shots for it now.

340
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:10,100
So if you compare smallpox, which is very old with chicken pox, which is varicella, the incubation period for smallpox is seven to 17 days.

341
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:17,880
For chicken pox, it's 14 to 21 days. So if we get out over over 17 days, it's probably not smallpox.

342
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:28,410
OK. Program for smallpox is two to four days where you're first beginning to feel sick and chicken pox, there's no producer syndrome distribution.

343
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:35,940
This is interesting for smallpox. It's centrifugal means it starts here and goes out to the arms and the legs and so on.

344
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:48,600
And for chicken pox, it goes inward. So on the progression, it's synchronous, all relations are the same for smallpox.

345
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:55,740
Are asynchronous for chicken pox, so you can have some young lesions, some holy lesions and so on.

346
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:02,370
The scabs form in chicken pox much sooner than with smallpox almost a week sooner.

347
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:07,890
And then they separate sooner in chicken thighs, the scab separate from the body.

348
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:18,320
If your child has to scratch them to make a full off much sooner than they do in smallpox also.

349
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:29,450
So specimen selection do not send samples to CDC or any other BSL four laboratory without prior approval.

350
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:33,840
OK. If you send them, there will be a legal case.

351
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:40,640
You have to have approval to send and they get the specimens can be scraping of skin lesions.

352
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:47,510
They can be pustular fluid pabulum of a vesicular fluid crusts from the lesions.

353
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:56,920
Blood samples are swabs of the tonsils. Or if the patient doesn't have tonsils, a throat swab.

354
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:05,140
OK, once again, work on smallpox can only be done in a BSL four laboratory by vaccinated individuals.

355
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:12,820
They will do the electron microscopy. They may identify viral engines by immunohistochemical studies.

356
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:18,250
They can do PCR or other molecular studies. They can grow the virus.

357
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:23,290
Scary as that sound tissue culture growth confirmed by nucleic acid amplification.

358
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:25,870
And there are also serologic assays.

359
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:34,190
So if you contact CDC and you say, I think I'm really this is really scary, I think we've got a potential case of smallpox.

360
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:38,470
They will tell you what to say and how to send it. You know, what are you sending it?

361
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:48,560
Who's sending it? You will be documenting more things than you ever thought was possible, and that's the way it needs to be.

362
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:57,020
How about management of the patient? Absolutely strict respiratory and contact isolation of the patient there can be.

363
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:07,610
You can't let up on this at all. Absolutely strict. Patients are infectious until all the scabs are separate have separated from the body.

364
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:08,540
OK, so what does that mean?

365
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:16,460
That means that the the people who come in and clean the patient's room, they can't do that unless they can gown up for four BSL,

366
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:22,910
four type or very limited number of people can go in and take care of that patient.

367
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:30,710
And CDC would have staff at the institution also notify public health authorities immediately.

368
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:36,950
If you even suspect it, they'd much rather have you be wrong and not to be notified.

369
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:48,130
And then all contacts and must be identified and vaccinated within 17 days.

370
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:52,720
So the crew vaccine, it's made from vaccine virus.

371
00:47:52,720 --> 00:48:00,760
There are sufficient doses in the US stores and I don't mean like target, I mean federal repositories.

372
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:08,890
I don't know where they are. They don't tell you where they are. OK. It is high level intradermal inoculation with a bifurcated needle.

373
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:12,880
You know, bifurcated needle is has like three or four little points on it.

374
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:19,360
So you dip it in the vaccine and then you go like this?

375
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:23,830
So we'll call it pustular lesion or intubation surrounding the central lesion.

376
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:30,460
As I got here, intense itching, low grade fever, you may be patient,

377
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:40,270
may have a swollen nose in the axillary area and there should be a scar, and it demonstrates successful vaccination.

378
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:49,000
But immunity is not lifelong, so everybody who is old like I am has a scar on a hip or on an arm.

379
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,450
But younger people don't have those because they weren't vaccinated.

380
00:48:55,450 --> 00:49:07,000
So who received the vaccine initially, military and public health response teams and personal personnel directly involved in evaluation,

381
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,650
care or transport of infected persons.

382
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:18,720
Others who may be vaccinated in the instance that there is a case or a suspect case would be directly exposed people,

383
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:29,730
household members face to face contacts of an infected person within two meters of an infected anybody within two meters of an infected person,

384
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:33,480
lab personnel who were involved with specimen processing.

385
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:44,580
They obviously need to be vaccinated and others who may have had contact with infectious material better to be vaccinated and not get disease,

386
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:54,060
then not to be vaccinated and have smallpox. So how long does protection last?

387
00:49:54,060 --> 00:50:04,920
So if you were my old age, you were vaccinated when you were somewhere a little child and you were vaccinated, infancy.

388
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:11,040
Case fatality rate, if you were zero to four years old is zero if you're not vaccinated.

389
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:20,160
Forty five percent case fatality rate. So if you go down, you can see that as you go down the age group, thirty to forty nine.

390
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:27,630
Yes, vaccinated in infancy. So case fatality rate would be three point seven percent in that age range.

391
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:32,310
But if you were not vaccinated, fifty four over fifty four percent of the people would die.

392
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:41,070
And if people are over 50 vaccinated in infancy, five point five percent of that population would get infected.

393
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:51,160
But if you are not vaccinated, over 50 percent will die. So some pretty significant numbers here.

394
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:55,690
What are the adverse reactions we always hear about I can't take a vaccine because of this or this,

395
00:50:55,690 --> 00:51:02,530
and I understand that this is not something that can be this can say no, it's OK, you don't need to take it.

396
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:11,590
No. If you're exposed, you have to take it. And so you can have mild to moderate adverse reactions, or you could have moderate to severe.

397
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:22,200
And if you have mild, moderate to severe and they're usually not too bad, but then you may need some medical care.

398
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:32,670
Now, progressive Xanthea or post-vaccination vaccinale and supplies, definitely those are very, very severe adverse reactions.

399
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:42,390
But they do not happen very often. So more contraindications and for no emergency and emergency use.

400
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:45,660
And you can read this on your own.

401
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:54,270
So this table shows and this is published in 2003, after it became known that we really needed to get information out.

402
00:51:54,270 --> 00:52:08,010
And all these tables were from MMW. Ah, which is CDC publication, the adverse events, number of new cases versus total number of cases.

403
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:15,030
You can see there were very few adverse reactions. There was one case of generalized vaccine here.

404
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:22,620
There are two cases of actually vaccine in two cases probable. And these are different timeframes.

405
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:26,340
February 25th to March 3rd and January 24th to March 3rd.

406
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:37,200
And in the new cases, you can see that in the February 25th, March 3rd, number of new cases with serious adverse effects were three.

407
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,280
Non serious adverse effects were twenty one so much.

408
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:51,590
If you're going to have an adverse effect, it's not going to be serious. But most people did not have a serious event.

409
00:52:51,590 --> 00:53:00,680
So emergency preparedness that CDC never put that in your brain and keep it there.

410
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:05,570
That's where you find information, is the website for all emergency preparedness.

411
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:14,810
You can download whatever information you need on chemical, radiological, natural disasters, mass casualties, et cetera.

412
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:22,560
It is a very, very useful website. Includes information about stockpiling supplies for your home.

413
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:30,530
OK. And then we have the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile,

414
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:39,710
which is maintained nationwide to have any antibiotics or products that are needed in case there's an outbreak.

415
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:46,130
So in 1999, the pharmaceuticals included ciprofloxacin doxycycline and yet there were I.V.

416
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:54,020
supplies and it was forward deployed for chemical interventions if they needed them.

417
00:53:54,020 --> 00:54:02,000
In 2000, in addition to what was there for 1999, they added penicillin as an antibiotic.

418
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,680
They had I.V. kits and they had diazepam and erythromycin.

419
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:16,490
Also, they had airway supplies if people needed to be put on a bench and the bags and the trade tubes and so on.

420
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:22,310
There were other emergency medications added to this supply for people who might have side

421
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:28,280
effects because they're so worried about what's happening to a family member or a loved one,

422
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:34,790
and then bandages and dressings were were added to the supply. Also.

423
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:39,380
So it's a strategic national stockpile, but most people don't know about it.

424
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:48,980
It can procure and management manage all types of supplies that might be needed for a national outbreak national serious outbreak.

425
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:53,330
There can be rapidly transported in case there's a terrorist event.

426
00:54:53,330 --> 00:55:01,490
We don't hear too much about terrorist events anymore, fortunately. But people need to know that the supplies are there if they're needed.

427
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:12,500
There's coordination at all levels, from the very bottom to the very top, and CDC will provide technical consultants as needed.

428
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,140
They will send people out as needed.

429
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:24,860
There's also a lot of research that's going on program evaluation and education and training at all levels for local, state and federal partners.

430
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:30,200
So once you graduate from this program, you're working in infection prevention.

431
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:44,400
You may get training for terrorism. In an emergency, if you believe you have been exposed to a biological or chemical agent,

432
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:50,670
or if you believe an intentional biological threat will occur or is occurring,

433
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:59,220
please contact your local health department or and your local police or other law enforcement agency.

434
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:10,920
They will. If it's if it's if it's wrong, it's OK, it's OK, but they need to know about it and that this is very, very serious.

435
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:18,700
So suspicious packages. We have one at work.

436
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:27,340
Opened it up, said you will be dead in two days. That was an immediate call to the state police.

437
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:31,390
And they followed up on they don't tell you there was nothing in it.

438
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:35,860
It was to scare. Which it did.

439
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:43,720
It was very scary to the point where I didn't want to go home, didn't want to be around anyone just wanted to stay in my office with the door closed.

440
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:49,300
So how do you tell us a suspicious package might have inappropriate or unusual labeling?

441
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:54,160
From what you normally get in the lab, I'd have a strange address or no return address.

442
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,580
The postmark could be could be sent from anywhere.

443
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:07,330
So it's not something you would normally expect to get in the lab or in your house, and there might be excessive packaging material.

444
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:14,950
The. Anthrax scares that were sent out had really strange addresses on returning addresses,

445
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:20,080
do not open a suspicious, suspicious package or whatever handle it is.

446
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:24,070
Leave it on your front porch. We had one in our front yard.

447
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:34,610
We kept it there. We call the police they got. So here's some internet resources if you want to look anything up.

448
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:39,720
They're updated constantly, I'm sorry, this is not quite as bright as I wanted it to be.

449
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:45,900
But you can look at any of those internet sources for additional information.

450
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:53,370
So in summary, we have now required incredible knowledge about anthrax,

451
00:57:53,370 --> 00:58:04,710
the clinical disease on a managed care susceptibility of the isolates and appropriate therapy for people who may have been exposed.

452
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:12,000
But there are many studies that are ongoing, adding to our knowledge of smallpox, we don't hear about it very much, which is wonderful.

453
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,930
But there are studies that have been done and are being done to improve care and therapy.

454
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:25,320
And we are we have so much more scientific knowledge than we used to have about these agents.

455
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:37,530
But still, people, there's a lot that people don't know. But the added benefit from my point of view is that people are learning about microbiology.

456
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:47,620
And with that, I always close with this. And it still gives me chills.

457
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:53,100
And are there any questions? OK.

458
00:58:53,100 --> 00:59:10,800
You know it all now. OK, let's go to the test. Does anyone want the test to be recorded, but we're going to talk about?

459
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:16,930
We need that. I need the recording going.

460
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:23,640
OK, so since I don't really know people's names, I mean, I know names, but I don't know who they are.

461
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:28,590
When I call your name, come up and get your test and then we'll talk just a little bit about it.

462
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:39,420
OK, so Malika. Muhammad.

463
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:53,090
You'd be. Good to be.

464
00:59:53,090 --> 01:00:02,290
Scallop. So it.

465
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:06,550
OK. I don't know how to pronounce this, are you?

466
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:12,040
Daniels, did I say correctly, You did you? Oh, good.

467
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:26,340
Raised me. Connor.

468
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:34,380
I mean. Maybe, Gail, or mitigate.

469
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:45,160
Hayley? Grace.

470
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:48,840
Grace. Know Grace.

471
01:00:48,840 --> 01:01:00,960
OK. Probably, like everybody else is right.

472
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:13,420
Joining. Sarah?

473
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:30,060
The that. Camera.

474
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:44,710
Here's. And mate, maybe, maybe.

475
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:52,950
OK. So as you look at them, you may be happy, you may not be happy.

476
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:57,460
From what I did was I went through.

477
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:05,290
I gave give it to Dan Dan Packer, student assistant, and she marched all the regular questions for me.

478
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:11,710
So if there's there were three that I did afterwards and Markos and read, she put X's by the ones that were incorrect.

479
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:17,650
OK. And then I looked at him.

480
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:29,560
I was the one here, looked at the short answers and assigned the extra credits.

481
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:35,860
And then I went through and that was this morning.

482
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:45,040
I went through and looked at some of the questions on the test how how many were missed on each one.

483
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:53,410
OK, so if I look at here, you know, I don't know.

484
01:02:53,410 --> 01:03:04,270
I look to see how many were missed for each question. So if I question one, if 12 people miss question one, I thought that was not a good question.

485
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:10,990
OK? And I took some questions out. So at the top of the test, you're going to see some really strange numbers.

486
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:16,780
So the first one, you're going to see some number over 88. OK.

487
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:25,750
And then plus nine or 10 or three or whatever is the number one, the amount that you got for the extra credit?

488
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:31,570
And for some people who did really well, they have more than eight points.

489
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:39,700
OK. And then I went through and I said, Let's take this one out and I adjusted everything, OK?

490
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:45,760
So it's it's a confusing way of scoring.

491
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:51,600
But I wanted to take get rid of the questions that almost everyone missed.

492
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:56,930
OK, and if you have questions, particularly you can ask me after class or you can ask me in class.

493
01:03:56,930 --> 01:04:07,830
OK. What lessons did you draw? I may not have that with me, but I can bring it next time.

494
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:20,930
OK? There were a few that I I don't have it with me.

495
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:26,710
OK, any other questions? Yes, the answer.

496
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:37,340
And. I generally don't post the answer, but I can I can bring it in.

497
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:44,770
First of all, is the correct answer to that. OK.

498
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:55,020
And I will want the test back. Are you going to know the answers to the.

499
01:04:55,020 --> 01:05:03,660
We can do today if you want to? Yeah. OK. Question one.

500
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:08,930
What's the incentive for you, ensure provision of high quality lab services.

501
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:13,610
Question two selective and differential.

502
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:25,520
Question three quality a lot of people miss number three, quality assurance is a program to monitor the overall quality of the testing process,

503
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:35,970
whereby quality control, so it's D Quality control is an activity designed to monitor the performance of instruments and reagents.

504
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:45,710
OK. Question four was a selective question, five is the micro air airfields.

505
01:05:45,710 --> 01:06:04,120
Question six is fastidious. Question seven is the Crystal Violet Question eight C. Iodine.

506
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:10,930
Question nine. B my colleague assets. Question 10.

507
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:19,120
Direct examination, such as Graham saying accomplish all the following, except the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern cannot be detected.

508
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:26,950
It says it can't be determined, but it can. 11 is a 12 is selective.

509
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:36,660
It's a selective medium. Thirteen is about nation.

510
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:49,420
Fourteen is a. Fifteen is D, so excuse me, fifteen is not good.

511
01:06:49,420 --> 01:07:12,590
So 15 should be a. Sixteen, a C 17, C 18, B 19 is B the abundance of the organism on the direct smear.

512
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:26,110
Twenty is the. Easier if I got the answer key right here, why am I doing this?

513
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:36,400
OK, hold on. Let me get. OK.

514
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:43,210
Twenty one is BSL two, which is B. Twenty two is differential.

515
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:49,780
Twenty three is C. The beads efficiently bind to nucleic acids and digested specimens.

516
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:54,460
Twenty four is the patient's underlying disease. So you said, what did you say?

517
01:07:54,460 --> 01:08:02,780
Twenty three was C as in cat. Anybody else having trouble hearing me, OK?

518
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:15,370
Twenty four is dead. Twenty five a. Twenty six, see?

519
01:08:15,370 --> 01:08:26,290
Twenty seven, a. Twenty eight SEALs II Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute.

520
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:35,190
Twenty nine is even. Thirty is C as in cat.

521
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:44,140
Thirty one is a. Thirty two is the.

522
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:54,840
Thirty three. Hey, inhibition of folic acid synthesis. Thirty four is D.

523
01:08:54,840 --> 01:09:11,100
Thirty five is the. Thirty six important cause of diseases such as rheumatic fever, Ballymaloe nephritis next day, the pharyngitis Streptococcus.

524
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:15,450
Question about their voice. OK.

525
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:25,410
Thirty seven candles, remember stripper candles, negative staff or Kelly's positive?

526
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:37,710
Thirty eight Streptococcus a, the latter Group B strep, so that's one thirty one.

527
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:43,390
I don't want to put it I.

528
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:49,810
I will go back and check it. OK. Yeah.

529
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:55,930
OK. Let me write this down.

530
01:09:55,930 --> 01:10:03,110
Well, anybody who missed that will be talking with me. OK, that's thirty four.

531
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:28,300
Thirty three thirty one. Not right.

532
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:35,110
OK. Where did I start? Thirty thirty nine, thirty nine.

533
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:41,040
Oh, OK. Um, alpha hemolysis c.

534
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:54,120
Forty is seen. Forty one is a 42 is a.

535
01:10:54,120 --> 01:11:05,890
Forty three is a lot age there. Forty four is de facto an order.

536
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:16,970
Forty five is a. Forty six days and forty seven is see.

537
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:25,350
