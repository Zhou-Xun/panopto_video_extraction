1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:15,090
Because I'm so lucky. So, you know, but, you know, like, that makes me do this.

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,420
You know, really living [INAUDIBLE] here.

3
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,710
Okay, I'll take that quickly. I think it's 65.

4
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:38,060
60? So make sure to do a new screenshot to.

5
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,250
Yes. Thank you. You're so beautiful.

6
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:06,329
Oh, perfect. Okay, let me see how I can fix you.

7
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:16,980
Only I get your Starbucks all ready to visit Starbucks from last year.

8
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,150
I stayed at trees so long, I was like another one.

9
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,430
00002, three, two, four.

10
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:38,760
That's what I want you for reading this one so I can share it with you.

11
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,840
So this is what you are using, right? And using this on the ground.

12
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,040
Something I try to do. Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

13
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,169
But these are some constraints you want my son to as a way to like.

14
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,250
I know you can, like, send money or something that you can like to see your evidence,

15
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,420
but to suppose that you just she tried to copy pasting the screenshot and it wasn't showing.

16
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:16,020
It was just like a white square. So instead of zero we can figure it out across and turn of us a little bit.

17
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,580
You. Also to finish signing up for my classes.

18
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:29,140
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So then, professor classes showing us weekly Saturdays, me yoga class.

19
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:36,310
Each one sent me that yoga mat. She said it was like, Oh, she was just saying things like, Oh, like meditation.

20
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:43,140
We need to get these, too, which is, I don't know,

21
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,860
I might have to because you can have three credit classes you might have to end up taking, I'm sure.

22
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,470
15. Yeah, I don't.

23
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,910
I want to ask you something now.

24
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,320
Like you don't need me.

25
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,170
I think it's just like I think it's a problem with the setting.

26
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,630
She said she like contact in the registrar's office, but like she said, they're just slow about.

27
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,790
So I think they will change it. He's eight classes.

28
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,229
It's pretty cool. Yeah. I'm sure to suck it up for two weekends.

29
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:23,360
Were.
