Hello, my name is Jadrienne Horton, and my position with the Future Public Health Leaders Program, also known as FPHLP, is as a program assistant.

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:21,380
I am also a former 2017 CDC undergraduate program scholar with the Kennedy Krieger Institute Program, also referred to as KKI.

3
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:29,630
I am a first year dual degree masters of public health and social work student at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor campus.

4
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:36,620
My interests include improving the environment for communities of color, developing and disseminating public health,

5
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:44,070
education material to the public to help enhance health literacy and promote environmental justice.

6
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,590
I am eager to share with you all over the course of several videos how to apply

7
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,510
to graduate school as someone who has recently undergone this process,

8
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,580
I understand the process can be very overwhelming.

9
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:06,830
This the content I present throughout this video is based on my own personal experience, piles of knowledge I am sharing with you all.

10
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:13,400
I was not only able to minimize my stories and complete all of my college applications in a timely manner,

11
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:22,220
but I was accepted into all the programs I applied to. I am also proud to say that I am currently attending my dream university.

12
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:28,900
My hope for you all is that you too can actualize your graduate school goals.

13
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:34,940
The graduate school application process is more strenuous compared to the undergraduate school process,

14
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:42,130
for example, students have to complete personal statements, take the GRE, obtain letters of recommendation,

15
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:50,260
request transcripts and so on, graduate school defines your professional career and you are now declaring your career focus.

16
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:59,230
This is important and should be taken very seriously. This process cannot be successfully completed over a weekend or over the course of a month.

17
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:10,120
It takes time. Understanding this, I follow a 13 month timeline to ensure my applications was successfully, successfully completed.

18
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:19,440
So here's our timeline. January to March, you will research and select schools, the interest you. After identifying programs,

19
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,650
you will create a table to organize each school's requirement.

20
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:36,530
April through July will be dedicated to prepare and take the Graduate Records Examination, also referred to as the GRE.

21
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:42,910
July through September, you will begin work on all application documents such as your personal statement, your resume,

22
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:49,060
and I also requesting letters of recommendation and the transcript.

23
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:55,720
November to December, final edits will be made and you will submit your applications.

24
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:04,680
In January of the following year, after submitting your application, you will complete your free application for federal student aid.

25
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:14,070
I also referred to it as a FAFSA. Also begin researching for scholarship opportunities outside of the university.

26
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,120
I will discuss each of these components further in the coming videos.

27
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,040
This will be our outline and referred to throughout the videos. In the next section

28
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,573
I will discuss how to identify schools of interest.
