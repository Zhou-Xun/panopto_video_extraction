The greatest increases in human health
in all of history have occurred over

3
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:22,320
the past 150 years.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,150
Even though human beings have been
in existence for thousands of years,

5
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,450
life expectancy remained the same until
the beginning of the 20th century.

6
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,020
Public health has played a key
role in improving the health and

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,100
wellbeing of people around the world.

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,370
Let's take a look at some of the important
historical moments in public health.

00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,285
[MUSIC]

10
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:47,897
Public health is not a new idea.

11
00:00:47,897 --> 00:00:52,766
Prehistoric humans learned how to avoid
disease even before there was a concern

12
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:54,770
for public health.

13
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,030
In some of the earliest human history,

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,790
there's evidence that people learned to
defecate downstream from communal areas.

15
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,950
And similarly, buried the deceased
away from where people were living.

16
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,580
For many centuries,
the notion of personal responsibility for

17
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,550
ill health was a pervasive concept.

18
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,590
Disease was often considered
something that a person contracted

19
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,580
because they were somehow deserving.

20
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,840
But during the Renaissance,

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,420
in the Age of Enlightenment, a new theory
of understanding disease was evolving.

22
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,195
This was the first time in history
when there was an emphasis on

23
00:01:31,195 --> 00:01:34,765
scientific explanations and
not just mystical beliefs.

25
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:43,323
Malaria, or bad air in Italian,
was one of the first diseases whose cause

26
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:47,083
was viewed to be something
related to the environment,

27
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,550
as opposed to a punishment for sin.

28
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,710
Lepers were considered unclean,
and therefore,

29
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,110
were excluded from society
In leprosy colonies.

30
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,942
But while there was an understanding
the disease was communicable,

31
00:02:01,942 --> 00:02:05,057
there was still no explanation for
how disease spread.

33
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,272
The 14th century plague known as
the Black Death brought humanity to

34
00:02:13,272 --> 00:02:15,640
the brink of extinction.

35
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,080
Reducing the world's
population by a fifth.

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,652
Spreading through trade routes,
the plague killed nearly one half of

37
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:28,159
Europe's population and
it took over one hundred years to recover.

38

39
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:37,990
The spread of disease was not just
limited to the European continent.

40
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:43,720
Travelers along intercontinental trade
routes carried disease across the ocean.

41
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,710
Early European explorers coming to
North America brought smallpox with them.

42
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,592
Little known is the fact that smallpox
killed many more Native Americans than did

43
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,976
conflict with the European settlers.
