1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:08,550
So for the most part.

2
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:18,480
Now, let's come back. Nothing's wrong.

3
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:25,720
So here is Walter. So, my secretary.

4
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,520
Well, it's like you don't.

5
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:52,080
I mean, you. Yeah.

6
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:01,440
That's crazy. Yeah, they just sent it out a second time because everybody having midterms.

7
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,820
Swimming's usual sparse.

8
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,860
This is going to be even worse today. He's just exhausted.

9
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,860
Oh, good. Career fair. Oh, really? I like ESP Iraq.

10
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,930
It's like the Google one. ESP each one. No school one.

11
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,300
Oh, university. Is there good stuff they're supposed to have, like sometime time year?

12
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,500
Yes. Yes. Where is that? In the union.

13
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,560
All right. Any questions? So your exam is Tuesday.

14
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,870
It is on phase one of phase two, although it also includes ethics.

15
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,670
So don't forget those. I already told you it's multiple choice.

16
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:58,550
I think it's like 25. Multiple choice for short answer, because there are so many of you.

17
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,050
You're lucky. I was like, I'm not going to have too many short answers and then I'm going to be helpful.

18
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,020
So I personally think your homeworks are more difficult than your exam.

19
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,180
Yep. So for the whoever their questions.

20
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:20,730
Yes. Will we get the answers for questions or did you know we went over them in class?

21
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,780
You can watch the lectures again to see what we talked about.

22
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,320
It's not easy to have to go through and do all that and I just can't.

23
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,440
So if somebody wants to do it, you can otherwise watch the lectures.

24
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,740
Any other questions about your exam? Remember, you get eight and a half by 11 with whatever you want on it, front and back.

25
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,380
[INAUDIBLE] be in this room. I have something to write with.

26
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,880
And don't sit next to someone if possible. And don't cheat.

27
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,669
It's here on your her. You're on, Your Honor. For Your Honor code.

28
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,530
Okay. All right. Your homework three was due today,

29
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:13,340
and you will post answers either tonight or early tomorrow morning so that you can study from those you likely won't get yours.

30
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,740
Your personal grade back before the exam, but perhaps we'll see.

31
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:27,620
Okay. So I just wanted to go over the phase two exercises a little bit before we get started.

32
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:36,110
And so the idea was that you were going to try this time in two stage design to match this paper.

33
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:47,170
And you'll actually see I think it's the next homework asks you to find a paper and then to try to match the sample size calculation itself.

34
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,830
We'll talk a lot more about sample size calculations, but this is kind of like a precursor to doing that.

35
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:59,450
This is in a phase two space and I'm hoping that you choose a for the next homework assignment, you'll choose phase three study and match it up.

36
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:05,450
But so this one, you could look at the publication and then as described in the design,

37
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:10,460
they assumed a 5% type one error, a 10% type two error or a 90% power.

38
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:18,950
They said that a 10% response rate was not of interest or was the normal response rate and a 30% response rate would be clinically meaningful.

39
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,240
And so then they wrote in the initial stage, 18 patients will enter.

40
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,100
If they had less than three responses, the trial will be terminated.

41
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:36,320
Otherwise they'll go into the second stage and have a total of 35 patients, and at the end of the trial, six or fewer responses occur.

42
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,070
It will be concluded that the regimen is not worthy of further study.

43
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:48,260
And so if you put this into R right, so you want to use the so I posted these answers,

44
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,549
by the way, it's a, it's a word doc, but if you put this into R,

45
00:04:52,550 --> 00:05:03,110
you want to use the clean fun package and the page two Simon function and you can put these parameters in here and you can match what they got.

46
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:12,410
So too. So they said less than three out of the first 18 and then they need a total of more than six out of the 35.

47
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:23,660
Oops. So we can match that, which is great.

48
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:32,060
And then I ask you, can they if they wanted to find instead of a 10% or a 20% difference from 10% to 30%,

49
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,970
if they wanted to find a 10% to 20%, would that be feasible with less than a hundred participants?

50
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:45,320
And if you try to do this in the to Simon code and say, well, I could Max have 100 participants, it'll tell you, well, then you can't do it right.

51
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,360
It no feasible solution found,

52
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:56,990
which means that you can't find the difference between 20% and 10% with 90% power and 5% type one error with less than 100 patients, you need more.

53
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,520
So you would say this is infeasible and most phase two designs won't try to find

54
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,870
a difference as small as 10% because it just requires too many participants.

55
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,870
So then they ask you. So if they couldn't, if they could,

56
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:22,280
if they still had to restrict the sample size to a hundred and they did want to find a difference between 10% and 20%, could they change their power?

57
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,980
Right. Or how would their power change for this difference?

58
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:36,170
And so you can do some basically trial and error of different power levels or type two error levels to find where this is actually feasible.

59
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:45,800
And so you could find if you did that, you would find that you would need 13% type two error or you would only have 87% power just still high.

60
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:52,980
So they could do it. And then I ask you about. Okay, so given that, what are the individuals in the trial?

61
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:59,840
And so it's 59 in the first stage and 95 total, and then it takes you through.

62
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,830
So that's for the two stage. Simon Tues design and then it takes you through, okay, now consider you're going to use a Bayesian design.

63
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,650
You go back to this? Right.

64
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,900
So it says, now consider a Bayesian design where you have a max of 35 patients,

65
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:25,639
you have some true response rates that your of the new therapy that that clinical clinically

66
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:33,110
meaningful of 30% the normal response rate or the existing therapy response rate is 10%.

67
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,040
And then at any stage you want to stop and to determine the new treatment,

68
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:44,090
it's interesting if the probability that the new treatments response rate is greater than 10% is very high, so about 90%.

69
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:52,970
And you would stop and abandon the treatment if the probability of the new treatment response rate being less than 30% is greater than 95%.

70
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,110
So then I ask you to do a little math, a little algebra for those beat up priors.

71
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,950
So you can just set these up, right, and solve for a one and a two.

72
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:13,660
And so we do that both for P1 and P2. So you get a one equals point two for the first one, and beta equals a two equals 1.8.

73
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,830
And then for the second one, you get 10 to 90.

74
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:27,340
And then you can use the library page to Baz and use the stop down post function.

75
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:34,110
And you can see that you get these these thresholds essentially.

76
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,130
Right. So this is saying that like at the first patient, you wouldn't make any decision you keep accruing.

77
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:46,130
But at the second patient, if you have seen two responses, you could stop, right?

78
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,360
So there's already enough probability that you could stop for efficacy there.

79
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:57,700
Alternatively, over here, these are the lower bounds. And they say if you have two patients and two.

80
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:04,780
And zero one. This is this is the number of patients.

81
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,739
Oh, here we go. Okay, so this is the number of patients and the bound.

82
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:17,500
So it's two patients and zero responses. Then potentially you could stop if you have nine patients.

83
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,809
Right. And only one response, then you could stop 15 patients, two responses, you would stop.

84
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:27,220
Whereas if you have 12 and you have four responses, you could stop for efficacy.

85
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,459
So here they're showing us that we have the different upper balance in the different

86
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:37,690
lower bounds for whether we stop for efficacy or whether we stop for for futility.

87
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,190
And so I asked you to fill in this this little table to make sure that you were getting it.

88
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,680
And so it should be as such. So this should have been relatively straightforward,

89
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,670
but just practice with using the AR functions and then interpreting the results from that, how you actually use it in practice.

90
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,870
Okay. One way in which we actually use this quite a lot.

91
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,659
So some people definitely use Bayes phase to design.

92
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:13,870
One way in that I use something very similar is for phase two designs where I'm interested in interested in monitoring toxicity.

93
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,129
I'll kind of use the same idea and say that I'll have continual monitoring of

94
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:23,020
toxicity and I have a beta prior for what I believe the probability of toxicity is.

95
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,899
And then as every individual comes in, we can say if there is a serious at this number of serious adverse events,

96
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,970
then we would stop the trial for toxicity.

97
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:38,110
So that's one way in which I use something very similar to this on a pretty regular basis for our Phase two trials.

98
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,629
Okay. Any questions on the exercise?

99
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:55,320
So now the answers are out. But if you wanted to check those. So then today we're moving on to phase three.

100
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,800
This will be on your next test. I want to give you a little bit of a.

101
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,569
Breather that you weren't learning everything on your tests up until that time.

102
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,620
But I know that also makes people not want to come to class. But you will have it.

103
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,249
We will eventually be tested on this. So today we're going to talk about randomization and blinding.

104
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:17,770
And actually these are important and were somewhat covered when we talked about randomization for phase two,

105
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:27,220
but we'll get into a lot more detail here. So we're going to discuss these two concepts which are really the underpinnings of Phase three trials.

106
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,090
So once we've gotten through those Phase two designs, whatever they are,

107
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,620
assignment to stage, vision design, whatever kind of design we use for phase two, right?

108
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,859
If we found that treatment worthwhile, we move into the phase three space,

109
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:47,500
which is a huge undertaking in terms of large trials, very costly, lots of participants.

110
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:56,530
Right. And so we want them to be as great as possible and they're considered the gold standard of treatment, identification, right.

111
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:04,540
Of finding effective treatments. So we want to learn what is blinding, who can be blinded and why would you blind?

112
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:11,210
These groups, why do we randomize which we've already talked a little bit about and then we talked

113
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:18,090
slightly about like simple randomization versus stratified or no block randomization.

114
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,480
But I'm going to talk about a lot more other types of randomization today or next Thursday.

115
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:34,860
And then also as part of this, I think it's really important to think about the placebo effect and when and why a placebo is appropriate in a trial.

116
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,640
So in phase three, placebo might be a comparator, but it might not.

117
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:46,080
And so we'll talk about that a little bit. So in phase three, it might be this new treatment versus a placebo.

118
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:53,850
Often it's a new treatment versus a standard of care. So often in diseases and disorders, there's already something that's being used.

119
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,660
And so you can't take that away from participants in a clinical trial.

120
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,890
Right. We have to give that to them. We can't just say, oh, never mind, we'll just give you a placebo.

121
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:09,990
We have to make sure that we have that those ethics involved here, it might be a combination of treatments versus the standard of care.

122
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,970
Phase three trials could also be multi arm. There are lots of different designs for these.

123
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:25,800
We're going to focus for the initial part on like a standard two arm randomized phase three design where it's this new thing versus an old thing.

124
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,510
And then a lot of your projects are based on more interesting phase three designs,

125
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,830
and we'll get a glimpse at some of those as we move forward as well.

126
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,950
So placebo controls can be ethical,

127
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,020
it can be used in phase three if that if there really isn't a standard of care

128
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:52,499
used in that area and they're obviously attractive because then you're saying,

129
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,000
you know, these participants think they're getting the treatment, but they're not.

130
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,300
And so we can really see an effect of this new treatment versus not getting any other type of treatment.

131
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,219
But of course, patients have to be fully informed.

132
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,950
So there's that informed consent process and that has to say what the possible treatments are under investigation.

133
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:19,110
And so they have to be aware that they could get placebo or that they could get the standard of care.

134
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:24,389
There are some really good references about placebo trials. If you're more interested in reading them.

135
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:31,980
I have them here. I didn't put them, I don't think, on suggested readings, but there's a lot of really interesting discussion,

136
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,420
especially about the ethics behind it in terms of placebo trials.

137
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:44,010
So I do recommend reading these, but I know you have a lot on your plate, so just keep this for future reference if you ever find the time.

138
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:54,750
Okay, so we have a phase three trial and in phase one, remember we either had healthy or really sick subjects and there are healthy subjects.

139
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:02,090
Is there the deal to use the toxicities were very minor and there were very six subjects of those DLT.

140
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:11,790
These were really serious. So in cancer, HIV, AIDS research, usually it's very sick patients, whereas in other research it's healthy participants.

141
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,879
In phase two, we tried to get closer to the population.

142
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,780
We're interested in teaching and in reaching eventually with this treatment,

143
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:27,780
but it's still a small population and so it might be a little less heterogeneous in that ultimate population of interests.

144
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:36,629
In Phase three, we're really trying to get to that sample, that population that we would be treating with this with this drug.

145
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:41,130
And so usually the eligibility criteria, the inclusion and exclusion criteria open up.

146
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,690
So there's a bit more in terms of inclusion, a bit less in terms of exclusion,

147
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:54,540
so that we can make sure that in the population that we would treat, we're actually studying the drug for the treatment.

148
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:02,490
Of course, we need to figure out where are we recruiting, how many participants are eligible to recruit,

149
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:10,560
what are diseases under investigation, and then figure out the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.

150
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:20,379
We are looking to balance, including all the individuals that would ever get treated versus, you know,

151
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:29,290
really trying to make sure that this trial is done well, is done safely and has the opportunity to show benefits.

152
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:38,120
So we usually want to include all the subjects who potentially would receive benefit from this intervention.

153
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,260
We want to include people who would be likely to achieve a result.

154
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,510
So that means we want to include people who we could follow throughout the whole time of the trial.

155
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,939
And obviously we'd like to include people who would be good suppliers so that they're

156
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,830
actually getting the medication as intended and so that we could see that effect.

157
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:09,010
Now, those things are hard to quantify or define participants, and unfortunately not a lot of people volunteer to be research trial participants.

158
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:18,250
And so often we take who we can get, but we want to have the inclusion and exclusion criteria so that we're really trying to stick with these.

159
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:25,510
We will exclude people who would be really likely to have adverse effects or whom the intervention might be harmful.

160
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:31,750
And so often in exclusion criteria, pregnant women, really older individuals, people with other co-morbidities,

161
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:41,320
often people with like diabetes, type one diabetes are excluded because we're worried about the series of events that could occur.

162
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:49,989
And then we don't want to include those who might die from other causes or from the disease being studied.

163
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:57,280
But for the endpoint is reached because we want to get the endpoint information and obviously we can't include

164
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,940
anyone who is unwilling to be available for the final measurements or unwilling to participate in any way.

165
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:15,339
So we try to make that eligibility criteria and then put that out.

166
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:24,820
So most research universities will have these like recruitment websites or information about the studies that are being that are undergoing.

167
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,840
They often also advertise studies to get participants involved.

168
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:34,719
And then what we want to do is have a sample of individuals in our trial and hope that we can

169
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,120
then make inference to a larger population of which we hope would receive this intervention.

170
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,450
It's really important that whenever we do a trial, if you read a trial in a manuscript,

171
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:51,280
you'll always see that table one is a very clear description of those in the trial,

172
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,750
and it's important to look at that and to consider are these individuals actually

173
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,670
represented a representative of the group who would receive this treatment?

174
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,530
And then usually figure one is what's called a consort diagram.

175
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,030
And actually this is required in all clinical trial manuscripts.

176
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:17,919
And that includes a summary of all those individuals approached, all those individuals who are eligible for the design,

177
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:25,210
and all those individuals who enrolled were randomized and were maintained throughout the trial to get the subsequent measurements.

178
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:31,149
And so that way there's a very clear picture of like who was screened, who dropped out,

179
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:37,330
why did they drop out, who was randomized, etc., and gives us a better idea of who's in the trial.

180
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:48,100
So this is if you're not familiar with consort diagrams, this is kind of a very simple version of what the consort diagram looks like.

181
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,089
It would say something like who was assessed for eligibility.

182
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:57,459
So this would be during a trial, like a research assistant goes to the individual and says, We have this trial.

183
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:03,220
Would you be willing to participate and talk about it? And at this point, somebody may say, I'm not interested, right?

184
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:09,910
And so they would be excluded or they might read it and then say, no, I don't consent.

185
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,680
Right. They're excluded. They might be toxic.

186
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,839
You might talk about the trial and then you might run some additional tests for the inclusion criteria,

187
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,640
realized that they're not actually eligible for the trial, and so they might be excluded for that reason.

188
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,590
And then participants are randomized and then people can fall out from there.

189
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,069
So they might decide not to be a part of the trial throughout.

190
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,580
They might drop out, they might move away, they could die.

191
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,469
Other reasons for just being lost to follow up.

192
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:47,830
And those all should be listed so that we understand that there is this final set who we would do the analysis on and

193
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:54,430
how that compares to the greater individuals who are randomized in the greater population asked to join the trial.

194
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:06,100
So that's all of that, right? The concert diagram is really trying to get at the external validity of the results of the trial.

195
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:12,100
So how representative is this group to those who would be treated?

196
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:17,110
Can we actually take what we found in the trial and make inference to the larger group?

197
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:22,840
Right. The concert diagram and the figure one demographics is going to help us with the external validity.

198
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,480
We're going to talk more about blinding and randomization, which are really helping with internal validity.

199
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,680
So blinding is also called masking. They're the same thing.

200
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:39,700
And this is often involved in clinical trials, particularly at phase three, but it's not a requirement.

201
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:49,090
So trials do not have to be blinded phase three trials do not have to be blinded and often cannot be because of the way that the treatment is given.

202
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:56,620
But this is essentially saying like which group of people don't know what the treatment is?

203
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,839
That's what blinding is, that you're blinded to whatever the specific treatment is.

204
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,299
Right? Like you're a patient, you know, you're getting treated,

205
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,650
but you don't know whether it would be placebo or the new treatment or the standard of care versus the new treatment.

206
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:19,120
And this design technique is really to avoid bias or we're trying to avoid the implicit and explicit bias from clinicians,

207
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,629
from patients, from the individuals assessing the outcomes and potentially from statisticians.

208
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:28,330
Although we're supposed to be the honest brokers of everything,

209
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:37,240
sometimes we're also blinded to what the specific treatments are until like there's a one statistician who can unblind the results.

210
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:51,460
And essentially. You know, most often we don't think that people are terrible and want to, you know, really corrupt the data.

211
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,670
Right. But you put all of your heart and soul into this massive clinical trial that takes forever.

212
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:03,059
And then sometimes what happens is that you like, you know, individuals, not statisticians, of course,

213
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:09,840
but might like, you know, finesse things or ask certain questions that have ethical issues.

214
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,420
And so blinding is one way to try to protect against those.

215
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:20,690
So when you're reading studies that some of them might say open label, single blind, double blind, sometimes they might say triple blind,

216
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:27,350
although often triple line is kind of included within the double blind could be a specific or a special case of it.

217
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,540
So open label means that nobody's blind it so everybody knows which treatment that they're receiving.

218
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:38,030
Most often it's not open blinded when a placebo is involved.

219
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,210
Usually the placebo. If there's a placebo, it's often blinded.

220
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:49,960
But if there are multiple different treatments that are given in different modalities, it's usually open label.

221
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:55,400
So, for example, if you're trying to compare treatments, say one is is given via IV.

222
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,890
And one is a pill, right.

223
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:07,010
You cannot blind patients to what they're being given unless you give everybody a pill and an I.V. and one IV has saline and one pill is a placebo.

224
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,090
Right. Otherwise, you it's very clear which one you're getting.

225
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,090
There's also the issue of blinding.

226
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:23,450
If like the treatment looks different or is given in different doses and can't be passed in that way.

227
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,160
And so, again, it might be it's just you're able to see what your what you're getting.

228
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,400
Single blind means that either the patient or the clinician is blinded to the treatment.

229
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,380
So either the patient doesn't know what they're getting or the clinician doesn't know what they're giving.

230
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,240
It's often patient blinding, but sometimes it's clinician blinding.

231
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:52,639
And the patient may or may know, but the clinician or whoever's providing the treatment doesn't know.

232
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,620
And that's to hopefully keep against any clinician bias.

233
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,960
So then checking up on you more are providing extra treatments, things like that.

234
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:09,739
Then Double Blind is often in phase three where everybody basically no one knows

235
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:15,979
besides the pharmacist who created these treatments and put the labels on them,

236
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,180
which treatment you're getting.

237
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,809
So someone knows in the back of which treatment you're getting to make sure that it was correct on the randomization schedule.

238
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:29,930
But you yourself, the patient doesn't know and the clinician treating you doesn't know, they're just dispensing the treatment.

239
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:36,920
And then, like I said, Triple Blind is often thought of as a special case of double blind, where also the statistician is blinded.

240
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:44,149
So what that means in terms of the statistician being blinded is that like you have the data set and it might say like treatment, you know,

241
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,270
it's going to call one of the treatments A and one of the treatments B,

242
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:53,690
and you just don't know if A is placebo or if A is a new treatment or B is placebo or B is a new treatment.

243
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,940
But obviously know that there are different groups. Right.

244
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:03,200
But it could help make sure that you're not substituting or running a certain analysis or doing

245
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,379
a certain transformations or something that would try to make the results go one way or another,

246
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,190
depending on the treatment group. Okay.

247
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,839
So bias can certainly occur when the patient knows what the treatment assignment is,

248
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,070
especially if the outcome is a patient reported outcome or from a scale.

249
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:32,600
And so this the bias that you could have from not blinding on the patient's side is often one of the ways that it happens is the placebo effect.

250
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,389
So the placebo effects specifically is the fact that you actually respond to placebo,

251
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,890
that you take placebo, but yet you feel like you have this clinical response to it.

252
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,460
This has been well documented in drug trials, is also been well documented in surgical intervention trials.

253
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,740
So there is a 2014 systematic review of surgery placebos.

254
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,540
So that's where they like take you under and you think you're getting surgery.

255
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,830
They might even cut you open, but they don't actually do anything in there.

256
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:11,030
And then so you back up, you feel like you're getting better even though nothing happened.

257
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:19,640
And so there is actually improvements in 75% of trials that had surgery placebos, the placebo arm had improvements.

258
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:28,909
This figure on on the right here is from a 2011 asthma study, specifically looking at placebo effects.

259
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:34,520
And so they gave they had for treatment arms and they randomized individuals to either receive albuterol,

260
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,860
which is, you know, if you have an inhaler, like the thing that's actually helpful for asthma.

261
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:47,780
And then some people were on like a placebo inhaler. So other group received sham acupuncture.

262
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,799
So this is also right. Acupuncture is where they put needles in you and you can do like pretend acupuncture

263
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,610
where you just don't hit the right spots or you don't push them in for far enough.

264
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,140
But people think they're getting acupuncture. And then there is a group who just absolutely got nothing.

265
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,370
Okay? And so what they saw was when they had this patient reported outcome.

266
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,000
So when they asked the patient in some way, like, how are you feeling?

267
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,879
Is your asthma better? Right in all three of these, the placebo, the actual albuterol,

268
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,860
the placebo inhaler and the sham acupuncture, all of those patients said, yes, I'm better.

269
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:27,590
Like I feel better. This is an improvement. Whereas the no interventions are no right or most of them did.

270
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,690
But when they actually looked at the objective lung function outcome.

271
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,380
Only the Albuterol Group was better.

272
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:46,360
So really interesting that they they're like, you know, these psychological effects that occur that aren't necessarily making changes in the body.

273
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:54,400
But this happens quite often. And so there's a lot of literature on the placebo effect, a lot of really interesting stuff on it.

274
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,260
Some people who study this specifically.

275
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:05,050
And so there is some understanding that there is beneficial health outcomes resulting just from your anticipation of this intervention helping.

276
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:12,370
There's also some that say that the placebo effect is a surrogate marker for everything that surrounds the pills.

277
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,709
So the fact that, like you're seeing a doctor,

278
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:20,290
you have these rituals about what you're doing because you're receiving treatment, maybe you're making healthy life changes.

279
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:25,670
And so those things are helping. And then there are some other reasons, right?

280
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,830
Like there's regression to the mean. There's something called confirmation bias.

281
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:33,129
So just the fact that we're saying like, yes, something's wrong with you. Here's a pill, right?

282
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:40,540
You feel better? Expectations and learning, pharmacological conditioning, social learning, human connection.

283
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:46,840
So as you can imagine, a lot of this is in like the psychology, psych psychiatric world of research.

284
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,580
But there have been also physical changes in people taking placebo.

285
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,010
So it's a really interesting area of research.

286
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:02,250
And then of course, we blind because we know that bias can occur if the clinician knows the treatment assignment.

287
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:09,270
So they might be more willing to say that there is some toxicity present if they know that you're receiving the treatment.

288
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,840
They might be more quick to switch treatments or to stop that treatment.

289
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,580
If they know which treatment you're receiving,

290
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:25,950
they might be more willing to prescribe some other treatment to try to help with that treatment if they know.

291
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,469
And so, you know, they're not trying to hurt the trial.

292
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,930
They're trying to do the best for the patient. Right.

293
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:42,270
And so, unfortunately, sometimes with extra knowledge of what the treatment is, those might end up biasing the treatment effects.

294
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,650
These are just other ways which I basically mentioned. Okay.

295
00:30:51,670 --> 00:31:02,670
So the blinding is one way to try to get across, to get past that clinician and potential patient bias in the the treatment effect.

296
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:09,489
Another way in which we try to minimize different types of bias is through randomization.

297
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:13,030
And so almost every Phase three trial will be randomized.

298
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:24,760
There are some exclusions in terms of rare diseases or things that are sometimes when drugs are trying to get an accelerated approval.

299
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,620
But for the most part, phase three trials will have randomization involved.

300
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:43,120
So our goal here is really to minimize many different types of bias and so that we can say on average these groups are the same.

301
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,700
And so any difference we see is due to the treatment, right? That's what we ultimately want to be able to say in a clinical trial.

302
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,940
So a little reminder, there are lots of different types of bias, two of which are listed here.

303
00:31:53,950 --> 00:32:00,490
There's confounding, and that's when one or more variable is associated with both the treatment and the outcome.

304
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,040
And there's also selection bias.

305
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:10,370
And so that's some systematic error or bias that causes a sample to be unrepresentative of the population from within.

306
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:15,249
So clinical trials can help with confounding, right?

307
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:20,380
And we can somewhat try to address selection bias in our inclusion and exclusion criteria.

308
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,610
However, randomization is not going to solve selection bias, right?

309
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,690
So randomization is really going to target the confounding issue.

310
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,280
But there still could be selection bias in clinical trials.

311
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:42,909
And that's actually the biggest argument for why clinical trial results maybe aren't relevant is because there is a very

312
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:48,910
specific group of people in the clinical trial that are not actually representative of those who would receive the treatment.

313
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:59,500
And so selection bias is the biggest issue with clinical trial results, whereas with randomization we can really address issues with confounding.

314
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:08,089
Okay. So we randomize because we want to have this assumption that the subject or the individual's

315
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:14,840
outcome on some specific treatment arm is independent of the event of being on that arm.

316
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:23,510
So that the fact that whatever is happening is happening because there because the only

317
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:27,709
thing that differs between anybody on two arms is the fact that they have that treatment.

318
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:35,330
It's not because they're older or because they're heavier, because they have diabetes or because they had some previous treatment.

319
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:35,980
Right.

320
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:43,130
We really just want to we want to make sure that the only systematic difference between these arms on average is the actual treatment assignment.

321
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:50,080
So again, right, there's a difference between a random sample and a randomized sample.

322
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:58,000
So such that a random sample is a representative sample from the population, which we hope to get in a clinical trial, but we don't always.

323
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:07,090
A randomized sample is one in which we actually do the randomization so that we on average can get rid of the the confounding issue.

324
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:21,380
So randomization also helps with these potential clinician and patient biases that we also tried to fix with masking or blinding.

325
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:28,300
Right. If we didn't have randomization, then either the clinician or the patient could opt in to whatever treatment is being studied.

326
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:32,890
And it's likely that there are specific reasons why the clinician would choose this treatment

327
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:36,940
for our patient or the the patient would choose a specific treatment for themselves.

328
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:43,930
And so we try to get rid of those conscious and unconscious biases by saying, you know, you don't get to choose.

329
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,290
We choose for you. And so we're going to assign this.

330
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,650
And on average, then hopefully our groups are similar.

331
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:58,270
Randomization also allows us to have all of our statistical tests be valid.

332
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:05,920
And so we're going to see that once we have this randomization that we can use all the things you learn in.

333
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:14,979
6016026 5651 to actually analyze the data and feel like we can trust the treatment effect, right?

334
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:21,430
And actually produce the what we call the average treatment effect. The disadvantages of randomization,

335
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:29,110
I think we already talked about this when we talked about phase two or earlier is that once we have randomization people,

336
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:33,790
people have preferences, right? Clinicians have preferences, patients have preferences.

337
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,180
And if they're not willing to be randomized, then they will not participate in the study.

338
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:45,159
And so this obviously affects the ability for our trial results to be representative

339
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,760
because there might be certain people who are just not willing to be in the study.

340
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,890
This can also interfere with the physician patient relationship.

341
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:59,380
So a patient might be like, well, you know, hey, doctor, you should know best for me.

342
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:05,440
Like, how do you not know what to do? Right. And so could be it could be hurtful in that relationship.

343
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:11,660
And then also, once we have randomization, there's always some sort of ah,

344
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:16,270
often there's this control group, right, either the placebo or the standard of care.

345
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:20,760
And now we're spending resources on things that we've already spent resources on or studied before.

346
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:24,460
Right. But we actually want to have a concurrent control group.

347
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:33,820
It's important in phase three to have that. And so we do spend those resources, but that is expensive.

348
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:49,090
Okay. So randomization allows us to do this, to actually use our statistics that we learn and make causal conclusions about the treatment effect.

349
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:57,420
So for example, the the best way to analyze the data would be to do this design based inference.

350
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:01,089
But we're going to see that this is infeasible once we actually have large numbers.

351
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:11,260
But ideally we would use the distribution of test statistics induced by randomization to make these treatment effects inferences.

352
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:15,880
So for example, if we had two treatments being compared,

353
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:23,110
we would have under the null hypothesis that these two treatments yield exactly the same response on all the patients in the study.

354
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:29,769
And we would allocate randomly allocate our treatments to the patients in the study.

355
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:34,270
We would observe their outcome. Why? And then we'd be really interested in the test statistic,

356
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:41,650
which would be the difference in the outcome in patients who received A versus the those who received B.

357
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,410
And our null hypothesis would be that that difference is zero.

358
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:51,470
And the alternative would be that that's some other, you know, clinically meaningful, different from zero.

359
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,410
So assume that we have four participants, then two people.

360
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:05,080
Right. Ideally we have equal randomization. And so two people got a and two people got B and we'll call the outcomes Y one by

361
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:08,800
two for those who got A in the outcomes for those who got the Y three and Y four.

362
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:18,670
So our test statistic would be the average of those who got a minus, the average of those who got B and under the null hypothesis,

363
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:26,050
we can actually use the permutation, all probability distribution of our test statistic because we only have four people and we can figure that out.

364
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:34,479
And that was induced by randomization. So if we had four people and they could have only gotten A or B right,

365
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,530
we can look at the different ways in which these four people could be assigned treatment.

366
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:43,989
There are only six different ways in which these individuals could be assigned treatment, right?

367
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:51,100
So there are three ways in which each individual could receive B, I mean, A, and three ways in which they could receive B.

368
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,990
So this is just permutation of a baby, right?

369
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,710
There are six permutations of a two A's in two weeks.

370
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,790
And so under each potential permutation, I can calculate the test statistic.

371
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,790
Right. It's just the average on anything minus the average on B and so on each time.

372
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:23,250
Zero, I'm assuming. Right. I'm just taking those individuals who got a averaging them and subtracting those individuals who got B now under the null.

373
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:28,860
Right. Each of those, each of those different test statistics.

374
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,950
Right. These averages are equally possible. Right.

375
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:35,880
Any of those could have occurred under randomization. Equal randomization.

376
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:49,960
And so we can figure out what the probability of the test statistic actually observed is versus, for example,

377
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:58,380
like the first test statistic by just counting the number of those test statistics that are greater than or equal to t one and divide by six.

378
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:08,110
And so we can actually very easily calculate our P value or the overall conclusion from this permutation test.

379
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:12,630
This is really easy because we only have four people and with two treatments, right?

380
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,120
There's only six permutations. And so we can very easily do this.

381
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,799
However, phase three trials usually include hundreds, if not thousands of individuals.

382
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,840
And so this would be nearly this would definitely be impossible by hand to do.

383
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:31,430
Right. And even with our computation power that we have now, it would take a very long time.

384
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:39,490
It's pretty infeasible. So instead of having to use these permutation tests to make inference,

385
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:45,640
we can actually use the test statistics that you've learned in previous classes.

386
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:52,350
So at this point, we actually want to be able to condition on the treatment actually received.

387
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:58,780
And in order to do that, we want to use the world of counterfactual outcomes or potential outcomes.

388
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,470
How many of you have heard about potential outcomes or counterfactual outcomes?

389
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,900
So some of you. Okay.

390
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:12,310
And so we're going to we're going to use that world and we're going to be able to figure out how we can find the treatment effect,

391
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:21,160
how we can use observed outcomes to make conclusions basically about the potential outcomes that could occur.

392
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:30,430
So we're going to go back to our usual thinking or usual model of what we would do.

393
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,149
And so at this point, right, we would say, oh, well, we have these two outcomes.

394
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:39,250
And they come from the the population where everybody has the treatment effects.

395
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,430
Mean right. Say and some standard deviation.

396
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:46,479
If they got a and for those people who got B right.

397
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:52,340
Well there in that distribution of everybody who would have received B in that mean treatment effect movie.

398
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:58,720
And so my null hypothesis is just that the two treatment means are equal.

399
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:05,950
Right. I'm really interested in if the population parameters the two population means are equal versus the fact that they're different.

400
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:19,750
Now I can use my T statistic to calculate that using my observed data the the estimated average values of the outcomes for those who got a minus,

401
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:27,130
the average values or the outcomes of those who got B. And then I can find the critical value of the T statistic.

402
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:38,669
We already basically discussed this, that the permutation distribution for inference about treatment efficacy is limited

403
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:42,060
because of the fact that we're going to have large numbers of individuals.

404
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:47,100
And so we want to be able to extend our results to this larger sample.

405
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:54,240
And randomization is going to allow us to use model for statistical tests and also to make causal conclusions.

406
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,909
So our results of a randomized trials can say that this treatment caused this effect.

407
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:03,840
And so therefore this treatment is useful to give to all these individuals.

408
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:09,330
You all know that in observational studies you don't have randomization, right?

409
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:13,650
And so while you can use these statistical effects, you're going to have the confounding.

410
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:23,100
And so you can only say you can't have generally unless you're using some specific techniques, you can't make these causal conclusions.

411
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,889
Right? You can only say that these things are associated.

412
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:32,850
But in trials, because we have the prospective assignment and randomize assignment, we can make causal claims.

413
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:43,000
So we also already talked about this, the internal versus external validity in the trial.

414
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:50,950
What we're really focusing on is internal validity. So for those in the trial, right, I can make these causal claims.

415
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:57,070
I hope to say that this is also the fact for all those outside of the trial.

416
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,740
But that really only makes sense for those outside of the trial who are similar to those in the trial.

417
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:07,690
So if it's a also a representative sample, then I can have the external validity as well.

418
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:17,290
Cook in the minutes. So if you remember, one of the textbooks that I said is really helpful for a clinical trial list is by cooking to beds.

419
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:20,739
And they say that if a trial is double blind and randomized,

420
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:28,840
there actually can't be selection bias and that the hypothesis tests will always be unbiased

421
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,970
and the estimates of the treatment effect will be unbiased for that study population.

422
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:42,400
So they're talking about the selection bias that is possible in biasing the treatment effect in the in the trial,

423
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:45,850
not the selection bias of those individuals in the trial.

424
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:51,069
Okay. So again, they're just saying that there is internal validity of results,

425
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:56,320
that the results within the trial will be unbiased if you have a double blind and randomized trial.

426
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:01,150
But that doesn't necessarily ensure that your results are unbiased for all the

427
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:05,310
individuals who could be treated with the treatment if they were not in your trials.

428
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:20,050
So we want to make this causal conclusion.

429
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:28,530
And in order to do that, most clinical trials are interested in this estimate here that we call the average treatment effect or 80.

430
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:33,100
So there are other potential estimated errors that can occur.

431
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:38,050
But for the most part, all clinical trials are interested in this average treatment effect.

432
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:46,569
And so this is the mean outcome in the population. Had everyone in the population had treatment a minus the mean outcome and the

433
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:53,710
population had everyone in the population had treatment be in observed data.

434
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:59,260
Right? Everyone doesn't get a and everyone doesn't get B, they get randomly assigned to one of these treatments.

435
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:10,450
And so we have to make some assumptions in order to say that those who we observe are representative of all those who would get that

436
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:16,890
treatment right and those who we observe and all their treatment are representative of all those who would get the other treatment.

437
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:22,990
And so we have to figure out what those assumptions are so that our average causal treatment effect is actually valid.

438
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:29,800
And so this is where that framework of potential outcomes are also known as counterfactual outcomes comes in.

439
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:36,340
And this was really well established in the late 1970s by Rubin.

440
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:49,270
Donald Rubin, who, if you know of little in our department, was a student of Don Rubin and has worked on a lot of missing data issues with him.

441
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:54,639
But he created this are really well defined the potential outcomes framework.

442
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:00,549
And so that's that like everyone here has these potential outcomes right under treatment.

443
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:04,540
A There's an outcome for us under treatment. B There is an outcome for us under treatment.

444
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,070
See, there's an outcome for us.

445
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:16,900
And so whatever outcome, whatever treatment we actually get right, we observe that potential outcome for that treatment.

446
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,470
And if we had, we got no other treatment, we would observe that potential outcome.

447
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:24,999
So it's kind of like this, like omniscient, omniscient, right?

448
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:34,480
Like God like framework where there's somebody up there who knows what would happen to you regardless of what happens.

449
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:40,270
And while we can only actually see one of those things, we know what would have happened under all these other.

450
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:45,280
Options. So we can only observe the one outcome.

451
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:49,870
However, you could have observed all these other outcomes.

452
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:54,100
And so ideally what we would do right, we would actually know all your outcomes.

453
00:47:54,100 --> 00:48:01,420
We would see whether you got what your outcome was. We would see your outcome would be and we would have the difference and we do that for everybody.

454
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:07,570
Right. That would be a really good estimate of the difference in the effects because we've controlled for every difference.

455
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:10,930
Right. It's within you. We've controlled for all those differences between individuals.

456
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:17,140
Now, once you get a right, that might actually affect how you act if you get B.

457
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,799
And so that's why most trials don't actually do this, right?

458
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,860
Because we can really only observe what happens with they when we give you a and or we don't

459
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:31,480
actually want to spend the whole amount of time to give you a and get rid of day and then give you.

460
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:37,090
Now there are trials that do that. They're called crossover trials and we'll talk about them later where you can

461
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:41,350
actually get A and B and we're trying to get rid of the between patient differences.

462
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:48,009
But for the most part in clinical trials, we're just going to give you one treatment and we're going to assume that whatever treatment we gave you,

463
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:55,810
whatever your outcome is, that's the outcome for that treatment. And so what we want to be able to do is to say, well,

464
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:02,230
I want I'm really interested in this difference in the potential outcomes that could occur for every individual.

465
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:07,240
However, I don't have that data, so I'm going to have to use the data of what I actually observed.

466
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:15,130
And so I want to be able to make some assumptions about the average effects,

467
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:22,030
the average difference in the potential outcomes and how that relates to the average difference in the observed outcomes.

468
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:28,990
So I want to use the potential framework outcome or the potential outcomes framework.

469
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:36,160
So I want to use the observed data to say that I have these differences in the potential outcomes.

470
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:44,350
So the potential outcomes I'm denoting by the stars, right there are hypothetical and we can't observe both of them.

471
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:48,940
What we do observe is everybody's outcome in whichever treatment they're actually on.

472
00:49:49,210 --> 00:50:00,250
And so in order to be able to say that the observed data is a good estimate for the potential outcomes differences, we have to make these assumptions.

473
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:07,629
So if you've ever read a causal inference literature, these are there are actually three primary assumptions being made.

474
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:13,270
These are two of them, the first one being stable unit treatment, value assumption or super.

475
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:20,410
So you'll see that in almost every causal inference, lecture or literature, at some point you're going to talk about these assumptions.

476
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:27,640
So this just means that whatever outcome we observe is the same as the potential outcome that was supposed to occur for you.

477
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:33,670
Which seems obvious, right. But could be affected by other things.

478
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,610
And so it's saying that. Right.

479
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:45,519
Your outcome why is whatever the potential outcome for a was if you got a or is the potential outcome for B if you got B.

480
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,120
So this is an indicator function saying which treatment you actually got.

481
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,830
This is expected to be satisfied in a randomized study.

482
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:05,170
Then independence is this other important assumption such that the treatment assignment t is statistically independent of the potential outcomes.

483
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:09,380
So you can you can see how this is clear in a randomized study, right?

484
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,660
We randomized you before we know your outcomes. You're randomized to the treatment.

485
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,930
And so obviously the treatment assignment was independent of your outcome.

486
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,950
You can see how that's not clear in observational studies, right?

487
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:26,050
People assigned or gave you a treatment because they thought you were going to do better on it.

488
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:33,100
Right. And so in observational studies, the reason why you have to control for confounding or use instrumental variable analysis

489
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,790
or propensity score or whatever is because you're trying to get this independence,

490
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:40,900
you're trying to say that the treatment is independent of their outcome.

491
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:47,680
And so observational studies, this is not just given, but in randomized studies this is given.

492
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:51,220
And so if you have these two assumptions satisfied,

493
00:51:51,520 --> 00:52:02,079
then you can say that the mean for the treatment effect of A is equal to the expected value of the outcomes for the individuals who got a right.

494
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:12,700
Because understood for the individuals, the observed data was is the same as the potential outcomes for them and the same thing for those on B right.

495
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:18,040
The observed data represents all the potential outcomes for B,

496
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:28,510
and so our average treatment effects can be that difference in the means that actually right is going to end up being are y bar minus r r y,

497
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:34,810
bar a, minus y. BARBEE That's how we'll estimate it. Okay.

498
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:44,650
Any questions? So now we're going to get a little bit more into different ways of randomizing.

499
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:51,670
I think there was a question. Maybe I took it off your homework.

500
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:55,030
There might be a question about this as well and on upcoming homework.

501
00:52:55,780 --> 00:53:02,500
But the next part is about fixed versus or equal versus non equal randomization.

502
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:08,830
And then we'll talk about the different types of randomization like simple versus block, etc.

503
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:17,739
So fixed allocation randomization explicitly means that whatever the randomization probabilities are from the beginning,

504
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,930
those are the randomization probabilities throughout. Okay.

505
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:24,910
And so often it's equal randomization that if you have two arms,

506
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,879
half of the individuals are going to go to this arm and half are going to go to that

507
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:33,160
arm and we'll talk in a slide or two about why half is or equal is usually the case.

508
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:39,610
However, you could have fixed allocation where it's two thirds go to this arm and one third

509
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:43,360
go to this arm and whatever you choose initially that remains throughout the trial.

510
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:51,500
Now. Why do we usually have half? Well, let's consider this choice of the randomization probability.

511
00:53:51,500 --> 00:54:00,049
So we're going to call it a pi. So this is the proportion of individuals randomized to a and I think I'll say one minus that is a

512
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:07,640
proportion randomized to to B and the more will assume that we have this total sample size of N where.

513
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,580
And one placenta. So the number on a or the number on B is the total.

514
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:19,829
And we can actually express right the number on one of the treatments as some portion of

515
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:27,600
the number on the other treatment or the proportion of patients on on a for example,

516
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,159
as a proportion of the total individuals. So we're interested in.

517
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:37,000
Right, remember, our primary interest is in this average treatment effect.

518
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:47,310
That's the difference in the means of those on A minus, those on B, and we'll assume that they have the same variance and that's sigma squared.

519
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:56,249
So this estimate of y bar A, minus y, bar B is our main interest and we can get the variance for that, right?

520
00:54:56,250 --> 00:55:00,900
It's going to be dependent upon the variance in the number in each arm.

521
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,670
And so we want to know,

522
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:10,740
so what's the most efficient estimate or of this difference in population means subject to the fact that we have a total sample size of N.

523
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:17,910
So we're trying to figure out what treatment allocation minimizes this variance of the estimates.

524
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:25,950
Right. So what is the treatment allocation where the N1 plus and where how many are in one and how many are in?

525
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:32,040
And to actually minimizes this this value right here.

526
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:41,690
And so we can figure that. All right. We. Can we get over here right where we're actually plugging in at,

527
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:50,690
we're saying and equals N1 placenta so we can just get rid of one of those variables or N1 equals pi times.

528
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:58,549
And so here now we're just in terms of N and we'll see that if we have this function over here that is related

529
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:04,400
to the proportion on each treatment arm that this has to be between zero and one because it's a proportion.

530
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:10,250
And so then that this whole thing is going to be minimized when PI is equal to 0.5.

531
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:16,190
That's the that's the when PI is equal 2.5.

532
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:21,770
This thing is going to be a smallest right? If you plug in .6.9 or point one or point four, it's going to be larger.

533
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:26,180
So it's minimize 1.5, which is equal allocation, right?

534
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:32,180
So this is Y equal allocation or 50 go to this arm and 50 go to this arm is used the most often

535
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:36,620
because then we have the most precise or most efficient estimates of our treatment effect.

536
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:43,520
Once we start playing with that allocation ratio and saying, oh, 60 go here and 40 go here or two thirds go here,

537
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,750
and one third goes here, we start getting less efficient treatment effect estimates.

538
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:56,769
Obviously. Also, there's like the logistical or ethical reason why we'd have half and half in the position,

539
00:56:56,770 --> 00:57:02,740
the fact that we're initially supposed to start with some point of equipoise between treatments.

540
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:09,700
Right. And so we have equipoise between treatments. Then it makes sense to say, well, half of the individuals should go here and half should go there.

541
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:18,550
So it has the ethical or practical reason, but then it also has this very clear statistical reason for why we have equal allocation.

542
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,940
Now, there are possibilities that we do not have equal allocation.

543
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:31,599
So we might actually say that we want two thirds, one third, or if we have multiple arms, like one to 2 to 2,

544
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:39,730
as we saw in one of the examples for the Phase two studies, because we wanted to put more participants on active treatments than on a control group.

545
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:45,240
And we might do that because there is not a terrible loss of efficiency.

546
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:50,020
So even though we do lose efficiency, it's not that bad if we're still around half.

547
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:54,820
And so, for example, if you actually have two thirds, one third,

548
00:57:55,180 --> 00:58:00,639
then you need to treat 12 and a half percent more patients to get the same precision as equal randomization.

549
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,170
So depending on what your sample size is, that might be might not be too many more people.

550
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:11,620
However, if you have like in the thousands, that could be enough that you just cannot afford that that trial anymore.

551
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:22,420
So why would we ever do unequal randomization? It's usually because of some ethical reason or some recruitment reason.

552
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:29,140
So usually we would do it because we feel like patients would be more willing to be on a trial.

553
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:37,210
The efficiency loss is slight. It might be the fact that we actually just want more data on the new treatment.

554
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:42,340
So we want to get more information on the patients.

555
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:50,370
So that we can do subgroup analysis or like biomarker analysis or how these targeted

556
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:54,120
correlative study analyzes where we're looking at for those on the treatment.

557
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:59,370
You know, who who is it most working for? What is associated with it being successful?

558
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:11,240
There's also the reason, right? For if. The other group is placebo or some standard of care where the outcome is not great.

559
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:15,450
And we really do have strong belief that this treatment is going to be useful.

560
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:21,689
But we still need to include this controlled trial again to help recruit patients and to treat them the best we can.

561
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:30,210
We might do this unequal randomization, but it does remove the equipoise because it is now saying, right, we believe this treatment is better.

562
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:34,260
And so there are some ethical concerns with ever having equal randomization.

563
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:40,530
And while we might have the belief that it could be better if it's not, then we're doing a real harm to patients.

564
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,790
So we have to be very careful if we ever have unequal randomization and it needs

565
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:50,670
to be very well justified in any protocol or paper that we read about it.

566
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:58,100
Okay. So then there are different types of random assignment. And this we started talking about.

567
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:08,440
Oh yeah. Sorry, I'm just talking about. Yeah. Is that similar to in phase two when you could be like randomize it to like a one, 2 to 4.

568
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:16,140
Yes. Yeah, same thing in phase two. So the reason why you do it is again to try to either get more data on the treatment

569
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:20,640
and or to help with recruitment in the trial or a combination of those things.

570
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:31,860
So there are lots of different ways in doing random assignment. It is often not just a simple flip, a coin.

571
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:35,010
And so we'll talk about several of those here.

572
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:43,740
Now, random assignment has to be done either in advance or right before a patient gets that treatment, right.

573
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:48,629
So it's either in advance where there is this large randomization list created and

574
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:53,760
either put into a computer program and or back in the day they use to put in envelopes,

575
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,829
treatment assignments based on the list or like the CRM, right?

576
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:08,430
You get information. And then the clinic bus station is running some program and outputting a random assignment based on that information.

577
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:18,720
So these dynamic real time assessments or assignments that are going to be usually we're going to have some discussion about adaptive designs.

578
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,550
You most often use the dynamic assignments in those adaptive designs,

579
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:29,940
whereas for most standard designs or fixed designs, we use the assignments in advance.

580
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:41,430
Usually there is either a statistician who is in charge of the trial or a data coordinating center when it's a much larger trial.

581
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:48,960
Who is in charge of the trial? And they have these randomization lists in advance, which you'll get practice creating next time.

582
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:57,989
And those figure A somebody is going into this like software or whatever or

583
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:01,440
figuring out what the treatment assignment is and giving it to the patient.

584
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:09,780
And if it's blinded, then it's a pharmacist who sees this assignment and then gives the correct treatment to whoever is administering it.

585
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:19,559
Okay, so simple randomization is the easiest one that's just repeated fair coin tossing and or if it's unequal randomization,

586
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:26,570
you could do repeated biased coin tossing. But this preserves complete unpredictability.

587
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:29,820
You have two treatments. You have no idea if it's going to be heads or tails.

588
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:35,520
You can do this, though, right? So you have 100 patients coming into your trial.

589
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:40,139
You can run the heads or tails ahead of time so that that whole list is ready

590
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:43,470
to go to figure out what that treatment is for the next patient coming in.

591
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:48,120
Nobody but the statistician or the pharmacist sees this list, right?

592
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:55,110
The clinician does not have this list in front of them because then they can start making biased choices about who comes in next to the to the study.

593
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:03,590
The problem with simple randomization, and we talked about this last time, is that it can yield highly disparate sample sizes by chance.

594
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:11,970
So while on average it's equal right in very small samples, especially, it can be quite unequal.

595
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:20,130
So for 20 participants, more than 5% of the sequences yield a ratio imbalance of 3 to 7 or worse,

596
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:24,360
or they're in balance, right, 12 to 8 50% of the time.

597
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:28,260
So there can be these big issues where you don't actually have like ten and ten.

598
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:35,940
Now, in large phase three trials, which are usually hundreds of participants, if not thousands, simple randomization on average should be fine.

599
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:46,590
However, we often don't use it because we just want to ensure that the balance and so we usually at least do block randomization,

600
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:54,280
but you could do simple randomization. So it's easy to implement.

601
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:57,240
It's virtually impossible to guess what the next treatment is.

602
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:03,600
And because we have simple randomization, we can use the statistical tests and have causal inference.

603
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:17,010
The disadvantages are that it's random, so imbalance can occur and this can then result in less efficiency and less credible results of the trial.

604
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:24,420
So then if you have imbalance, you could have some issues in terms of the confounding factors balancing on each side.

605
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:28,770
And that can make people not feel confident in the results of the trial.

606
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:33,719
So there is the option that if you're doing this ahead of time, right,

607
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:39,360
and you run your randomization list and then you see, oh, this is super unbalanced, it's like 7030, right?

608
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:47,220
You can just run another randomization list. So this is the easiest way to fix the simple randomization is what's called replacement randomization.

609
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:56,590
So before anybody goes on this trial, you make sure that your randomization list is is well done so that you see this balance.

610
01:04:56,970 --> 01:05:03,810
And so this is totally acceptable as long as it's all done before the trial starts and anybody in the trial.

611
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:11,760
You can't read. You can't do this. Once people are in the trial, now you see of an issue, you can't change things.

612
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:18,089
Okay. So, right, you could just say, let me do a randomization list.

613
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:21,090
If it's equal, great. And if it's not, I'm just going to keep doing it.

614
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:25,710
And I could write a nice little function to make sure that I'm not like having to hit go every time.

615
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:30,450
Okay. And then we said that.

616
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:38,640
But one of the easiest ways to deal with this balance is through random per muted block randomization.

617
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:42,389
And so we gave that example where you could have block.

618
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:49,290
So if you have two treatments, you can have blocks of four and then within every block of four there's balance.

619
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:51,990
So there's always two A's and always two B's.

620
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:59,190
And because there are different ways in which you can have two A's and to B is right, there are six different ways, six different permutations.

621
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:07,650
You don't know which permutation is coming up next. And so there are ways in which the there are many different ways in which a, b can be assigned.

622
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:13,049
Yeah, just clarify it. So simple randomization and replacement randomization are different types.

623
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:16,610
It's not like an iteration of simple or an arm.

624
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:22,649
It is actually really replacement randomization is iteration of simple randomization.

625
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:26,010
Right. It's just saying that like the first time I did simple randomization wasn't good.

626
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:29,820
So I'm going to keep doing it until it's good. It's not really a different type of good question.

627
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:41,969
It's. I think the biggest confusion with people who don't, who first learn about random block, randomized block or around primitive blocks,

628
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:48,110
is that they think there must be four patients coming in at the same time, and I disburse their treatments like that.

629
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:55,649
That's not the case. So we're just ahead of time calculating these lists where within every block of four there is balance.

630
01:06:55,650 --> 01:07:01,650
However, patients can come in one at a time and we just go down the list where every four is balanced.

631
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:10,780
In fact, the bigger the block, the the harder it is to actually guess which treatment is next.

632
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:16,629
Right. If we said that we had that we were doing random block randomization or we were doing preview

633
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:22,630
to block randomization and the block sizes for the clinician could keep track of like,

634
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:26,290
oh, the first person got to in the next person got beat, the next person got to,

635
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:30,190
I know this person's going to be I don't want to put my patient on because I don't want them to get beat.

636
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:38,290
And so the way to try to get against that bias is to say, well, what if the block was six or eight or ten or 12?

637
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:44,440
There's no way they're going to remember that. Or what we usually do is actually say, Well, let's choose random.

638
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:51,580
Well, first choose a random block size, and then there will be random assignment within each block size.

639
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:58,300
So if we have, say, two treatments, right, we could choose block sizes of any multiple of two.

640
01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:01,510
So you could do two, four, six, eight, ten, 12.

641
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:09,130
Right. And usually you will do like if there are, say, two treatments, we do block sizes of like four, six and eight.

642
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:14,470
And so then the first kind of random pick is my choosing a block of four, six or eight,

643
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:19,420
and then there's a random pick of what's the permutation of those treatments within that block.

644
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:26,710
And then overall, right, there will be balance, general balance across the participants.

645
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:30,730
So we have this random block assignment of like four, six and eight.

646
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:36,550
We make this really big list. This, by the way, is what our randomization log lists will look like.

647
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:39,470
And we can do all of this in the package block.

648
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:48,340
Rand So what happens is that the first person comes in and says, oh, they should get be the next person should get PBB or whatever.

649
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:54,160
So, for example, we only had 16 participants.

650
01:08:55,210 --> 01:09:00,730
To broaden this list, right. We didn't actually get through that full block of ten.

651
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:05,890
So we can have some imbalance because we won't necessarily get through all the blocks.

652
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:14,680
However, we're going to have very we're going to have much smaller balance using the permitted blocks than if we just did simple randomization.

653
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:24,410
So random primitive blocks. Bizarre is the.

654
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,630
Is mostly what I use for randomization in trials.

655
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:34,900
And so then you choose the size of the blocks as a multiple of the number of treatments,

656
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,559
and you usually don't go too high because the higher your block size,

657
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:42,760
the more likely you will have that imbalance because not every you won't fill the blocks.

658
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:48,400
But so for example, if I had to choose like blocks of four, six and eight, maybe are just four and six.

659
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:53,630
And we'll talk about why this has stratum on here in a minute.

660
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:58,680
Maybe. Yes. Okay.

661
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:03,570
There's also the bias coin method. So you guys did a version of this for your homework?

662
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:13,569
The bias coin design. Remember, you saw that if there was a toxicity, then there was a stop or something.

663
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:20,620
And if there wasn't a toxicity, then you could either increase the dose level or you would stay and you could flip a biased coin.

664
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:29,949
So similarly in randomization, we can use bias coin to try to make the groups equal the numbers, right?

665
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:36,340
So we can start regular simple randomization and then we can say, Oh, now that there's this huge imbalance,

666
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:44,620
let's actually turn on bias coin randomization so that more participants will get the treatment where there's not enough participants in that level.

667
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:58,480
So you can basically keep a tally of like what the balance is between the treatments and then allow for bias coin to try to correct that imbalance.

668
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:02,739
And so Kokoschka suggested that if we're going to use a biased coin,

669
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:12,160
we use probability of two thirds to try to correct that imbalance and that the imbalance should be corrected relatively quickly with that probability.

670
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:16,090
So it's right. One option which we'll talk about later, is that we could just say like, oh,

671
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:22,360
if if say five people have a and three have be, well, we should just give the next person B, right?

672
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:30,100
Well, that's too deterministic. So we said let's actually have flip a coin where two thirds probability they get B and one third they get A,

673
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:33,430
and if we keep doing that until there's balance remover,

674
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:38,050
we're going to get balance quickly and then we could go back to the half and half randomization.

675
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:45,760
So the bias coin method is usually some combo of like simple randomization and the bias coin to try to get the balance.

676
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:59,640
So you can implement this. The spice coin method using the randomize are packaged and this MTI is the maximum tolerated in balance.

677
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:08,730
So this is saying that I want a randomization list for 20 participants and if at any point there is imbalance of four or more between the two lists,

678
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:18,330
turn on the bias coin so that now there's going to be two thirds probability of getting the lesser accumulated treatment arm.

679
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:24,660
And so here this is in the list where you can see.

680
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:34,960
That at this point, the bias between five and six, the bias quote in randomization would have been turned on because there are four people in black.

681
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:43,220
Actually, no, it's six. There would have been turned on because there are five people in treatment, one and one person in treatment two.

682
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:51,530
And so there's a balance of imbalance of four. And so now there's going to be two thirds probability of getting that treatment two or the zero.

683
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:58,100
And so you can see that happened for a while. And then they went back to like half and half and couldn't get balance.

684
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:04,750
All right, Farley, let's stop there.

685
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,890
That's enough for today. That's more than enough for today. I'm sure you all feel.

686
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:14,390
So we'll talk about stratification. So this is the way in which we're going to try to balance with what?

687
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:19,960
Within specific prognostic factors. And this is also something that's often used in trials.

688
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:28,780
So Tuesday you'll have your test. Thursday we'll come back to this and then move on to the next lecture for phase three.

689
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:35,280
Good luck studying. Feel free to send me any questions.

690
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:40,090
There's. I don't have any more office hours before test, but following GSI has them on Friday.

691
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:55,300
So those are not like they're so close to the entrance.

692
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:00,530
So it's like, yeah. Lessons learned.

693
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:05,970
The government is looking for increased assistance.

694
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:16,290
I was very surprised to learn that it is targeting small groups as there is yesterday.

695
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:22,110
Like, I think it's an easy one.

696
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:28,110
So I think it is. How does it work?

697
01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:50,710
So maybe it does give it a greater finish and how that helps me learn to be great at making it.

698
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:55,950
You know, just when it comes to know myself.

699
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:59,730
I believe that we are two things.

700
01:15:04,830 --> 01:15:19,000
I think one thing is that you are you. And sometimes that's why you look like not.

701
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:25,770
I am actually not about that. But I think you are.

702
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:40,980
You sleep, you hook on your cold and fell on me about what I well look how miserable feels really hot.

703
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:45,930
I'm 63 days and not six and she was the first person to.
