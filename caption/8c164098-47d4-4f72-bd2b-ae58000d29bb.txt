00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,630
Good afternoon. I'm here today to talk about how climate change is affecting the city of Detroit.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:12,060
Climate change affects everyone worldwide, but each community faces its own set of challenges,

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,780
and certain communities are going to be more heavily affected than others.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:25,050
As with many serious public health issues, climate change affects more vulnerable and under-resourced communities such as Detroit harder than others.

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,870
Today, we'll be focusing on how climate change puts Detroit at risk for extreme heat.

6
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,550
So as climate change progresses,

7
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:40,530
we're expected to have more and more extreme heat events where temperatures rise to dangerous levels, sometimes for days at a time.

8
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,470
Detroit is at higher risk for extreme heat because many areas of the city are urban heat islands.

9
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,990
This means that these parts of the city get much hotter than the surrounding areas because

10
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,520
the buildings and streets absorb the heat from the sun and cause the temperature to rise.

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,320
Since these areas of the city don't have as many trees or plants to cool things down.

12
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:09,810
The air temperature can be as much as 10 degrees hotter than the surrounding area. Now, extreme heat has several serious effects on people's health.

13
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,760
First, higher temperatures can trap air pollution, which makes it harder to breathe.

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:25,480
It can trigger asthma attacks. Second, the high temperature can cause heat stroke where the body can't cool itself down, which can lead to death.

15
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,070
The harms from extreme heat events are more likely to fall on communities of color in

16
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,620
Detroit because people of color are more likely to be housed in urban heat islands.

17
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,910
This is due to systemic inequities such as redlining,

18
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:49,660
which have funneled communities of color to less desirable housing areas where there have been significant underinvestment in infrastructure.

19
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:57,130
This leads to undermine teen housing, inadequate ventilation and higher energy bills for cooling,

20
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:04,030
and this underinvestment also has led to low levels of trees and parks to cool these areas down.

21
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:11,410
Because of the high heat risk in Detroit and the unequal burden of extreme heat on Detroit residents of color,

22
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,540
there are several things that the city of Detroit must do to address the environmental injustice.

23
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:24,280
First, the city needs to allocate funds to plant trees and parks in these urban heat island areas.

24
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,950
Second, the city needs to invest in infrastructure upgrades in urban heat islands,

25
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:39,100
including reflective roofs that deflect the heat from the sun instead of absorbing it in cool pavement that absorbs less heat as well.

26
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,810
Finally, while the city works on upgrading infrastructure,

27
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:49,840
it needs to implement a program to reduce the cost of energy for cooling homes and urban heat islands.

28
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,790
Since these communities bear an unfair cost of keeping their homes cool,

29
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:00,160
we need to come together to protect our most vulnerable residents from heat related harm.

30
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,233
It's the right thing to do.
