1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,590
And we'll leave you with some of these real world lessons.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,978
I think number one for me, this has always been very important,

3
00:00:06,978 --> 00:00:11,040
I think measures should be inspired by the problem.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,578
This was a very important problem to me, and

5
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:16,402
the community of clinicians that I worked with.

6
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:21,258
And I think that that was one of the reasons why there's a lot of energy about

7
00:00:21,258 --> 00:00:23,739
trying to push for this improvement.

8
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:27,085
I think to really understand how to improve a measure,

9
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:30,518
we really have to have a deep understanding of context.

10
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:34,630
And I wish there was a different way, but it ends up taking a lot of work and

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,140
a lot of partners to be successful.

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,590
It's not something that you can kind of do in isolation, published and

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,651
hope that it's actually gonna make a difference in the world.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,597
There's a big part of this publishing it will cure it, that's definitely true.

15
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:57,667
The only one who's guaranteed to read your papers is your mother.

16
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:00,174
>> [LAUGH] >> You got to get a scholarship in

17
00:01:00,174 --> 00:01:03,431
whatever way you can, and then finally,

18
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:08,290
no measure is really perfect, they all need to be adaptable.

19
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,582
You might even argue that some of these have a shelf life and

20
00:01:11,582 --> 00:01:16,148
one of the things about is that because it's kind of tapped out to where it's at,

21
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:18,723
it's actually being retired at this point.

22
00:01:18,723 --> 00:01:23,062
As we're thinking, one of the broadest measure, maybe it is trying to measure

23
00:01:23,062 --> 00:01:26,820
a system's response to somebody showing up from the moment that they

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,680
have symptom recognition all the way towards definitive treatment.

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,995
And it's been really exciting, I mean, this is group and

26
00:01:32,995 --> 00:01:36,271
fielding community that's been thinking really, what's next in this regard?

27
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,866
And then, as I told you with that Alaska and evaluation is challenging and in fact

28
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:48,231
it's always kind of ongoing when we think about it, how we wanna kind of move over.

29
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,165
All right now, all I've talked to you about is primary DCI and

30
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:58,150
it's [LAUGH] like this, it's only one small piece in a whole larger puzzle when

31
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,640
you think about medicines like aspirin stat cardiac.

32
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,262
So this is one small piece in one small disease process in the whole world

33
00:02:07,262 --> 00:02:10,821
where there's a hell of a lot of room for improvement.

34
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:15,488
So I think understanding that it's important and the scale of things,

35
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:18,160
but this is how change happens, right?

36
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,310
It doesn't happen globally, I think, understanding that and appreciating

37
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,001
that and really embracing that is sending a powerful way of [INAUDIBLE].

38
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:32,225
All right, we'll end with the final storey, so

39
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:38,681
it's the fall of 2011 and Notre dame comes to the big house, right?

40
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:44,357
So the two winning Nous programmes in college football history of play,

41
00:02:44,357 --> 00:02:48,205
and there's more people that watch this game,

42
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:52,067
I didn't ever watch the football game before.

43
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:57,076
All right, so some of you might have actually been, but

44
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:01,979
someone that was in the audience that day was a guy named

45
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:07,322
there was a Bay City Michigan native and a lifelong moving.

46
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:11,700
So somewhere in the middle of the second quarter, he just starts feeling

47
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,429
not well and he looks to his sons who was at the beginning with,

48
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,536
and he kind of passes out, right?

49
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:23,178
There's a dentist behind him who sees this, jumps down and starts doing CPR,

50
00:03:23,178 --> 00:03:28,139
they activate 911, the paramedics come,they shock him because

51
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:32,843
he's in a dangerous rhythm called ventricular fibrillation and

52
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:38,231
they whisked him off to university hospital, where actually my colleague

53
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:43,819
ends up doing intention plastic on him and opens up this blockage that he had.

54
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:48,642
And the best part about this is that by the fourth quarter he's

55
00:03:48,642 --> 00:03:53,927
already back in our CCU and he's there to watch the end of the game and

56
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:58,658
he gets to see boy Roundtree catch that pass from Dennard with

57
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:03,421
like three seconds left, right, and sees Notre dame lose.

58
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:07,197
And he's got the best line, which is he goes, I always root for Notre dame,

59
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,734
where he goes, I'll always be for Notre dame, but

60
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:13,040
I'll never root against the university of Michigan.

61
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,614
So I say this as the ending of it mainly because what's remarkable and

62
00:04:18,614 --> 00:04:23,730
extraordinary about that storey is how ordinary it is, right?

63
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,235
So a decade and a half ago, that was amazing but I can tell you every month,

64
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:33,180
when you hear storeys like this, and changing the extraordinary to the ordinary

65
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,257
has been kind of a few, I think, team about this.

66
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:40,383
And it's really amazing, and it's been really just one thing to be a part of and

67
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:42,056
to think about how to get there.

68
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:42,561
[APPLAUSE]
