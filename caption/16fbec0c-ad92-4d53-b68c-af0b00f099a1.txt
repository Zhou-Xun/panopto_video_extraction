1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:10,080
The 40. So very delighted to have our second presentation for today.

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,010
Jennifer Sweeney, can you give a little background about yourself where you are?

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,969
Sure. My standing in the race fossil record, it doesn't matter.

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,900
It doesn't matter how it finds you. Everyone was making a little money.

5
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,320
It's kind of creepy how it really does look like. Good morning.

6
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,870
I'm John Sweeney. I'm from Infection Prevention, along with Jacqui.

7
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,830
So I actually came to infection prevention any kind of roundabout way.

8
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:53,100
I did my undergrad here at University of Michigan, and then I did my Masters work at the University of Minnesota.

9
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:01,469
And my direction of study was actually environmental health epidemiology.

10
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:11,640
Ah, I'm sorry, microbiology. So I come from a, an environmental health micro background versus a standard epidemiology background.

11
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,610
And part of my project work that I was working on, interestingly enough,

12
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:27,570
was hand hygiene and culturing the environment, culturing hands and the environment for, for MRSA.

13
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:36,059
So via VATS, I got an introduction to infection prevention because it was the infection prevention folks

14
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,070
that I was working at working with at all of the different hospitals that I was going to.

15
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:46,860
And they would help me identify the patients and get into the rooms and perform the cultures and whatnot.

16
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:54,149
So via a different non epi route I ended up in infection control and I have been in

17
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:59,430
this department since I graduated from the School of Public Health 20 years ago.

18
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:06,030
So now you know how old I am in my duration, in infection prevention.

19
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,680
I've done a little bit of everything. For the most part I have covered.

20
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,490
For those of you who are familiar with our department,

21
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:21,629
we have an entry level analyst position that does a lot of the heavy surveillance and some of those activities.

22
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,800
And according to the Health Department,

23
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:32,880
that was my introduction into the department in that I took on I became an infection prevention test and covered all of the March hospital,

24
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,660
and I was part of the group that helped build the CW building.

25
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:48,570
And then I transitioned to the surgical world and did very specific surgical surveillance in surgical work for seven years.

26
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:56,459
And I came back to the cloud Zuccotti World and worked at the project level.

27
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,530
So Jackie just presented us to be one of my main projects as well as Corti,

28
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,520
which I think you'll hear about next week, maybe a couple weeks right here.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,730
So I used to lead those big institutional projects.

30
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:20,850
Now I'm actually a manager, but still have now come back to the SSI world and am kind of managing the the global SSI project for the department.

31
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:27,090
So I'm kind of coming full circle. So this is my first time actually doing this presentation.

32
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,940
So I'm familiar with the content, but it's a little bit lumpy, apologize.

33
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:44,040
So I was asking Dr. Foxman, if you guys had the definitions, have you looked at some of the SSI definitions and Chapter nine?

34
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:50,219
If not, I have a couple handouts that I can give to you when we get to that point so that you're not completely lost.

35
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,960
So just let me know when we get there if you want some some hard copies to look at.

36
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,700
All right. With that, let's go into SSI.

37
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,550
I use the mouse to scroll, right? Yeah. You can click on the area, visit page.

38
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,570
Oh, okay. Whatever works for you. All right.

39
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:20,610
So what is an SSI? And SSI is an infection that is that occurs after a patient has has a surgical procedure.

40
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:30,629
Obviously, in there are we're going to go into the details of this, but you can have many different types of surgical wound infections.

41
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,220
But obviously, if you're not having surgery, you're not going to have a surgical infection. I see that's easier.

42
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:45,419
Why are these important? Strangely, as as eyes are one of the more common hospital acquired infections.

43
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:51,840
And they are they account for a large chunk of the hospitalized patients infections that we have.

44
00:04:52,080 --> 00:05:01,200
And they're actually very costly because what they usually do is they increase the hospitalization sometimes significantly,

45
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:09,319
and that obviously always increases the cost. So. One of the big things that we're always trying to do, one one is from a patient safety perspective,

46
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,120
make sure our patients are not coming in for surgical procedures and acquiring infection,

47
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:22,370
but then making sure that we're not incurring additional costs to the health system by these infections needing to be managed as well.

48
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:31,969
So you can see down here, three and a half to $10 billion annually account for expenditures related to surgical wound infections.

49
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,260
And I believe that is relatively old. So I'm sure it's even higher now.

50
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:50,480
So not only are they just not good from a financial and a patient standpoint, there are a number of probably for those reasons,

51
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,210
there are a number of different groups that are monitoring this from an external standpoint.

52
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:00,530
And one of these is the Joint Commission as a health system.

53
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,120
Most hospitals are accredited by the Joint Commission.

54
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,990
We actually just had our training try in the old, whatever you call it,

55
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:15,920
survey where they come in and they evaluate everything we're doing in there, say, okay, you're good for another three years.

56
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,409
If they are not happy with what they're doing,

57
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:25,580
they could pull our accreditation status and prevent us from from seeing patients, which is pretty significant.

58
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:32,359
So they actually have a goal that lies underneath the joint commission standards that

59
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,639
says we feel it's very important that you reduce health care associated infections.

60
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:47,630
And one of those is to prevent help, prevent infections that happen after surgical procedures.

61
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:57,230
Oops. There are other people that pay attention to this as well, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,

62
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,350
or you'll sometimes hear them refer referred to as third party payers.

63
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:08,420
They also monitor and look at data from our institution on a regular basis.

64
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,670
And they've come up with standards and they have picked surgical procedures like coronary artery bypass,

65
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:23,030
bariatric surgery, certain orthopedic surgeries and implantable cardiac devices like pacemakers and whatnot.

66
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:29,720
In if there are significant if they're infections related to some of those procedures that require additional cost,

67
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,110
they can see you're sucking that up yourself.

68
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,710
We're not paying you for those because these shouldn't have happened.

69
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,409
So it comes back from an external source as well.

70
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,240
And then from an infection prevention standpoint,

71
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:54,080
we collect data related to abdominal hysterectomy and colons that go into any season that are pulled.

72
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:04,910
And there is there are reimbursement ramifications to to those as well from this AP piece group.

73
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:14,360
Oops, I just hit the wrong button. So all of these are kind of roll under the sun realm of value based purchasing.

74
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:24,020
So if the data does not look like what we want it to look like, then the the money that you are giving back could be limited.

75
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:32,089
But also, if they feel like you're doing well, then you can get these these points back and it's sort of like buying a car.

76
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,629
You get some incentives. Sometimes it's it's a similar concept.

77
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,460
You sometimes can get some points back and it's a good thing.

78
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,649
But this is published data.

79
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:52,850
So if you were having some sort of colon surgery or a hysterectomy, you could go and look and see what our numbers look like and be like.

80
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,890
I do not want to go there for this type of surgery. Their numbers do not look good.

81
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,549
So is you can be an informed customer about where you were receiving your health care as well.

82
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:11,750
And you can go you can go shop around and find the place that looks the best to you from a from a numbers standpoint.

83
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,860
So how do we how do we have necessary well, in order to have enough to say, first of all, you do have a surgical procedure,

84
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:30,270
but then obviously you also need a pathogen and the pathogen needs to get into the host in certain quantities to be able to cause an infection.

85
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:40,020
So there are a number of things that all need to come together in order for an infection to happen compared to it.

86
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:46,440
I don't like seeing the exercise are more complicated than any of the other health care acquired infections that we look at.

87
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,759
But there are a lot of factors that really come in.

88
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:58,710
And any time you're looking at a surgical wound infection or investigating a cluster, you have to take all of these things into account,

89
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:09,839
which probably two labs would probably not involve all of these all of these things, but patient factors, which we'll talk about in a second.

90
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:17,640
In the environment, you're you're having a procedure in what is considered to be a very clean environment.

91
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,229
We refer to surgical procedures being sterile. The room is not sterile.

92
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,350
There is nothing sterilizing the room, but the room is very clean.

93
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:32,069
The room needs to be treated in a manner to maintain its cleanliness,

94
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:39,600
to make sure you're not having harboring organisms in the environment that are going to make it back to the patient.

95
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:47,250
You have surgical instruments that are being reprocessed in a certain way and the expectation is these things are sterile.

96
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,110
So you're often bringing sterile things into the room and you're making a prepping and draping.

97
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,740
You're making a sterile field around the patient to keep things protected.

98
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:04,830
The staff have certain attire that they're wearing so that when they're coming up to the field, they are as sterile as possible.

99
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:14,640
There's a certain way that we clean the patient. Patients who have longer procedures are at higher risk of infections.

100
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:21,420
Glucose in body temperature. There are groups that are monitoring for normal.

101
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,400
For me as a normal,

102
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:33,090
there means keeping your body temperature at a certain level so it's not going too low and making you more susceptible to having an infection.

103
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:41,490
Glucose levels, especially in diabetic patients, it's a really big ticket item right now,

104
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:49,440
is making sure that people's glucose levels are at the appropriate level before, during and after a case for a certain window.

105
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:56,880
Because when someone's glucose is completely out of whack, that's also impairing your body's ability to to heal itself.

106
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,489
Certain procedures have preoperative antibiotics that are expected.

107
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,000
So longer procedures, things involving implants.

108
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:14,250
So there's a whole and they have to be administered at a certain time frame so that you make sure you have it actually absorbed into your tissues.

109
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:21,120
It's not just like administering antibiotics and then making an incision in traffic.

110
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,520
Hands, scrub, obviously surgical hands grow up in traffic. Do you guys know what traffic means in an operating room setting?

111
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,560
So we're clearly not driving cars in and out of people in and out.

112
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,630
Correct. Is people in and out of the room. So our operating rooms are pressurized.

113
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:46,200
They have 15 to 30 some air changes within that room, which is a lot.

114
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,050
So if you're in there, it feels it doesn't feel windy, but if you're standing at the door, it feels windy.

115
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,970
That also results in a positive pressure environment.

116
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:04,139
So as soon as the door to positive pressure environment is opened, it messes up the air,

117
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,560
changes in the airflow that is coming down over top of the patient.

118
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:19,920
And when you mess up that special air curtain, it's allowing for things floating around in the air, particulates to get back to the patient level.

119
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,140
So that is always something that we are focusing on.

120
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:32,220
Now some more about patient factors. Obviously, we talked a little bit about diabetes.

121
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,360
Some of these things we can try and control for like the glucose main attraction.

122
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,569
You can't control for someone's age. That is that is what it is.

123
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,590
And you just need to work with it. Obesity, malnutrition,

124
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,220
those are things that people will try and work with the patient on to get them at their

125
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:55,050
optimal state prior to surgery so that they can be in the most optimal condition to recover.

126
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:03,840
But malignancy, you can't always control smoking that will put people on smoking, cessation programs, immunosuppression.

127
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,309
Sometimes that can't be helped either. So some of these things can't be accounted for.

128
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:14,880
And we just we know that we're dealing with the slightly more compromised patient in some of these cases.

129
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:26,160
And how do we how do we keep track of this? This is actually one of the ways that underlying patient factors are kind of documented.

130
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:34,620
So the American Society of Anesthesiology has a score. So typically, before you have any surgical procedure, you will meet with an anesthesiologist.

131
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,559
Your surgeon is, as we are, and we're going to have surgery.

132
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:45,660
Now, you need to have your preoperative checked done and usually at some point you'll meet with an anesthesiologist, they'll talk to you.

133
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,120
They will find out about your history, you know, things like that.

134
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,020
And they will assign you based on these these numbers.

135
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,940
And once, you know, one would be an assay, it's called an assay score.

136
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,180
An assay of one would be in normal baseline, healthy patient.

137
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,830
But when you're getting to an assay of three, that's someone who's got some pretty significant underlying issues.

138
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:16,710
So when you're looking at an infection, you see and assay of three or only cow four, then you know,

139
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,809
you have someone that is probably someone that we were going to have a hard

140
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:26,370
time getting them through this without some sort of complication afterwards.

141
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,440
I've never seen anything above a four. So the five and six.

142
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:40,370
Ah, not seen very often. And even for, as I would say, we often do not see force.

143
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,470
But you do on occasion see three.

144
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:54,270
And then there is also a wound class that is determined by the the attending and some of the nurses that are involved in the case.

145
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,290
And that is kind of assessing the type of surgical procedure.

146
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,970
And or it might give you some indication if something happened during the case,

147
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:11,610
a cardiac procedure should never be clean, contaminated or dirty unless it's infected.

148
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,570
Or if something happens to contaminate the site during the case,

149
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:24,930
a case might start clean and it might end up being contaminated or contaminated if something happened during the case.

150
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:31,469
So they could be making changes to that one class as things progress.

151
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:37,470
And that might help lead you to think through something if you're investigating a wound infection.

152
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,870
So how do we prevent these? So that giant wheel that I just showed you, really,

153
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:52,790
you have to do some work at every single one of those spokes to try and prevent a surgical wound infection.

154
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,049
And this includes some of them, but not all of them.

155
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,709
But really, that giant wheel is everything that needs to be done.

156
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,820
And even sometimes if you have covered everything on that wheel, the best that you think you can.

157
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:10,930
Things just happen and a patient may end up with an infection. All right.

158
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,889
So NHS on, I think Jackie probably talked to you about the National Health Care Safety

159
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:21,459
Network that is kind of the housing place for all of the definitions that we use.

160
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,440
That's where we report all of our data to.

161
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:33,770
That's where a lot of the other folks like Seamless and we actually have some other groups that poll data from NHS on that we we put in there.

162
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:48,110
Yeah. So that's it. And now, Jackie, talk to you about the collab Z definition where you had kind of a nice seven day window period.

163
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:56,930
So that will be very similar for, I think, almost everything else that you're going to be looking at from infection prevention in terms of clubs.

164
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,590
Icardi V SSI is a little bit different.

165
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:08,870
We have a longer time frame that we can look at from an SSI standpoint, so we'll talk about that in a second.

166
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:18,649
But from a history standpoint, there are definitions for what an operative procedure is and really you need to have at least one incision

167
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:24,200
and that can include laparoscopic incisions and your case needs to take place in an operating room.

168
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,719
That may sound funny, but there are times where certain cases do happen at a bedside.

169
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,200
If things are really dire for certain patients, something may.

170
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:41,270
It's very rare that it happens, but something that happens at a bedside would not fall under the NHS.

171
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,930
An evaluation criteria for a wound infection.

172
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:54,860
There are levels and I think I mentioned this briefly at the beginning there are superficial, deep, incisional and organ space.

173
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:01,490
So we're first going to go through the superficial skin infection definition.

174
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:11,570
So in order to have a superficial wound infection, it needs the infection needs to occur within 30 days of the surgical procedure.

175
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:19,159
So unlike Cloud Z, where you generally will take the dates, the microbiology lab,

176
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:25,069
and you'll set that in the middle of your window period and kind of work on the opposing three

177
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:33,110
days previous in the post three days the day of the surgical procedure is is your start date.

178
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:38,720
And when you're calling a wound infection you may actually call an infection.

179
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:52,400
So August 1st you had a surgical procedure and there are some that track 90 days out and you had a 90 day one that you were evaluating.

180
00:19:52,850 --> 00:20:00,230
And if you called an October infection, that would still count as an August 1st SSRI.

181
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:05,060
So it's a little bit different. Everything bounces back to the date of the surgery.

182
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,250
Okay.

183
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:15,180
So in order for it to be superficial, it needs be 30 days after the operative procedure and only involve the skin and soft tissue of the incision.

184
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,559
So it's it's something that you should be able to see. And there's a few additional things on here.

185
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,110
So if they mentioned preplanned drainage from the incision,

186
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:36,080
if they have cultured it and it grow something, sometimes a a physician or a surgeon will open it in.

187
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:43,220
So opening it can be in different things. So they can actually take the patient back to the operating room and I'll say,

188
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:50,480
cultured the incision or they can be in an exam room and they can just literally take a Q-Tip and kind of

189
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:58,010
stick it in the corner of the incision and that that counts as opening as well from a superficial standpoint.

190
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:06,710
And it needs to be culture positive. So if they if they culture it in its culture negative, it's not going to meet these definitions.

191
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:13,220
Or they can choose to not culture it at all and just tell you it looks like it has prolonged drainage from it.

192
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:22,580
And interestingly, this is also the only healthcare-acquired infection that will allow you to call something by a provider diagnosis.

193
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:30,620
But you still need to take this a little bit with a grain of salt, and we'll go through a few things to kind of explain that in a second.

194
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:40,040
But as Jackie mentioned earlier, we are dealing with surveillance definitions, clinicians, nurses, providers.

195
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:47,090
They are treating the patients. So they you will if you continue on in this type of field,

196
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:58,489
you will routinely find yourself in conversations with clinical folks about something being an infection or not an infection.

197
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,790
And you just need to keep reinforcing that these are surveillance definitions

198
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:09,229
and these are what allow us to compare ourselves across to other institutions,

199
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:15,889
to ourselves, as Jackie said, be consistent with yourself in your definitions and especially in the surgical world.

200
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:24,260
Being consistent with how you approach this is is really important because some things that I'm going to show you in a second,

201
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:31,820
a provider would say surgical wound infection, I'm throwing antibiotics on board, but they are not going to meet these.

202
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:36,650
So they might call it an infection. And we will say it's not meeting our criteria.

203
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:46,210
At the era. There are sort of two different things within a superficial that you can call as well.

204
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:52,540
And one is a super incisional primary. That means that the primary incision is what is infected.

205
00:22:52,970 --> 00:23:02,980
There's a superficial incisional secondary, which means there is like a secondary site, like for a coronary artery bypass procedure.

206
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,500
They will often take leg vein. You'll take things out of your leg.

207
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,700
Or my son had a cleft lip. They had to harvest bone from his hip and put it in his mouth.

208
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,670
So that would have been a secondary. His hip would have been a secondary site.

209
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,990
Now stitch abscesses is what I was talking about with providers.

210
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,980
Obviously an incision is closed with stitches or staples.

211
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:41,920
Sometimes a person will react to the stitches or staples and you will get redness and or maybe just a tiny and it looks like a tiny little pimple,

212
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:51,970
a pustule in one little spot. This is really a sticky abscess because it's right on either the staple or the stitch.

213
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:58,960
Sometimes providers will come right out and say, this is a stitch abscess, but they may still think of it as an infection.

214
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:06,490
We we don't we don't count those as infections. Cellulitis is something else that we do not count.

215
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:11,830
Cellulitis means it's it's red and it looks like something is happening.

216
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:22,209
But there there is no drainage. It's dry. This is very common for providers to see a cellulitis type incision in call.

217
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,080
An infection is hurt, treating it because they're thinking about the patient.

218
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,560
They're thinking something is brewing. We want to get ahead of this.

219
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,560
We are thinking about it from a definitional standpoint.

220
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:42,280
So we do not call those unless it progresses to something that has drainage and pus, stab wounds and pinned sites.

221
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:51,219
If it's not sutured, closed, generally those things don't fit into into kind of our or SSI criteria.

222
00:24:51,220 --> 00:25:00,490
So sometimes there are stab sites where test tubes or things like that are put in and there's a drain.

223
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:06,700
Those do not fall under the SSI umbrella pin site for orthopedic procedures

224
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,330
if they have like a fixation device that they have put on into operatively,

225
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,520
even if those are a little bit red, those usually do not fall under that either.

226
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,760
So, yes, laparoscopic. Laparoscopic.

227
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:27,070
Are those surgical sites? Yes. So even if there's three, because they'll go down will not have black holes.

228
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,350
Yep. Those count. Those will count.

229
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:42,070
And then if you know, you have a site where the surgeon says, oh, it's it feels hot, I'm going to prescribe an antibiotic, do it.

230
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,760
And so it could have progressed but they didn't about it doesn't count.

231
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:51,070
Yeah it correct it does not count so it's is long is.

232
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,200
So if they do prescribe antibiotics and that does actually fix the problem and perhaps it

233
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,529
would have progressed to something with drainage we would not probably have counted that.

234
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:13,360
And that's her being consistent with what you are normally doing is is really important because you are allowed that physician diagnosis option.

235
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:26,440
But if you look at it and it says just read, no drainage, a little bit of heat, it's not technically meeting the definition at that point,

236
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,450
but sometimes you may connect with the provider and they may have other things that they will tell you.

237
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:37,500
And I mean, you can always there is always some leeway with that physician or provider piece,

238
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:42,640
diagnosis piece, but usually that requires a little bit of maybe back and forth with them.

239
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:49,720
I wouldn't just automatically call something because they have said that it's an infection.

240
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,800
Now deep, superficial. You can see it should be very easy to see.

241
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:01,350
It should not go below. Now, this is like an.

242
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,159
These are amazing pictures of the different layers of skin.

243
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:14,940
But when you're thinking about your actual, like arm over here, this is all happening in very close proximity to each other.

244
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,350
So sometimes it's hard to weed out what is happening depending on the case that you're looking at.

245
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:25,860
So deep incisional is below the incision, but above the fascia.

246
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:35,480
So the fascia is like everything is covering the organ space area so it can be in the fashion.

247
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:41,820
But you don't. I'm sorry. It's within the fascia, below the skin, but above the organ space.

248
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:48,720
So it's this very fine little window here that I find deep to be very difficult to call sometimes,

249
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,930
depending on what type of procedure you're you're looking at.

250
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,040
So deep incision. Now we are starting to extend our window here a little bit.

251
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:07,170
Deep infection can occur between 30 and 90 days after the operative procedure, depending on what it is.

252
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:16,440
So there's a list that I'll show you in a second. Again, it's involving the facial and the muscle layers, not the organ space and not just the top.

253
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,940
You can call it based on fragment drainage from the incision.

254
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:31,099
It can spontaneously digest. You guys know what that means? No, that means it breaks open on its own.

255
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,300
So a nice closed incision just kind of opens up and is now.

256
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:49,540
No longer fully closed. So again, it opens up or a provider formally opens it up in either cultures, positive or not culture at all.

257
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:54,580
A culture negative does not meet the criteria. And you do have to have a symptom.

258
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:06,940
You can also call it with an abscess that is identified on imaging or seeing it during OP rehab.

259
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:13,170
You can also have a secondary site and a primary site just like the superficial as well.

260
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:23,770
So that hole like cabbage and leg infection, you can still call a deep on that leg if there were a harvest site infection and organ space.

261
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:32,410
I feel like these are a little bit easier to delineate when you're actually in the organ space because if you're looking at a cardiac surgery,

262
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:35,440
you are you are dealing with the heart at that point.

263
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,150
And that is you're in that chest space within the rib cage.

264
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:48,070
You're dealing with bone. If it's an orthopedic procedure, you're in you're you're deep at that point.

265
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,979
Again, we are 30 to 90 days after the operative procedure.

266
00:29:53,980 --> 00:30:03,280
We need to be below all of those muscle layers into like the body cavity, wherever the organ is or the bone that you have had your operation on.

267
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:07,360
You can still have poor drainage. It's often from a drain.

268
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:18,550
Or they might. It might be from the surgical drain into the space, or they may go in and physically drain it out or if they identify an abscess.

269
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:30,850
Now, this is the tricky one, that if you have not looked at Chapter nine, you will you have to meet these criteria of the organ space.

270
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:37,000
And then you need to go to Chapter nine and look at this giant list of options.

271
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:42,159
And it will it under orthopedics, it will say, is it a joint infection?

272
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,180
Is that a spine infection? Have you guys seen that kind of list?

273
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:57,310
No, I have some in my bag that I can just put my bag over here I can hand out if you guys want to look at me is the definition of standpoint.

274
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,720
Happened that I only met him, but I think he might to share.

275
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:10,010
I did not copy the entire chapter for you, but I think the ones that we might be looking at today, we can have a.

276
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,600
So this is the list of how the time frame for tracking things.

277
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:22,000
So for the most part, most things are going to be 30 day surveillance.

278
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,810
The 90 day surveillance are kind of broken out.

279
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:35,500
So what I would say is if you're looking at something and you can't find it on the 30 or the 90 day, it likely falls under a 30 day window.

280
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:43,480
But like the 90 days or cardiac surgery, spinal fusions, they're big cases that often have implants in them.

281
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:54,190
So we're tracking them for a little bit longer. It used to be we tracked them for a year, but now it's only this one, 90 days surveillance.

282
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:58,000
So, Jackie, did Jackie talk to you about active and passive surveillance a little bit?

283
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,420
Okay. I won't waste too much time on that, but. Yeah, and it was in that video.

284
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,610
Okay, I'll just cruise over that. So it's all in here if you want to look at it again.

285
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:12,150
Did she go over how to calculate? Oh, she wouldn't have calculated this claim.

286
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,969
These are calculated with central line days.

287
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:21,310
So it's per thousand central line days. Surgical procedures is actually a percent.

288
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:28,930
So it's over the total number of procedures for whatever case you're looking at.

289
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,950
So if you're looking at total knee arthroplasty,

290
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:40,209
you've got all the total needs that were done that particular month over time with the number of infections on top,

291
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:45,950
and then it's just multiplied by 100 to 2%. Okay.

292
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,650
And like I said, everything bounces back to the surgical surgical date.

293
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:58,960
So that is sometimes confusing for people to grasp. And when you say 30 days, it's up to including day 30, up to including day 90.

294
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,829
Correct. Yeah. Okay. It's not lessons usually post.

295
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:06,820
So it start you'd start the the surgical day would be like day zero.

296
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:12,939
It's the surgical day when the surgery starts because after some surgeries but I don't know so

297
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:19,780
I would I always have you the surgical day is like day zero and then it's the first day post.

298
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,479
Okay. So, so that's different to because of a hospital acquired infection.

299
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,600
Day one is the day you're admitted to the hospital. Correct.

300
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:32,830
Whereas for this day, one is the day after the procedure?

301
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,059
I think so. You know, maybe I should check on that before I misspeak too much.

302
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:41,020
Let me double check. Yeah, things have changed a little bit over time.

303
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:49,090
One of those two and that level of detail is not something, you know,

304
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:54,910
it's just I think it's a reason because those kind of things make a difference for reporting.

305
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:01,660
Right? If it's less than 30 days or, you know, where you can't be zero if you're one day off.

306
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:02,680
Yeah, right.

307
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:15,130
And obviously, it's hospitals want to have the lowest rates and they do everything they can to try to seek to make sure it really isn't a problem.

308
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:25,780
You will report it. One of my former a chip interns and she had this surgeon where she went in the surgical.

309
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:30,070
So you hear anything the surgeons say that's not effective.

310
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:37,629
It was a very painful experience. Yeah.

311
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,270
And in my head, I'm so used to all we do is COVID.

312
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:46,450
It seems like for the last two years and the date of the event is always day zero four for global exposure.

313
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,960
So I may be confusing myself when I check on that and I'll let you know. Yeah.

314
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:51,760
All right.

315
00:34:52,570 --> 00:35:01,270
There's something else that if you're doing data comparisons now and it just and once upon a time, it used to actually give comparative rates.

316
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:07,420
They do not do that anymore. They give standardized infection ratios for pretty much everything.

317
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:15,700
Yeah. And Jackie, did did you go over all this? Just reiterating the bad and good and this is useful is what you want to know.

318
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,610
Yeah. And this is used for surgical too, so just be aware of that.

319
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:25,540
And we do a lot of discussion of this kind of stuff like looking at a graph together and cover all that.

320
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:32,560
So this is just a very rudimentary looking SSI rate graph.

321
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,979
So even though ASCI hours are what we're benchmarking to,

322
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:43,990
we still report and look at rates and trend things out to see if it looks like something is going on.

323
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:46,959
So if you're looking at a graph like this,

324
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:54,070
you see there's very clearly some spikes here of things going on and then it obviously levels off and is quite, quite low.

325
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:59,680
So there's probably it was an investigation at some point in this time frame, like why are we having so many cases?

326
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:06,040
They would have taken out that giant SSRI. We'll probably gone and done some observations in the operating room,

327
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,719
looked at the cases that were infected to see if there was something obvious that was happening.

328
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,100
And then that would. Help them guide, help guide their observations in the operating room.

329
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:22,360
And ideally a change would have been made, which then results in a lower number of cases afterwards.

330
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:31,350
And this is something similar. But I think what's important about this graph is you solve it.

331
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:35,990
Just because there's a giant spike doesn't necessarily mean there is a problem.

332
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:42,319
I had a graph very similar to this when I was doing transplant cases.

333
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:51,379
They are often very rare. So your denominator is going to be very small and if you have one infection in a very small denominator,

334
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:57,830
you are going to have a very large rate that might look very bad on a graph.

335
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:02,450
And when you look up that, obviously you always still want to look at the patient, look at what's going on with that patient.

336
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:07,370
But that can be one case where that could actually be five cases.

337
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:13,580
So you have to kind of take a look at what you're really dealing with to figure out

338
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:20,810
if this is showing you a problem or if it's just a figment of the data that you have.

339
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:27,940
This is an actual graph from several years ago, which is kind of similar.

340
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,599
It shows you kind of lower numbers back here.

341
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:39,819
And then we very clearly have some sort of cluster that was happening that was all together and quite high that resulted.

342
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:46,090
And this is an orthopedic graph. What ended up coming of this was a stat for a screening problem because you

343
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:50,709
probably will see in the literature that there are a few surgical procedures

344
00:37:50,710 --> 00:38:01,780
and total these are one of them that can often benefit from a staph aureus screening for screening and decolonization program prior to the case.

345
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:08,020
These are big implants and often with bigger implant cases.

346
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:16,690
It's it's very damaging to have an infection when you've got a giant implanted patient because if they have an infection,

347
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:24,879
then you either have to try and manage it around the implant and sometimes whatever it is can make a biofilm on the implant.

348
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,970
That is very difficult for the Doctor Stoneman Group to treat and sometimes they

349
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,740
have to take the implant out and treat the infection and put it back in once,

350
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:44,710
once the patient is has recuperated. So anything that we can do to prevent infections, especially in implant groups, is really important.

351
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:51,340
All right. So these are some case studies. How long did you or you?

352
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:55,060
1133 or 15 minutes or. Oh, no, we have more time.

353
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,660
Okay. We have some time. We have to like 1145.

354
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,130
Okay. Just want to make sure I wasn't rambling too far.

355
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:11,230
Not at all. Okay. So these are some case studies like you just do what you hacking.

356
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:17,140
All right. So first we have June 18th.

357
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,480
Larry had a colon surgery on the 23rd.

358
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,990
Larry comes back to the emergency department with concern for infection.

359
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,580
The physician notes that the abdominal incision has poor drainage.

360
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,050
Slight erythema. Do you know what erythema is? Yes.

361
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:40,020
It's redness and in duration, which means it looks like it's it's kind of popping out.

362
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,950
The incision is intact. Which means what? It's an open or close?

363
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:54,209
Close. Closed wound. Drainage, however, is sent for culture, and antibiotics were started on June 26.

364
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:57,720
The culture comes back for intro back there around.

365
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,400
So what do we think that we are dealing with? I can flip to the next slide.

366
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,690
Yeah, I think I think the answer is on the next slide.

367
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,790
What do we think? Do we think we are so we have something that we can see.

368
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,959
The incision is intact. We do have some.

369
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:23,360
What? What were some key words that you noticed in here? Drainage, um.

370
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,170
Redness. And we have. What did we. They cultured.

371
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:31,730
And what did did we grow something? Yes.

372
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,420
So do we think we are meeting together?

373
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:43,380
Do we think we are meeting criteria? Are we within a 30 day window of the surgical procedure?

374
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:48,810
Yes. So that that's okay. We have some pus.

375
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,800
We have a positive culture. So which definitions of that you think we're meeting?

376
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:59,010
Superficial. Superficial. Let's hope we're right.

377
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:10,500
Now, I should show me this. So, yes, we have a superficial incision that is in the primary location of the colon site.

378
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,680
All right. Case two mole undergoes a hernia repair.

379
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:20,759
He is has a known positive mercy screening test.

380
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:29,819
So in case those words seem confusing to you, certain patients, if they're in the hospital,

381
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,660
might be have a nasal positive and these will screened for MRSA.

382
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,649
So that means and obviously you probably know this already,

383
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:44,970
but then there is a great place for Mersa to hang out and that's usually where they culture to see if you're colonized.

384
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:50,120
So obviously this gentleman is a known colonized mersa.

385
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:56,459
Patient does not say that he was decolonized. It just says he's got this screen they just heard.

386
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:06,390
Somehow in the 16th he readmitted with a red angry wound that is opened to the facial level by the surgeon and is cultured.

387
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,430
On April 1st, the culture results return, not surprisingly, for MRSA.

388
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:21,120
So this is kind of his case here. Are we still within our 30 day time frame post procedure?

389
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:29,129
Yes. Yes. So tell me about what you've what you think are the key words here from the bones.

390
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:34,100
So I think it's on here. A red, angry, angry wound.

391
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:39,810
So sometimes there are interesting descriptors for the way wounds look.

392
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:47,070
Even if I'm your definition, you have certain words like in duration, erythema, permanence.

393
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:50,700
Those may not be the magic words that you actually see in the chart.

394
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:56,280
So you sometimes have to use your judgment in trying to kind of understand what they are telling you.

395
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:08,280
Red angry wound sounds like era of FEMA that is perhaps indicated in some fashion and the provider opened it to the facial level.

396
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,630
So it sounds like the fascia is intact. So what level do we think we're at?

397
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:24,310
What level has to go below with the fashion involved the fashion and be below the deep.

398
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:31,790
So it sounds like the fascia is intact here. So I would aim for maybe fashion.

399
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:39,850
Yes. So I am going to say this is a superficial incision, all primary infection.

400
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:47,910
Curly. Now, what were we watching when we first made these cases?

401
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:52,260
Right. Hurley underwent a coronary artery.

402
00:43:52,530 --> 00:44:00,360
When I do mine, the last time I did a bunch of cases, which actually I think someone else is presenting my lecture later on.

403
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:03,690
It was all Walking Dead character, Sophie Still Walking Dead characters.

404
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:07,410
That's my old cousin, Oklahoma.

405
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:13,230
Yeah. Curly undergoes coronary artery bypass grafting.

406
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:17,850
A vein is harvested from his leg to be used as a graft.

407
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:21,810
The surgery is successful and the patient is discharged on the 30th.

408
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:28,680
Now, in June, Curly is readmitted with fever and prevalent drainage oozing from his leg incision.

409
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,440
Cultures are collected and antibiotics are started.

410
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,750
On the fifth, the cultures returned positive for quake negative staph, which you learn from Jackie, is a.

411
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:43,100
Common Council, but it doesn't mean that for surgical purposes.

412
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,560
Okay. So what do we think is going on with Curly?

413
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:52,990
We have we are still within 30 days, right.

414
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:01,459
Of the surgical procedure. And give me a really important word that will immediately cross this lake.

415
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:07,910
Chalk this up as an infection prevalence prevalent drainage from the incision.

416
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:09,900
So right away.

417
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:17,750
Generally, if you see the word pus are lines that should immediately flag you that you're probably going to have to call it something is long.

418
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:23,450
Is it fits within the criteria of the timing based on what you're working with in this?

419
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,700
This works fine. But what kind of superficial infection is this?

420
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:42,410
Secondary. Excellent. Before Mini now undergoes a lumpectomy with lymphoma lymph node biopsy at an ambulatory surgery center.

421
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:48,770
Also, do not get distracted by some of the detail because sometimes there's extra detail in here trying to trip you up for some reason.

422
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,060
So focus on the words that you know you need to be looking for.

423
00:45:54,020 --> 00:46:01,700
So she wanted underwent a breast lump act to me and she that means generally an ambulatory

424
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,410
care patient is someone who's who's pretty healthy doesn't have underlying conditions.

425
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:14,120
So just from a thinking through what your patient is like standpoint and they don't generally require hospitalization,

426
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:18,359
they just they just go home on the 15 five days later mini context,

427
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:25,100
the clinic saying she's got redness and tenderness at her incision site on the 16th of the next day.

428
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:34,219
Her incision is clean without drainage. Some slight erythema is noted, diagnosed with cellulitis and still prescribe antibiotics.

429
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:39,049
But no cultures are collected. So what do we think is happening here?

430
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:42,380
Are we still within 30 days for many? Yes.

431
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:47,630
Tell me about tell me the things that you think are important about her incision.

432
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:54,799
No drainage. There's no drainage. Sometimes it's just redness within her, calling it cellulitis.

433
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:04,550
And it is not. Don't get too fixated on the administration of antibiotics because it is very common for anything

434
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:09,800
that a provider is concerned about that has redness to still result in antibiotics being prescribed.

435
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:15,320
All right. So what do we what do we think we've got going on here?

436
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:20,059
It sounds like we are calling it cellulitis.

437
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:23,180
Which means what? Yes or no? No, no, no. Correct.

438
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:29,889
You do not meet criteria at this point. All right, Mickey.

439
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:42,870
Now on the 10th is having a total knee replacement surgery or a total knee arthroplasty is what the booked name would be on the 13th of October.

440
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:46,840
Mickey comes to the Ed complaining of pain and swelling in that knee.

441
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,190
He has an ultrasound showing a fluid collection within the joints.

442
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:56,590
Two fluid specimens for culture are obtained by needle aspiration.

443
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,030
On the 15th, everything returns for positive for staph aureus aureus.

444
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:09,550
So tell me on that list of 30 in 90 days, how many days would we track a total knee?

445
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:15,180
90. So are we still within the window where we can evaluate this?

446
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:19,610
Yes, we are. Okay, so now we need to look.

447
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:24,000
Which which definition do you think we should be looking at here?

448
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:31,070
We have now an ultrasound showing a fluid collection within the joint.

449
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:34,140
So where are we at in incisional level now?

450
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:42,090
Are we the deep? Probably not, because we are within the the joint at this point.

451
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,210
So that requires looking at the organ space definition.

452
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:51,420
So on the organs based definition, are we meeting criteria to call that?

453
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:58,600
Tell me what you see. That you see. I'm coming back to my list.

454
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,069
All right. So we know we're in the August base.

455
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:10,150
Do we have perennial drainage from a drain? Kind of.

456
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:20,379
They actually went in and via needle aspiration aspirated fluid out of the joint.

457
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:25,209
So that can count as a drain that is placed into the organ space.

458
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:34,480
But you could probably also meet the organisms isolated from that are being a skeptically obtained piece of the definition as well.

459
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:41,500
So I would say, yes, we are meeting the organ space definition and we're not covering that in this particular case.

460
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,970
But then the next step is going into those Chapter nine definitions to see,

461
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,260
because we can we can't formally call yet until we look at those Chapter nine.

462
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:56,110
So there's one later on that we'll do I'll get you to give you a freebie right now.

463
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:01,350
So right now we are going to call it organ space.

464
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:10,900
And then we would have to look at those. Chapter Nine's In. There is actually a name on there that's called a prosthetic joint infection.

465
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:21,070
So you would probably include you in to look at that. And that is what we would need to look at next to see if it is meeting that criteria.

466
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,970
All right. K6 Donald undergoes and excision of a mass on his left foot.

467
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:31,900
Donald calls his surgeon on November 1st.

468
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:34,180
So we're dealing with a mass excision.

469
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:44,110
He calls in November, complaining about penis foot, that he has clarity that the patient is expressing cloudy fluid from the incision site.

470
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:57,280
One thing we universally across every one of my department agree upon is you never take a patient's word for pus coming from the incision site.

471
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:04,730
Always make sure it's a clinical provider. So if they send in a picture in, the provider says Yes, that looks like us.

472
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:13,590
There are a strange number of things that are very normal that might look to ET, to us, who are not clinicians like us,

473
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:22,680
but to a provider, they'll say, Oh, that's, that's lymph fluid or that's granulation tissue.

474
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,520
That's completely normal.

475
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:34,030
So in the clinic, though, they diagnose the patient with a superficial wound infection and place them on antibiotics and they collect no cultures.

476
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:45,530
Tell me what you think about this case. It's a mass, an excision of a mass from a foot.

477
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:49,300
Do we see that on our 90 day surveillance list?

478
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:53,850
Because we are most definitely beyond 30 days at this point.

479
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:03,630
Is that on our 90 day list? Then it's likely on our 30 day list, correct?

480
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:10,230
I don't even know if mass excision is on the third day. So if it's not on your 90 day list, it's going to bump into the 30 day category.

481
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:15,180
So can we do anything with this?

482
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:19,740
We can at it very likely might be an infection,

483
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:27,660
but we we are outside our window that we can actually do something about it from a surveillance definition standpoint.

484
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:36,560
All right. Now, Daisy is having a bilateral breast reduction surgery on November 5th, on the 20th.

485
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:42,920
She comes to the E.R. complaining of fever and that her left breast incision has opened

486
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,500
with another word that you might see in a patient's chart about her wound opening.

487
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:53,629
You remember the essence of her, the E.D. notes.

488
00:52:53,630 --> 00:53:00,530
Her, of course, is right here. Her incision has spontaneously deiced and foul smelling, prevalent drainage is noted.

489
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:09,080
So they actually the word pregnant is actually in here. But you will often see that listed as foul smelling drainage,

490
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:15,620
and that will usually equal some sort of prevalence, even if they're not coming right out and saying it.

491
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:25,310
No cultures are taken, but antibiotics are started. So how are we doing with time?

492
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:31,160
She is still within 30 days, correct? Yes.

493
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:36,049
Her incision has now. So now we're now we're getting a little more complicated.

494
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:40,760
Her incision has decreased. So what definition do you feel like you should look at first?

495
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:47,870
Which definition has the wound has deepest and opened up into the deep one?

496
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:54,079
So let's take a peek at RDF and see if Rosie is meeting it.

497
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:57,350
So it's opened with presence.

498
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:04,210
But I believe for deep fun you need a symptom.

499
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:09,760
Correct? Sorry. I should have put little stickies on these pages.

500
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:23,650
And she has a fever. So our deep has we do have brilliant drainage from a deep incision, so we could call it off of that.

501
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:33,010
But we also have deep incision spontaneously. De Hess's is cultured and is positive, and she has a symptom which includes a fever.

502
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:38,530
So we should be able to call this a deep incision or primary.

503
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:46,900
Okay. So these next ones, you're going to want to take a look at your Chapter nine stuff that I gave you.

504
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:51,440
These are what we try a couple of these so I don't take up too much of your time.

505
00:54:53,570 --> 00:55:01,730
Okay. So most of these are organ space in nature and it's giving into looking across

506
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:09,290
at the organ space as well as the next level in these Chapter nine definitions.

507
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:19,820
So we have a 42 year old female who admitted on May 23rd for abnormal uterine bleeding, she underwent a laparoscopic total hysterectomy.

508
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:27,559
The patient was discharged without complications on the 4th of June, a patient called with severe abdominal pain,

509
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:32,420
no bowel movements and surgery and a full feeling bladder on the fifth.

510
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,190
The patients can't call back, say they went to an outside emergency department with a fever,

511
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:45,260
had a city that was unremarkable, but still experiencing severe contraction like pain.

512
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:51,990
Now on the ninth. So we've got like kind of a grouping of days here.

513
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:59,040
The patient comes back to the ED with a bowling ball feeling in her pelvis, still has a fever,

514
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:08,730
new onset of pink vaginal discharge, speculum exam and revealed intact vaginal cuff with purulent drainage.

515
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:18,120
The drainage was sent in as positive for E coli on the 10th interventional radiology aspirated fluid from and had nasal mass,

516
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:24,330
which is a uterine type mass that was positive for E.coli.

517
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:33,660
So if we're just looking at the information on this first page through the fifth, it definitely sounds like something is going on.

518
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:38,070
But do we have anything that we can really point out yet? No.

519
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,560
And then on the ninth when she starts coming in.

520
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:47,430
So the only thing we had previously was that she had a fever and that was the only thing that we could hang our hat on at that point.

521
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:54,570
Now she's got some discharge, but it's painkillers that would probably mean it's bloody in some fashion.

522
00:56:55,950 --> 00:57:03,600
And then they they mention pregnant drainage from her vaginal exam that was positive for E coli.

523
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:10,590
So let's look real quick at the organs based definition to make sure we've hit all of our criteria.

524
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:21,719
So these are also these Chapter nine definitions are also the same and definitions that I don't think Jackie went into too many complicated ones,

525
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:26,810
but you will have to use some of these to rule out secondary bloodstream infections as well.

526
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,910
So it's one massive set.

527
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:38,100
These are not surgery specific, I guess, is what I'm saying. You need to use them to call organ space, but you can use them for class C work as well.

528
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,970
Okay. So we are within the right timeframe for our hysterectomy, correct.

529
00:57:45,660 --> 00:58:00,600
The infection is in the deeper area. So we are in the patient's pelvis in seeing a mass that is up near the uterus, which is not superficial anymore.

530
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:06,060
We are up near an organ space, so I think we are definitely in the organ space.

531
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:10,050
And now what definition from Chapter nine do you think we should be looking at?

532
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:13,590
Have you found one that looks like.

533
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:30,470
What was that that you just said correct to your point 25 So we couldn't use that one for the new project because because of the pension plan,

534
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:40,410
that is ultimately what the answer is. I was actually going to look at what so under the EP, so you're in definitely in the right category.

535
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,479
Patient has an organs identified from tissue from the affected site.

536
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,800
So that would meet that as well.

537
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:56,700
But then knowing that there is a specific vaginal cuff infection break out,

538
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:03,719
if you have something that is more specific, that is the one that you're going to want to try and meet.

539
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:13,740
So if we know that we are in the vaginal area and we have a presence from the vaginal cuff,

540
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:18,120
it is likely that that is the definition that we want to be looking at.

541
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:22,769
So if you're in that area and it's not specifically from the vaginal cuff,

542
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:26,730
then this or epi is definitely the one that you're going to want to be working with.

543
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:34,500
But good job, both of you. Complicated vaginal cuff infection.

544
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:40,420
Okay. Let's do. Do we have time for one more? Sure. Okay.

545
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:46,120
So 59 year old male admitted on the 11th October 11 for ongoing abdominal pain.

546
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:53,920
He has a seat that shows signs of obstruction and a colectomy was recommended to be on October 12th.

547
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:59,310
Remainder of the hospital stay was unremarkable. Patient discharged home with no concerns.

548
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:05,890
They call back more than 12 days later on the 25th, reporting abdominal pain and cramping.

549
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:17,650
No issues with the incision. So on the 26th, they actually do A.C.T. that shows pre peritoneal fluid collection and the recommended admission,

550
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:26,020
the 2736, a pregnant fluid was aspirated from this space and sent for culture.

551
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:31,870
So the culture did grow streptococcus inguinal.

552
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:39,640
So do you have any this this is actually I didn't mean to do that.

553
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:45,090
I thought there was another slide of detail. Sorry.

554
01:00:45,100 --> 01:01:00,400
Get that bag. Okay, so this was a complicated one because the peritoneal space typically is one that you will look at from an organ space perspective.

555
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:12,810
But the pre peritoneal space, you just make sure the pre peritoneal space is actually within the fascia.

556
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:18,810
If you look it up in I actually had to look it up because I have never seen this word used before.

557
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:20,590
So this is most definitely a tricky one.

558
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:35,680
So this is getting at point a deep infection, even though you feel like you are looking at a, um, an organ space piece.

559
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:43,869
So there are, I think, two or three more that if you guys want to kind of peruse these,

560
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:50,559
but it's again going through the practice of getting through the organ space

561
01:01:50,560 --> 01:02:00,260
piece and then looking at these Chapter nine specific locations and then go.

562
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:03,040
So it's a lot more work because you have to meet both sets.

563
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:10,540
You can meet the organ space, but then if you can't meet the specific, but I think that's what we're getting at with that other reproductive one.

564
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:14,470
Like let's say we couldn't meet the vaginal cuff definition.

565
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:19,330
We could very clearly meet that or epi definition.

566
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:20,140
So you can always.

567
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:26,950
Usually there is a little bit more of a vague one that if you can clearly get through organ space, there's something that you can manage.

568
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:36,230
But sometimes it requires you going through in reading and tapping on other other things to see what kind of criteria you can meet.

569
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:42,760
So it's it's definitely a little bit complicated. I think that I think that was everything.

570
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:50,220
You guys have other questions about exercise. So I have a question for you guys.

571
01:02:50,230 --> 01:03:04,200
So what's different about exercise? And plenty of these are devices associated with our devices necessarily.

572
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:09,899
And, you know, for the man, I can't hear you. Well, I was in classes or devices last year in person.

573
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:13,170
Were that device part. Yeah. So that's one difference.

574
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:17,610
What, what from a reporting standpoint, what, what stuck out to you, what was different about it?

575
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:26,070
Yeah, I think the length of time to report something more like 90 days, whereas, you know, practice really 2 to 3 days.

576
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:30,659
Yeah. So, so the, the window, the window was quite a bit different.

577
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:35,940
Right. What about was there something else about the timing that was different?

578
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:42,950
You don't go before the surgery like you would like a cleansing.

579
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:49,880
Right. So day one was different. Right. So you have a much larger window and you have a different starting point.

580
01:03:56,100 --> 01:04:01,140
And, uh, which which one was more common?

581
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:16,910
That's as far as you can. That's as precise and duty as the two most common husband co-infections.

582
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:20,950
I think Cody or you guys are probably still working women.

583
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:25,389
No, I mean. Yeah. Yeah. You think? Yeah, I was thinking about that.

584
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:29,860
I'm like, I wonder which one? Because those are the two I used to do. The Cody presented the two.

585
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:33,030
Right. Because that's within the Cody is it's one of the most common.

586
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:39,610
So what I was thinking, which is the most common? Would it be urinary tract infections?

587
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:45,430
Probably more so than Cody. But then when you're looking at urinary tract infections and exercise and probably be.

588
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:54,879
Yeah, I mean as we've changed the definition, you know, for for Cody last five years for I mean for for I know for Cody,

589
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,930
but for urinary tract infections, we think those are still quite as common as they used to be.

590
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:05,040
Urinary tract infections. I mean, that worries about colonies, not so much about.

591
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:08,260
Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's my thing.

592
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:16,360
But I mean, you know, if you just like if you look around and there and you don't get up enough or walk around, we'll find bacteria in your bladder.

593
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:20,769
But it may not mean anything. Yeah. Especially within the home screens anymore.

594
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:23,980
But when you do have prevalent screens, it's like 10%.

595
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:28,180
It's like, what are you single but you don't do anything with it.

596
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:33,460
Yeah, well, thank you. That was really an interesting question.

597
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,010
This is more complicated to.

598
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:43,540
Well, I think it's mean doing it the clubs in the SSA in the same way because you're just getting your feet wet with clams.

599
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:48,910
And I was really impressed that you guys were picking up on some of the nuance of that.

600
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:53,950
And then the three completely are something completely different on the same day.

601
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:59,700
So sorry about that. No. Well, we really appreciate you coming.

602
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:06,670
Let's begin for Hal. Thank you. So sorry.

603
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:14,470
I think everybody did it. Thank you for your confidentiality, for uploading so or email me.

604
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:21,110
Um, and other than that, I.
