1
00:00:00,598 --> 00:00:08,744
If you'd like to have your grades held instead of automatically posting for students, you can set a course grade posting policy.

2
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:20,650
click the grade book settings icon and navigate to the grade posting policy tab.

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,270
The default is that all grades automatically post to students once they're entered.

4
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:32,710
Switching to manually post grades will hold or mute, as it was called before all assignments.

5
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:38,770
While you're in the settings, you might also want to look at the late policies and the advanced tab,

6
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,780
which now offers an option to instructors to override a final grade.

7
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:55,020
Make your selection and click update. Once you've finished grading each assignment, you'll come back and post the grades,

8
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:02,760
which will allow your students to see their grade for that assignment. You can also post the grades from the speed greater view.
