Hello.

2
00:00:06,316 --> 00:00:11,090
Today's lecture is a discussion of
measures of association and regression.

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,430
It is companion to a previous lecture
in which we talked about computation

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,640
of Pearson's Correlation Coefficient.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,443
In this lecture,

6
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:23,648
we will talk about limitations of
Pearson's Correlation Coefficient.

7
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:28,162
Recall that how we compute Pearson's
Correlation Coefficient is driven by

8
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:30,065
the distance of each subjects or

9
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:34,260
observations from
the corresponding sample means.

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,631
If one subject has an unusually
large value of x and or y,

11
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:40,590
we call these outliers.

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,012
And they will largely influence the value
of my Pearson's Correlation Coefficient.

13
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:51,289
Returning to our previous example of
firearm ownership and male suicide rates,

14
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:55,478
I have highlighted in red one of
the states that has a value for y,

15
00:00:55,478 --> 00:01:00,760
the number of firearms male suicides,
that is larger than most of the data.

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,400
We will consider this observation
to be outlying in it's y-value.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,440
I've also highlighted three states
that have outlying values for

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,840
their x-values, or
the percent of firearm ownership.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,880
We could take these three observations and

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,900
we could move them downward,
away from the sample mean.

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,170
And this would produce
a correlation coefficient of 0.48.

22
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,920
The previous correlation coefficient
was 0.84, which was much higher.

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,803
So we can see that moving these
observations led to a much weaker

24
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:35,760
association.

25
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,360
The line that we saw
earlier is not as obvious.

26
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,680
Another possible extreme example
is a situation like the following.

27
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,500
These data have a Pearson's
Correlation Coefficient of 0.35.

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,340
However, visually,
the positive trend that we see in the data

29
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,130
is mostly done by these two points.

30
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,230
If we were to remove these
two points from our plot,

31
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,730
the Correlation Coefficient
would drop to almost zero.

32
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,760
It is 0.07, and is much weaker.

33
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,660
And visually, we can now see that there
is no obvious linear trend in the data

34
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,770
like there was before.

35
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,950
Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient
was completely driven

36
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,620
by these two points in my data.

37
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,110
Another example is presented in this plot.

38
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,890
Pearson's Correlation Coefficient,

39
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,600
computed from these data, gives me
essentially the conclusion that there is

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,670
no association between firearm
ownership and suicides.

41
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,780
However, we can see visually that there
is obviously a very strong association

42
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,200
between these two quantities.

43
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,190
Pearson's Correlation Coefficient would
fail to pick up this obvious strong

44
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:50,240
pattern because, as was stated earlier,
Pearson's Correlation Coefficient

45
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,630
is a measure of linear association,
how well x and y fit on a straight line.

46
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,610
These observations do not fit
at all on a straight line, yet

47
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,700
they still have a very strong
relationship to each other.

48
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,960
In fact,
they have a quadratic relationship.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,530
Therefore, to emphasis again, you should
always plot the data with a scatter plot,

50
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,010
and it should be examined prior
to computing correlation.

51
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,862
If the pattern and
the data looks distinctly non-linear,

52
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:22,770
then you should use other
measures of association.

53
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,270
Also, Pearson's Correlation Coefficient
is useful for

54
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:30,430
looking at the association
of two continuous measures.

55
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,235
If one or
both of your measures is not continuous,

56
00:03:33,235 --> 00:03:37,150
then you should consider other
measures of association.
