1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:15,260
Somebody. All right.

2
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:22,610
Good morning, everyone. Great to see you all. Wow. So last week in classes, both a little bit exciting and almost scary, right?

3
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,070
All right. So a couple of quick announcements before we start.

4
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,410
Actually, mostly one main announcement and then I'll offer up any questions.

5
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:41,209
You probably already been invited, not just in this class, but in all your classes to complete a course evaluation, give a quick nod or.

6
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,490
Andreas? Yeah, this sounds familiar. Okay. I recognize that many of you, not all of you.

7
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:52,549
This is your first semester at Michigan, so I'm not sure how well addressed it is in your other classes.

8
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:58,880
So I usually try to just make a quick mention of the process just for everyone's assurance.

9
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:05,330
It's completely anonymous. Okay, so that in all your classes, when you complete the evaluation,

10
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:14,150
it's not available to the instructor of the course to see the results until after all of the grade.

11
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,140
The final grades for the course have been submitted. And even then, it still remains anonymous, right?

12
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:27,290
Your identity, the scores, comments, whatever it is that you that you submitted are not tied to you specifically.

13
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:34,430
But I just wanted to make sure that everyone, you know, fully understood that process are specific to this class.

14
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:41,989
I think in all classes. But I can say as an instructor that I really value those evaluations, you know,

15
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:47,120
both where you think the course can be approved, as well as comments along the lines of,

16
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:58,310
hey, this, this works great, or I really enjoyed this component, etc., because we have a participation component of our our formal course grade.

17
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:07,280
I can actually offer up an extra point in that participation category to everyone if we achieve a certain bar.

18
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,970
So I don't because it's all anonymous.

19
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,600
I don't know who has completed their course evaluation or not.

20
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:24,410
All I can see is like a tally of the total. So there are 23 enrolled, so I can see how many have completed if we had 90% completion.

21
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,910
I can give everyone in the class an additional point in their participation.

22
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:38,360
So go team in that regard. Any any questions about the the course evaluations process, etc.?

23
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,860
I know it's been open for at least a few days. I expect it's open until at least the end of the week.

24
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,040
Do they actually give you a deadline? Do they tell you how long you have to complete it?

25
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,250
Sound familiar to me. But I don't know what it is either.

26
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,960
11th. The 11th. Okay. So that's Sunday.

27
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,270
Okay. So, yeah, so you have until the end of this week to get those in.

28
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,240
And again, not not just for this class, for other classes.

29
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:16,660
I know a lot of instructors really use the feedback to help them for future offerings of the course to make improvements or whatnot.

30
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:28,870
Any questions about anything else unrelated to those courses until they've finishing up the semester?

31
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,090
Sure. All right. With that, let's go ahead and jump into material.

32
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,870
We'll follow the same format that you did last part three. I'll give you kind of a short lecture.

33
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:49,410
We will watch a short video and and then we'll make sure to leave plenty of time for our next round of class debates.

34
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,800
Okay.

35
00:03:51,130 --> 00:04:00,430
So continuing on this theme of topics that didn't easily kind of fit into the structure and the early part of the semester that are important to that.

36
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,130
We want to make sure we cover some or at least touch on some of them.

37
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:09,700
We're going to jump into some kind of remaining environmental quality issues that are out there that we haven't talked a lot about.

38
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,770
I know Professor Gee talked a little bit about water and health.

39
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:20,560
We'll talk specifically around surface water and groundwater and some of the tie

40
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,720
ins with policy and regulation and also soil importantly with contaminated sites.

41
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,989
It was touched on a little bit, right, in both debate teams and the urban farming debate topic.

42
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:40,540
Right. This is one of the issues or considerations is, you know, residual contamination of site from industry.

43
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,979
So let's talk about a little bit today. All right.

44
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:52,240
So our goals in terms of learning objectives is to understand, again, we introduced all of these regulatory bodies.

45
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,700
We'll talk specifically about how they're overseen in these particular areas around

46
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,970
fish advisories and also for cleanups of generally large contaminated sites.

47
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:15,520
And then touch on some of the examples of challenges that remain right forward for communities and again, especially in large urban industrial areas.

48
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:24,280
And a lot of this course and I kind of give you a heads up early in the semester, a lot of it's kind of tough, uh, negative, right?

49
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,590
Depressing because we have all these challenges in front of us, but we are making headway.

50
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:39,339
And so we'll finish with a video that was a pretty big bite, uh, in terms of, to take on as a task that was pretty successful.

51
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,110
So we can watch that at the end. All right.

52
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,790
So with regards to fish advisories, right.

53
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:57,250
So these are contaminants that work their way into the surface waters, whether it's rivers, lakes, streams, etc.

54
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:08,110
Since 1993, the EPA has made available this NDA on fish advisories and safe eating guidelines.

55
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,979
They're really like the shout out to Dr. Seuss over here.

56
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:20,650
Very clever. Um, and these include, you know, recommended levels of consumption, right, for fish that are caught in local waters.

57
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,410
And these advisories give advice on how to limit or even completely avoid

58
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,840
eating certain fish due to contamination from from various chemical readings.

59
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,180
Looking at some data, some statistics here.

60
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:48,470
This is kind of a trend of consumption advisories and it's listed as a percentage of total lake acres and river miles.

61
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:56,690
Right. So going over the course of a couple of decades. Lake Acres is in the lighter blue color river miles and the darker color.

62
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,070
And then here are just a percentage of national totals.

63
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,040
And it was increasing, increasing, increasing and increasing up until about 2008.

64
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,820
And then it kind of leveled off going forward.

65
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:20,510
So, you know, 40% of our total lake acres and river miles are under fish consumption advisories.

66
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,110
So that's worthwhile of note. What about this trend?

67
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,530
What is what's going on here?

68
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:38,450
Is this an indication that our the quality of our waters and the contaminant levels in the fish continued to basically increase from 1993 to 2008?

69
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,160
Kate is shaking her head, no. What you folks think is going on here?

70
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:56,880
Whenever it was the fish advisory started in 93. Right. So probably like just better technology and more testing.

71
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:03,940
Yeah, absolutely. So much more widespread monitoring and assessment and even identifying.

72
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:10,860
Right. Where are the issues, where are the problems? Where do those advisories then need to be listed and put into place?

73
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:18,270
So yeah, so this was a lot of improvements and in building a knowledge base for that time period.

74
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,469
A few different ways to look at this.

75
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:30,840
Here we are looking at a map and then again, just some numbers around the number of waterbodies where advisories are present.

76
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:46,290
Again, about this at 40 ish percent of Lake Akers River Miles, coastal waters, all of the Great Lakes are under some sort of advisory.

77
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:55,680
And then if we start to break it down by pollutant. Right. So they're actually it's not just an advisory across the board.

78
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,990
It's fine pollutant that is present in the fish.

79
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,060
So this one breaks it down.

80
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:14,050
So 94, this is going back to 2000 1194 of all advisories in effect were due to five bio accumulative chemicals, mercury, PCBs, chlorine and DDT.

81
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:19,870
If you look at it over here again, here's Lake Acres under advisory on the bottom.

82
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:28,420
These bars that are probably too small to see is applying them each by year from 1993 going forward.

83
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,830
And then they're grouped. So here's mercury, here's PCBs, etc.

84
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:40,720
And as you can see, it's mercury, right? That's the biggest driver in terms of Lake Acre is affected under advisory.

85
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:52,270
So most of when it says that 40% of our our river miles and lake acres are under advisory because of some sort of chemical contamination,

86
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,260
it's primarily driven by mercury. Mercury is that widespread.

87
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:04,360
It's truly a global pollutant. It's not just localized effects from its emissions and contamination.

88
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,870
And then here this is kind of looking at a map again, but specific to mercury,

89
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:18,230
right where there are advisories in place for specific water waterbodies, where there are statewide advisories.

90
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:29,510
And again, it's it's pretty much the entire U.S. aside from Hawaii, in which case there are coastal advisories.

91
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,190
All right. So with regards to fish consumption advisories, how are they actually implemented?

92
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,290
How does this work in the real world? And we have various federal agencies.

93
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,650
Right. Which in some cases is a problem.

94
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,229
We've talked about examples earlier in the class about how there's even conflicting information or conflicting policies.

95
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,520
Right. In this case, it actually works pretty well.

96
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,020
There are numerous opportunities for people to become informed about these.

97
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,950
So we talked about the EPA. Right.

98
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:13,950
And they are putting out this guidance maybe aimed at people that that fish that are catching their own fish with the intent to consume the fish.

99
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,800
So there's information that goes out with instructions and guidance on what type of fish

100
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,260
and from where should you be either limiting or staying away from in terms of consumption.

101
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:35,940
The CDC also coordinates with agencies to put out useful information as long as the FDA.

102
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:46,020
So this might actually look like, yeah, if you're a sport fisherman and you're going out to catch fish to consume or for example,

103
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,370
you're a mom to be and you're in the doctor's office.

104
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:56,609
Right. And you're getting information not because you're catching your fish, but because you're going to go to the market to buy this.

105
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:06,239
Right. Or to plan your meals. And so to know a while pregnant or even of childbearing age or nursing, you know,

106
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,670
what are the advisories and guidance in terms of the types of fish, how often you should eat the fish and so forth?

107
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:19,280
All right. Shifting gears a little bit to clean ups and this is a big deal.

108
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,850
We'll talk about a couple of different examples of it. But again,

109
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:31,069
this is still in the wheelhouse of the EPA for both conducting and supervising investigations

110
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:36,139
and cleanup actions at sites where oil unfortunately ends up being a big one.

111
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,490
Right. We talk about our consumption of fossil fuels and emissions.

112
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,240
We talked about air pollution. Right. We talked about greenhouse gas and climate change.

113
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,400
Just accidents that happen. Right.

114
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:57,350
And release of whether it's crude oil or refined oil, um, throughout all different types of environments and ecosystems.

115
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:03,800
In terms of the cleanup activities they can take place at abandoned waste sites.

116
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,650
This is unfortunately a common one. There was an industrial use.

117
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,580
The company packed up, went bankrupt, whatever it is.

118
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:16,830
And now it's an abandoned site. A lot of waste federal facilities.

119
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,040
We'll talk about some examples of those properties.

120
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:26,070
We've talked in class about military bases and people and so forth.

121
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:36,990
And then EPA will often coordinate with other federal agencies with state, usually department of environmental quality,

122
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,979
something like that, or departments of Community Health, a different municipality.

123
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:47,700
So at a very local level, you know, as well as the company or response or party that's responsible for the contamination.

124
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:54,390
And then cleanup can also include a provision for how to reuse.

125
00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:00,960
Right. It's not just clean it up, but what's the what's the ultimate goal to reuse that site or to redevelop it?

126
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,910
There are a numerous cleanup programs under EPA's purview.

127
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:15,650
One that we've talked about in classes is Superfund. So this is for large and again, often abandoned hazardous waste sites.

128
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,479
There's federal facilities, clean up, brownfields, cleanup.

129
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,600
We'll talk about a couple of examples of brownfields here in a few minutes.

130
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,280
Underground storage tanks are a specific issue that are, again, under EPA purview.

131
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,240
We talked about RCA Ray earlier in this semester.

132
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:43,190
Cleaning up oil spills is unfortunately not a new problem, but continues to be a problem.

133
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,019
And then for cleaning up air pollutants as well. All right.

134
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,920
So let's step through a couple of them, starting with the first one.

135
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:59,320
So this program started in 1984 with the goal to promulgate in the first place.

136
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:11,930
Gregory testified that investigate and then clean up hazardous waste and oversees long term remedial cleanups at sites

137
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:21,520
that are listed based on national priorities and also does short term cleanups and responses kind of emergency response.

138
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:27,379
The chemical level and the Superfund cleanup starts right when anyone discovers or

139
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,960
reports a waste site or the possible release of these material and compiles a database.

140
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,030
So a couple of examples of what that might look like, trying to stay a little bit local here.

141
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,360
This is going back about a decade or so in July of 2010.

142
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:54,140
So Ann Arbor is not on this map. But if you go a little bit to the west and this was the interstate, I think this is I-94 here.

143
00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:01,340
Right. So in 84, it goes through Ann Arbor. If you go west, eventually you get Kalamazoo for maybe an hour.

144
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,900
A little over an hour and a half, maybe.

145
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:15,530
And there was an Enbridge energy pipeline that ruptured during this time period, and the Kalamazoo spilled into the Kalamazoo River.

146
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,710
And the concern was that the Kalamazoo.

147
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,990
Well, there's a local concern, of course, for the local area.

148
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:30,650
But a larger, broader concern is that the Kalamazoo River is a tributary to Lake Michigan.

149
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:38,360
Right. So it's only 80 miles from Kalamazoo to get to the shore of Lake Michigan here.

150
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,250
And this is an ongoing if you are looking at the E as in the news type article.

151
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:50,420
Right. You see these as well. This is like this, uh, worst case scenario, overhead line five.

152
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:59,089
Right up in the streets, there are these oil lines, huge pipes that lay across the bed of many,

153
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:09,440
several of the Great Lakes that are carrying, containing and carrying massive amounts of oil to refineries to then be,

154
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:20,720
you know, refined and transported gasoline and contaminate, you know, a large leak or spill and contaminating the Great Lakes,

155
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:29,400
which, again, the largest source of freshwater on earth is a huge, huge concern of many.

156
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,510
And so that was kind of the backdrop of this as well.

157
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:41,840
So there was this 30 inch pipe that ruptured. It released over 840,000 gallons of oil flowed into the river.

158
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:49,970
Heavy rains caused the river to overtop the existing dams and oil got about 35 miles downstream.

159
00:17:51,530 --> 00:18:00,469
So the EPA jumped in. It was the federal agency in charge of responding to this incident, coordinated again with several federal,

160
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:07,430
state and local agencies in addition to Enbridge Energy as the company responsible.

161
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,920
And then EPA, you know,

162
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:23,350
basically filed a legal order under its authority of the Clean Water Act the next day directing Enbridge to conduct removal actions and so forth.

163
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:34,390
A process by 48 hours later on this spill had been contained again, about 80 miles short of the shores of Lake Michigan.

164
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:39,960
And that, again, following EPA's regulatory oversight.

165
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:45,550
This is several years later. Right. So the spill occurred in 2010, by 2015.

166
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:55,360
Here's kind of the outcome. Enbridge must restore the environment injured by the 2010 Kalamazoo River oil spill.

167
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,050
So kind of fines, right. That are levied.

168
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:07,329
But not just that. But it's up to Enbridge with oversight by EPA under its regulatory powers right

169
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:12,460
through the Clean Water Act to oversee Enbridge addressing these issues.

170
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,430
Shifting now to Brown. Any questions, by the way, I should cost?

171
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,330
Yes, I had more of a comment, but I'm sure questions or comments.

172
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,950
I went to college and I was part of a study that my ecology professor led.

173
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,700
We were testing it's levels of bio indicator species.

174
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,900
That seems like things are better. I just wanted to throw that in.

175
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,970
Thanks. Thank you for the update and great comment. Any others?

176
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,600
This is a relatively local one from the area. My thoughts about the secret plan.

177
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,760
If it's an abandoned waste site and they can't identify it, the responsible parties for the responsibility refuse to pay.

178
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,299
What actually is the likelihood that it's going to use its own funding?

179
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,990
Because my impression is that the super fund was a fund that's basically dried up.

180
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,720
Yeah, good. Good question. Yeah, resources are a challenge.

181
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:11,540
And that's where I talked a few slides ago about this kind of national priorities list.

182
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:19,280
Right. So it's identifying and not just blowing it off from day one and saying, oh, we'll never have enough money to address that.

183
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,560
So forget about it. It's all identified, it's all investigated, it's all categorized, it's all assessed.

184
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:28,430
And then, yeah, it's kind of like using the resources that are available.

185
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:37,900
What's, what's the most important one? And it's usually related to the size and immediate threat or impact on, on people and populations.

186
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,120
They can drive that priority. But yeah, you're absolutely right.

187
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:47,090
The process is short on resources for remediation.

188
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,120
Great point, isn't it?

189
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:57,710
Also sometimes take time for it to be designated as a Superfund site because your side of like as soon as it's found out, it's a super fun thing.

190
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:04,160
I think like knowing the one for dioxane plume in Ann Arbor has taken many years to be declared.

191
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:08,299
Yeah. And know this example here is, you know, it's emergency response, right?

192
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:13,130
It's like. Absolutely. You know, big spill.

193
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:19,380
No reported. Yeah. That was news yesterday.

194
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,209
Right. One of our emeritus faculty here in The Age has read a lot.

195
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:27,350
Caruso published a paper with another coauthor.

196
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:32,749
Uh, and I don't know if it was timed or not,

197
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:48,020
but it said Eagle prices at the state level quality also released new data that shows that there's groundwater contamination at one four dioxane is

198
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:55,430
slowly making its way from just groundwater to surface water that serves as

199
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:00,740
the source of municipal drinking water intake for for the city of Ann Arbor.

200
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:08,000
And so this is a concern that has, as Kate mentioned, has been growing over the course of decades.

201
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:17,840
The issue was identified quite a long time ago, but it was isolated and it was basically only affecting individual residents or businesses

202
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,640
that were serviced by wells that as well have been contaminated by the groundwater.

203
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,450
But over time and through monitoring and modeling,

204
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,059
it's basically been able to be observe and track how this this groundwater is

205
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:38,150
expanding across the local area to the point and this has been the concern for,

206
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:44,089
I guess for decades, is that okay, here is where Ann Arbor's drinking municipal drinking water intake.

207
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:48,950
Is it ever reaches that point then? That's going to be a concern for a much broader community, right?

208
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:56,240
That's not just remediating, you know, individual wells, whether it's residents or businesses.

209
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:02,660
Now you're talking about the whole community and it's it's slowly getting worse, for sure.

210
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,309
But yeah, a great example of not an emergency response.

211
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:17,000
Right. Something that was identified, again, a significantly lag time like a decade or more after the contamination occurred,

212
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:23,720
but still falls under the same process. So what are brownfields?

213
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,060
All right, so here's a definition. I'll just kind of read it out loud. Uh, it's a real property.

214
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:38,720
The expansion, development or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence of potential hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants.

215
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:43,610
Right. So these are ones where there's not a local company.

216
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:49,400
It's like the Enbridge example, right? That you can say, Oh, yeah, you just had this spill.

217
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,730
You're responsible for cleaning it up. Let's work together to do this.

218
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,750
These are, you know, long forgotten, long abandoned, uh, hazardous waste sites.

219
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:07,069
And again, whether it was known usually not when when the time the company pulled up and State went bankrupt, moved out,

220
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:15,950
whatever else it has with significant lag and time, been identified as a site where there are large amounts of contaminants presence.

221
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:30,080
So this is kind of a definition of a brownfield. So what are some of the actions that EPA is able to take within this brownfields program?

222
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:37,560
So it provides funds as well as technical assistance, again, to all of the stakeholders involved.

223
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:43,010
So states, communities, oftentimes economic redevelopment.

224
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Again, we'll watch a video on one of these at the end of the lecture that work together to not just to assess the damage put into a

225
00:24:52,040 --> 00:25:02,300
plan to safely clean it up and also with a vision for how this site can then be used sustainably as part of redevelopment.

226
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,540
And again, it's balancing, you know, how do we protect human health?

227
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:13,340
Obviously, that's kind of the first one. And then secondarily, you know, how can we redevelop it and repurpose that site?

228
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:22,630
Um, so here's an example of one, a much smaller one in Indianapolis.

229
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,390
We're going to look at a bigger one on a video in Boston in a moment.

230
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:34,580
But yeah, just really quickly, this was a three quarter mile smart growth redevelopment district in Indianapolis.

231
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:44,110
Uh, it encompasses neighborhoods that are challenged by crime, illegal dumping nearly 70% household poverty rate and houses and vacant lots,

232
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:49,940
concentration of brownfields with potential residential exposures to human health, soil and groundwater contamination,

233
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:55,400
and limited access to retail job centers, transportation options, fresh food and community service.

234
00:25:55,410 --> 00:26:00,440
That's right. You layer almost every problem we come up with and here it is.

235
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,059
So in terms of priority, right?

236
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:10,040
So from a human health perspective, an immediate population that's at risk,

237
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:19,430
but then also a really high likelihood of community benefit with an effort to redevelop that site.

238
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:25,640
Right. Following the cleanup. And then, yeah, I've been alluding to this.

239
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:30,290
There's actually two each one is several minutes long, I think in the interest of time.

240
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:36,349
We'll just watch the second one. I'll ask you to go ahead and watch the video and clean up on on your own time.

241
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:40,520
Again, they're only several minutes long. It's a very short. We'll watch this one.

242
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:46,730
It's an EPA kind of documentary video on the restoration of Boston Harbor.

243
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:55,250
And again, it's I think it's a good example of, wow, huge a huge problem requires lots of resources.

244
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:07,130
How are we ever going to overcome this? It's a really good example of what has been done and what can be done to stop that, play that video.

245
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:11,400
And I've queued up, so I'm hoping to.

246
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:28,620
Well, his brother was Louis Janklow from the islands and spent quite a bit as a major contributor to the pollution.

247
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,830
Once again, he was funny.

248
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:40,740
Also, there was an 83% on the day of the Boston Harbor cleanup represents one of the largest public works projects ever undertaken in New England.

249
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:48,810
Once considered the dirtiest harbor in America, today is recognized as one of America's greatest achievements.

250
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:57,270
Well, the clean up, the water, the some buildings that no one wanted to be down here.

251
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:05,670
People in Boston didn't care that much about it, except that it was supposed to be like in 1973,

252
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:17,760
following the passage of federal pollution control members who were getting out and cleaning up for their children's generation to swim in one.

253
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:22,260
And they went out to the business community that they all wanted to work together.

254
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:31,980
And ironically, not one business group at the time could envision this waterfront would be clean enough for children to swim for generations.

255
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:42,310
Oh, yes. I was sworn in and the parking lot was polluted.

256
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:52,410
It was not just on the place, but on somebody is not enough.

257
00:28:53,930 --> 00:29:05,250
Our job was to make sure youths join us.

258
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:13,220
By the 1980s, Boston Harbor was the dirtiest harbor in the United States more than a century.

259
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:19,980
Daley, ways from Boston and 43 surrounding communities were virtually untreated before being dumped into the harbor.

260
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:27,770
When I was in the Rose Bowl, that you would fall in the water, didn't get any shot.

261
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:33,120
Finally, in 1985, EPA joined the Conservation Law Foundation, the city of Quincy,

262
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:37,380
and the town of Winthrop, in a federal lawsuit seeking compliance with the Clean Water Act.

263
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:43,380
EPA was then charged by the court to cooperate in and ensure the expeditious design,

264
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:48,300
funding and construction of the necessary facilities to clean up Boston Harbor.

265
00:29:48,840 --> 00:30:01,919
And it was only it was remarkable. And it is the city that the lawsuit of people went to that is going to be first with everything

266
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:10,409
else and then was only called that part of the way that the Boston gridlock system most

267
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:17,100
incomprehensible aspect of the whole thing where they treated the wastewater collected and took

268
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:22,830
out the collected the slides and then dumped it back into the harbor on the innovation division,

269
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:26,940
announced that these problems were new. People knew of them,

270
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:32,009
but they just didn't have the political will to solve them until we and others

271
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:36,510
pushed the enforcement case and the court insisted upon compliance with the law.

272
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:44,760
Court ordered the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to transfer responsibility for sewage management to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority.

273
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:50,370
BMW are the party which created the integrity to the integrated, run down,

274
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,450
ineffective sewage system from a state agency that had been neglected for many years.

275
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,620
Now a number of key components to this project moving forward.

276
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:06,470
The first thing we want to do is actually building some system that required that the town

277
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:13,290
board underneath wants to bring the rest of the city over here year out and prevent,

278
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:18,720
obviously, the destruction of the the flagship have to be around people critical.

279
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:27,000
Another key milestone was the elimination of the sludge being washed into the harbor in the power plant in the john

280
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:35,040
so that we saw the people were taken out of the boat and involved made into pellets onto the used as fertilizer.

281
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:42,960
Then the final piece was number one, which was one of the longest single entrance tunnels, every dog in this country.

282
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,890
And that allows us to release the untreated effluent.

283
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:53,940
I didn't have my vote in Massachusetts Bay. This was a huge construction plant for many, many children.

284
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:01,740
Very difficult, dangerous, hard work. We brought a lot of blood, sweat, tears to the folks who were actually out here.

285
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,840
Many obstacles, friends on the project, the massive plant cost of billions of dollars.

286
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,750
Ratepayers protested their increasing circles.

287
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,080
Citizens worried that this drug, alcohol, was still too close to Boston, while others argue it was too close to the Cape.

288
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:24,310
It might impact Marine One. So we had community impacts, social impacts on the communities, we had environmental impacts, we had economics.

289
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:29,950
And it was really difficult to try to figure out how to put out plans for all of the projects involved,

290
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,340
hundreds of individual construction projects, and every one of them had its own complications.

291
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:42,280
And just knowing that there was that many people out there working on this project was just a great feeling.

292
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:51,760
It wasn't anymore. The EPA was in this alone. We actually had thousands of people working to clean up the harbor as soon as it slowed down.

293
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,630
Almost see the difference in terms of time.

294
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:04,780
And then later in 2000, I was there at the ceremony where George Rosen and a worker from the construction opening up to do all this.

295
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:12,760
So that was very good news. Harbor restoration didn't end with the building that was around the treatment plant since 2005.

296
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:20,680
The EPA has been involved already in several projects to eliminate the combined sewer overflows that occur during rainstorms.

297
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:25,030
The difference in the harbor is palpable. I think about this one.

298
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:29,380
I like to go to Red Sox games and the part where we sing along.

299
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,299
I love that dirty water and it's a lot of fun, but it's not who we are anymore.

300
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:40,270
It's not how anybody would think about how young people can swim and fish again even harder when they couldn't before.

301
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:53,610
I think we have really changed the way we feel about the city and helped us to really take pride in wearing in this case study project.

302
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:59,070
And this will be a very, very clear project work.

303
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:06,550
What would you think? There is no negative impact on the Cape or North Shore anywhere.

304
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:11,080
Water quality is great and average weekly maintenance.

305
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:15,950
We've seen the turn of a lot marine species recovery.

306
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,400
However, the is considered some of the most difficult supplies from the sea.

307
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:30,070
Everything from small fish eggs to large predators like synthetics and just about everything.

308
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:42,670
So it's just one of those very hungry. You know, we haven't seen an outbreak because maintenance and economic development along the entire area.

309
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:52,900
And then all of a sudden, again, the critical mass of residential commercial use is a cultural situation, all coming to the waterfront.

310
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:58,540
I think if you had such anyone 20 years ago, you would have those solutions for employment.

311
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:04,030
You want to do something big, you need incredible persistence.

312
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,350
We had to persist in the face of hundreds of obstacles.

313
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:13,210
We couldn't stop after overcoming the 10th one or the 40th one.

314
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:18,610
We had to be ready to go all the way to the end and sweep every challenge as it came.

315
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:22,390
The incredible thing about it is that we succeeded and the water is clean.

316
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:34,380
And to clean up Boston Harbor, anything, I think that our generation will be looked at as the nation by our children and our grandchildren for that.

317
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:40,870
And they paid a heavy price for something like this that my goodness, what they have, that's our generation.

318
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:58,700
I don't think. All right.

319
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,360
So a good example, right? Huge, huge task.

320
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:07,140
A huge project to bite off. It wasn't like, yeah, we'll fix this in a year or two.

321
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:12,990
Right. This was a long term vision, but a good example of what has happened and what can happen.

322
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:26,030
Without further ado, let's go ahead and invite the pro group to come on up and the floor is yours once

323
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:34,850
you guys get yourselves settled and ready to go ahead and start that process.

324
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,840
Okay. Good morning. We're the prime DDT group.

325
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:59,220
And we're going to give you a little bit of background on malaria and why Iris is our best solution for combating malaria.

326
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:05,790
So just some basic overview stats. In 2019, there were 227 million cases of malaria worldwide.

327
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,790
550,000 deaths in the same year. And 93% of this disease burden is from sub-Saharan Africa.

328
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:19,110
As you can see in this map to the right of the same year of 2019, overall there are five parasites that are infectious to human,

329
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:23,820
with vivax and falciparum being the most concerted, the most studied as these are the most fatal to humans.

330
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:30,300
Malaria parasites are transmitted via the bite of an infected anopheles mosquito that's being classified as a vector borne disease.

331
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:37,480
Symptoms for uncomplicated malaria are fever, flu like illness, chills sweating.

332
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:44,270
And for the more severe cases, if it is not promptly treated, it results in seizures, kidney failure, mental confusion, coma and death.

333
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,770
On average, symptoms can begin from ten days to four weeks after infection.

334
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,710
But for certain strains of parasites like vivax, if you go valley,

335
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,469
it can stay dormant in your liver for up to four years after infection risk demographics.

336
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:03,050
So who does this impact? Why do we care? Malaria is actually one of the leading causes of child mortality.

337
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:10,400
The World Health Organization estimates that more than a million people in Africa die from malaria every year, including 3000 children each day.

338
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:14,720
And as you can see here on this map, it's a little outdated. It's from 2004.

339
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:21,650
But the purple regions indicate which countries were malaria since 2002, just where malaria was prevalent and indicate it.

340
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:28,460
And you actually see it in red and orange and yellow, the areas where it's been eliminated using iris and other controlled vector methods.

341
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:38,120
So current interventions, vector control is a huge part of combating malaria, just kind of eliminating the risk of mosquito bites in the first place.

342
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,850
So the best way to do this that we have found is indoor residual spraying DDT.

343
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,980
Some factors of malaria are considered undeveloped, which just means after they blood feed,

344
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,350
they will rest in your home, leaving the best opportunity for them to be eliminated.

345
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,830
They can be killed by insecticides when they rest. Right. Absorbing a lethal dose.

346
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:59,929
And this does require community compliance.

347
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:05,480
So 80 to 85% of communities, if they participate in spraying, are the best options to eliminate this.

348
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:11,540
And it works best in conjunction with long lasting insecticidal nets which go over your bed at night are treated.

349
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,670
But these offer only individual protection and are not as great as community control spread.

350
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:27,830
So just to kind of recover this is from this data pulled from the CDC Travel Guide for American Travelers to other countries.

351
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,520
You can notice that about 84 of the 84 countries not currently at high risk for malaria.

352
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:38,670
Africa is about half or most of that risk with the rest of it being in Southeast Asia specifically.

353
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:46,320
So in Central America and the Middle East and North America, it's mostly actually in the Caribbean areas and not in Mexico or Canada.

354
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,370
Then in Oceania. And again, South America is also coming in kind of high.

355
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:56,460
So you can note that it's a lot of regions that are not in the Western world, essentially.

356
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:02,519
So got 84 countries at risk. And one of the biggest medications used to treat malaria is chloroquine.

357
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,080
And 71 of those 84 countries have a strain that is resistant to that drug.

358
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:16,560
So there's not many things you can do in terms of medication. And again, also farmers, about 64% of that risk and vivax, which I just mentioned,

359
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,940
can be dormant for up to four years, is 31% of the primary strain in these countries.

360
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:26,070
So that's obviously a very large problem. And again,

361
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:32,129
we talked about indoor residual spraying is typically conducted using DDT as the main chemical

362
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:36,630
and from the CDC as it was typically used in agricultural methods as an insecticide,

363
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,400
it likely exposure occurs from ingestion and that's the most toxic from ingestion.

364
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,969
But inhalation and skin contact is actually pretty low toxicity,

365
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:51,450
and that's also backed up by the World Health Organization at very high doses, which is not what's typically used an indoor residual spray.

366
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,290
The health effects include like vomiting and use some seizures.

367
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:58,890
And in some animals, that usually impacts on liver systems and reproductive systems.

368
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,360
And it is a possible aggressive carcinogen, but there was no direct ties found yet.

369
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:12,240
So because of that, the health effects at high doses don't connect to the low dose ones.

370
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:19,260
So why does DDT indoor residual strains continue to be relevant and useful in the changing world?

371
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,370
Well, we know that as a result of global warming and human intervention,

372
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:32,370
deforestation and increases in surface water are happening on a global scale, but especially in areas that are primarily affected by malaria.

373
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:36,640
We see this in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Southeast Asia and South America.

374
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,580
Both of these anthropogenic changes increase the available amount of mosquito habitat.

375
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:49,800
Therefore, climate change also is affecting patterns of rainfall and temperature, which also affect mosquito habitat.

376
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:55,980
This, in turn, affects the susceptibility of people living in malaria prone areas to malaria.

377
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:04,530
In fact, we actually expect that climate change will result in an increase of about a million more people in Africa alone to malaria,

378
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:09,179
where they hadn't previously been exposed before as a result of changes to mosquito range.

379
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,419
And this isn't occurring just at the level of the vector.

380
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:17,579
However, we can also see that climate change is benefiting malarial parasites.

381
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:24,150
So these are the Plasmodium as a result of changes to temperature primarily and humidity.

382
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:31,560
Plasmodium is expected to survive for a longer durations of time and a shorter incubation period as the world continues to get warmer.

383
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:41,819
These changes to Plasmodium ecology have already shifted and will continue to shift species prevalence of individual Plasmodium vectors,

384
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:49,260
as we can see here in Malaysia. So as a result, modern malaria a highly effective and adaptable solution.

385
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:58,140
This is especially salient because rainfall abnormality seems to now be the key driver of malarial prevalence in a given season.

386
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:03,120
As we can see here after 2010, this is when this shift started to occur.

387
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,560
Much of this is because Bednets alone, which is the traditional sort of low budget efforts at malaria control,

388
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:17,850
have not been demonstrated to have universal usage, even when significant efforts have been undertaken to distribute them to populations.

389
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,120
Rather, the decreases that we have seen in East African malarial prevalence can be directly attributed

390
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:28,890
to increases in indoor residual spraying as well as improved access to health care.

391
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:36,390
Because the results of indoor residual spraying in the face of a change in climate here are self-evident.

392
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:44,549
You can see this is opia. Most of the deep red areas that are on this left hand side in this area on the graph and of these areas,

393
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:50,370
two are remote and do not have great access to health care clinics.

394
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,640
However, we can see that they have experienced in many cases a drop in malarial prevalence

395
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,700
as a result of individual of indoor residual spraying where it is implemented.

396
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:08,309
And here is just some additional confirmation that those drops that we saw was not just due to the fact that there is a drought there,

397
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:16,980
that your rainfall is fairly normal that year and still no residual spraying is appearing to be effective in controlling malaria, which is great news.

398
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:25,560
Another key point, to go back to a previous figure, we can see that health care access in malaria stricken areas is starting to improve.

399
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:30,810
But as it stands, malaria is a significant drain on health care resources in these areas,

400
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:36,480
as malaria is better controlled and as health care access continues to improve.

401
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:44,340
However, the management of some weakly associated in some cases DDT health conditions can be better managed

402
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:49,500
as we have more resources and more clinics and more doctors that are able to take on the challenge.

403
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:59,490
Just some further information on another intervention that can be possibly used to treat or prevent malaria.

404
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:08,820
Our antimalarial drugs, which are admittedly highly effective, but only in areas where they're not resistant to the specific drug.

405
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,330
Some negatives is that you can only take them for a short period of time.

406
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,760
So they're not feasible for residents of the area, only for people who are just traveling to the area.

407
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:25,010
And then drug resistance is common, as we were seeing earlier, with research about chloroquine.

408
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:30,120
And then there's also a very common adverse health effects.

409
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:39,179
For example, in chloroquine, there's allergies, there's bone marrow issues, muscle issues, heart disease, epilepsy, kidney and liver issues.

410
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:44,850
And then with other antimalarial drugs, there's also a lot of GI tract issues.

411
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,230
So these are the six common antimalarial drugs.

412
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,700
None of them can be used by pregnant women or by children.

413
00:45:53,970 --> 00:46:02,550
So these are often very vulnerable populations that we want to protect from malaria, and they can't use these antimalarial drugs.

414
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:07,110
There's also many other vulnerable populations that can't use these drugs,

415
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:13,770
which make it really inconvenient to try to determine which drug you can use, can't use what safe what's what's going to be effective for you.

416
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:22,410
On top of that, like you're saying earlier, there is a lot of antimalarial resistance,

417
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:30,240
so it's pretty difficult to determine which drug is going to be useful depending on the area that you're traveling to.

418
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:39,170
Further the inconvenience with antimalarial drugs is that you have to start taking them 1 to 2 weeks before you travel.

419
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:44,190
So if there's any spontaneous trips or anything like that, like people traveling for work,

420
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:50,400
you have to be taking them one or two weeks before travel to be effective.

421
00:46:50,610 --> 00:47:01,559
You then have to take them throughout your entire time and then also for up to a month after a quick break over our points one more time.

422
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:08,760
So again, the geography and prevalence of malaria is changing due to anthropogenic impacts as well as the environment and climate change.

423
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,120
And all these things we talked about in previous attempted attempt to control methods such

424
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,950
as bedbug bednets alone are no longer effective in controlling this malaria malaria.

425
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:25,560
So we have to combine that with indoor residual spraying to truly decrease the prevalence of malaria these countries.

426
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:28,139
And again, the drugs cannot be taken for some period of time.

427
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,560
And we want to protect the residents of children and pregnant women who live in these areas.

428
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:41,130
So using things like indoor residual spraying in combination with bed nets is our most feasible and most manageable solution.

429
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:55,930
Okay, great. Thank you very much. And with that the against grew up in.

430
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:15,380
Really? Okay, so we are the calm group, so we will be discussing.

431
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:20,330
Thank you. We will be discussing why one would be against the use of DDT.

432
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:25,910
So should indoor residual spraying up DDT still be allowed for the control of malaria?

433
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:32,570
So what is DDT? DDT is known as the most powerful pesticide in the entire world.

434
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:40,400
Unlike most pesticides, DDT is capable of killing hundreds of different kinds of insects at once instead of just one or two types of insects.

435
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:46,659
And what is indoor residual spraying so indoors that you will spraying involves

436
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:51,550
spraying the walls and other surfaces of indoor spaces with a residual insecticide.

437
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:58,980
The goal of this is that for several months the insecticide is supposed to kill mosquitoes and other insects that come in contact with these surfaces.

438
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:09,710
So just a little history and background. The publication of Silent Spring, which was written by Rachel Carson and published in 1962,

439
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:17,390
stimulated the widespread public concern over the dangers of improper pesticide use and the need for better pesticide controls.

440
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:27,980
In 1972, the EPA issued a cancelation order for DDT because of its adverse effects on the environment as well as its potential for human health risks.

441
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:29,389
Since then,

442
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:36,920
studies have shown that there is a relationship between DDT exposure and negative reproductive effects as well as the development of liver tumors.

443
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:43,290
Okay. So let's talk about some of the health issues caused by DDT.

444
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:52,920
I feel like those were maybe glossed over by the last group. So, yes, in high doses there are immediate effects, including like vomiting,

445
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:57,930
tremors and seizures, and that's through direct consumption of DDT, the chemical.

446
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:06,540
But and low doses from residual spraying have not been shown to directly impact health through the actual spraying process.

447
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:15,179
However, this just doesn't look at the actual exposure risk from being around that in their environment or take into

448
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:23,760
account water and soil as a pathway for DDT consumption as well as bioaccumulation within food sources.

449
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:33,000
One thing that is really concerning to us is that DDT has really long lasting intergenerational impacts.

450
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:42,180
So there's studies that show that grandmothers who were exposed to DDT in the sixties in the United States,

451
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:48,030
those with high DDT exposures had lasting generational impacts,

452
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:56,399
both with their daughters and their granddaughters through the 2.6 times account of

453
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,700
developing an unhealthy BMI in their granddaughters as well as their granddaughters,

454
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,400
were twice as likely to have started their periods before age 11.

455
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:08,160
Those are both concerning because they raise their risk of breast cancer as well as cardiovascular diseases.

456
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:17,129
As the other group noted that it is a potentially high percentage and it hasn't necessarily been completely linked in human studies,

457
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:24,240
but it has been modeled in animal studies. And as we know it didn't quite ethical to test these things on humans in.

458
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:39,989
So I read a few different in health risk assessments in both Ethiopia as well as in China around DDT exposures.

459
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:49,649
And both of them noted that they couldn't necessarily link a direct health impact from water or from soil with DDT in it.

460
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:58,770
But they noted that they were unable to measure and model the impact of DDT through food consumption and that that needed to be included.

461
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:03,659
And another issue is that DDT does harm local food sources.

462
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:10,350
So fish die off in lakes, and some of these areas require fish to economically survive.

463
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:17,140
So not only did the fish die off, any of the fish who survived might have DDT, and then it's bioaccumulation in people systematically.

464
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:24,990
And oh yeah, the DDT is fat soluble and can also be transmitted through breast milk and also in utero.

465
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,870
All right. So now we're going to weigh a few of the pros and cons,

466
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:39,230
although I understand that you guys just listen to a whole slideshow or presentation on the pros.

467
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:43,940
I'm just emphasizing here that DDT can be effective at killing mosquitoes.

468
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:47,659
It's relatively inexpensive and easy to manufacture.

469
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:51,610
And as we know and heard from, it lasts for a long time in the environment.

470
00:52:51,620 --> 00:53:03,080
But are there options for malaria control where we don't necessarily have to use DDT and feel the potential long lasting impacts of DDT?

471
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:06,560
And a great example of that is malaria control in Vietnam,

472
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:14,600
where they switch from the idea of eradication to control and their methods decrease deaths by 19 times.

473
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:26,270
So a couple of reasons for their success, where the high level political and financial commitments that Vietnam essentially made to control.

474
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:32,300
It's essentially right all come together and utilize methods to control malaria.

475
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:38,900
They offered free treatments to those affected, including vaccines and other malaria treatment drugs.

476
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:43,489
They also educated their health workers on malaria,

477
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:50,570
and that also helps those health care workers educate their own communities on how to control malaria.

478
00:53:51,260 --> 00:54:01,070
And then another thing is funding the organization. So instead of using the funding methods that were recommended by the WHO or W.H.O.,

479
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:09,560
they went to 12 horizontal funding methods that essentially provide funding to

480
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:15,950
proportional funding to communities based on their personal health health care needs.

481
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:25,400
And so this next slide, we're highlighting a study from South Africa where they show.

482
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:38,839
They should write malaria transmissions from when when DDT was sprayed, says from 1990 to 96 when DDT was discontinued, that you can see.

483
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:45,080
Right. Clearly, there's more malaria transmission here than in 2001 when DDT was reintroduced.

484
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,800
We can see those malaria transmissions going back down.

485
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:55,640
But what about the mosquitoes who are now becoming resistant to malaria due to the process of natural selection?

486
00:54:55,670 --> 00:55:08,360
So in the graph over here, we have over the course of 22 months how a population of mosquitoes were affected through multiple strains of DDT.

487
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:12,410
So in the first spraying of DDT, we can see a mortality rate of almost 100%.

488
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:20,150
But as time goes on, the mortality rate slowly goes down because the mosquitoes that survived each time are now reproducing.

489
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:26,990
So we have larger populations of mosquitoes who are resistant to DDT, therefore making it almost ineffective.

490
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:39,270
So ideally of contributions or advancements in science contribute US solutions to individual or societal problems.

491
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:44,490
Industrial chemical substances are beneficial to its users.

492
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:50,090
However. And.

493
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,780
Well, I lost my train of thought. Give me a second.

494
00:55:55,100 --> 00:56:02,060
However uncritical faith in human control over nature is what creates debates like the ones the one that we're having today.

495
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,430
The truth is that y'all are already on the winning side of this argument, which is our side.

496
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:17,750
But my purpose is just to provide you with further evidence as to why the consequences of DDT cannot ethically uphold its use.

497
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:27,790
Okay. I'll. She must go to court.

498
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:35,590
Oh, so. I'm going to go off the cuff then.

499
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:43,180
Okay. So we have some ethical violations here that DDT violates.

500
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:51,070
So firstly, we have the fact that we are placing the value of certain human lives above others.

501
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:56,770
We are prioritizing short term fixes over a future irreparable damage.

502
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:03,610
We're putting visible Band-Aids on top of invisible, yet very real further complications.

503
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:12,430
We're taking in us versus the mentality. And also we're under the impression that only some of us are impacted when in reality,

504
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,360
because of climate change, this will become more and more in the future.

505
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:24,840
Okay. The W.H.O. says that malaria is a preventable and curable.

506
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:29,430
Yet Africa places a disproportionately high burden.

507
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:37,530
In 2020, the region was home to 95% of the malaria cases worldwide.

508
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:42,290
So because the pro DDT argument is largely closed.

509
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:48,510
I have some numbers for you guys also out of the entire population in Africa.

510
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:56,130
95% of these cases that happened in the one year equates to about one fifth of its population.

511
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:01,380
And the reason I say this is because even considering the birth rate,

512
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:09,240
not all of these cases end in death or else Africa's population would soon be desolate at the hands of malaria alone.

513
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:20,370
So we have to think for ourselves and open our eyes and not allow these huge numbers to scare us into slowly poisoning entire populations of people.

514
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:31,810
Regulatory actions against DDT began back in the fifties and in 72 it was banned for the US countries from all over the world.

515
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:35,200
Italy came together in unity over the horribleness of DDT,

516
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:42,969
yet the ultimate decision was made that it's okay in certain circumstances because of certain populations,

517
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:46,240
because of malaria, we'll insert populations because of malaria.

518
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:52,870
And as people who don't live the reality of this of this experience,

519
00:58:53,140 --> 00:59:01,690
it can be easily misconstrued that this decision is a reflection of how bad or behind the way of life is in these regions,

520
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:07,480
when in reality, this decision is a reflection of large scale environmental injustice.

521
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:16,830
And that concludes our argument. Thanks for listening. Okay.

522
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:19,410
We'll do the same format that we did for the first debate.

523
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:25,650
So I'll invite the pro group to head out this door and maybe hitching a ride down to the cafe area

524
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:31,320
and the against group to go out that door and hang out left some more pieces for the Indy room.

525
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:37,559
Guys, got 2 minutes to come up with your models and then I'll call you back.

526
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:42,810
In short, I their time.

527
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:55,260
Now, I do want to to you about this.

528
01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:00,110
I don't get it. Do you guys?

529
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:06,980
Well, you know, we're going to find it very, very interesting.

530
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:11,990
All right. Whenever you're ready for your rebuttal. Okay.

531
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:17,480
So our rebuttal is that DDT is an imperfect solution, but it is the best one that we have.

532
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:22,669
Our debate is on the question of allowing the use of DDT spraying and considering that the

533
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:27,290
United States itself eliminated malaria in the 1950s through the same use of these chemicals.

534
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:32,510
Our group considered considers it unethical to tell other regions of the world that they are not allowed to do the same.

535
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:39,500
So considering just the over the sheer amount of people who are vulnerable to this,

536
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:44,600
it's about 1.4 billion people who are exposed to the potential dangers of malaria.

537
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:51,550
Even with a small death rate, this is still around half a million people who are dying each year from a treatable and preventable disease,

538
01:04:51,560 --> 01:05:00,970
as the last group mentioned stated by the WHO. So another thing to note is a lot of the countries that are impacted by high,

539
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:07,130
high prevalence of malaria risk outside of the nation like the continent of Africa,

540
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:14,450
include a lot of small tribal nations and Polynesia and and island states.

541
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:19,999
So it's very difficult for them to have like full governmental control, bringing in other things.

542
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,520
So being able to bring in something that is backed up by the who are backed up by all these other places is

543
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:32,209
a lot easier than trying to spend like high amounts of money and coordination on stuff that may or may not,

544
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:39,560
not, may or may not work in those regions. And for them, the current thing is just getting everyone safe out of risk.

545
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:50,690
So having to consider the other nations involved and their capacity and ability to afford and control and carry out these kind of like high stakes

546
01:05:50,690 --> 01:06:01,220
vector control plans when something as very simple sprang it inside of their homes and using bed nets in combination is a lot easier for them.

547
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:08,420
This is a question of timing, and it is an immediate threat to lives and future generations too, of from malaria.

548
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:12,710
In order to be looking at long term effects, we are negating those who are immediately at risk.

549
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:19,790
So thanks very much. Progress against group.

550
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:21,860
You now have 2 minutes for your rebuttal.

551
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:31,340
So this seems like one thing this other group didn't mention was that there is a vaccine for malaria that is being promoted by the W.H.O.

552
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:32,240
And it is.

553
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:38,000
And they mentioned that malaria drugs can't be used in children, but we have this vaccine that is being recommended by the W.H.O. for children.

554
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,350
This vaccine does not have the same environmental impacts as DDT because it's a vaccine.

555
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:47,930
Number two, I just added it.

556
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:55,340
The other group showed a graph actually during the presentation that I ended up looking up from a paper by Ryan et al in 2020,

557
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:59,600
which shows that there's actually a decrease from climate change in the endemic regions,

558
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:05,389
and that actually climate change and that rainfall itself is not necessarily a predictor of

559
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:11,390
an increase in malaria because rainfall can actually remove mosquitoes from those areas.

560
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:17,570
The other thing I want to mention is that this first shift here,

561
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:23,780
so this is a map that talks that highlights the movement of air and particles throughout the world.

562
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:31,309
And one of the huge problems with DDT as a persistent organic pollutant is that it actually ends up even in virtually spraying it in Africa.

563
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:33,350
It's going to end up in other places in the world.

564
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:39,469
And we have a huge issue in the Arctic right now because the Arctic has become a sink for persistent

565
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:44,930
organic pollutants where it's actually poisoning food systems for people who live there.

566
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:52,129
And the indigenous people there actually have considered it a form of threatening their right to their cultural practices

567
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:58,940
because of the ways that it harms their ability to eat their traditional foods like blubber and steel and things like that.

568
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:01,729
And now they're also not able to then breastfeed their children as well,

569
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:05,450
which also increases the costs for them to of living because they have to buy formula.

570
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:10,190
And so if that's happening there, it's also happening in other places in the world.

571
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:15,620
But we just really don't have enough studies on how it actually impacts our food chain.

572
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:23,809
And I'm going to move it over to Mary to talk about I was just going to say, obviously, it's been banned for a reason.

573
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:29,870
And I know they said that there's not a direct link, but I mean, animal studies have been proven.

574
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:33,140
You know, if it affects if it does this in, an animal can do it to humans.

575
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:39,880
We can't really deny the fact that there's been an. And negative reproductive effects in women today.

576
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:46,160
So who knows how much of that has been caused by DDT to go off?

577
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:50,050
I'm going to stop you guys. Sorry. You're over there. All right.

578
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:57,430
Reach out to both groups. You guys can go ahead and take a seat.

579
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:03,700
The court, please.

580
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:08,270
So, like we did last time, just by just by a show of hands.

581
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:18,570
Right. So that's the first kind of vote is not your stance on the issue, but based on the quality of the debate presented.

582
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,240
Which group do you think put forth the best argument? Our case.

583
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:33,100
Who thought that the pro group won the debate and then who thought that the against group wanted to take over?

584
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:36,410
So you need to see at least all the hands of the against.

585
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:44,870
Okay, a second show of hands. Who is in favor?

586
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:49,870
Right. Who supports the pro view of the use of DDT for controlling malaria?

587
01:09:52,510 --> 01:10:00,880
I see some so so the way in and then who is against the use of malaria for good use for malaria.

588
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:04,390
Okay. All right. So maybe a little more mixed, right?

589
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:11,050
Our our first debate topic, I think everyone was in support with regards to urban farming.

590
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:15,430
This one not so much. Right. And a lot more, I'm not really sure.

591
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:20,080
Type of responses. So what do folks think?

592
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:24,969
Comments? Questions. What are the challenges?

593
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:31,780
And maybe looking forward to those of you who said, yeah, I'm not really sure. What what is it that makes you unsure about your view?

594
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:44,409
Yeah, it's kind of a horrible question because like if you like DDT, it is proven to be very effective.

595
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:51,340
It has been historically. There is no denying that it is not great for human health and it's going to have environmental repercussions.

596
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:56,680
But it really is like a question of morality, of like can we really ethically tell these people that they're not allowed to protect

597
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:01,390
themselves when this is like a viable solution that they can use to protect their communities?

598
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:07,239
Especially when you have so many young nations that are have just been like perceived independence

599
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:12,790
and like the fifties or the sixties and like have issues with accessibility to health care,

600
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:17,139
that sort of thing. They're still developing. And so I think temporarily it's not a great solution.

601
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:23,469
And I really hope the vaccines start working. They're still in clinical trials, which is I didn't really have high hopes for that.

602
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:28,510
So yeah, so that leaves me like really kind of floundering for for sure.

603
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:37,570
Yeah. Thanks. But I see at the hands going up, I think it's your case for I'm not trying to like continue the debate right now, but I did.

604
01:11:37,570 --> 01:11:40,660
You mentioned that these, these countries are like new countries.

605
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:45,190
And the reason they're new is because of colonialism. And this whole thing is an issue of colonialism.

606
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:50,829
And the reason these countries don't have the money to try other methods is because they have been

607
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:57,580
like exploited and pulled from like financially and resourcefully from like the global north.

608
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:00,790
And so I think a huge issue in this is actually just like the funding,

609
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:07,940
because the reason DDT is used is because it's cheap, not because it's the best option is what I would say.

610
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:18,370
Great comment. I thought it makes sense. And also they're kind of like still developing because of issues like this, like you're floundering,

611
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:22,600
they're kind of floundering also because they're faced with this issue of like, okay,

612
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:30,549
right now this is a short term fix, but for future generations and like climate change is just worsening this for the future,

613
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:35,980
like it's only going to get worse for our entire population. So it's just great comment.

614
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:40,540
Amy See, I agree, I agree. It's colonialism and I agree it's like an equal partner.

615
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,880
I think on the same line it's who are we to set the agenda as far as whether or not to use DDT?

616
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:50,630
And I think that there is a lot of pushback originally to Silent Spring from countries or malaria.

617
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:54,790
It's a big problem being like you can't understand what it's like to live like everyone's

618
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:59,049
wearing masks and you can understand what it's like to live with the cotton concern of malaria.

619
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:08,320
And so why should a US concern over the potential health effects but not the real effects of of the easy side agenda as far as

620
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:13,540
you can use malaria and like the same way that we have all these countries and climes like why can't individual countries,

621
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:14,290
individual communities,

622
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:22,240
individual people like weigh their own risks based on the literature and what we know about DDT to decide what make them feel the most safe.

623
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:30,200
Any any other comments or questions if folks want to weigh in with.

624
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:42,560
I guess just something I noticed while I was researching. And I'm sure you guys have a more nuanced perspective of this,

625
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:48,250
that the amount of consensus on actual negative health effects that are associated with DDT,

626
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:58,050
it's kind of shaky, like a lot of the papers I found, like they like there was an association, but only if you like had an alpha level of like 10%.

627
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:01,830
So I think there's a lot more research that needs to be done.

628
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:11,280
And it it's kind of concerning that, you know, we may end up using some of these vulnerable populations as sources for these long term effects.

629
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,710
But at the same time, the risk of people literally dying from malaria at the age of five.

630
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,540
I don't know. It's it's weird. Yeah.

631
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:26,729
I mean, I can I can weigh in. And again, this isn't like, you know, supporting the use of DDT,

632
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:37,530
but comparatively speaking of the relative toxicity compared to other chemicals with such a long time track record now of its use, it absolutely.

633
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:41,700
It's well documented that it spreads, it circles the globe. It goes everywhere.

634
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:45,330
Um, you can measure if people are exposed to it.

635
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:49,049
That's not a question. I mean, obviously the people it's being applied, they're exposed.

636
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:52,920
But even unintentional exposures, people are being exposed.

637
01:14:53,730 --> 01:15:00,180
Even with all of that. Yeah, there's not this like very clear association with health.

638
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,820
That's not not to say that it's not still of concern,

639
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:11,580
but relative terms of relative toxicity for some of the other chemicals that add that that long of a I spent up time for study and research.

640
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:14,940
It's not appears to be as bad. Go ahead.

641
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:20,219
Well, I'm just curious how much of that has to do with the fact that it's not like the issue in the global north,

642
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:23,670
like it's not something that I can't remember what it's called,

643
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:31,620
but it's like about the whole paradox, like things like malaria and TB and HIV all are like considered like third world problems.

644
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:39,239
And so they're not they don't have as much funding and research backing behind it by big institutions in the United States,

645
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:43,290
because we're more interested in like solving dementia and cancer, which I'm not saying that's bad,

646
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:48,450
but like I just mean like we're like we're more interested in those sorts of things.

647
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:53,909
And so a lot of the studies that I did find have very tenuous risks as well.

648
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:59,850
But yeah, like why are we testing this on vulnerable populations basically, and using them as test studies?

649
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:06,629
And then the other thing I found, which I didn't know how to like document because there's not documentation on it, was that a lot of these countries,

650
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:15,690
because DDT is legal for indoor residual spraying, also end up using DDT in illegal uses as well because it's so bailable.

651
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:20,969
And so it gets used in a lot of ways that are not just indoor residual spraying that

652
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:26,280
are possibly even more harmful to people's health than they were residual spraying.

653
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:31,469
And I would say that's because it's like allowed to come into those countries for indoor residual spraying.

654
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:33,530
So I don't know. It's.

655
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:41,709
My partner worked on TV and it's just like, you know, people think it's gone, but it's like huge in so many countries in the world.

656
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:46,750
And it's just like a lot of these diseases are don't have the urgency on a

657
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:50,230
global level because it's not the people with money are the ones who have them.

658
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:58,009
So. Oh, just one minute last time.

659
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:02,290
I'm afraid to pose the question. Next question. So what?

660
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:14,090
So what do we do right now for folks that I mean, there are good points, but do we say, okay, stop now?

661
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,360
Right. Whatever.

662
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:23,810
So W.H.O., wherever it is, it has like some sort of authority or some treaty, international treaty, and then quickly develop an alternative.

663
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:35,630
Or if I think everyone has agreement that it's not the best option, continue its use until the better alternative is in place.

664
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:45,680
Obviously, therefore, we continue the use until there's a better alternative because anything that's done quickly is not going to be done well.

665
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:50,299
And it's great that there are these vaccines that are being developed that are these vaccines

666
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:53,750
are actually going to be distributed to people who need them would be the biggest question,

667
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:57,350
because big pharma could solve this problem, but they won't.

668
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:07,460
So if you have something that works, I think the risk of dying from malaria for a lot of people is much higher than the risk of dying from cancer.

669
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:16,490
A lot of the countries also have like I think their life expectancy is not long enough.

670
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:21,750
You can die from cancer some. And yes.
