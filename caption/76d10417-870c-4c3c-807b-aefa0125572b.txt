1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:07,549
Evangelical Church. And the fact that it's allowed is just incredible.

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:15,470
And so for us and all the going to make I think you run from you know.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,740
Yeah it was I have a friend that lived right behind it so she had multiple undergrads like Peak and Renard and I was like,

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,480
I can't it's not worth the $2,000 help you pay for rent.

5
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:34,309
But it would be fun to walk around and see people outside, like sitting on their porch, like playing catch.

6
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:40,250
I'm like, that's cu. Yeah, that's real. But yeah, one time.

7
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,720
All right, I'm going to start just because we have two topics to get through to get today.

8
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:57,200
So we're going to be kind of trying to stay on pace while people are kind of filtering and we'll just kind of figure out where we are in the course.

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,270
So here we are on the kidney. We're going to do normal structure, function and pathology today.

10
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,260
So that's a lot of stuff about my water.

11
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,540
Hopefully I'll make it. And then next week we're also going to do kind of a two fer.

12
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,870
We're going to do a lung, normal structure, function and pathology.

13
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,330
So both of these are kind of a lot of stuff at once that makes a little bit challenging.

14
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,740
And it also means that there are two quizzes for this week that are due next Friday.

15
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:31,580
So I encourage you to kind of not leave those till the last minute because it will be easier to sort of remember the stuff,

16
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,480
remember where it is in the lecture if you do it in somewhat proximity to the lecture.

17
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:44,959
So that's this week and next week. And then we're getting towards the end, which kind of shocking the nervous system.

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,190
I did split up like like we did for the liver because it gets a little bit more complicated.

19
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,870
So that one will split up structure, function, pathology, so it'll be a little bit easier.

20
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:59,990
And then that November 18th, that is the last of the systems pathology will be going over for the final.

21
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:10,790
Okay. So the final is just going to cover our systems pathology, the liver that we did last time, kidney, lung and nervous system.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,840
Okay. So all the material that will be on the final will be done prior to Thanksgiving.

23
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:20,600
So that bodes well for kind of reviewing the material and making sure you know where everything is and that everything makes sense.

24
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:30,859
Then we have Thanksgiving. Yeah. And then on the second we have a palooza at the bar, which is just going to be other examples,

25
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:37,850
things other than the ones we've got over in class gives you a little bit of practice, but nothing on that will specifically be on the final.

26
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,860
Okay. For the final, I talked a little bit about this previously.

27
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,500
It's going to be on the ninth, which is the last scheduled day of classes.

28
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:56,570
It'll be similar ish to the midterm in that it will be on canvas, most likely embedded in canvas itself.

29
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:07,220
It will be time limited. So usually I give you essentially the whole day, which I'm going to kind of define as like a ten hour period.

30
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:15,320
So I'm going to give you the whole day to do that. The exam itself is defined, is designed to really be like a two hour exam.

31
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:23,569
Okay. So again, you can have any space of time within that 10 hours to take your two hour block that gives you some flexibility.

32
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:29,330
Some people are faster. Some people are slower to have if you want to take 10 hours, I seriously don't realize it,

33
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:36,050
but a two hour exam and that'll be within a ten hour block of the Friday on that December 9th.

34
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,800
Okay. Compared to the midterm.

35
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,150
So the second part of the course you've seen, we're doing structure function.

36
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,040
So there's some just kind of, you know, what are not type questions for pathology.

37
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,600
There's some interpretation. Nothing that I show in the final will be something that you have not seen in class B or C,

38
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,250
but we did deliver we showed an example of acute liver toxicity.

39
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:06,170
Right. We had acetaminophen. There's necrosis. What else did we show?

40
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,530
We showed an example. Well, you had your your cow example, which was another type of acute toxicity.

41
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:18,410
And then I showed an example of chronic toxicity that was the cirrhosis one with lots of different things going on.

42
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,940
So basically the things that, you know for liver are what does acute damage look like,

43
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,710
like acute cell death necrosis and you know, what are the components of chronic damage?

44
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,480
Okay. So your scope of things I can show on the exam are pretty small.

45
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,730
I'm not going to show you and your pleasure or anything like that.

46
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,510
And then there were those cryptic recognitions, hypoplasia, hypertrophy, that kind of thing.

47
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,820
Okay, so it's going to follow pretty closely to what's on the quizzes and what we went over in class.

48
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,429
And then, like we said before,

49
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:53,800
I'll usually ask you like if I show you Central Iberian necrosis and a liver and you identify that there will be a question about name a talks,

50
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,230
name one toxin or an agent that could cause this.

51
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,030
You can use the example we had in class, and I'm usually going to ask you to explain.

52
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,720
A Genesis director explained that metabolism of acetaminophen.

53
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,850
So make sure you know those mechanisms. You can't just right. Acetaminophen causes liver toxicity.

54
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,710
You do that before the class. So there's some flexibility if you have another toxicant that you want to use instead, that's totally fine.

55
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,130
But just the example of one toxic in another.

56
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,470
So the only organ systems you'll know by then are liver or kidney, lung and nervous system.

57
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:35,200
So another question that sometimes comes up is What if I freak out and I see a history picture and I screwed up from the beginning?

58
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,130
I think it's a different organ, like the lung or something. So will I lose all the points?

59
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,590
So the answer is no.

60
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:54,110
If you misidentified the organ at the beginning of value into your alternate universe where the liver is the kidney and the basic processes,

61
00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:01,250
remember, are kind of similar from tissue to tissue. So if you misidentify the liver as the kidney and you start describing the process, cell death,

62
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:07,040
and then you give me an example of a toxicant that causes, you know, tubular necrosis in the kidney.

63
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,910
Yeah, you'll lose the points for the organ, but you'll get all the points for the process.

64
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:18,800
Okay, so don't. Again, I know that we have a limited time to learn histology, so don't freak out too much about the visual parts of it.

65
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:25,400
Okay. Does that make sense? Again, everything we show is a lesion that we've seen in class.

66
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,630
So I'm not going to show you like I won't show you the neoplasia thing that we talked about.

67
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,799
I'll tell you, if it's if I'm showing you something extra that will be on the exam and I'm not

68
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,490
going to throw some other or a totally different lesion in that you haven't seen.

69
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,540
Okay.

70
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:48,679
So in in some ways, the final is a little bit more straightforward because it's more you're tied to something direct that you see versus the path,

71
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,750
which is a little bit more conceptual. But still, the advice for studying is the same.

72
00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:05,090
Bless you. You're very quiet little thing. The advice for studying is the same in that the best method for preparation is to review the PowerPoints,

73
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,079
look at the review sheets, you know, quiz yourself using the review sheet.

74
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,030
If you're studying with a friend, ask each other questions from the lecture or from the review sheet.

75
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:20,060
So I would advise to study for it as if it were an in-class closed book exam.

76
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,190
And the reason is because, I mean, those are time compressed periods and you just get tired.

77
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,580
I know that midterm, you know, give you ten days, take it made you tired.

78
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,639
So if you already sort of read the question like, oh, okay, this is about well, five will pop into your head.

79
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,470
This is about that thing you are is can spend less time sorting through your notes and looking at the,

80
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:46,850
you know, recordings that go right where the information is. And you can spend more time thinking about your answer and organizing your answer.

81
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,780
Okay. So keeping up each week, kind of reviewing the material, making sure I know the quizzes are, you know,

82
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,940
you can pass the quiz by taking it one sort of noting down the correct answers and then taking it again.

83
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,380
But like the quizzes are there to try to help you practice it and get it into your head.

84
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,950
So try to pay attention as you're going through the quiz. If I didn't have my notes.

85
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,780
Like, how well do I know this? And you'll know sort of the parts that you need to spend a lot more time on.

86
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:19,819
Okay, so that is kind of where we are in the class. The final is the ninth, if anyone.

87
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,330
I think if someone had had a question about timing of the final, they had a conflict.

88
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:30,830
If you have a scheduling issue with the final, please talk to me a.s.a.p so that we can arrange an alternate time.

89
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,910
I think I have one person already who's going to be taking it a little bit early.

90
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:39,590
Okay. And then 717 folks, there's no 717 class that day.

91
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,159
So you won't have that time constraint in the afternoon. Okay.

92
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:49,850
The midterm, I know you're waiting with bated breath. Midterms are corrected. I will be putting them on to canvas after this class.

93
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,129
I want you guys to focus on kidney this morning.

94
00:08:52,130 --> 00:09:01,430
And I knew if I put the midterms on you, I'll be like frantically thumbing through the average for the midterm with an 83.2,

95
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,720
which is about where it usually is for an in-class exam and about kind of what to expect.

96
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,530
There was a bit of it. It's all fun. It's all fine. There was a bit of a tail.

97
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:16,909
So like there was a bit of our left tail.

98
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,229
So there are some people I spoke to individual who maybe didn't do as well as you'd as they had hoped.

99
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,350
So it was kind of skewed a little bit towards the upper end of the eighties.

100
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,310
I was like I said, I'm going to put them all on canvas.

101
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:37,920
I wrote comments on everybody's test. So like, you shouldn't, for the most part, have like things marked wrong.

102
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:43,760
We have no clue what I was looking for. So my suggestion is you kind of go through your test, read what I wrote.

103
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:51,709
Read your answer. See if it makes sense. If you have questions about what I was expecting or questions about just in general how you did in your test,

104
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,130
please reach out to me and we can set up a time to kind of go over in more detail.

105
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,140
But like I said, I make not made notes for everything. So there should be some explanation in there and hopefully.

106
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,180
It makes sense to you folks who sent in, who gave me a PDF that was a lot harder to make notes on,

107
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,080
so just kind of come talk to me if it doesn't make any sense.

108
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:22,719
Okay, so 83.2, which is not bad for the type of exam that was that was a tough exam that required you basically was looking for is that you had

109
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:30,880
knowledge of the concepts but also were able to integrate them and clearly express kind of a integrated answer to a complex question.

110
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:36,520
And that's hard and that's also tiring to have to do it so many times for that scope of time in the exam.

111
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:43,120
So again, read the comments that I made. Let me know. I'm happy to meet with you if you want to discuss it in more detail.

112
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:51,190
And then the other thing to remember, like I said, I'm not I'm not unhappy at all with that average sounding good.

113
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:57,610
Remember that the homeworks which are how to give away points right, is worth 50% of your grade.

114
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,520
So if the stars were not aligned for you and you had a midterm exam where you know,

115
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:10,120
it wasn't quite the result that you expected, each exam is only worth 25%.

116
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:15,040
And, you know, if you find yourself kind of on the wrong end of that curve, things didn't quite click.

117
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,170
You didn't quite figure out yet how did the exam.

118
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,370
I'm perfectly happy and willing to disproportionately wait your final if there is improvement shown in the final.

119
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,440
Okay. And again, come talk to me if your questions about your individual situation.

120
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:34,480
But remember that the homeworks are designed to be pretty easy points.

121
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,990
They're worth kind of a lot a large percentage of the class. That's intentional because they're intended to kind of help you learn the material.

122
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:49,630
Obviously, we have to assess in some way, but it's not the end of the world if you didn't do quite as well on the midterm as you had hoped.

123
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:55,740
And actually, traditionally in this class, the midterm people do more poorly on the midterm than on the final.

124
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:03,280
Probably has something to do with the material somewhat more conceptual. Also, it's the first time they're taking an exam of this point,

125
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,540
and then usually people get all nervous and scared straight for the final and they do better.

126
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,280
But either way, all right, as any I know, it's kind of broad.

127
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,560
You've had your exams uploaded yet, but like I said, I will do that after this class and it questions on that.

128
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,470
All right. Let us talk about kidney.

129
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:35,330
What's my time? All nervous about time with this. Okay. Hopefully you can sort of see that back there now that we don't have the screen anymore.

130
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,590
All right. So today we're going to first do kidney structure and function.

131
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:45,050
Okay. So there are a number of different kidney functions.

132
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,640
Obviously, one of the most obvious ones is the excretion of metabolic waste.

133
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,820
So the kidney has a filtering function for blood and removes metabolic waste products,

134
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,920
so filters them out of the blood and into the urinary tubule to be excreted in urine.

135
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,660
Okay. And that is very important for us. Also, an elimination of toxicants.

136
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:11,480
Kidney has other functions, though, and these include things like the regulation of fluid volume.

137
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:19,100
So we'll see in this lecture how there's certain structural elements of the kidney that help us with our regulation of water balance.

138
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,380
And this is also related to blood pressure.

139
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:30,709
So water balance, whether urine is concentrated, so whether there's more reabsorption of water from the urinary filtrate or if urine is dilute,

140
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:36,740
if there is excretion or a decrease in the absorption of water that regulates the body water balance.

141
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:43,790
And again, this is also related to blood pressure as part of its function of excretion of waste.

142
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,850
The kidney is also involved with the excretion of toxicants.

143
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:51,800
And there are also detoxifying enzymes within the kidney itself.

144
00:13:52,610 --> 00:14:01,290
So these include the phase one oxidant oxidizing drug hydrolyzed enzymes that we talked about last time in the liver.

145
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:07,700
So things that create functional groups. There are also conjugating enzymes as part of phase two metabolism in the kidney.

146
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:12,770
And then there is what's sometimes referred to as phase three metabolism.

147
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:20,720
And the most common enzymatic example of that are beta lysis, which are enzymes that remove particular conjugates.

148
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,750
And we'll talk about an example of that. So these are located in particular portions of the kidney.

149
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,790
And then finally, the kidney also has some metabolic and hormonal functions.

150
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,680
So some endocrine functions that we are not going to really have time to get into today.

151
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:45,460
But there are things that might pertain to systems that you're studying in other contexts, or these include activation of vitamin D.

152
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,820
So vitamin D, as you probably know, is involved in absorption of calcium.

153
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:56,660
We get vitamin D from the sun, but we also have a form of vitamin D that has to be activated in the kidney.

154
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:02,870
So in individuals with kidney failure or kidney damage, there actually can be abnormalities of calcium absorption.

155
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,410
And that's related to the inability to activate vitamin D.

156
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:15,260
And then the kidney also produces a hormone called erythropoietin that affects the bone marrow to influence red blood cell generation.

157
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:22,340
So again, with people in kidney failure, one very common clinical finding for people in kidney failure is anemia,

158
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,700
and that's typically due to the decrease in erythropoietin.

159
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:35,150
Okay, so those are kind of extra functions, but we're going to concentrate mostly on the excretory water balance and detoxifying functions.

160
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:46,520
But first, let's try to understand the structure. So here we have a cartoon and then a low magnification image of the kidney showing the cortex,

161
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,270
which is the outer portion and the medulla, which is the inner portion.

162
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,930
And what we're going to kind of see so grossly, when you look at the kidney, there's kind of a dense cellular coating,

163
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:01,840
which is the cortex, and then there's the cellular coating that looks a little bit less dense.

164
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,000
And it has to do with the orientation of the tubules, which is the medulla.

165
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:11,750
And basically this kidney is made up of a large number of tubular units that we'll see are called nephrons.

166
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:16,130
And the outer portion of those nephrons is all arranged in this outer cortex.

167
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:21,290
As the blood gets filtered, the urinary filtrate is all going to cool.

168
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:28,220
It's going to get collected into tubes in the medulla and all pool towards these points at the base of each of these globules.

169
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,940
And after the pee, those are the renal people up. So basically we have the filtration part on the outside.

170
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:41,780
Then we have tubules collecting the filtrate and those kind of combine to larger tubules that the urinary pillar,

171
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:51,530
renal pillar in this image, where is it right here. And then from there, the filtrate then as it enters into a larger tubules,

172
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:58,640
sort of like a sister in the renal pelvis and that's going to empty into the ureter, go to the urinary bladder and to the urethra.

173
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,450
Okay. So it's like kind of like a drain, if you will.

174
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:11,660
Okay. So we have cortex, the medulla, we have renal papillae and those emptying into the renal pelvis, which is the beginning part of the ureter.

175
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:20,390
There are species differences in the number of lobes present in the kidney and the degree of fusion.

176
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,930
And probably the best the coolest example of this are in ruminants.

177
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:31,870
So this is a cow kidney. Which looks like a bunch of little kidneys all stuck together because they are very well-defined globules.

178
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,700
So each kidney is kind of a miniature entity of the kidney has like a court that's a module and a pillar.

179
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:44,320
And then there's a whole bunch of them, like a bunch of grapes. In some species, these individual globules in development fuze.

180
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,490
And the ultimate example of that is a carnivore where they've all fuzed.

181
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:54,100
So it all looks like just one globule that's a dog kidney and that a pig has

182
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,759
kind of an intermediary version of it where there is some fusion of a cortex,

183
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,350
but the people are still separate. And this is the one that's probably most like a human kidney.

184
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,400
Like that one I showed you previously was a fetal human kidney.

185
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:15,640
So species differences in the number of lobes and degree of fusion, but the basic mechanism of filtering from the cortex to the papillae is the same.

186
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,860
Here's another weird species related difference. These are bird kidneys.

187
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,540
Rectum kidneys are very similar. These are lobular itd, but it's a little bit less organized structure.

188
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:35,140
I didn't give you a history of it and that they are kind of a long dated structure up against sort of the back of the animal.

189
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:41,210
I mean, our mammalian kidneys are up against the back as well. But these are less of a, you know, like a kidney B, in shape.

190
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,410
These are more modulated structures up against the back of the animal.

191
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:52,660
And then the other interesting thing about birds, it's a little bit of a jeebies, is that the ureter, there's no bladder in a bird or reptile.

192
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,340
The ureter empties into the same receptacle as the end of the GI system does.

193
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:05,110
So there's a structure called a cloaca, which you receive, which is sort of the end of both the digestive and the urinary system in those species.

194
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,980
But in mammals, obviously, that's separate. Yeah, just the fuzed.

195
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:17,410
I'm assuming just based on these examples of fuzed versus not fuzed has to do with dietary differences like metabolites or something.

196
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,249
Yeah. Most likely because the ruminants tend to have them also modulated.

197
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,430
And a pig is an omnivore like a human. Okay.

198
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,430
So is that like. Well.

199
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,840
Passive. Different, probably.

200
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:39,880
I'm trying to think if I can, I try not to think about it, to articulate it more specifically why I like plant materials.

201
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,940
I'm thinking like oxalate. Yeah. Okay.

202
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,820
I'm not sure if that would be related to, like, toxicant exposure.

203
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,040
Like if you protect. Yeah, that's probably too complex.

204
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,590
I don't know. I'd have to think about it a little bit more. Yeah. Sorry.

205
00:19:53,620 --> 00:20:01,360
So, yeah, there's definitely a dietary related or, um, I think if there's exceptions to that.

206
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,370
Hmm. I don't know. I have to think about it a little bit more.

207
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:13,270
That's a second thought question to me. And I am a dietitian, so I'm thinking about food.

208
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:22,550
I'm not really that relevant. You know, I think if I remember correctly, I think marine mammals.

209
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,809
Have kidneys that are more like this category.

210
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:35,740
That would be salts, maybe salt regulation, maybe. But I don't know. I'll think about it like someone's thesis in the making.

211
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:43,420
Okay. So that was kind of structure part. The renal vascular supply is what we're going to go over next.

212
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:49,929
So the major blood supply to the kidneys is a little bit more simple than the liver,

213
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:57,660
in that we have one main blood supply to the kidney and that's via the renal artery, which is a branch.

214
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:01,420
Well, there's two of them, but these are branches of the aorta.

215
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,939
So the renal artery supplies both substrate blood.

216
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,200
So blood that's going to be filtered and oxygen supply.

217
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:17,080
So remember in the liver, we had the portal vein bringing blood that was substrate blood from the digestive tract,

218
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:24,900
but the hepatic artery was bringing blood that was oxygenated. And then those systems kind of blew together in the in the liver, in the kidney.

219
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,420
It's filtering not the GI contents, it's filtering the blood.

220
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,240
So the blood is coming from the renal artery branch off the aorta, and that's also oxygenated blood.

221
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:41,530
And the structure is basically where this arterial blood enters at the highlights and then branches within the kidneys.

222
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:49,650
It's a little bit hard to see here, but there's little branches coming up between the walls and then coursing through the cortex itself.

223
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:57,800
And as we'll see in a minute, the branches within the kidney, once you get up to the cortex, get really, really small, become little arterials.

224
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,620
And the arterials, you're still in the arterial system. You haven't hit a capillary yet.

225
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,780
The arterials are the location where infiltration takes place.

226
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:17,139
So we'll see what that looks like in a minute. After filtration, the arterials get smaller and smaller and become a capillary system.

227
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:25,480
And that as the bridge between the arterial on the venous systems and then the venous the deoxygenated blood kind of parallels.

228
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,159
So now again go the other way.

229
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:33,670
We have all our branching stuff happening here and now we're going to pull all of this blood up to what exits the kidney via the renal vein.

230
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,520
So we have to kind of parallel trees, arterial and venous and interconnecting capillaries between them.

231
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,790
The kidneys have a huge demand on cardiac output.

232
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:54,100
Their job is to filter blood so they receive between 20 and 25% of the cardiac output.

233
00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:02,740
So the renal artery is a pretty important artery and this is enough to filter the entire blood volume about 60 times a day.

234
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,129
So that's very effective for filtering.

235
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:14,320
But it also leaves the kidney pretty vulnerable to toxicants that might find their way into the blood filtering all this blood.

236
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,940
Another important thing is we have to maintain our blood volume because that relates to blood pressure.

237
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:27,700
So we're not going to want to dump everything out of the blood. And part of the kidneys job is to re absorb portions of the filtrate and that includes

238
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:33,160
both metabolites that are useful for the body that it wants to kind of recycle and water.

239
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:39,889
Okay. So 99% of the substances that are filtered are actually of the total volume, I should say,

240
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:48,280
if a filtrate is reabsorbed and that leaves sort of an average amount of urine containing metabolites in water that are excreted daily.

241
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:59,590
Okay. But this is very variable because the amount that gets reabsorbed is responsive to changes in blood pressure, changes in hydration state.

242
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:05,649
So there's some flexibility within the kidney to control some absorption is kind of static,

243
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:12,160
is a fixed amount and some water absorption is actually variable depending on the body blood pressure,

244
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,700
state and other concentration of the urinary filtrate.

245
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,100
So we'll see how that works. Okay.

246
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:24,940
So your blood supply takes a lot of blood flow to the blood reabsorb water to control blood pressure and water volume.

247
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,170
And the functional unit that does all this absorption is the nephron.

248
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,450
So let's look at that. So the nephron functional unit of the kidney.

249
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:40,390
So here we have a cartoon that I'm trying to draw out, sort of parallel to where it is in the kidney.

250
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:48,490
The cortex itself is made up of thousands and thousands of nephrons, and that's just one of them sort of blown out.

251
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,839
So this part, this is my kidney side again.

252
00:24:52,840 --> 00:25:01,450
This is the cortex, roughly. This is the middle. And this is drawn parallel to the cortex and the medulla right in this cartoon.

253
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,090
So and remember, there's tons of these nephrons inside the kidney.

254
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:15,070
So what is the basic structure of the nephron? Nephron? It's a junction between blood supply and the epithelium of the kidney.

255
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,940
So the junction itself is this renal corpuscle.

256
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,530
The renal corpuscle essentially a word, meaning a little body.

257
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,940
The real core puzzle looks like a little ball and we'll show it in a higher magnification in a minute.

258
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:36,030
Hard to see on this thing, but it has the arterial loops that will be filtered.

259
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:41,190
So the word glomerular refers to the sort of work like collection of loops.

260
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,880
These are tiny diameter arteries, so they're arterials.

261
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,460
So we're still in the arterial system and this is the state of filtration.

262
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:58,410
So the arterials form this little more black loop that enters, that is surrounded by the yellow thing, which is like the open end of a tube.

263
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,040
So if I had a balloon, that's actually how it happens in development.

264
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,080
You have a ball of cells and the glomeruli infiltrate like me punching my fist into a balloon.

265
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:18,150
So all the epithelial cells sort of space around this glomerular loop, the glomerulus is the blood vessel structures.

266
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:23,070
Bowman's capsule is the main to this widens this cistern like space.

267
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,709
Okay, sometimes when you're here, people talk about the kidney, they'll use these words kind of interchangeably,

268
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:33,510
and that's actually kind of fine, but that's what the basic definition of each of them are.

269
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,880
Okay, so that's the junction between the blood system and the tubule system.

270
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:47,850
So you're going to have a substance that substances that are going across this filtration membrane and entering the tubule system,

271
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,270
which is the whole thing drawn here, it's all twined around.

272
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,590
And the first part of it is the proximal meaning close proximal means near too close to the primary,

273
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,130
less convoluted because it's really twisting and turning.

274
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:08,489
That's the proximal convoluted tubule. Okay. That's a very long epithelial tubule.

275
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:17,250
And it needs all that length because that's the site of most active resorption of nutrients, the metabolites that the kidney wants to retain.

276
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:23,700
Okay. So the proximal plus proximal convoluted tubule is in the cortex.

277
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,510
That's the portion of the to build its closest to that glomerulus.

278
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:37,350
Then the tubule takes a little detour and goes looping way down into the medulla.

279
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:45,250
And overall, that has different components that you don't know for the path, but it's the loop of heavily that loops way down into the medulla.

280
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:50,890
This is an area where water resorption takes place, salt absorption takes place,

281
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:57,550
and there's sort of a osmotic gradient with to control some of that resorption with the substances in the medulla.

282
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:01,570
But basically it takes this diversionary loop and that's also the site.

283
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:08,260
If you follow the blood system, that's where the capillaries are joining the arterial and the venous blood system.

284
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:20,650
And then the tubule goes back up and amazingly, it actually goes back up to to a location that's very close to the glamorous where it originated.

285
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,180
So it's not just random. And then this is the distal convoluted tubule.

286
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,960
So we're still in the nephron, the distal convoluted tubule.

287
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:33,490
And like I said, it comes in really close proximity to the glomerulus where it originated.

288
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,070
Kind of amazing how developmental it's able to do that.

289
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,170
And this is important because there are regulatory cells here that sense sort of the osmotic pressure

290
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:50,480
in the tubule at this portion and sends signals to the release that regulate the blood flow.

291
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:58,240
So it's a way you can kind of regulate the amount of filtration that growth goes across the glomerular filtration membrane.

292
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:04,360
So if you need to relax and dilate the arterials to get more blood to flow in, if you need to constrict them,

293
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,240
there are sensory mechanisms and feedback mechanisms in this distal tubule that regulate

294
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,180
the pressure at it's individual glomerulus because it's tied to its own kind of origins.

295
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,880
That's the distal convoluted tubule.

296
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:29,499
And then it goes again back to the medulla in a larger diameter tubule, which is the collecting duct that's moving towards the renal pelvis.

297
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,960
So that's where it's collecting what's going to become urine.

298
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:39,700
And there's also some water resorption that occurs there and then that goes to the renal pelvis and into the urine.

299
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,430
Okay. So we have this twisted turny thing consists of the actual filtration,

300
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:52,720
so we real corpuscle proximal convoluted tubule, loop distal tubule and collecting duct.

301
00:29:52,990 --> 00:30:00,970
So that's one nephron and there's many, many of them in the kidney. So let's look a little bit closer at that actual filtration site.

302
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:09,760
So this is the renal corpuscle itself. So the red thing obviously is the glomerular are the arterials.

303
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:14,980
And then you can kind of see gets a sense of this bulge epithelial cells around it.

304
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:23,040
So the vascular structure consists of afferent meaning to an efferent arterials.

305
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:26,200
I think it was marked so there's the afferent arterial.

306
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,510
So that's bringing in blood that's going to be filtered.

307
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:36,430
So the blood enters through the apparent arterial into the Bowman's capsule and then it forms this essentially capillary system,

308
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:44,470
but it's all kind of on the arterial side. So there's a bunch of capillaries that have some leak in us to them and we'll see what that's comprised of.

309
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:52,320
And then the direction of filtration is across these arterial capillaries into this kind of system.

310
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:58,030
So that's the urinary filtrate going out into the proximal tubule and the urinary

311
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:04,330
filtrate and then the remaining blood exits the glomerulus via the different arterial.

312
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:16,750
Okay, the bowman's capsule itself is just really a dilated end of the proximal renal tubule, which has a cuboid of epithelial lining.

313
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:24,070
So as you point out, the film and Bowman's capsule, depending on the species, can either be kind of flattened, epithelium or cuboid.

314
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,639
So there's actually some sex differences, particularly in mice.

315
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:34,210
In male mice, this is more cuboid L type epithelium. So I don't know what it is, but it's probably some hormonal influence.

316
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,400
All right. So that's the glamorous. And so there's the Meredith cartoon again.

317
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,810
Right? So here's our little blood structure. Here's the Bowman's capsule.

318
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:53,950
And then if you take a slice of one of these capillary structures, so it's blowing up here, this is the actual glomerular filtration membrane,

319
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,020
or each of these capillaries has the glomerular filtration membrane, which has three parts.

320
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,740
And part of it is the and it's like any vessel,

321
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:08,799
it's lined by endothelium which are flat squamous epithelial cells that for some reason in this diagram

322
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:17,020
is drawn as Swiss cheese because the endothelium in the glomerular filtration membrane is porous.

323
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:23,380
So what they're trying to illustrate here is that the inner lining of these vessels is porous.

324
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,370
So that's easy for materials from the blood to get through.

325
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:37,170
So it's a pretty leaky. Capillary. The next layer is the basement membrane of the endothelium,

326
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:44,820
which is which is actually fuzed and shared with the basement membrane of these epithelial cells.

327
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:48,000
So this is now the tubule side, blood tubule.

328
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:54,810
So there's epithelial cells called portal sites that are on the two wheel side of the structure.

329
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,530
And those two guys share a fuzed basement membrane.

330
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:08,070
The basement membrane has a negative charge. And so that also restricts filtration across the glomerular filtration membrane.

331
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,600
So it favors filtration of substances that have a neutral charge.

332
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,200
So many biologic molecules have a negative charge. So often they need to be bound to something in order to go across.

333
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:27,870
So there's a charge limit. And then the monocyte, which is the epithelial cell, is like an octopus type cell and has lots of little feet.

334
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:32,850
And then they have long sort of fingers on it and kind of fetal fingers wrapped around this capillary.

335
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:39,780
And the space between the fingers is actually covered by an excreted tenacious matrix,

336
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:49,350
but they're split like spaces between those foot processes that are called the filtration foot, and that's another barrier to filtration.

337
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:59,130
So you have to be small enough to fit between those filtration slits in order to exit the glamorous exit the primary filtration membrane.

338
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,620
Okay, so policy parameters split. So it's referring to these foot processes.

339
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:14,220
Okay. So the glomerular filtration membrane is comprised of these three things and so you can see it restricts filtration by size.

340
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:19,860
That has to do with the endothelium and the filtration slits of the inside and also by charge.

341
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:30,390
And damage to this structure can either limit the ability to filtrate or more commonly damage things to make filtration less selective.

342
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,860
So you start losing protein and things across that filtration membrane.

343
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:40,740
And this is kind of an electron microscopy image of it. It's a little bit hard to follow, but this is the capillary movement.

344
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,880
So here's where the blood is.

345
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:50,370
This is these little things on this side are endothelial cells, and then this is the shared basement membrane and then the porter.

346
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:54,959
So you can kind of see in fragments this is just a two dimensional view.

347
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,070
But here's the cell itself and here are its little foot processes.

348
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:04,530
Here's a good work. You can see it's sitting right on the end of psyllium. And then if you magnify that square, I'll show you the picture.

349
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:15,270
I'll grab your question with that. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. No, we're so blood endothelial cells, the set of striated pores, basement membrane.

350
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:22,140
And then these are the foot processes of the prevalence of the parasite, and that's the direction of filtration.

351
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:26,430
Did you start gibberish? I was going to ask on that one.

352
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:34,950
There's that. Yeah. Sorry, I just. For orientation. Yeah. Is the circle like are we looking down a capillary burn down.

353
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:38,280
Yeah. So I don't have a good picture here.

354
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,659
Here's a capillary. So like, let me think. Like it's like chopped open.

355
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,350
Yeah, yeah. So if I have three vessels going this way. Going this way.

356
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:50,309
Yeah. And I chop it and then I have my parasites. I don't like this.

357
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:57,030
Yeah. If I chop my vessels like. Yeah, okay. Sorry, I did one capillary, two capillary, three capillary.

358
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,149
And then this is the other part of it. Thank you. Yeah. Electron microscopy.

359
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,840
Because you don't have the color even to help you. It's much harder to learn, in my view.

360
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,660
To learn to interpret. All right.

361
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:14,879
I don't know why I chose to do horrible picture for this, but this is just an overview of, like, I did, like 100 pictures of kidneys, so many.

362
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,970
And I chose this, but I have better ones later.

363
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:24,480
Don't worry. So this is a picture of the cortex showing you all these structures with lots of distracting arrows.

364
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:29,370
The glomeruli look like little balls, so if you're looking at little magnification, they're easy to recognize.

365
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:34,560
Well, all the new the nuclei are mixed. Some of the nuclei that you're seeing are proteins that nuclei.

366
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,840
There are also cells called besan gel cells that are in a particular location.

367
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:46,080
And there are also some leukocytes, but there shouldn't be very many white blood cells in there unless there's abnormalities.

368
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,059
And then the capillaries that are in that glomerulus are really hard to see unless you zoom in.

369
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,360
So like mostly what you're just going to notice is like a ball. Okay?

370
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,800
And then in the cortex, all those tubules all wound together.

371
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:05,860
Imagine like a bowl of spaghetti that if you cut a cross-section through it, some things are going to be straight circles, right?

372
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:10,230
I'm going to hear this. Others are going to be longitudinal. Others are going to be kind of tangential.

373
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,060
So the way you can recognize the picture of cortex is you'll see the balls, the glomeruli,

374
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,260
and then you'll see kind of a whole hodgepodge of non parallel tubules, right?

375
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:28,149
Because it's just like a ball of spaghetti. The medulla, which I'll show you in a minute, has lined up tubules.

376
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:32,460
So everything's parallel. So it's easier to recognize that there are no glomeruli present it.

377
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:39,630
Okay, so what do all those tubules do? So the renal tubules job is to collect and modify filtrate.

378
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:48,000
So here's our diagram again with the proximal convoluted tubule, the loop of Henllys, the DCT or distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct.

379
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:54,000
So the proximal tubule is kind of the longest portion, the most convoluted portion,

380
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,810
and its job is to reabsorb things that are important to the kidney.

381
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,560
So there's some fixed amount of water resorption here.

382
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:05,010
So there's a certain amount of water resorption that happens no matter what.

383
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:12,150
But another important job of the proximal convoluted tubule is to reabsorb some ions and organic nutrients.

384
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:17,580
So it's just metabolites that are necessary to the kidney that doesn't want to waste, it doesn't want to lose.

385
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:25,229
So this is an area that's quite vulnerable to toxicity because a lot of drugs tend to hitch rides on some of those organic nutrients,

386
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:33,630
for example, and get absorbed in this area. And because these epithelial cells are designed to endoscopes material from the filtrate,

387
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:38,160
they have the potential for accumulating toxicants in a high concentration.

388
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:49,410
So absorption proximal convoluted tubule. The loop of Henllys has some resorption of water occurring here and also sodium.

389
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:57,899
So this is really kind of setting up a concentration gradient. That function is a little bit more important in some species with a long medulla.

390
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,520
So there's more water resorption in species where water conservation is critical.

391
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,490
So like desert species like. All these desert rat things.

392
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,950
They have a really long medulla to their kidney.

393
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:14,870
So like gerbils and things like that, it's a little bit less important than humans, but it still has the same basic function.

394
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:18,200
And then the distal convoluted tubule is important.

395
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:26,060
It has some secretory functions, but the main thing we're going to concentrate on is its role is to regulate the variable reabsorption of water.

396
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,990
So you'll see there are some sensing mechanisms in the distal convoluted tubule

397
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:34,550
that influence how much water we absorb in the variable portion of the tubule,

398
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:43,460
because the proximal tubule absorbs a whole lot of things. A kind of a fixed rate loop of Henley is sodium and chloride, some water resorption,

399
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:48,020
but then the distal convoluted tubule is the regulatory site for water absorption.

400
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:55,160
And then the some of the same factors that affect this reabsorption also affect water absorption in the collecting duct.

401
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:06,680
Okay, this may be a stupid question, but does the rate of that change the rate of like of like I guess in this case it's blood rate moving through.

402
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:13,550
Does that rate like if you're like more physically active or something, is it moving through faster or is that so?

403
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:21,739
Yeah. So the glomerular filtration rate is a measurable thing, but mostly that refers to the volume of blood.

404
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:26,510
Well, the volume of blood moving across a per unit of time.

405
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,929
So like if you're dehydrated,

406
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:39,979
it's going to drop the great merit or filtration rate and you're going to be less able to sort of excrete toxicants or substances.

407
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,330
If you're drinking a lot of water,

408
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:46,610
it's going to maintain a certain pressure in the release of a volume that goes through per time is going to be higher.

409
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:50,660
So yes, that is variable. Okay. Okay.

410
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:53,659
This is a little bit better histology pictures of how things look.

411
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:58,160
So this is the cortex showing you the difference between proximal and distal tubules.

412
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,000
The right hand side is an HD section, the same that we always use.

413
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:08,780
So the proximal tubules, it's all kind of cuboid, all or local na epithelium.

414
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:14,050
The proximal tubules have a little bit taller epithelium and there's also a brush board.

415
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:19,820
It's hard to see here. You'd have to zoom in. So the top of it looks a little bit broken up, and that's because there's a brush border,

416
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:26,030
but the proximal convoluted tubules have a little bit taller, so the distal cells look more like a true cube.

417
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:31,549
They have a much lower cell profile, so distal to those of the cells are a little closer together.

418
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:35,270
So it looks more basic. Fill it because the nuclei kind of Typekit tighter together.

419
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:42,110
Most of the tubule profiles you see in the cortex the are proximal tubules because that's a longer section.

420
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:47,990
And then the the stain here, right, is a stain that makes the membranes really obvious.

421
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:52,130
So this is outlining the membrane around each of these tubules.

422
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:59,420
And remember your bowl of spaghetti analogy. So again, cutting spaghetti across like this looks like it's a discrete structure,

423
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:03,799
but it's really about imagine a tubule like curving like this and I cut the top of it.

424
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,459
I'm going to get this sort of angular representation of it. Does that make sense?

425
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:14,730
That's like a tangential view of it. And this one's just cut straight on all spaghetti to the.

426
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:18,520
It also helps show up. The practice of that brush border again shows it better than.

427
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:27,160
Okay. So that's court cortex. Blue spaghetti usually see comparison to medulla.

428
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:32,890
Everything's lined up. So if I cut the medulla across, I'm going to get all cross-sections like this.

429
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:39,700
And if I cut it longitudinally, I'm going to get everything longitudinal. So it's pretty easy to see the difference histologically.

430
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:46,240
All those little letters are showing you the different portions of the loop of Henley.

431
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:50,010
Don't worry about that for this class. I'm not going to ask you to identify those.

432
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:54,850
I just want you to know the difference visually if I show you a picture of a cortex versus medulla.

433
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:06,810
Okay, so we're talk about a little bit. This is just another pretty stain with the collecting duct showing evidence of this side.

434
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:09,639
This is the world's most complex slide. Don't worry.

435
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:16,150
We're not going to ask this if somebody is like master study slide, it seems for med school has everything on it,

436
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:24,400
but we're going to use it for a very defined purpose to show the sites of filtrate, filtrate modification and water balance.

437
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:29,920
So the proximal tubule, I told you, is very active in terms of absorption,

438
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:34,720
but the absorption that occurs here is the necessary sort of fixed rate absorption.

439
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:39,580
So there's now a lot of variability in that section that's necessary absorption.

440
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:47,319
Then the loop of Henley going down into the medulla has to do with concentrating the filtrate.

441
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:51,100
So there's some variable absorption here or fine tuning of absorption here.

442
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,310
There's some water absorption and salt absorption.

443
00:43:54,970 --> 00:44:00,250
So water and again, that's not very I shouldn't have said very well, this is more fixed,

444
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:05,560
just fine tuning because you're you're going to want to absorb some water back from the urinary filtrate.

445
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:11,590
And then the part where it's really variable is in the distal tubule and the collecting dust.

446
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,580
So this is the site of the major control mechanisms for water conservation.

447
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:17,220
Okay.

448
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:26,140
So fixed absorption of everything, fine tuning, which is regulated by water and salt, and then this is the variable portion for urinary concentration.

449
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,620
So how does that happen?

450
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:39,910
Well, there's a structure called the justa meaning near glomerular apparatus, the just glomerular apparatus which regulates water balance.

451
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:49,380
There are three components to it. A portion of the distal convoluted tubule called the macula denser, which means dense spot.

452
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:56,590
It's all very logical to flatten the messenger cells and the just the glomerular cells.

453
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:03,940
So look at this. So the macula denser is just a portion of the distal convoluted tubule where the

454
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:08,800
cells are really crowded together that's very close to the to the glomerulus.

455
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:12,400
So it's going to be hard to see that really stupid arrows on top of it.

456
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:20,499
But this part of the distal tubule, this nuclear travels right next to each other, this is just the concentrated portion of the distal tubule.

457
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,700
That's the macula Dexter.

458
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:30,520
Then there are cells, really strange, mysterious cells called messenger cells that kind of have markers of phagocytes that are kind of like tissue,

459
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,740
macrophages, but they also have smooth muscle cell markers, embryo.

460
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,720
Logically, they're very strange cells. Nobody knows exactly what they are.

461
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:44,770
But these cells form essential cells are located outside of the blood, very sort of in the junction between that.

462
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:49,630
So probably the tubule and the different in different arterials.

463
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,560
Um, and we'll see a little bit what they do in a minute.

464
00:45:53,800 --> 00:46:01,900
And then finally there are just the glomerular cells which are also kind of located in that sort of triangle area.

465
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:11,980
But these have smooth muscle function and they can regulate the dilation state of the ether under efferent arterials.

466
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,970
So the constricting cells that regulate blood flow.

467
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:21,550
All right. So that whole thing is the jumpstart glomerular apparatus.

468
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:32,110
And what happens is the macula dense. So that specialized area of the distal convoluted tubule is sensitive to either low osmotic pressure,

469
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:37,540
so low sodium essentially, or low blood pressure at the distal tubule.

470
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:45,129
So think that what that means, if we have a decreased flow of blood through the filtration system, it's going to go all the way through that tubule.

471
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:51,520
It's going to get to the distal convoluted tubule and immaculate death is going to no notice either that there's not

472
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:59,229
enough pressure in the tubule or that the sodium content is low and it interprets the sodium content as being low,

473
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:04,600
meaning that there's not enough blood because like the sodium, it's assuming I mean, it doesn't rain.

474
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,470
I think it's assuming that the sodium content of the blood is fixed.

475
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:14,290
So that signal of low sodium is signaling there's not enough blood flow through the glomerulus.

476
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:19,510
So that's that signal. And then the macula just says.

477
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:25,550
And signals to the jester glomerular cells and they secrete red a substance called red

478
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:34,520
in red in gives the locals signal to the efferent arterial who's trying to boost.

479
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:40,460
Basically, the whole thing is designed to keep a steady state of blood across the glomerular filtration membrane.

480
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:51,020
So the efferent arterial, if that gets constricted, the blood flowing out of Meredith is going to be a little constricted.

481
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:55,040
So that's going to boost my blood pressure, a little capillary loop.

482
00:47:55,790 --> 00:48:03,440
Okay, so Redman controls the local flow in the Glomerulus by the constriction state of that different arterial.

483
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,309
And as we'll see in a minute, it also has systemic effects.

484
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:13,820
It does some other things that help trigger water conservation because it's thinking, oh, no, blood pressure is low,

485
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:22,489
we need to increase the volume in the whole system and then of asenjo cells to affect veins of pressure in a

486
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:29,300
little bit more variable way that can cause constriction or dilation of the afferent or efferent arterials.

487
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:36,980
So they're just kind of maintain that pressure in the system. And that's the weird part of your cells, their smooth muscle function.

488
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:45,709
So I would yeah, do both low sodium and low blood pressure have to be like have to be present or what happens.

489
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:49,700
Like if there's low sodium but there's not actually low lot.

490
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:53,960
Yeah, that signal or like would that catch it before I got to that point?

491
00:48:54,080 --> 00:49:06,200
Great question. So in the normal state, if blood pressure is low, sodium will automatically be low because there's not as much blood flowing through.

492
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:12,590
If you have a actually, that's a really good question. If you're losing sodium somewhere.

493
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:17,730
So if you're kidney tubules, sodium is one of the things gets absorbed.

494
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:23,120
If you're in renal failure and you're not absorbing sodium, absorbing sodium the way you should,

495
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:30,320
the distal convoluted tubule is going to get a message that there's low sodium even if your blood pressure and volume is actually fine.

496
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,460
And so it's going to cause constriction. Oh, no, we need to get more blood in.

497
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:41,270
If the if the true fact of the matter was not that the blood was low, that's actually going to be a cause of hypertension.

498
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,260
And that actually in people with renal failure,

499
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:49,549
hypertension is one of the symptoms or one of the signs that can be very complicating for renal failure.

500
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:54,500
And it's because of this dysregulation of renin and of this water constipation mechanism.

501
00:49:54,530 --> 00:50:00,320
That's an excellent, excellent question. So, yeah, so like ordinary state, those two things go together.

502
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:03,799
But if you have a dysregulated state, like we're not absorbing sodium for some reason,

503
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,100
or if you have another endocrine disorder where you don't have that,

504
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,150
that can dysregulated system and one of the side effects can actually be hypertension.

505
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:21,830
So memory loss, I think I went through all this. So the net effect is that the memory of the GFR that Mary filtration rate is preserved.

506
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:29,360
Marinus These are those weird meson joe cells, very mysterious, really cool cells, but kind of spooky and weird.

507
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:34,280
So I talked about their smooth muscle function. They have a constriction function.

508
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:40,250
So depending on their degree of constriction, you have differential flow of blood through the different arterials,

509
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,809
but they're also like macrophages, so they have phagocytic activity.

510
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:51,200
So if something comes through in the glomerular lot, in the blood flow like bacteria, which are essentially particles,

511
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:56,330
these are the cells like the poop resides in the liver that will phagocytosis those particles.

512
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:03,680
So they're kind of a tissue resident macrophage. So they have both macrophage markers and smooth muscle cell markers.

513
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,210
Nobody knows what they are, but they are both an immune function and they raise the regulatory function.

514
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:13,610
Really cause of. Yes. Do they respond to like interleukins?

515
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:20,930
I believe yes. I believe so. I think they respond like a macrophage and I think they actually secrete some of the same.

516
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:26,140
There might be some differences, but I think they secrete some of the same interleukins that a macrophage would.

517
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:32,390
So they would be one of the sort of on site responding cells in an acute inflammatory phase.

518
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,110
And actually with these capillaries being so small,

519
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:44,059
if you do have like if you have a disseminated bacteremia and your bacteria circulating through the blood, you like sepsis.

520
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:47,990
If you have disseminated bacteria in your system or toxins in your system,

521
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:55,729
renal glomerular capillaries are one of the first sites that you see thrombi that's like one histologic sign of sepsis,

522
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:03,530
and it has to do with dysregulation or damage to the smas and your visa constrictor mechanism you can get from those little capillaries.

523
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:11,510
Okay, so renin I said acted locally kind of affect arterial or constriction through the text of the mariner cells.

524
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:17,479
But renin also goes into the system. It's like you're trying to tell the body, we have a problem, we need more water here.

525
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,220
What are we going to do about it? So. Low.

526
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:28,040
Here we have our situation low glomerular filtration rate triggers GC signaling, so we have local constriction of the inherent arterial.

527
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:35,090
But renin also enters the bloodstream and in the bloodstream we have circulating angiotensin again,

528
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:42,620
which is a precursor enzyme made by the liver and that gets converted by renin to angiotensin.

529
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:46,340
So Angier you know is another word for blood vessel angiotensin.

530
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,290
You can tell kind of where it's going. Angiotensin one by itself is not vasoactive.

531
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,540
It actually gets converted by an enzyme from the lung that's made in the lung and enters

532
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:02,840
the circulation angiotensin converting enzyme to the active form which is angiotensin two.

533
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:10,130
Okay, the angiotensin two has a number of different activities on different organs.

534
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:16,070
It actually has cardiovascular activity. So it's a direct sympathetic stimulator.

535
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:20,330
So it's going to increase the heart rate, increase blood flow rate.

536
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:26,120
It also has a direct effect on arterials, so it causes vasoconstriction.

537
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:33,169
So you're trying to maintain the blood pressure that can work against you because sometimes that can decrease blood flow to the kidney,

538
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:42,920
but you're basically trying to maintain blood pressure and that angiotensin acts on the adrenal gland to tell it to produce aldosterone,

539
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:52,010
which is a water regulatory hormone, and it acts on the pituitary gland to tell it to produce anti diuretic hormone.

540
00:53:53,020 --> 00:54:03,709
So, you know, a diuretic makes you lose more water. An anti diuretic blocks that water loss and then both angiotensin two and

541
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:10,340
aldosterone affect that distal convoluted tubule to tell it to increase water.

542
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:16,280
Resorption Okay, so this is part of that regulatory system for that distal tubule.

543
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,640
You're trying to increase water reabsorption to conserve it.

544
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:26,330
Meanwhile, antidiabetic hormone increases water resorption from the collecting duct.

545
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:30,260
Okay, this is very complicated system, lots of pieces,

546
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:38,450
but it's a way that the kidney can communicate to the entire system and affect all the different things that can help us with water conservation.

547
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:45,920
So heart rate, um, absorption of the kidney itself have some intermediaries and vascular constriction.

548
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:58,800
So a lot of these names are familiar. Like if you have any recollection or of any experience from a medicine, a lot of these things are treated both.

549
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:02,230
A lot of these things are activated when a person has hypertension.

550
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:07,930
So a lot of antihypertensive agents are designed to block various aspects of this pathway.

551
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:15,250
And there is the overview. So that's kind of the easier way to kind of remember what all is happening.

552
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:21,280
So the net effect is through angiotensin to activity of conservation of water.

553
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:29,500
There are multiple factors that affect the glomerular filtration rate, some of which we've already talked about.

554
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:34,310
So the normal is depicted at the top. We can have arterial or constriction.

555
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:40,740
If you die, if you constrict the affair and arterial your decrease in the blood supply to the boom areas.

556
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:47,080
That's not good because that's actually going to drop the blood flow across the barrier filtration membrane.

557
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:56,200
If you have something obstructing like a urinary stone in the in the urinary or the re through or the bladder or anywhere,

558
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:02,139
it can cause back pressure that obstruct flow increases pressure.

559
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:06,490
And that pressure itself can block flow through through the coumarin infiltration membrane.

560
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:12,370
Or if you have damage to a tubular like some cell toxicity, you're going to have a permeability,

561
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:18,970
change and leakage and that's also going to affect glomerular filtration rate and decrease your ability to reabsorbed.

562
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,450
So the sort of things at the kidney level,

563
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:27,430
things before the kidney related to blood pressure and things sort of at the distal level related to obstruction.

564
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:32,260
All right. Let's do the toxicant metabolism and we'll take a little break.

565
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:38,590
So the real renal, the kidney is very susceptible, as you can imagine, to toxicants.

566
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:42,700
And the proximal convoluted tubule in particular is highly vulnerable.

567
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:50,050
So it has a high filtration rate. There's 20 to 25%, as I said, of the resting cardiac output.

568
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:56,800
And that means, unfortunately, that there is potential for a high volume delivery of blood toxicants to the kidney.

569
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:02,589
The convoluted tubule epithelium itself is very and also topically active.

570
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:08,470
So it's designed the first two portions in particular are designed to absorb many substances from the lumen,

571
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:14,410
and that can unfortunately cause them to be concentrated within those proximal tubule cells themselves.

572
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:21,490
So there's a potential for accumulation damage, and then some of them get reabsorbed from the proximal tubule and enter the blood.

573
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:30,309
So it can be a way of recirculating in the blood. And then the proximal tubule epithelium itself has a lot of mitochondria.

574
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:35,140
So it's a high oxygen demand tissue and so is susceptible to hypoxia.

575
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:41,710
So that's one of the first there is we often see hypoxia if the overall glomerular filtration rate is decreased.

576
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:46,600
So that's kind of the first two. They call them the segment one and segment two.

577
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,410
The one that's two segments of the proximal convoluted tubule,

578
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:59,110
most of its toxicities related to absorption or to oxygen in the distal segment, which is three.

579
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,860
So this is usually right at the junction between the medulla and the cortex.

580
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:09,850
The distal segment has a high level of phase one enzymes, so it's high in p450 enzymes.

581
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:17,460
It's kind of equivalent to that zone three in the liver. So all of the things that were toxic to the liver in that region,

582
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:26,380
so things that require p450 metabolism for their toxicity will hit usually that distal segment of the proximal convoluted tubule.

583
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:32,860
And then there also beta lives is present in this portion of the proximal convoluted tubule.

584
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:37,060
And those are enzymes that are involved in what's called phase three metabolism.

585
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:43,059
And their job is actually to remove cysteine conjugates so good.

586
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:50,020
If I don't add the cysteine conjugate right to a substance that it wants to get rid of its amino acid conjugate

587
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:57,310
and beta life activity removes the cysteine conjugate because that's an energy expensive molecule to make.

588
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:04,780
So in sort of I don't know, I guess evolutionarily it was advantageous to reabsorb those systems,

589
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:13,870
unfortunately with zero biotics where we're using the cysteine to excrete something and make it more water soluble.

590
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:23,470
Removing the cysteine conjugate often reactivates a compound that was previously inactivated so many compounds that are detoxified in the liver.

591
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:29,940
But do the final conjugation end up getting activated again in the kidney and become renal toxicants?

592
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:34,180
So here is that overview.

593
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:41,140
The loss is your first exposure to toxicants, and so a lot of the toxicity there is affected by blood volume or hydration state.

594
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:45,690
The proximal convoluted tubule has to do with toxicant concentration.

595
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:55,240
It also has a high oxygen demand and then the three portion of it has toxicity vulnerability related to phase one and phase three enzyme activity.

596
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:01,360
The medulla and the papillary regions have a low blood supply.

597
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:08,050
So if there is blood constriction so that there is vulnerable to hypoxia, that there is very vulnerable to ischemia.

598
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:12,190
So that overlap there. Yeah.

599
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:16,809
And this is just an overview side, and that's kind of enough why you can't read it from back there.

600
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:21,610
I'm sure it just lists some common toxicants and where their effect is in the kidney.

601
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:30,400
Yeah, there are. So visually, you can kind of tell the difference between these different regions of the kidney.

602
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:36,670
But if you need to for an experimental purpose or what have you, specifically define a portion of the kidney.

603
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:44,050
There are unique markers that you can use to define different segments, for example, of the proximal renal tubule.

604
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:49,520
So this is defined as transferase with a red immuno marker.

605
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:56,410
So all the ones in between are just the convoluted tubules is just kind of trying to define a particular portion.

606
01:00:56,890 --> 01:01:03,640
And then those are other markers showing collecting ducts in the brown in middle stain and tam worthwhile protein,

607
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:09,910
which is the red immunostaining and everything between it is that as three segment of the proximal tubule not marked.

608
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:16,750
So this is just kind of the same image with different immuno markers. So just showing that there are markers that can specifically distinguish these.

609
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:22,790
Okay. Let us take a little break there.

610
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:40,310
Yeah, let's take a break. That. Relations are constantly evolving.

611
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:45,440
Yes, that's right.

612
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,010
That's probably from commercial.

613
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:57,590
The other day, I did tell them any questions for 15 minutes.

614
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:06,970
I was like, all right, 15 minutes. Like I said, I don't know where you have been.

615
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:18,049
Yeah. Yeah. I do a lot of buying and selling, like, positive results, but I guess I didn't tell anyone you transferred.

616
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:26,060
Have to get that. Don't know. Yeah, that's what I was thinking than 1.5 I guess it was six weeks.

617
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:30,480
Yeah. Those summarizes every day.

618
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:34,459
Every other day. Every day. Yeah. So we had a lot of work to do.

619
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:42,800
Everything. We were very, very lax. Like, there were kids that were turning in like, oh, like five or 606 or 7 p.m.

620
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:48,110
And I would help them with everything. And I got to walk through every single thing.

621
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:56,240
It's like crap. And she didn't like it. So be like, it's like, Oh, I can't turn this into like after the semester.

622
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,260
And we're like, You can't do that. I have to give you something.

623
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:05,600
And also I can't hear you like I'm not going to be under contract again.

624
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:09,610
And I was I don't know.

625
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,850
Yeah, me neither. I think it was like it's really fun.

626
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:18,590
And I've seen so much growth and like a lot of these students are that.

627
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:24,100
Yeah, that was the first time. Like, I think they were.

628
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:29,030
They were pretty mad there.

629
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:37,890
And I'm like, Oh yeah, they like come in and like, I think it's like, it's like a full explanation of the call.

630
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:43,340
Like, like I said, freaked out. And I'm like, I like your resume, like me, like I can give it to you, right?

631
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:49,190
Yeah. I was like, Oh, yeah, I know, I know, I know.

632
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:57,860
I, you know, I have so many funny stories, and he apparently went viral.

633
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:02,910
I haven't seen anything like this recently.

634
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:05,960
Yeah, like a couple days ago, my friend sent it to us. Yeah.

635
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:17,730
Oh, my God. His frickin truck audience like I you for what you saw before because he doesn't watch romance.

636
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:23,980
It's like another day. I would feel that biologically had his.

637
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:28,219
That's so funny. I never thought I was.

638
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:31,570
You're 24. Oh, my God. Listen to me. Yeah. So I can't.

639
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:35,600
Yeah, he brought it up. Yes. Fact he didn't, but, like, he didn't show.

640
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:43,310
I'm so glad I was in my brain.

641
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:53,700
Oh, he has the services of this esteemed. But this year it's clear that this is unlikely to either.

642
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:58,790
I think it's hard to be yourself.

643
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:05,300
But how many other kids are there?

644
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:14,500
It's supposed to be for fun. I supposed to be somewhere where you can really do something.

645
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:19,820
Yeah. I mean, that isn't discipline.

646
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:29,840
Yeah. Which I think is. I don't know, this is their man, but he's really nice and I'm not sure.

647
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:36,740
I just wanted to clarify. How do you distinguish whether or not it's like a like a pair sagittal midline

648
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:42,050
versus like frontal corona accomplishments when you look at these images?

649
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:48,290
I guess like when you look at this like these images in general election, this image is actually from your state.

650
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:54,410
So I teach just my picture to kids. I teach the I teach to and the point I want to make.

651
01:05:55,370 --> 01:06:04,800
And so. Yes. And then we have three internal meeting, which just every 43 hours or are you doing point five because of them are enough?

652
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:10,460
Well, you will find that admittedly, I don't know about that three.

653
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:13,590
So that in itself is the most common.

654
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:20,900
Okay. It's weird because this part this is just, you know, this is something that causes toxicity in every three segment.

655
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:27,070
And so like the S three is where like the cortical really watered down the majority to this overlap.

656
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:31,840
And so they could see that there was there was like necrosis that they wanted to tell.

657
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:37,700
Okay. And knowing that these things overlap here, is it affecting the parts of Camille or like our cortical image?

658
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:44,660
Okay. So, like, everything, like, you know, the reason is, is that transitions that everything is pretty much.

659
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:48,380
Yeah. You not I that it's like brains all year.

660
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:55,600
Okay. So the pictures I shop on the your your point that I can make it out here.

661
01:06:55,670 --> 01:07:02,000
And so but there is sort of a junction area where things are kind of moving towards black.

662
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:07,549
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

663
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:09,520
I'm not going to ask, like, for this class something.

664
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:18,470
I'll ask you to know that the three segments appear to be a lot like a the fact is it's more sensitive to metabolize toxic because it has p450

665
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:25,450
and they like but I'm not going to show a diagram like that is going to pick out it and okay yeah it's always a little weird as a parent.

666
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:31,759
No, no, no. I mean, like things that are variable.

667
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,110
So just let me go live in a really good high school.

668
01:07:36,110 --> 01:07:46,939
We already have to that I can come up with the one that has the bad cholesterol is in the next two years, you know,

669
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:50,960
where you sort of ads out of your parents you think and then they was like

670
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:58,090
got I just I think this is so great but I feel like you're bragging about it.

671
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:01,200
You didn't get the 500 no test.

672
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:04,810
So why are you here? This is embarrassing. You need to.

673
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:09,130
And if I remember how to shut my mouth. Good.

674
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:21,410
So far. All right, guys, I know you're tired. I know it's a super short break, but I'm going to press on word just to try to fit it all in.

675
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:27,040
I know this. These double up lectures are tough. I wanted to do more than, like, two organ systems.

676
01:08:27,090 --> 01:08:33,319
That's why I did a couple of these double ups. This is the last part of that structure function lecture.

677
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:38,479
And I kind of go through this fast and I'm going to limit the amount of stuff we need to know.

678
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:44,570
Some of these sites are taken from a another course I teach, which is a little bit more focused on these things.

679
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:48,320
So biomarkers of renal damage.

680
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:54,740
So there are some markers that you can assess in blood or urine, those of you and 717 we've talked about some of these.

681
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:58,790
So this is just a reminder of some of those markers.

682
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:01,340
And like I said, I'm not going to ask you to know everything here.

683
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:09,230
Basically know that if you want to assess renal function, there are two sort of tissues that you can earth substances that you can use to do.

684
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:11,900
So you can look at what's happening in the blood.

685
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:19,370
So that might reflect things that are not being pushed across the glomerular filtration membrane at the rate they should be.

686
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:25,880
Right. If we have some backflow or you can look at things in urine which will reflect stuff that's coming across that shouldn't have.

687
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:32,720
So the serum markers, the most common who are urea nitrogen are blood, urea, nitrogen.

688
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:37,130
So you might see butane is an abbreviation like on a serum chemistry result.

689
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:43,990
And create means. And these are byproducts of nitrogen of protein and muscle metabolism.

690
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:54,260
And ordinarily, ordinarily, they're going to be filtered blood, urine, nitrogen is filtered to a small amount and then reabsorbed.

691
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:57,470
So these should be retained at a certain level in the blood.

692
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:02,360
But if they're not being filtered appropriately, they're going to actually build up in the blood.

693
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:07,940
So they'll elevate in blood if there's glomerular filtration damage and then in the urine,

694
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:13,490
a couple of things can happen if you're not able to concentrate the urine as well as you should.

695
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:17,180
Like something, you shed some tubules or something's wrong with that.

696
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:23,320
Just to compare the appearance we talked about, the urine is going to be more dilute than it should ordinarily be.

697
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,250
So there's a measure called specific gravity, which is basically the concentration of urine.

698
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:33,830
And so urine concentration should parallel like your hydration state and your ability to filter.

699
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:44,509
So if you have a person who is dehydrated and has dilute urine, that means something's wrong with that kidney because that makes no sense.

700
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:48,290
If you're dehydrated, you should be able to concentrate kidney the urine.

701
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:55,849
So one measure of kidney function is actually to do sort of a controlled dehydration state

702
01:10:55,850 --> 01:11:00,980
where you're strict water intake and then measure whether urinary concentration goes up.

703
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:05,660
And if it doesn't, that's indicative that the kidney is losing its ability to concentrate.

704
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:08,900
So specific gravity is a measure of urine concentration.

705
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:17,120
If you have damage to the tubules, you can have cells that are sloughing off the tubules and entering the urinary filtrate.

706
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:23,060
So because it's a tube, they've come in the form of casts. So you'll actually see in the urine urinary casts,

707
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:30,710
or if you have a substance that's precipitating in the urine like a crystal, you can see those crystals in the urine.

708
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:36,620
And then there are substances that ordinarily would be filtered by the minerals

709
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:41,930
and taken up again that would leak across the glamorous and end up in the urine.

710
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:46,129
So ordinarily, you shouldn't have a high level of urinary creatinine.

711
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:52,070
You shouldn't have a high level of glucose or protein in the urine. But if there's damage to the tubules, those will all be present.

712
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:57,020
Okay. So the take home is there's blood measures of renal assessment and there's urine

713
01:11:57,020 --> 01:12:01,070
measures and they're all measuring sort of different aspects of urinary function.

714
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:06,440
So I'm going to skip these. You could read those at your own. It's a little bit more detail on it.

715
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:11,960
And I'll just show you these two images. This is what tests look like.

716
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:17,210
You don't need to know the difference between all the different types of classes again for my other class.

717
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:24,200
But it just gives you a sense of like when you're looking at a urine sample, these are the types of substances this is not stained or anything.

718
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:29,989
These are just refracted elements in urine and this reflects cellular decomposition.

719
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:35,570
So those are all the cells that were lying in a tubule that ended up in the urine and then kind of start degenerating.

720
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:40,550
So it's indicative of tubule damage and this is what crystals look like.

721
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:48,170
Again, I'm not going to ask you to distinguish between the types, but the shape of the different crystals can kind of indicate different things.

722
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:51,800
Some of these are relatively normal. Others can indicate toxicity.

723
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:57,140
These are the type of crystals that you often see with ethylene glycol in urine.

724
01:12:57,140 --> 01:13:05,810
They look a little bit different in tissue, but urinary crystals are precipitated substances in urine and there are also are many drugs.

725
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:09,260
This is a self automated related crystal in a dog.

726
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,360
So many drugs will precipitate out in urine.

727
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:18,739
And if those crystals combine together because crystals tend to precipitate on one another and if they get larger,

728
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:24,170
you can end up with a kidney stone or a bladder stone or a stone in the urethra or elsewhere.

729
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:31,250
Okay. All right. Yeah, that's what I'm going to say, for that matter.

730
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:36,860
This is my heart has all the history detectable around Halloween, and there's tons of,

731
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:41,719
like, funky stuff that we saw in the microscope that they do throughout the whole year.

732
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:46,010
But Halloween, they really go crazy. It a lot of really funny ones there. All right.

733
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:55,040
So that was structure function. We're going to do a little bit of pathology and again, kind of hang on for the ride a little bit.

734
01:13:55,040 --> 01:14:00,470
I know that it's very hard to learn the normal and then immediately learn the abnormal without time to digest.

735
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:06,800
But your quiz should sort of help you solidify the stuff that we did in class today to help a little bit.

736
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:12,020
Okay. The kidney stone family, a tragic event. All right.

737
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:16,760
So kidney pathology. So let's again review the normal.

738
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:22,700
Was there a question? Oh, okay. All right.

739
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:26,120
So this is an overview that can be from a monkey.

740
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:33,409
You know, in this tissue, it's pretty easy to see the distinction between the cortex and the medulla,

741
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:36,970
even at low magnification, depending on the species. Sometimes that is.

742
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:41,820
Action isn't as obvious that little magnification. But this is a nice illustration.

743
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:50,310
There's your ring off the pillar. There's the pelvis. Here's all that higher magnification again, showing the cortex in the medulla.

744
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:57,770
The cortex usually a little more dense. And then that little square is what I'm going to show in high magnification in the next slide.

745
01:14:57,790 --> 01:15:01,470
So this is going to be cortex. There's a better visual cortex finally.

746
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:10,620
So, again, the spaghetti. Right. So we have all the things we took in cross-section and we see either straight down the tube,

747
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:14,190
kind of a longitudinal section of it, others that are more tangential.

748
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:20,910
You can see that the proximal tubules, a majority of tubules that we see in profile and they have sort of a taller epithelium,

749
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:29,310
the distal convoluted tubules have more of a true kub, a shorter cuboid epithelium and there's fewer of that.

750
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:36,120
And then this one, you don't always catch this perfectly, so you're not going to always see this, but this one has like a perfect representation.

751
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:40,700
Here's distal tubule. Here is that area where the cells are all squished together.

752
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:45,510
That's the macula. Okay, so that's that regulatory area.

753
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:51,959
And then here's the little ball of the glamorous. You can't specifically see capillaries.

754
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:56,610
Usually in the normal state. There are actually some special stains that we use to highlight capillaries.

755
01:15:56,610 --> 01:16:02,340
But unless the kidney is sort of congested with blood or there's something abnormal, a lot of times you don't really see the capillaries.

756
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:08,520
This is a tiny little capillary loop. Just know that they're intertwined because all these nuclei are those parasites, right?

757
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:14,760
So they're in there intertwined. And then this is a little square is going to show you the difference with the medulla.

758
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:19,670
This one is actually this was you know, this is like of the era that I just showed you.

759
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:23,250
This is that junction right between the cortex and the medulla.

760
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,700
So everything's lined up more parallel. These are all the loops of heavily.

761
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:32,880
Like I said, you don't need to worry about the distinction between the particular subdivisions of the looks of Henley.

762
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:37,200
And this is what's the S three portion? This is from the cortex.

763
01:16:37,230 --> 01:16:40,650
So that's the look for those cortical tubules. So this is right at that junction.

764
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:41,700
And remember,

765
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:53,490
the s three portion is where substances that are that are toxic by virtue of like p450 activity or b the lion's activity have their function,

766
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:58,190
have their effect. And then this is just more distally in the propeller.

767
01:16:58,230 --> 01:17:02,520
Everything's all parallel. All those big collecting ducts and moving towards one.

768
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:05,880
That's this stern cutting. That's real villa.

769
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:10,740
That's just the tissue falls. It's like an artifact. Just ignore it.

770
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:14,640
And then this is just another view of those collecting dots.

771
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:22,440
So again, all that I ask is that you can recognize the difference between the cortex, the spaghetti and the medulla.

772
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:26,820
All right. So here's case one doesn't run. This is a dog.

773
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:30,180
So dog kit is pretty big. So a lot modification.

774
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:34,760
This is obviously just sort of a wedge cut kind of halfway between the papillae.

775
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:50,730
Okay. So remembering back to how we do pathology is we orient ourselves, we try to figure out is it a solid organ, is it a tubular organ?

776
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:56,300
And then we have a big picture sentence, something like there are decreased cells in the what?

777
01:17:56,310 --> 01:18:03,090
There are multifocal cells that are absent or there is multifocal cellular alteration.

778
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:06,960
So that's usually our first view. I think I give you a normal in here.

779
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:10,650
So I even like stuff, a little arrow in, I should have done that.

780
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:19,260
So in this overview and this is like a real slide, so there are ten and this is a diagnostic case.

781
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:23,880
So there tends to be a little bit of artifact. So it's going to be a little it's going to be all kinds of weirdness this up here.

782
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:30,690
But this is the normal kidney. And this is pointing to an area where things look a little kind of fragmented and broken up.

783
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:37,379
I think I have a higher mag and I don't. So one thing I'll start you off.

784
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:43,440
One of the things that I would notice if I were looking at this, I would expect sort of a dense uniformity to the outer portion of the cortex.

785
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:45,089
So if I'm looking here,

786
01:18:45,090 --> 01:18:53,340
I might notice that there's sort of a decreased I can either call this like a decrease in cell cells or just there's cellular alteration.

787
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,910
It's pretty wide spread. And then where is it?

788
01:18:56,910 --> 01:19:04,950
It's in the outer portion of the cortex. Okay. So there's diffuse or widespread cellular alteration in the outer portions of the cortex.

789
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:11,520
Then I'm going to look at what that looks like at higher magnification.

790
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:13,020
So that's my broad sentence.

791
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:20,790
So I'm already I mean, presumably I've looked at the rest of the kidney and I don't see much abnormalities there, but that's where I'm going to focus.

792
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:24,960
And then I'm going to look at what that cellular alteration looks like.

793
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:29,160
Okay, have a normal one. So there's the normal to show you.

794
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:36,750
And then I have a bunch of different have obviously the glomeruli there's a little bit some of this is probably artifact these are.

795
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:42,480
Ball's Sprite and it has a space around it. So depending on where I cut that, I might see more or less of the memory loss.

796
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:47,590
And there's also a little artificial dilation here, and some of this is probably due to back pressure.

797
01:19:47,610 --> 01:19:51,120
It's a full bit of dilation, but that's not the main thing actually here.

798
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:58,200
What I'm going to encircle some tubules, but my little handy dandy beltline thingy.

799
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:03,570
What do you think is the difference between these three tubules that I've outlined?

800
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:09,269
So I have this tubule here and this thing you wouldn't want to describe it.

801
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:12,740
We think the bottom one compared to the bottom.

802
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:16,590
Yeah. Yeah. And these other two have a loss of structure.

803
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:20,680
Yeah. So what specifically what does this guy have like this?

804
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:23,930
This. I have this one here.

805
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:33,270
So cells, right? Yeah. So like the affected some of the affected tubules have a loss of cells, lots of epithelial cells lining them.

806
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:37,500
And what's all that show you think of the middle or that granular stuff.

807
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:45,640
So it was information we should see. Nuclei, right?

808
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:51,459
And remember, this is a tubular lumen. So we already decided we've lost souls.

809
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:54,850
So imagine yourself you're in a tube epithelial cell.

810
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:59,440
The epithelial cell is gone. So presumably we've had some necrosis, right?

811
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:05,560
Where is it? So where's the mass going to go? Into the living.

812
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:11,910
Right. So this is just cell debris and this cell tubule makes it easier to see that.

813
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,910
So what's going on here? It's kind of an intermediary, right?

814
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:22,420
What do you think's happening here? Anyone else want to add? What's wrong with these cells?

815
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:26,559
What do they look like? What's different about anyone else?

816
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:31,390
What do you think happened? Or any kind of like what's the structure of the cells?

817
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:36,610
I know. Yeah. Yeah.

818
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:40,200
And what do you think about their nuclei compared to those nuclei?

819
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:46,710
Just jump in about it. Yeah, they're very condensed.

820
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:50,399
So these cells are on their way up. Right? Absolutely.

821
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:54,240
They've lost their ordered structure and some of them are actually kind of in the loop.

822
01:21:54,930 --> 01:21:58,200
So these are cells. What is cells doing? They die. They swell.

823
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:04,559
They detach from their neighbors. They're sloughing into the lumen. And then once they're in the Lumen, they're not attached to anything.

824
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:07,920
They're going to disintegrate. So they're going to end up like this. Right.

825
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:14,670
So we kind of have a progression. We have the normal one. We have cells that are dead but are in the process of sloughing.

826
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:20,520
And then we have the aftermath, which is where all the cells have been lost and it's just debris.

827
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:32,670
Okay. So we had widespread cellular alteration in the outer cortex and then the affected tubules sometimes had a complete loss of tubular epithelium,

828
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:36,780
and other times they had not nuclei and sloughing cells.

829
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:40,450
And the affected tubules contain cell debris? Yes.

830
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:44,970
Does that loss of like cellular turgut kind of cause a problem?

831
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:51,090
Like you have all this empty space now does that. It causes a big problem.

832
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:56,460
So a couple of things. You've lost your proximal tubular epithelium.

833
01:22:56,940 --> 01:23:02,909
Those cells are supposed to absorb stuff, so you've lost some ability to absorb nutrients,

834
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:07,020
to absorb, you know, necessary metabolites for things that you need.

835
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:15,320
You have stuff if there's a that's partially blocking the lumen of the tubule, if you have enough stuff in there,

836
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:21,059
like if there's enough of that smell, it's going to cause a back pressure, which might be contributing to some degree.

837
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:25,110
Why we have this deletion because like it's a pipe that's clogged, right?

838
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:28,950
So that might contribute to some degree why we have this increased space in the

839
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:34,110
Bowman's capsule that doubt that upstream can affect pressure in that primary release.

840
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:43,049
So essentially have a blocked tube a little bit. Um, and if this goes on more and we also have disrupted this barrier,

841
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:48,430
so the things that should be excreted can potentially end up in the interstitial.

842
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:52,320
We have a lack of absorption of things that are things that should be absorbed.

843
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:58,170
And when we have inflammatory cell response to this, which we will shortly to clean this up,

844
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,950
that is further going to potentially cause damage to this area.

845
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:06,960
So it's kind of lost the tubules have lost their ability in those areas to function.

846
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:14,760
One thing to note about the kidney, though, is that you have lots of different nephrons and this is happening in individual tubule.

847
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,790
As long as you have enough remaining nephrons,

848
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:25,980
you can actually increase the glomerular filtration rate across the remaining nephrons and have some compensatory ability.

849
01:24:26,790 --> 01:24:30,600
So kidney function isn't lost in a linear fashion.

850
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:40,799
And as a matter of fact, you have to lose before you increase your view and increase your serum markers out of kind of the normal range of values.

851
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,350
You have to lose like two thirds of your nephrons.

852
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:51,960
So unfortunately, those are very insensitive biomarkers of renal function and the remaining tubules have some ability to compensate for this.

853
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:59,879
So yeah, this nephron is messed up, but how much that impacts the organism as a whole depends a little bit on how many different end

854
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:05,790
up being affected and if it's if it's all happening at once versus like some are recovering,

855
01:25:05,790 --> 01:25:12,150
some are not. Sarah Okay. But from a description point of view, I should have shown you this is a little bit better.

856
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:17,220
This was trying to show you that most of the tubules affected are proximal convoluted tubules.

857
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:21,420
That could be hard to. You know what the family have left to help you?

858
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:26,250
Probably what you would have to do if you wanted to establish that definitively is find

859
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:30,750
some areas that are less effective affected and see the morphology or use immuno.

860
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:35,700
But most of the tubules in a given cortical section are proximal, so that's another good clue.

861
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:39,210
Okay, so those are those proximal convoluted tubules.

862
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:46,590
So this other alteration consists of proximal tubules with sloughed cells and pic knotted nuclei,

863
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:51,300
and there are also proximal tubules that lack a cell lining and contain luminal debris.

864
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:59,909
So very simple. And then this is obviously, oh, this was the medulla, which is actually totally fine, although the cells are happy.

865
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:03,840
So this is a very kind of region specific toxicity.

866
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:08,220
So that again starts pointing us remembering what the proximal tubules vulnerable for.

867
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:15,960
Yes. So with this. Like sort of the biology being like, would this be something that would cause a chasm?

868
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:20,220
Yes. Very, very, very good. That's excellent.

869
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:31,270
Yeah. And actually, the really interesting thing, the amount and creatinine are kind of insensitive markers for tubular damage.

870
01:26:31,290 --> 01:26:40,649
They're much more sensitive from the memory line. A lot of our are classic kind of zino biotics are toxicants are tubule toxicants and a lot of

871
01:26:40,650 --> 01:26:44,700
times people will in their study like use be when and create to try to measure the effect.

872
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:51,120
Unless you're really slamming the kidney, you might be surprised because of this kind of compensatory function,

873
01:26:51,960 --> 01:27:00,570
you'll get minimal rise in view and creatinine, but then histologically there'll be a ton of damage and as long as you get it in the right spot,

874
01:27:00,570 --> 01:27:10,260
renal casts are actually a more sensitive marker of tubule damage that you can create if the basement membrane is preserved.

875
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:15,209
There are stem cells here that will quickly repopulate that area of renal tubular epithelium.

876
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:21,270
So a lot depends of timing. Like if you hit them hard with the toxicant and then wait a while, like wait a couple of days,

877
01:27:21,870 --> 01:27:25,380
you might not even see the casts because it's already been sort of repopulated.

878
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:30,270
But in acute damage. Like if you looked at the urine of this dog right now, there would be casts there.

879
01:27:30,630 --> 01:27:34,110
Yeah, excellent. That's actually a very sensitive marker for tubular toxicity.

880
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:43,680
So that was the sentence. And then the medulla was fine. And so the interpretation was, well, really, this is consistent with tubular necrosis.

881
01:27:44,190 --> 01:27:48,120
I guess if you looked over the whole side, there were other areas. I'll show you in a minute. We're less affected.

882
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:52,110
But the basic net effect was that I showed you was tubular necrosis.

883
01:27:53,610 --> 01:27:56,280
So that was the description, the morphologic diagnosis.

884
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:02,640
Again, if I want you to say degeneration, I'm going to show you something really obvious and I'll show you an example of that in a minute.

885
01:28:02,970 --> 01:28:14,160
But basically, this was tubular necrosis. This is borrowed from the cloth, the distribution, it's multifocal, or I would take wide spread.

886
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,330
Does it hit the cortex?

887
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:25,230
If you think of the it the outer portion of the cortex, the duration, this is a very acute toxicity because there is no even inflammatory response.

888
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:30,390
This is like an overdose or like a high toxic, a single instance toxicity.

889
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:36,180
And I'll show you tell you in a minute with this. Well, this was gentamicin toxicity.

890
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:41,759
Gentamicin is an antibiotic that in a minute but acute tubular necrosis,

891
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:47,550
which is what what I just showed you is a very common manifestation of renal toxicant exposure.

892
01:28:48,270 --> 01:28:55,380
It's very common with compounds that get absorbed from the proximal tubule and concentrated within the tubular epithelium.

893
01:28:56,070 --> 01:29:01,470
So we said that proximal tubules really designed to pull stuff out of the filtrate and absorb it.

894
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:07,680
And that can cause a couple of things. It can cause direct cytotoxicity due to the concentration effects.

895
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:14,610
So essentially the compound absorbed accumulates in lysosomes to to a higher degree and causes lysis of the lysosome.

896
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:20,490
And then the lysozyme enzymes will waste the cell itself like an overload

897
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:28,170
toxicity in the S1 and as two segments we also have P450 or b goliath activity.

898
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:37,170
So if the compound requires metabolism by either of those enzymes for its toxic effect, that's also a reason for a proximal tubule.

899
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:44,510
Restricted toxicity. And then, as I was saying, if the basement membrane is preserved,

900
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:50,750
so like that dog that I just showed you is probably pretty sick in like an acute renal stage of failure.

901
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:53,750
It's not going to be able to reabsorb water, so it's going to get dehydrated.

902
01:29:54,410 --> 01:30:02,470
But as long as those acute effects are supported, if it still has basement membrane preserved, the kidney has an excellent ability to regenerate.

903
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:10,040
So that would be a survivable event as long as, you know, secondary effects like dehydration, infection, what have you don't don't get you.

904
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:14,780
So the kidney has a large capacity for epithelial degeneration or regeneration.

905
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:21,530
Hypoxia is not the same if you have a lesion to the kidney due to hypoxia like a blood

906
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:26,150
clot or something that destroys the basement membrane and then the kidney gets replaced,

907
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:33,740
a section of the kidney gets replaced by scarring. Okay, so even though toxicants, the animals can be really super human, can be really sick,

908
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:39,260
oftentimes they have a better long term or a better outcome than like in a scheme like event.

909
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:46,050
So here's an example of an anti-viral agent.

910
01:30:46,090 --> 01:30:50,450
So this is a person who is treated with a sixth of Europe, which is a known renal toxicant.

911
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:57,050
So depending on the dose and depending on like hydration state and their overall health status, it can cause some renal toxicity.

912
01:30:57,530 --> 01:31:03,830
So this is showing blood creatinine. So this person did have an elevation and that means they three or four hospitalization.

913
01:31:04,370 --> 01:31:09,710
But then as they recovered from that, the kidney regenerated the crown and came back down.

914
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:15,980
So just again, demonstrating that many of these toxicants are quite recoverable given the regenerative status of the kidney.

915
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,450
So this was the dog who was gentamicin toxicity.

916
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:29,450
Gentamicin is an immuno glycosides antibiotic and one of its common reasons for renal toxicity is lysosomal accumulation.

917
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:35,450
So the mechanism is that it's taken up by receptor mediated and also ptosis.

918
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:41,200
So the star here is gentamicin and there are specific receptors that can do this.

919
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:50,540
I'm not gonna worry too much about them, but gentamicin accumulates inside the endosomes, which as is normal fuze with a lysosome.

920
01:31:50,540 --> 01:32:00,379
So you have essentially a federal lysosome and a lysosome and it can get sequestered in those lysosomes if that sequestration is excessive,

921
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:05,090
it can actually cause rupture of the lysosome and enzymatic digestion of the cell.

922
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:13,129
So necrosis, which is probably what happened to this dog. So due to accumulation of that gentamicin, but at lower doses,

923
01:32:13,130 --> 01:32:19,010
it kind of causes an increase in reactive oxygen species and generates apoptotic signals.

924
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:22,850
So at lower doses, gentamicin is an effective trigger.

925
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:26,480
So you can have lower level of renal tubular dropout as well.

926
01:32:27,530 --> 01:32:35,390
Okay, so it's a proximal tubule toxicant. This was the reminder slide for a proximal tubule vulnerability.

927
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:41,929
Uh, I think is going to go over that. So it's fairly self-explanatory.

928
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:50,270
But just remembering that the different segments have vulnerabilities depending on the fate of the toxicant inside the cell.

929
01:32:52,010 --> 01:32:59,270
Here is an example of degeneration. So this was kind of like dogfight where we had overt necrosis and cell debris.

930
01:32:59,270 --> 01:33:01,850
This is normal. The cell is kind of getting there.

931
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:08,240
It still looks a little bit more like normal nuclei, but the cells are getting kind of a hydrophobic change to them.

932
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:13,790
This is an example of a radio contrast agent. It's like an agent they inject.

933
01:33:13,790 --> 01:33:19,280
If you want to do an imaging technique like an x ray or C.T. or something where you need a contrast agent,

934
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:26,150
a lot of those have high ionic strength and get absorbed, as do other ions in the proximal tubules.

935
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:30,140
But because they have such high ionic strength, they pour water into the cell.

936
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:35,480
So you have hydrophobic change, which is a degenerative change due to that contrast agent.

937
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:38,050
And then it just becomes a matter of degree.

938
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:43,520
It can either kind of stay with degeneration and recover, or if you have enough severity you could have some necrosis as well.

939
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:47,300
And usually a mix of both. It's first generation degeneration.

940
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:52,760
So what happens if the person or the animal survives the initial injury?

941
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:56,390
So this is pointing to something in this tubule. You know what?

942
01:33:56,390 --> 01:34:03,900
That thing is kind of like the back. So this is in a cell.

943
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:07,090
So this is this is actually kind of a new this is gone.

944
01:34:07,090 --> 01:34:10,600
But this is stuff that was in the nucleus. Regenerating cells divide.

945
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:19,320
Right. That's the mitotic spindle. So these are mitotic figures, the little arrow, the lower magnification view, these cells.

946
01:34:19,590 --> 01:34:22,780
You know, previously there's been damage and now these are cells that are regenerating.

947
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:31,390
So there's mitotic activity. So that's one signal or one sign that you're having some regeneration occur to the regeneration.

948
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:40,030
And overall, when that happens, the resulting kind of daughter cells are bluer than they would ordinarily be.

949
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:45,220
So you'll notice this in the big picture by an increased base of cilia.

950
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:50,410
So there's just not as much cytoplasm yet. The cells are just bluer than they would be ordinarily.

951
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:56,950
So a common finding is you'll see a kidney that has some areas of tubular necrosis,

952
01:34:57,190 --> 01:35:03,370
some areas of regeneration that are bluer depending on where you are, variable amounts of inflammation.

953
01:35:04,270 --> 01:35:07,990
Okay, so the increased blueness is just saying these cells have just regenerated.

954
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:17,200
And in preclinical toxicity in animals, there's also a type of regeneration where you have sort of a primary proliferative signal.

955
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:23,740
So this is a term a potentially carcinogenic agent, a very that's kind of a primary signal to proliferate.

956
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:27,400
And that gives you this atypical regeneration, which has a lot of piling.

957
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:33,310
So this is kind of a danger sign that people see in rodent studies of a copper, but that's potentially carcinogenic.

958
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:37,620
But you don't need to worry about that.

959
01:35:37,630 --> 01:35:43,540
Just know that increased mitotic figures and increased blueness to the tubules can be indicative of regeneration.

960
01:35:45,550 --> 01:35:51,700
All right, let's do another one. So this is this is tissue from a cow ruminant.

961
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:58,210
It's a huge kidney, very hard to fit on the side. So this image is just showing you the cortex.

962
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:07,270
There's the normal. So even at low magnification, this looks quite different right from the normal.

963
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:15,760
So who wants to help me out here? Anyone who has have kind of jumped in at the deep end before.

964
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:19,839
What do you think? In broad terms? Forget your past terms. In broad terms,

965
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:23,319
how does that big picture of the cow kidney look different from the normal

966
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:30,370
one about someone maybe from my back row Jordan or Jennifer you use went on.

967
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:38,340
What do you think about cow kidney. Just in broad terms. Sorry I've been sick.

968
01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:43,310
That's all right. Don't worry about it. I'm losing my voice and I speak. There's a lot of there.

969
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:50,350
It's. Yeah. So. And do you think that's in, like, the particular structures and in particular or.

970
01:36:53,910 --> 01:36:57,440
Like, where do you think that? Spaces around us.

971
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:02,850
Yeah, it's hard to tell, isn't it? Some of it's actually in the tubules, so the tubules themselves are dilated.

972
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:13,110
And then there's even like that that little ball that there's even some dilation right in the Bowman's capsule, which makes sense, right?

973
01:37:13,110 --> 01:37:14,850
Because all of that is one tubule.

974
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:21,630
So if you have dilation widespread throughout all these tubules, this is just the upper end of the tubules that's going to be dilated as well.

975
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:28,530
Okay. So we have widespread tubule dilation and I'm mostly it's starting to hit kind of as three.

976
01:37:28,530 --> 01:37:32,640
I'm mostly just showing you the cortex, but this actually extends all the way into the medulla.

977
01:37:33,270 --> 01:37:37,500
But widespread tubule dilation. So that's easy.

978
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,800
And this is what it looks like, higher magnification. So there's that widespread dilation.

979
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:49,320
The affected tubules are dilated. And what do you think about the epithelium there?

980
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:54,150
And it's thin. It's kind of attenuated or flattened.

981
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:58,380
So the affected tubules are widely dilated and have flattened epithelium.

982
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:08,100
I think I have another side of that. But yeah, their flattened epithelium and Bowman's capsules dilated.

983
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:13,860
And then you might have already seen there's something else in there. So here's another magnification showing you something else.

984
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:18,480
I think there's another side of something else. Oh, that's a good one.

985
01:38:20,190 --> 01:38:23,340
What else is present? So we have a there is also a sentence.

986
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:28,950
So I would say anything funky about this image. Looks like there's some white crystals.

987
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:38,550
Yeah, look at that. So there are some refracting material, so which it doesn't pick up the stain and it's kind of more geometric, right?

988
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:41,890
Like doesn't look like a cell, has a sharp corner, doesn't pick up stain.

989
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:48,389
And if we were on a microscope, if we focused up and down, we'd see it's not quite in the focal plane reflecting the light back at us.

990
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:55,420
It's refractive. So there is also refract tile crystalline material in the affected tubules, you know.

991
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:58,740
Sorry, but crystalline refraction material. Excellent.

992
01:39:00,330 --> 01:39:05,070
And so these finding those tubules are not actually gone.

993
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:08,700
They're still nuclei, but it's certainly a degenerative change.

994
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:14,280
So this flattening, this dilation of the two builds is, as morphologically we call it, degeneration.

995
01:39:14,970 --> 01:39:24,990
And then we also have that crystals and the word there is a path word for this, the word for crystal in urine, urea is the as the suffix for urine.

996
01:39:25,950 --> 01:39:29,160
So a crystal or any of this just crystals in urinary filtrate.

997
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:35,850
Okay. But I mean, for this class, I would accept anything that gives the idea that there's a crystals.

998
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:39,510
Crystals present that would be totally fine. So there's degeneration in crystal.

999
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:43,920
Luria It's tubular. There's not really any inflammatory reaction.

1000
01:39:43,930 --> 01:39:48,540
So we're still in the neighborhood of acute toxicity and it's pretty severe affecting this whole thing.

1001
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:59,130
Any thoughts on what what are common toxicants that might cause crystals in urine and humans showed you one example of I it fast and think of any.

1002
01:40:00,330 --> 01:40:05,340
So this is not obstruction. So if we have enough crystals it will block flow through the nephron.

1003
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:10,440
If we have enough crystals glomming together, we'd actually get discrete, grossly visible stones.

1004
01:40:10,850 --> 01:40:15,210
But we can also get obstruction that's tiny and microscopic from those individual crystals.

1005
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:20,070
Anyone know any crystal toxicants? We think melamine.

1006
01:40:20,370 --> 01:40:26,970
Melamine. Good one. I'm glad you said that one that most people go with antifreeze, which is let me show you first.

1007
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:35,040
But melamine is a very a more recent kind of newly we're not really doing it at this point, but a more recent example.

1008
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:42,420
So probably the kind of prototype toxicant that causes Crystal Luria that most people know about is ethylene glycol or antifreeze.

1009
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:48,960
This is less common than it once was because there are now some more safe versions of antifreeze that don't use ethylene glycol.

1010
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:57,749
But ethylene glycol says, you know, that reason cars, green color, you know, it's toxic, but it has a very sweet taste.

1011
01:40:57,750 --> 01:41:00,780
And so pets like in the garage, something spilled.

1012
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:05,579
It's a really common toxic for pets and unfortunately has that color.

1013
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:08,220
And there have been toxicities in children as well.

1014
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:15,600
So ethylene glycol is actually metabolized via alcohol chemical, but itself is not really that toxic.

1015
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:23,160
But when it's metabolized by alcohol, dehydrogenase to an aldehyde, the aldehyde itself, oops, didn't get all the way to area.

1016
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:32,550
The aldehyde itself is toxic to the renal tubular epithelium and when that aldehyde is further metabolized you get oxalic acid.

1017
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:39,480
So it's a pathway to get to a good solid acid. And then that combines with calcium, which is present to some degree in the urine.

1018
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:44,250
It combines with calcium to form a calcium oxalate crystal that will precipitate out.

1019
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:49,470
So the crystals are calcium oxalate crystals. And depending on the degree of precipitation,

1020
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:59,100
you can have partial or complete obstruction which causes increased pressure in the tubule flattens out that epithelium so we saw all that flattening.

1021
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:02,219
That's because the pump through the pump is obstructed.

1022
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:07,890
There's increased pressure distally and the tubular epithelium is get flattened and if there's enough pressure,

1023
01:42:07,890 --> 01:42:12,900
that will lead to necrosis of that tubular epithelium. Okay, so we have two things.

1024
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:17,700
We have some direct toxicity. This is actually kind of controversial how how truly toxic this is.

1025
01:42:18,030 --> 01:42:23,010
But we have some toxicity here and then we have essentially a pressure problem due to these crystals.

1026
01:42:25,470 --> 01:42:33,600
The remedy or like from a clinical standpoint, the treatment is actually competitive inhibition of alcohol, dehydrogenase.

1027
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:41,399
So you add another substance that's going to use up the alcohol dehydrogenase activity because the ethylene glycol will pass off by itself.

1028
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:48,480
It's not very toxic. So there is a drug called F dissolve that's a competitive inhibitor of alcohol, dehydrogenase.

1029
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:53,760
It's a very expensive drug. And I will tell you, this toxicity is really common, like I said, in pets.

1030
01:42:54,450 --> 01:42:58,320
So most practices actually kept track of beer.

1031
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:03,390
They actually keep like hard alcohol, like as high alcohol as you can get.

1032
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:09,569
And you actually recited as I was like, ah, is this really medicine actually make a solution?

1033
01:43:09,570 --> 01:43:11,190
It's alcohol type of alcohol.

1034
01:43:11,190 --> 01:43:21,420
And you actually there's like a calculation you're intravenously injecting that alcohol to competitively inhibit that enzyme.

1035
01:43:21,510 --> 01:43:30,330
This is a really common toxicity in animals. So the animals get very, very drunk, but you support them, you know, during that, I think.

1036
01:43:32,580 --> 01:43:36,149
But it actually is a way of avoiding having a more severe renal failure.

1037
01:43:36,150 --> 01:43:39,370
And I mean, yeah, it's cheaper than that.

1038
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:45,659
It's less of a toxicity now because there are more frequently use the non toxic versions of antifreeze.

1039
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:47,010
But I do remember from practice,

1040
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:55,770
I mean open the controlled substances cabinet and pull out the high proof vodka or whatever, but competitive inhibition.

1041
01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:03,569
So this is another toxicant Neal's example causing Crista Laura is melamine this is this actually

1042
01:44:03,570 --> 01:44:12,120
came out I was in residency in 2005 2006 this came out in 2007 during my residency in Pet Foods.

1043
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:20,759
So there were pet foods that were contaminated with melamine, which is a substance that has a high nitrogen content and an animal feeds.

1044
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:25,800
The most expensive ingredient is protein, which is measured by its nitrogen content.

1045
01:44:26,610 --> 01:44:35,850
So if you have nefarious inclinations and you put a nitrogen rich substance that has no nutritional value like melamine into a feed,

1046
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:42,540
when they ask that, they're just asking for nitrogen. So you can charge like a high price as a protein rich feed additive.

1047
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:47,070
So I remember when I was in residency in 2007,

1048
01:44:47,070 --> 01:44:53,490
we had this dog case where it was a dog that had developed acute renal failure and died and histologically we were all

1049
01:44:53,490 --> 01:45:02,940
confused because it had a lot of changes of chronic kidney damage and then I had this acute crystalline lesion on top of it,

1050
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:08,910
which is very acute. This is what it looked like for me before our case because I was published as part of the Case series.

1051
01:45:09,810 --> 01:45:13,620
They look like ethylene glycol crystals in tissue. That's what ethylene glycol.

1052
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:16,980
So we kept asking, is there any chance this dog could get exposed to antifreeze?

1053
01:45:17,190 --> 01:45:18,989
No. No one could figure it out.

1054
01:45:18,990 --> 01:45:26,790
And then at that exact, exact same week, actually, the FDA came out with a recall was like the largest pet food recall in history,

1055
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:29,280
and it was pet foods that were contaminated with melamine.

1056
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:36,420
And so there were a large number of dogs and cats because it was traced back to sort of a protein rich ingredient,

1057
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:43,260
bone meal or something like that, that was contaminated with melamine as an import affected a large number of dog and cat foods.

1058
01:45:43,410 --> 01:45:49,980
Most of the animals that died were cats. Cats are far more sensitive recently than dogs.

1059
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:56,910
This dog had a preexisting renal insufficiency so that was would explain the chronic changes of

1060
01:45:56,910 --> 01:46:01,110
its kidney and that it this was like the last straw for it because it had no kidney reserves.

1061
01:46:01,110 --> 01:46:08,160
So it was a really cool case. Yeah. So given the reason, I guess it's not recent now, but in 27 years I've been in California.

1062
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:16,100
Yes. I'm just curious, is it like the similar mechanism where if you have melamine and then co exposure with like uric acid that forms like the.

1063
01:46:16,650 --> 01:46:26,810
Yeah, yeah. So the funny thing about melamine is that when it was first tested, it was thought to be pretty nontoxic, but it's actually melamine for.

1064
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:31,350
So what basically happens is melamine forms a crystal, just like with the ethylene glycol.

1065
01:46:31,770 --> 01:46:36,599
But by itself, it's not very crystal genic. It combines with other contaminants.

1066
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:42,330
And in the foods it was Sinopec acid because there wasn't a pure contamination in infants.

1067
01:46:42,450 --> 01:46:48,330
Infants, one, they're more prone to dehydration, they're smaller and they have more uric acid in their urine.

1068
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:52,950
So infants what? This was also an infant food contamination.

1069
01:46:52,950 --> 01:46:59,820
But infants are more sensitive to melamine because the melamine combines with uric acid to form those calcium oxalate type crystals.

1070
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:06,240
So the animal case is kind of a harbinger of what happened the next year.

1071
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:13,470
This is kind of a unspoken secret, like melamine contamination of feeds, animal feeds is going on for a really long time.

1072
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:17,729
But depending on the degree of co contamination with sinar acid,

1073
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:23,970
you may or may not see signs and this drew it to the forefront because it was such a severe contamination.

1074
01:47:24,470 --> 01:47:34,070
The very next year. There were some cases there were cases of contamination of infant formula and Chinese infant formulas that affected about,

1075
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:38,210
I mean, probably more 52,000 children with six attributable deaths.

1076
01:47:38,570 --> 01:47:45,260
But kids ended up in the hospital. Infants with acute renal failure are due to Christa Luria and it was the same thing.

1077
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:54,450
But you know, the quality of the food is measured by the protein content, but the substance which is thought to be nontoxic, was in there.

1078
01:47:54,500 --> 01:48:00,680
Unfortunately, the infants were uniquely susceptible, maybe due to a combination of dual contamination with sidetrack acid,

1079
01:48:00,980 --> 01:48:05,210
but also due to their innate susceptibility due to higher uric acid levels.

1080
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:11,030
So that was the animal case really was a harbinger for what happened in humans and

1081
01:48:11,030 --> 01:48:14,750
that drew a lot of better understanding of what the toxicity was for melamine.

1082
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:19,280
There's actually fairly recently a kind of that went away for a while because

1083
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:22,700
people were very aware and there's been actually a fairly recent upsurge in this.

1084
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:26,929
Again, I can't remember which country. Yeah, I just have a curiosity.

1085
01:48:26,930 --> 01:48:33,360
So given like a recent review of the evidence, is there evidence for like inflammatory stress from reconstituting sometimes?

1086
01:48:33,710 --> 01:48:38,270
Yeah, there's a lot of research now, melamine, because like the basic toxicity is crystal urea.

1087
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:43,760
But as we've learned, everything goes downstream. So if you have degeneration, you have inflammatory cells.

1088
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:51,440
And so there's a lot of downstream effects. And I think there's still a lot of to be learned about how much is directly due to melamine

1089
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:55,580
and how much is like the damage induced by the melamine and then the body response.

1090
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:59,600
So I don't know what the specific induction is like of the inflammatory cells,

1091
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:03,050
but I'm sure that the inflammatory response contributes to the damage downstream.

1092
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:09,200
So melamine this is actually this was for my dog case is one of the pathologists at MSU.

1093
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:13,729
This is the dog. And these were the crystals for that particular case, which was the first case we had.

1094
01:49:13,730 --> 01:49:16,250
But now there are a whole bunch other MSU and elsewhere.

1095
01:49:17,270 --> 01:49:23,390
The cow though probably is not well cause woody antifreeze the lead anything the cows not that were

1096
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:29,600
melamine but that was actually a naturally occurring toxicant of ingestion of an oxalate containing plant.

1097
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:33,620
So pigmeat is an ox, a naturally occurring oxalate containing plant.

1098
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:42,080
Same mechanism though as far as calcium oxalate crystals, and it's similar to the toxicity of taro in humans.

1099
01:49:42,530 --> 01:49:50,360
The taro was a root food that, if it's not well cooked, contains a Catholic acid that will precipitate to form calcium oxalate crystals.

1100
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:56,810
So it's a good example of that type of toxicity in animals, just as in humans.

1101
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:04,549
I'm going to fly through slides for this. You are not going to this is the equivalent to the chronic damage of the kidney, like I showed you.

1102
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:08,180
Chronic damage in the liver. I'm not this is a very complex slide.

1103
01:50:08,180 --> 01:50:13,400
It's crazy looking. I'm not going to ask you an example of this in your final.

1104
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:18,469
There are a couple of pictures from it in your quiz, but it's too complex a slide for this level.

1105
01:50:18,470 --> 01:50:23,480
So you've learned acute tubular toxicity, you've learned Crystal Luria those are the things you've learned for kidney.

1106
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:28,310
But to give you a sense, this is a rat kidney with widespread damage.

1107
01:50:29,510 --> 01:50:32,540
And then when you look at it, there's all kinds of things going on.

1108
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:38,479
There's dilation of tubules, there are tubules with pink stuff in them at higher magnification.

1109
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:44,420
We have some changes that we've seen. We have multiple we have on TUBULES that are dilated with attenuated epithelium.

1110
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:48,260
So there's degeneration. We have some cells starting to sloughed.

1111
01:50:48,290 --> 01:50:53,360
If I looked around enough, I could probably find some necrotic tubules. And then I have all this pink stuff.

1112
01:50:54,080 --> 01:51:01,790
So we learn pink is protein rich. This is because the glomeruli in this animal are affected and it's spilling protein into its urine.

1113
01:51:02,180 --> 01:51:10,100
So this is tubular protein ptosis. So there's too much protein in the tubules of the urinary filtrate because ordinarily the filtrate should be clear.

1114
01:51:10,970 --> 01:51:14,570
And then usually I have two bills, all right, next to each other.

1115
01:51:14,570 --> 01:51:18,470
Right. But now I've all kinds of stuff in between the tubules.

1116
01:51:18,740 --> 01:51:26,330
So the space between the tubules, the interstitial is expanded and it is expanded by both pink stuff like this,

1117
01:51:26,330 --> 01:51:30,979
which is fibrosis, like chronic change. It's been damaged, replaced by scar tissue.

1118
01:51:30,980 --> 01:51:35,330
There's fibrosis and there's like pepper kind of thrown like this.

1119
01:51:35,330 --> 01:51:41,330
Someone threw pepper on the side. So there's inflammation. So this in a nutshell, is our cycle of damage.

1120
01:51:41,330 --> 01:51:46,129
We have tubular degeneration, we have necrosis, we have inflammatory response.

1121
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:52,910
In some areas. We're going to have regeneration. If the tubules that are bluer in other areas, the kidney is going to give up and have scarring.

1122
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:57,560
So this is a kidney with chronic damage. And here's further examples.

1123
01:51:57,570 --> 01:52:04,610
Same thing prognosis, dilated tubular degeneration and fibrosis and inflammation.

1124
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:10,850
And then the glomeruli themselves have a thickened membrane.

1125
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:15,830
So there is protein deposition and scarring and the glamorous life itself.

1126
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:21,050
So every aspect of this kidney is affected by chronic change.

1127
01:52:21,770 --> 01:52:31,650
Essentially, this is what we can term a. End stage kidney and all this means this is the end result of a cycle of damage and repair in the kidney.

1128
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:36,780
At this stage, you usually can't tell which where it started.

1129
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:41,160
I can't tell. Was it a primary lesion? First was a tubular lesion first.

1130
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:46,170
Because of the downstream snowball effect, everything kind of builds upon everything else.

1131
01:52:46,590 --> 01:52:52,740
So essentially it's an end stage kidney, but it has no underlying.

1132
01:52:53,310 --> 01:52:56,730
It has all those components. Okay.

1133
01:52:56,730 --> 01:53:03,330
So those four five things are the morphologic diagnoses, but the overall thing is end stage kidney.

1134
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:11,100
These are kind of path words for end stage kidney. But the point of this slide is just that's the net effect of chronic damage to the kidney.

1135
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:14,250
So many different things can cause that.

1136
01:53:14,970 --> 01:53:23,010
As I said, the kidney has a high functional reserve, so it has to be pretty bad or longstanding damage to get to this point.

1137
01:53:24,590 --> 01:53:30,420
That particular example is a naturally occurring version of end stage kidney damage in rats.

1138
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:34,530
This is probably a common the most common age related lesion in rats.

1139
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:45,059
And it's a confounding effect for talks studies, because if I give if I the long term study and I give rats a renal toxicant long term because of age,

1140
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:52,590
usually I have the superimposed on any chronic renal effects of the kidney in humans.

1141
01:53:52,590 --> 01:53:56,489
Any type of chronic tubular toxicant exposure can cause this.

1142
01:53:56,490 --> 01:54:00,780
And probably one of the more famous ones is chronic heavy metal exposure.

1143
01:54:00,810 --> 01:54:04,560
This is cadmium exposure. This is an incidence.

1144
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:09,360
I mean, there's been several incidences, but the most famous one is the occurrence of Itai Itai disease.

1145
01:54:10,770 --> 01:54:20,250
This was a cadmium contamination in Japan that caused chronic renal failure because the people were continually exposed to cadmium contaminated water,

1146
01:54:20,610 --> 01:54:23,820
both in the drinking water and in seafood taken from the river.

1147
01:54:24,810 --> 01:54:32,760
And what happens is the cadmium is taken out by metal assigning receptors into the proximal tubules and has the same mechanism of toxicity.

1148
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:38,450
As that gentamicin bursts, the lysosomes cells die and then you're going to have repair.

1149
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:45,210
So you're going to have the cycle of repair. But also free cadmium is a dye bulent on and it acts like calcium,

1150
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:52,170
so it interferes with calcium uptake and calcium signaling and kind of replaced calcium in bone for these individuals.

1151
01:54:52,650 --> 01:54:57,030
So the long term effects were actually osteo militia or lack of calcium in bone.

1152
01:54:57,810 --> 01:55:07,750
So you type time means like, ouch, ouch. Literally. And the person here is unfortunately affected by osteoporosis, secondary to the softening of bone.

1153
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:12,430
And these are images of the kidneys which are all distorted and scar down.

1154
01:55:12,460 --> 01:55:16,000
So they ended up with chronic renal failure and are still militia.

1155
01:55:17,350 --> 01:55:25,090
So that's kind of a famous example of cadmium toxicity. So the downstream effects are mediated through the uptake in the renal tubules.

1156
01:55:26,050 --> 01:55:30,850
All right. So that is a lot of stuff there. There's your summary, slide four stuff to know.

1157
01:55:31,150 --> 01:55:35,860
Even though we did a lot of stuff, there's really only two lesions that we talked about in the kidney.

1158
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:40,480
Both are acute. So you can have perspective. And as I said,

1159
01:55:40,630 --> 01:55:45,190
just knowing kind of the main points of what it looks at looks like and one toxicant

1160
01:55:45,190 --> 01:55:49,599
that can cause those findings and this was their kind of so you can see the complexity,

1161
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:53,290
but that's crosstalk. All right. Thank you, guys.

1162
01:55:57,160 --> 01:56:04,680
But you to travel and think. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1163
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:12,850
No, I was going to see my family, but my dad, no doubt, my parents not.

1164
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,810
Know you're not worried about us like that. No, it's fine.

1165
01:56:20,630 --> 01:56:33,910
Yeah, I like my other staff there that I would try to like so.

1166
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:38,570
And also I just saw these. Yeah. So you're just here to think about this stuff?

1167
01:56:39,390 --> 01:56:45,080
We know we're preparing for the last game there.

1168
01:56:46,830 --> 01:56:51,730
Yeah. And then there's also we were debating the the bus.

1169
01:56:52,950 --> 01:56:58,510
I know that happens. Is I of.

1170
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:06,630
So, like, if you don't leave in your peer groups, you're doing a measure of confidence,

1171
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:10,140
essentially the same if you're going to get the same result repeated in November.

1172
01:57:10,170 --> 01:57:13,340
Yeah, I can't remember. Where is the Typekit?

1173
01:57:13,770 --> 01:57:17,909
Oh, yeah. It's like this is day zero. Yeah. How many do I tell you?

1174
01:57:17,910 --> 01:57:22,500
How many? Second. For all the reasons I selected for first place.

1175
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:25,620
Near were these when we collected antibodies? Yeah.

1176
01:57:25,620 --> 01:57:33,230
I think we collected serum at each of these days and all of that information at zero.

1177
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:36,810
Okay. So this is baseline and then we just check that you guys are concerned.

1178
01:57:36,850 --> 01:57:46,739
I got it right. Yeah. So I would consider this a repeated measure in the way that I know to compare even to groups with repeated measures.

1179
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:54,190
They know what they're doing as. Sorry. So you could do a t test you describe.

1180
01:57:54,230 --> 01:57:57,270
But essentially what we've done is like, you know.

1181
01:57:57,550 --> 01:58:01,500
Yeah, but that means you're increasing number of times.

1182
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:06,000
I know you're doing those right. Right.

1183
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:12,959
I remember. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I went to the know kind of corrects for that because a little bit of that area but you do

1184
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:19,860
yeah so do you recognize the that like the sample in the high point it kind of tracks.

1185
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:30,010
Oh so like I don't want to start off higher here and letting that and then checking for the influence of the samples, at least the same ones.

1186
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:33,330
It's like I'm hearing. Okay, that makes sense.

1187
01:58:33,870 --> 01:58:38,759
Yeah, I would say I feel like you would have to just have to specify.

1188
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:42,219
That's two groups. Yeah, right. That makes sense.

1189
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:47,760
Yes. And then our other question was, I think we were just confused of what the Y axis is saying.

1190
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:53,250
So there's is this the concentration of the serum neutralizing antibody?

1191
01:58:53,250 --> 01:59:01,750
Because I know when we were doing looking at the plaque reduction, yeah, I some of the graphs we had were showing different things like that.

1192
01:59:01,770 --> 01:59:04,499
Yeah. So the reciprocal titer,

1193
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:12,270
so like if you have when you do the plaque neutralizing acid so that ordinary plaque formation assay is like you're growing the cells.

1194
01:59:12,270 --> 01:59:14,040
So there's going to be a certain amount of cells there.

1195
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:23,940
And as you can see if I can do it in my head, as you give a level of virus, there's going to be increased plaques.

1196
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:33,510
But if I add a higher amount of antibody, so like a 1 to 10 dilution of antibody versus a 1 to 100 versus a one to whatever.

1197
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:38,220
Yeah. If I add sufficient antibody, I'm going to neutralize that effect of the virus.

1198
01:59:38,850 --> 01:59:48,840
And then the higher so and then I'm going to look for a plaque reduction below a certain threshold level.

1199
01:59:49,170 --> 01:59:55,440
So I'm trying to pick the dilution of antibody that will reduce below that level 50 I think for 60%.

1200
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:58,880
Yeah. Yeah. And then the.
