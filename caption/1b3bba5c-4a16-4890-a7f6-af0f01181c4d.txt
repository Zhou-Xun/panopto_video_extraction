1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,310
Was like a Friday because I'm done for a week. How is the graduation?

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,440
That's why I'm so tired. I didn't sleep at all the whole time, so I'm like just thrown right back to school.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:19,590
Did you go to the Midway Museum? We I wanted to, but we ended up going to this, like, tied fool thing and said, okay, but I wanted to go there.

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,370
San Diego. There's always now. There's always another time. Graduate.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,400
No, I just graduated from the Marines. Oh, God.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,420
We went out there for him. It's been like his life, passion and dreams.

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,020
So it's, like, kind of nice there. And it's happened.

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:40,850
So it was cool. It's always stressful to take trips during the semester.

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:49,080
A couple of the professors in our department are going to the I as IEEE conference and I think I think Greece,

10
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:56,909
Greece and then Portugal, and they're one week after another. And I was like, I can't go this semester because I'm teaching three classes.

11
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,270
And Doctor, she was like, You should just go got and recorded your life.

12
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,100
And I was like, Dang it.

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:10,650
Oh, well, next year because it's too late to submit now let's but basically anyone's duffel bags or luggage they're going to I mean,

14
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,680
I know, but I know I know myself well enough to be like it's not going to be one of those things where I can actually,

15
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,910
like, fully relax and enjoy it because I'm like so many,

16
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,790
like people are still emailing me like I'm not going to have time to, like, leisurely stroll and like, you do the work trip.

17
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:35,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so we're going head and finish the lecture last week.

18
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,139
So we're going to finish that and then talk about pre-testing cognitive interviews,

19
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,240
and then I'm going to get more into conceptual and theoretical models and theories.

20
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:55,800
I think your pilot is coming up in a few weeks, your pilot assignment being due in a few weeks.

21
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,160
Those are perusal assignment during the week on Sunday?

22
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:06,850
Yes. Somebody for sending a check to make sure that it works because I set that up myself.

23
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:18,040
So let me know if it doesn't. So for the model of survey response process, there's four major components that we have to think of.

24
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:25,290
We talked a little bit about, you know, comprehension. What are the meanings of the words or the context, the retrieval.

25
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,190
Is this something like that people can actually recall and can it be constructed?

26
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:36,100
How long will it take for them to like estimate and judge what the answer will be?

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,690
And is there even an answer option if it's closed ended,

28
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,290
that's appropriate for them to fit that judgment that they make about how they will choose to answer this.

29
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:57,190
So on the continuing continuum of respondents approaches, we have two roads that are at the extreme.

30
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,010
One is called the low road and then the high road.

31
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:08,379
So at the low road you have satisficing, where you're only seeking to understand the question well enough to provide a reasonable answer.

32
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:16,540
But like, you're not going to go out of your way to like really dig into that brain there.

33
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,050
So I think I taught maybe this class with the other class.

34
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:27,610
I'm participating in that two year long COVID study run by the university, mostly like, you know, from our school.

35
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,740
They don't pay you at all. You have to get your blood drawn every two months.

36
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:40,570
They made me get an extra blood draw after I had COVID, and then they wanted me to do an additional one.

37
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,860
And I was like, I'm buying. And they were like, Can you come? And I was like, Go away, you don't pay me.

38
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,250
But they just sent me cause it's been about a month now.

39
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:55,420
They sent me this super long survey where they asked, like, What symptoms did I?

40
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,590
Well, it was a long COVID survey. Asked me what symptoms do I have?

41
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:05,860
And then for every symptom that populated, like the new mini survey where like fatigue and body aches,

42
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:11,020
like on the scale of like the happy face scale of like 0 to 10 and then,

43
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:17,240
you know, how many weeks did you experience that still experiencing if you're still experiencing like 0 to 10?

44
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,379
I'm like, blah, blah, blah. So out of all of them,

45
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:29,260
I missed one that I left blank in the person like emailed me and like screenshot of my answer and like circled and she was like, you miss this?

46
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:35,620
Like, what about your height? Okay, good for you for like going after like not having missing data.

47
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:44,020
But I can imagine after like answering so many of those people are just like, yeah, I kind of think it's like this, right?

48
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,050
Optimizing is the opposite,

49
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:55,240
where people spend a long time in excruciating detail to kind of pick apart the nuance of what they think the question should mean.

50
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,390
And it may vary by question. It's not like they're going to satisfy the entire survey,

51
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:08,740
although you do have people that kind of just go down with like agree on a whole thing or like neutral, an awful thing.

52
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,469
There's also two sources of error that we can talk about.

53
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,270
The first let's talk about acquiescence is the tendency to agree rather than disagree.

54
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,100
So like I said, like, people don't want to necessarily come off as negative.

55
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,850
So they'll just say, like they agreed to something a lot.

56
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:37,970
And then social desirability, even if the questionnaire is fully anonymous, people might feel like, okay, they're being judged in some way.

57
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,370
Like the the researcher may judge them in some way.

58
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,930
So like when you often ask questions about like safety at work, for example,

59
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,570
like no one's going to like generally not a lot of people are going to be like, Oh, I've been super careless and stuff like that.

60
00:05:52,810 --> 00:06:01,420
Or if it has like social desirability where it's a questionnaire maybe on like intentions to help other people or like protect the environment,

61
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:09,100
you might give that kind of social desirability bias where people change their answers to appear a certain way.

62
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:17,439
How do you ever know, though? You don't. So that's just like when in your limitations, that's something that you have to acknowledge.

63
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,310
If you think you have a topic that you're addressing where that might potentially be a problem.

64
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,500
There's also the primacy of fact in the recency effect.

65
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:35,319
So the tendency to select one of the answers that are given first in a list and this is obviously more common on paper and administered surveys,

66
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,490
whereas the recency effect, you tend to give one of the last answers.

67
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:45,819
So if you're given like a phone or face to face interview where people give you like five options,

68
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,979
you just pick like whatever the last two between the last two things that they said might

69
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:59,440
be telescoping is the tendency to see events in the past as having occurred more recently,

70
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,670
recently than they have. Then. So this causes overreporting.

71
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:12,040
So like, if someone says in the last six months, how many times did you attend an art exhibit play or other arts performance?

72
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,330
How many of you can like confidently answer this question?

73
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:23,110
I don't think I've ever done one zero. Okay. You've never been to, like, a museum of art.

74
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,280
You play or perform it? Don't know if I was at a museum. Like an art exhibit.

75
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,900
Yeah, I can say yes, but I could have killed it. Yeah.

76
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,540
Yeah. Zero one because of rule that would have if we weren't in COVID.

77
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,930
Would you be able to answer this question? Okay.

78
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:44,260
Like, let's just say different. In the past six months, how many times have you gone to the grocery store?

79
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,559
A lot. A lot. See, it's like those are kinds of things too difficult to quantify.

80
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:02,430
Or like someone asked me in the past six months, like, how many times did you like go see a doctor?

81
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:10,290
And, you know, I could go through the trouble of, like, logging into my little account and then, like, counting up the number of things.

82
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,150
But since the pandemic, like, what is time?

83
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:21,390
Like, things that happened two years ago seemed like it happened yesterday, but also like five years ago.

84
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,500
So so these recall questions where you have a really large time span are really susceptible to telescoping,

85
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,770
then you have unfamiliar and ambiguous language.

86
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:40,730
So. This one probably doesn't mean anything to you, but I would say,

87
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,980
how would you describe the level of stratification within the College University New York system before and after 1999?

88
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:58,380
So that's kind of like how would you describe how we stratified schools and colleges at the University of Michigan before and after 1999,

89
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,700
like, I don't know, convoluted grammar.

90
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,650
I don't believe that the right to assemble has no limits.

91
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,760
That's confusing for me. And I'm a native English speaker.

92
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:19,970
Public officials often aren't really interested in the problems of the average person.

93
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,890
That is that is a less confusing sentence. But you still have to like think about it for a second.

94
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:34,430
And then there's also conceptual complexity. What rate would you say your views on premarital sex have changed over the last ten years, since 1998?

95
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,650
Well, I was eight then, so I don't know. It's been like a long time.

96
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,219
But again, that's like a conceptual complexity question.

97
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:52,700
Like, even my views on basic political stuff have changed within the last four years, let alone like 20, ten, 20 years.

98
00:09:53,300 --> 00:10:01,370
Okay, these are awful. Don't do these unless you really have to for some reason.

99
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:09,109
So ranking where people essentially like you have, usually it's like this long list and I've seen ones that are up to 20,

100
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:15,229
I've done some that are up to 20 where you have to kind of like move them in the order in which it goes.

101
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,440
And then like we try to insert one into and then it like moves everything.

102
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,270
So these are frustrating questions where people just give up.

103
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:30,860
So rather than doing ranking, what are some alternative ways to ask or the statement?

104
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:38,510
Please rank the following benefit you would look into for Royalty Rewards program for an online travel agency.

105
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:46,610
What's another way to ask these questions? Could you do like choose the top three benefits you would look for?

106
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,810
Like check that check. You should check the top three. Okay, that's good.

107
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,770
You go one by one and say, like, how important is this to you and this girl?

108
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,900
Them like, not important to very important. Yeah. You do like 1 to 10.

109
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:12,550
Other thoughts? You can also still do drinking if you really want, but rather than having it as like this dragging situation,

110
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:20,100
ask them to number them in order of importance where they can like do that as well.

111
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:26,710
But bringing questions are generally also avoid avoid double barreled questions.

112
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:34,000
So how would you rate the quality and prestige of an Indiana University graduate degree?

113
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,790
So when I answer this, am I answering about the quality, the prestige, or both?

114
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,410
There's another example of a double barreled statement.

115
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:53,260
There is little use writing public officials because they often aren't really interested in the problems of the average person.

116
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:59,919
True or false or agree or disagree? Am I answering to the part that there's little use in writing them,

117
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,110
or my answering to the part where they aren't really interested in the average person's problems or both?

118
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:14,379
And then a behavioral example is, in the last 30 days, when you withdrew cash from an ATM machine, how often did you withdraw?

119
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:21,540
Less than $25. I haven't been to an ATM machine in a very long time, so I don't even know how.

120
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,180
I can't even answer this question. How many of you have been to an ATM in the last month?

121
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,000
Just Josh. Okay. Yeah.

122
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,950
I don't tender cash really anymore.

123
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,400
There's only a few situations. Yeah. Like.

124
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:43,910
Like a like a like a like a food vendor at a local art fair or something like that.

125
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,410
Or like, I don't know, you're buying something off someone from, like,

126
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:55,130
Craigslist or something that they're traveling like specifically in the U.P. with my boyfriend or and she was like,

127
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,700
You kid, you really carry cash on you and everyone can read a card.

128
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,050
So you're like traveling to remote areas, I guess.

129
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,180
I've never been to the U.P., but good to know. Yeah.

130
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:12,560
I don't like using credit cards at airports because I don't want to go down like their credit card stuff and scan.

131
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:22,670
Mhm. Or if you go to like a Vietnamese business, it's usually cash only, but that's for tax efficient purposes.

132
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,940
This is almost like paying the credit merchant fee. Yes, yes.

133
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,760
Yeah, for sure. Yes.

134
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:42,350
I don't have I've switch banks so many times because I've moved over the country that my bank doesn't have a brick and mortar place here anymore.

135
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:48,620
So that's like a behavioral question I couldn't answer. So like, how are you? Would you pick this up in the last 30 days?

136
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:55,820
You would do this as a skip logic question. Meaning in the last 30 days, have you withdrawn cash from an ATM?

137
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,139
Yes or no? Okay. If it's no, they move on to the next thing.

138
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,710
If it's yes, then they get the second part of the question.

139
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,830
How often do you draw withdraw? Less than $25.

140
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,630
Always. Usually, sometimes or never. Does that make sense?

141
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,990
There's also wording effects that you have to think of.

142
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:25,210
So do you think the U.S. should forbid public speeches against democracy, against strong language, with the forbid?

143
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,010
Or do you think the U.S. will succeed in staying out of the war?

144
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,820
Which war? But also war is a touchy subject to a lot of people.

145
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:40,990
And then if you use terms like illegal immigrants versus undocumented workers, depending on who your target population is,

146
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:48,250
you might be turning some people against go about as it's just the experience that you kind of develop its own language within like

147
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:57,240
what the use or is it like kind of just like plain language principles when developing and using the right words or plain language,

148
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,480
nothing that evokes super strong emotion.

149
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:07,570
So like as a survey writer, you should try to be as neutral as possible.

150
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,880
So like in the best practice, just say like you have a group of questions.

151
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,160
The each section should ideally have its own instructions.

152
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:25,089
And you can say for like to what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statements?

153
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,360
Like you wouldn't just say, to what extent do you agree with the following statements?

154
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:36,790
You have to try to be inclusive as both, but also like pilot testing and cognitive interviews help at time because like, that's how we talk.

155
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:42,570
Like things we talked about, like how the Latino community does not actually like the term Latin Act.

156
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,200
So you don't want to like use that in the survey or like, you know,

157
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:55,689
a community might feel more comfortable with you using like a certain term to identify them rather than like what we think we should use as academics.

158
00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:00,190
So like, for example, you know, now you're supposed to like,

159
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:06,040
say persons with like a characteristic like persons experiencing housing

160
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:13,180
instability or like person experiencing like disabilities or something like that.

161
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:22,440
But if your survey was to target people who were experiencing housing instability and they read it and they were like, Who is that?

162
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:28,300
And they're and you're like, That's you. And they could say, like, why don't you just say homeless, right?

163
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:36,639
So yes, just how far down the wording effects connotation rabbit hole do we go further

164
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,990
explain examples obviously make sense but like so do you think the U.S. like.

165
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:49,090
Well but there have been studies or is there like a dictionary of very neutral words because like think versus feel versus believe?

166
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:56,740
And I'm like even the way I feel like you say U.S. versus the United States or that all might kind of change the response.

167
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,590
I'm kind of curious as to not that far down not that far down the rabbit hole.

168
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:11,290
I mean, you could write out United States, you can put you s but here because they're saying will succeed in staying out of the war,

169
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:20,199
it's kind of already presenting like like a value statement on the questions dumb itself.

170
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,149
So you could rephrase this as a statement.

171
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:31,629
Like, to what extent do you think the U.S. will be involved in the war?

172
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,830
And you could do like very little to a lot, something like that.

173
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,070
That's a little bit less evocative.

174
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,650
Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm crazy on Plantation.

175
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:52,059
It's it's like think or feel, but it's like, you know, just I mean, yeah, but it's also specificity.

176
00:17:52,060 --> 00:18:01,990
So this is a question for like where they're they they they differentiate working for pay on campus versus working for pay off campus.

177
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:12,100
Or like I said, like when you want people to answer more clearly, you put like examples in parentheses following your question and stuff.

178
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,620
So preparing for a class that includes things like studying, reading, writing, doing homework,

179
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,859
lab work, blah, and then participating in co-curricular activity is like, here are some examples.

180
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,820
So that like if a person had ambiguity just from reading this part,

181
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:34,720
then the examples that are provided at least give them a better context of how to answer the question.

182
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:42,110
So these are just like some guidelines from the Dillman book.

183
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,730
No, this is from Groves,

184
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:52,129
where they just have some basic guidelines for writing open ended questions and closed ended questions that I put in there for you.

185
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,630
All guidelines for ordinal closed ended questions.

186
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:04,010
This is a big one. Choosing between a unipolar and a bipolar scale.

187
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,790
So the bipolar is like bad to good.

188
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,890
Agree to disagree.

189
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:30,110
Unipolar is like worse, worse or worse where we're kind of like on the same side of the semantic scale or like, you know, bad, horrible, devastating.

190
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,670
Like that's unipolar, a bipolar scale.

191
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:40,520
If you're using words rather than numbers, it's also sometimes called a semantic differential scales.

192
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:49,310
So like very unlikely to very likely is a semantic differential scale, choose the appropriate scale length.

193
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,290
So generally, you know, people like to keep it to about five categories.

194
00:19:54,650 --> 00:20:00,440
There's sometimes when you might go to seven because a theory or a conceptual framework that you're using tells you two,

195
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:06,420
unless it's like a dichotomous response, like yes, no, true or false.

196
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,090
Very seldom will you see just three, right?

197
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,059
Like I don't very often just see like agree, neutral, disagree.

198
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,810
There's usually some something else tacked on the other side.

199
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,430
Like I said, verbally label all categories.

200
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:33,860
You don't have to like be super explicit in what you're explaining to like the person about what you're trying to do for your specific study.

201
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,120
But like if you're like, okay,

202
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,749
in these next block of questions has to do with work stress or these next block of questions have to do with job satisfaction,

203
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,320
like you can use sub headers to label it as such.

204
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,829
And then we talked a little bit about this already.

205
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:58,459
The no opinion or don't know the problem is that this has multiple possible meanings to it because some people really

206
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:04,460
may not know how to answer it or they just might feel like it's easier to just mark that and then not answer it.

207
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:11,390
So this causes ambivalence, and it may be due to a lack of sufficient knowledge to answer.

208
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,430
Or sometimes like when I'm asked something like I really like literally don't care.

209
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:24,499
So like yesterday I got a survey asking how satisfied I was with my last with the customer,

210
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,920
with the customer service I got from the vice provost office to help me submit my last grant.

211
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:36,890
And like they did it, but it wasn't like amazing.

212
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,340
But it also they didn't mess up. So I just put neutral on a lot of them.

213
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,450
Job. Yeah, like literally their job, which it was a, it was an experience.

214
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:55,639
It was an it happens right around here but you know, the trade offs is okay.

215
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,660
Pros and cons, this may encourage satisficing, but, you know,

216
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:05,600
it may more accurately reflect attitudes because some people may feel strongly about certain things in market that way.

217
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,620
So again, like when giving the option of no opinion, don't know or choose not to respond.

218
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,560
Think about if you actually really need it there.

219
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:24,620
So like the the survey that we have right now, a non-pharmacological pain management approaches in the construction industry.

220
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,920
A lot of the construction industry are Hispanic or Latino, and they're not native English speakers.

221
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:39,860
So we asked them about things like using analgesics like topical analgesics, music therapy, acupressure.

222
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:46,340
We have the call them, I don't know, because some of them like literally may not know what that is.

223
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:55,670
So pros, pros and cons, these are some more question guides about how to order questions for you.

224
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:01,220
So that was finishing the last part of last week's lecture.

225
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,970
Any any questions for me about that?

226
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,240
Okay. This servers are kind of trashed by more hard sciences people.

227
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:17,430
Yes, they are. To what extent do you think the lab will provide information?

228
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,760
Do you think that they can provide really good information or.

229
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,410
I mean, like, I guess to what level should we trust? Service.

230
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,899
Oh, I don't go to the supplier. Yeah.

231
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:35,550
I mean, that's biased because like most of my research is survey research, but like it's like because I do a lot of community work.

232
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:40,420
I don't have a lot of money. People love to throw money at cancer.

233
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,680
They don't like to throw money at work or health. So, you know, I kind of have to balance like my goals.

234
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:55,860
And, you know, I, I as a I don't personally feel comfortable to like do a randomized controlled trial.

235
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:01,110
I would never do a clinical trial. Right. So those are obviously like the gold standard.

236
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,879
When I can't get that close,

237
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:11,550
I'll try to do something crazy experimental by potentially using like secondary data that has like a more robust sample size,

238
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:17,430
but there's still like a lot of value in doing surveys.

239
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:24,299
I do mixed methods research, so I'm like that person that's like there's equal benefit in qualitative and

240
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,500
quantitative because there's only so much you can find out by like looking at cells,

241
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:32,219
but there's also only so much you can find out by like collecting air samples and there's

242
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,620
only so much you can find out from getting people's like perceptions or opinions on paper.

243
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:46,530
And then, you know, you have to eventually talk to people and then you can triangulate all that data to make your findings more robust.

244
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:56,990
Yeah. There's a lot of people who have a very narrow view of what research actually is.

245
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:08,180
Um, and it's interesting. And I will say for one of the recent big studies that just got funded and they have like a survey type thing,

246
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,260
like some of us just like clicked on it out of curiosity.

247
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:24,500
So it's like, oh, if only there was somebody in the department who like to ask me to be on it.

248
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:32,570
It's okay, but I'm. Yeah, a little salty, but yeah, I think there's value.

249
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:36,600
But obviously it depends on like the like your circumstance, right?

250
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,300
So, like, I would not do a search like.

251
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:50,359
Went through a survey to see the effectiveness of open medicine. No, it obviously wouldn't do that.

252
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,829
Right. Or but at the same time,

253
00:25:51,830 --> 00:26:01,549
like I wouldn't necessarily do a survey to like but like try to get the the point of view or perceptions of like a very

254
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:09,250
marginalized or overlooked group without like following back up with them in some sort of way or doing like a mixed methods study.

255
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:15,140
So like there's, there's explanatory sequential and then exploratory sequential.

256
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:20,570
So explanatory sequential is where you collect quantitative data first.

257
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:25,670
And that can either be like a survey or like you use secondary data from that.

258
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:32,959
You look at it and see what the trends are and you're saying, okay, these are like things that are like three things that are a specific interest.

259
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,230
So then you might follow that up with like some detailed key informant interviews or focus groups or something like that.

260
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,909
And then exploratory sequential is the opposite way where like maybe you start out by

261
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:48,860
like conducting focus groups or doing observations or doing like a ethnographic study,

262
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:53,329
or you're looking at documents and then you collect data that way and you look at some, you know,

263
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:59,360
you do your themes and your coding, and then from there you decide to follow that up with more quantitative measures.

264
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:08,330
Like, okay, we've heard from like hotel workers that they have a lot of stress and they're exposed to like X, Y and Z during the day.

265
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:14,630
So we're going to also follow that up by doing like collecting some biomarkers and some like, you know,

266
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:21,200
health data, like blood pressure, collecting blood samples, looking at our static load and these kinds of things.

267
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:31,010
Yeah. Mm hmm. Um, so, again, like drafting an example, to what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statements?

268
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:35,690
I feel a sense of accomplishment in my activities as a nurse.

269
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:46,510
Is this a double barreled question? No.

270
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:53,590
No. How come? Even talking about one thing.

271
00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:01,620
Which is like. Your accomplishment as a nurse and your activities as a nurse?

272
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:10,710
Yeah, I guess I'm kind of you view that exactly like the perfect double barreled, but often kind of just where you could be.

273
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:17,460
I don't know. I mean, you're asking about frequency and if you feel incompetent, I feel like it's kind of you're trying to get at two things.

274
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,720
Yes. How do you interpret the word often?

275
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:30,930
Is that a feeling? Do I make a cutoff that says more than 60% of the time?

276
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,649
You know, those are kind of hard, which, you know,

277
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:42,420
like that's the same thing with like aq9 or like a gad where they're like those anxiety and question depression questionnaires or the like.

278
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,780
How often do you feel like hopeless?

279
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:52,210
Most days. Some days. All the days. Like it's it's very variable, but every person is different.

280
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:58,350
So for your pre-testing methods, there's a couple of ways for you to go about it.

281
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,850
You're going to do pilot testing for this class,

282
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:08,700
but if you're ever doing are going to do pilot testing and cognitive interviews, so you're going to do three and five together.

283
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:15,450
But there's a couple of ways to pretest versus expert reviews so you can get like people who are expert in the

284
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:23,580
content or people who are experts in like questionnaire and survey design or both and get them to review your survey.

285
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,440
So even when we have surveys that are like internal, like the whole research team,

286
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:36,390
I always be to test it not only to work out the kinks that might have come through on Qualtrics, but also like they read through drafts.

287
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:43,620
Like every survey that I've ever done has had at least five drafts where it's like reading through the questions, Does this actually make sense?

288
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:51,870
You can also conduct focus groups to pretest your survey, although this is a bit more time consuming and it's going to cost you money.

289
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,200
Usually, number one, you can ask people to do it for you for free.

290
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:01,770
But if you're asking people to conduct like a focus group, like, you're going to have to pay them most likely for their time.

291
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:07,950
Cognitive interviews will get to you in a second, then feel testing and behavioral coding.

292
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,990
How many of you have done any field testing or behavioral coding before?

293
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,920
This is also not soup. Josh, I did a test for.

294
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:31,700
I was in my undergrad. It was for like one of those science papers hosted, um, showing people whatever, like education at the University of Chicago.

295
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:35,290
And actually I did like, I met boom. I'm not sure if that counts.

296
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,730
I mean, it's like usability for yeah, yeah, yeah.

297
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:46,790
In my undergrad I was a cog ci, a major cognitive science major and I worked in this like speech and language lab and as a research assistant,

298
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:52,580
as an undergrad, like we would go out, it was for kids under the age of five.

299
00:30:52,610 --> 00:31:01,069
So these are like preschool kids, so we'd have to get parental consent and they were like cute pictures that played specific like vowel

300
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:06,110
sounds because we were trying to figure out how quickly kids pick up like these language patterns.

301
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,650
But what we did was we had like a car seat.

302
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:15,350
It was me and this other undergrad. We had a car seat and then we put it on the ground and strap the kid on it.

303
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:21,950
You put like a dot on there for a head and then you have to calibrate the eye tracking machine.

304
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:28,939
And kids are always like, Yeah. And then and then based on like you go through the exercise or the cute little cartoons and

305
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:36,230
it captures their eye tracking to see like what visuals or like cues they respond to first.

306
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:47,600
They do this with adults too. They see like some technology these days, like an advertising the media also captures, like these kinds of things.

307
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:54,739
This, again, is more complicated. And then there's pilot testing where you do a small scale, full administration.

308
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:02,510
So you're going to do that with three people. We said, but you could do it anywhere from between, like ten, 15, 20 people.

309
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:10,340
Or you can do like randomized or split ballot experiments where like one group receives one

310
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:15,559
form of your pilot survey and another group receives another form of the pilot survey.

311
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:19,550
You either rearrange it or it like the questions are ordered differently,

312
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:26,840
or you're you might have like things worded differently and you see how people respond to that.

313
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:37,740
So here is an example of a pretest for the National Student Engagement Survey that I was talking about that Dr. Gona does.

314
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:43,500
So this one is a statement that said carefully revise the.

315
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:52,800
This was the original statement, carefully revise the content or organization of that paper before turning it in, never to very often.

316
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:58,560
So you can see how the freshmen answer versus how the seniors answered.

317
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:08,460
But then after they did the pilot testing, they reworded this statement to prepare two or more drafts of a paper or assignment before turning it in.

318
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:17,040
And you can see how the percentages change, where it's not heavily weighted to that often or very often,

319
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:21,450
but it's more evenly distributed between the answer choices.

320
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:29,280
Because for some people, like carefully revising, the content just means like grammar and punctuation.

321
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:34,710
And then this one here, like when you're doing drafts, you're thinking more intellectually about the content.

322
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:45,630
So like, this is what I want to see from you when you discuss this in your final report where you'll talk about like initially this,

323
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,170
like you don't have to change like every question on your survey.

324
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:58,050
It might just be like five that you change, but like highlighting like did the wording changed, the answer choices change and so on.

325
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,500
You don't have to provide me with frequencies or anything like that.

326
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:07,380
You just need to be able to discuss that. And when you're doing your pilot testing and cognitive interviews,

327
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:14,820
make sure that you're ready to take notes when you work with folks so you're able to like include that in your report.

328
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:24,660
So we as a group are going to do a concurrent think aloud, exercise the think aloud exercises, the cognitive interview.

329
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:32,700
It's sometimes called they're called the same thing. So like generally with a think aloud exercise,

330
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:40,710
you just do this for like one question or one set of questions or you can force one to do it for your entire survey,

331
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:47,760
which is what I did when I piloted my dissertation. So obviously you want to thank the person for their time.

332
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,030
You want to let them know, like I'm piloting the survey.

333
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:59,489
So like the reason for this is for you to help me, you know, either refine the wording, determine like what questions are confusing,

334
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:05,040
or you have a challenging time answering and explain to them what the think aloud entails.

335
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:14,700
So with that you want to explain to them you're not only going to read the question and the question choices to me out loud,

336
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:19,920
but things that normally would be inside that are like internal processes.

337
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:28,110
You're going to make a really concerted effort to vocalize that to me, so I will do.

338
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:36,040
So. Okay, we'll practice. We will practice and then make sure you take notes.

339
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:42,460
Okay. So I will do this first one as an example, and then the next one I'll call on one of you.

340
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:52,870
Okay. So, okay. In the last 20 and the last day, that is 24 hours, how many ounces of candy have you eaten?

341
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,409
Round or answer to the nearest ounce circle.

342
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:04,120
One of the choices below zero ounces, 1 to 2 ounces, 3 to 4 ounces or five ounces or more.

343
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:10,870
So I'm going to bridge it. Pretend to be that the person who wrote this question and I'm doing it a single out.

344
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:17,830
Okay. So I said, okay, in the last day, 24 hours, how many ounces of candy how many does candy include chocolate?

345
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,460
Yes. Yes, it does include chocolate. Okay. So I do eat chocolate, but I don't eat candy.

346
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:31,120
So if I had, like, chocolate covered almonds, does that count as candy?

347
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,940
Yeah. Okay. All right.

348
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:47,310
So yesterday in my office, I probably had, like, a handful of chocolate, coconut covered almonds, and I think they were like two ounces.

349
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,920
So that's two. And then I came home from work.

350
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,300
And then after dinner when I was watching House of the Dragon,

351
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:03,880
I like ate a couple more pieces of chocolate and I think they were like four ounces all together.

352
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:11,920
So I think I actually did eat five ounces or more yesterday, so I'm going to choose the last answer.

353
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:17,830
So like, do you see how like as the cognitive interview, I'm kind of going through my mental process.

354
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,340
What if you had said chocolate doesn't count? Thank you.

355
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:27,490
Two zero. Yeah. Yeah. So that totally changes the scope.

356
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:33,570
But if I have to ask you, does chocolate count, what are you going to do with this question?

357
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:38,510
Probably give examples of candies. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

358
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:44,870
Who wants to do this one? That as a think aloud person.

359
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:52,040
Sam. Okay. How many windows are there in your home?

360
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:56,350
Enter the number of in the blink. What am I doing?

361
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:01,630
You think you're doing the think alone? Well, I'm thinking of my home, so.

362
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:07,660
I mean, the place I'm living in right now. Um, how many rooms do I have?

363
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:12,580
I have my. It goes to glass doors to the campus windows.

364
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,640
Are those doors? Like the full, full glass doors?

365
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,210
No, those don't count. Those are doors. Okay.

366
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:27,860
Um, so then I have one in my kitchen now, including the doors in my living room, and then I have two in my bedroom.

367
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,640
So I have three windows. Is that? Is that it?

368
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:36,470
Yeah. I went through windows. I have a screen door that I have big three doors in that room.

369
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:41,750
Do you have a window in your bathroom? No. Oh. Did you pay more for windows?

370
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,760
Yeah. Yeah. These are apartments, right? Yeah. Okay. Okay.

371
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:50,870
I was like, one wouldn't have five one room or one in the bedroom and two windows in my living room, I guess.

372
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,070
One the screen door. So. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

373
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:58,190
See, like, see in your home. Your home is an apartment.

374
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:03,440
So, like, if I were doing this exercise, I would say I have a window,

375
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:10,520
but my front door and then in my living room I have two windows and I have a window in my

376
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:18,530
laundry room and then each bedroom has a window and then my basement has an egress window.

377
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:25,340
So I have eight windows at my house. So that's kind of like how I would think aloud to answer that question.

378
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:31,700
But you might get somebody who asks you like, do the patio door count? Okay, how about this one?

379
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:39,260
How would you how often does your job require you to lift heavy loads?

380
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,650
Mark an x next to the answer that best describes a situation.

381
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,740
The heavy metals like that.

382
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:59,150
They have like a certain member for about scales £50 and.

383
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:08,270
I would say my job is. Just sitting in the office, so I would stay.

384
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,890
No more. Most of the time. Okay. Okay.

385
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:16,940
Do any of you lift heavy loads? Okay. Yeah.

386
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,930
I mean, I just said £50 because that's the recommended weight limit.

387
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:27,440
But for this one, you know, like just say like, oh, you work at Target or something like that.

388
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:32,360
How often does your job require you to lift heavy loads if you don't specify the weight?

389
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:41,000
Someone may not know how to answer that, but also what's a heavy load to me may not be a heavy load to somebody else.

390
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:47,090
Like oddly shaped like things yet to lift because I know like my peasant work at Christmas

391
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:50,510
where we had a lift a lot like this weirdly shaped stuff that might have been heavy,

392
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:54,440
but it's just like because of the, like, physics of the way the weight is distributed.

393
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,440
Yeah. Yeah, it was probably better. And just for that.

394
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:03,800
Yeah. Yeah. Like if you, if you give me a square box that's £50, I can lift it.

395
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:12,440
Yeah, but like the other weekend when I was walking dogs at the Humane Society, most pit bulls are just £50 of pure muscle.

396
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,979
And one yanks me two like forget high heaven.

397
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:20,630
And that seemed a lot more forceful than if I was lifting £50.

398
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:27,950
So as you're doing your cognitive interviews with, you know, folks, so like obviously yes,

399
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:36,640
pilot tested with at least three have three people go through your entire survey.

400
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,000
But for the cognitive interviews, if you have a really nice person or friend,

401
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:49,550
ideally they would do like a think aloud for every question or you can have them do it on a specific subset,

402
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:57,830
which you're really unsure about because you don't necessarily need them to ask like, like do a think aloud on like what's your age rate?

403
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:02,149
Or like unless they're like, I don't like that you're asking these in categories.

404
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,240
I should be able to like fill it in number, right?

405
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:13,549
But be able to conduct enough think allows for you to demonstrate that you've improved your

406
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:19,160
questionnaire between the pilot in the final and there was some kind of justification for that.

407
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:28,880
Now, what if you interview cognitive interview three people and they say three totally different things about your question?

408
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,620
Does that mean you need to interview more people? Yeah, it's a bet or it's a bad question.

409
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:41,630
Or you just make like a judgment call on that.

410
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:47,990
But like I said, like in the sample questionnaire that I put from a student from previous semester.

411
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:51,860
Like two of the sections were from validated questionnaires,

412
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:58,390
and then one section they decided to make up like their own questions for a scale that didn't exist.

413
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:06,830
So, you know, if that's already validated, you can certainly pilot like cognitive test those to see how it is.

414
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:12,530
But if it's like in that situation, I would definitely do what they think allowed on the ones that you created.

415
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,460
Okay. All right.

416
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:23,610
Questions on that before we move on. Okay.

417
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:34,800
So your thoughts. What's the difference between a theory look ahead versus a theoretical or conceptual framework?

418
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:41,669
What's the difference? Josh My understanding,

419
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:48,620
and I think this is on the quote or something was a theory is like I think there I think a theory of gravity theory of evolution,

420
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:52,820
which is like broadly plausible. Literally everything is like reality.

421
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:59,059
That theoretical conceptual framework is more like in this scenario I can understand X by looking at it

422
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:04,280
through the lens of this or like this might not be a comprehensive framework to understand the world.

423
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,550
But when we're looking at this, the usual way to apply.

424
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:10,760
Yeah, yeah. To yes, yes, yes.

425
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:22,340
Very close. So a theory is a set of interrelated constructs or concepts that is a systematic view of a phenomenon in specifying variables.

426
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:25,159
Within explaining the purpose of predicting that phenomena,

427
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:30,890
what does very complicated whereas constructs are considered the building blocks that make a theory.

428
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:37,159
So these are terms that have been adopted by the theorist or researcher used to explain the phenomena.

429
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:44,570
Like I said, something abstract, like again, job satisfaction, a psychological trauma,

430
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:52,130
psychological harassment, things that we can't see with our eyes per se, but we also can't measure like wait.

431
00:44:53,660 --> 00:45:01,879
And then a conceptual framework is a schematic representation that describes the way the world or part of the world looks like,

432
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,750
and it's used in regular life in research. The thing with the theory, though,

433
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:14,300
is that so many people have validated the constructs within it that it is essentially more or less accepted as like,

434
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:24,440
Oh, this is fact or something like the theory of relativity, the theory of planned behavior, the health behavior model, the theory of reasoned action.

435
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:30,770
These have all been really super well constructed, so oh, very plainly.

436
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:39,230
So we know for a fact that intention to perform intention is a precursor to behavior.

437
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,800
If you intend to do something that is a behavior.

438
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:48,620
And based on these constructs, we know that perceived behavioral control,

439
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:56,600
your perceived norms and your attitude towards the act inform what your intention is.

440
00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:04,310
And by then you can like use that as a proxy for behavior because sometimes you can't analyze a behavior directly.

441
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:11,210
So I use a version of this, for example, in my dissertation because mine was looking at evacuation during fire alarms.

442
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:16,790
I can't just go around campus setting little fires everywhere just to see what happened.

443
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:24,350
Although there was a girl in the business school who did that during finals week in the trash cans of women's restrooms just to get out of exams.

444
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,680
They caught her, though, from pool.

445
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:33,709
Right. But sometimes, like, they're like it's either an impractical to you directly analyze the behavior.

446
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:38,510
It's unethical. The behavior doesn't happen often enough when you can observe it.

447
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:46,070
So that's why you use this theory where you have items where you can measure to best explain the behavior.

448
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,030
Does intention always explain behavior?

449
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:56,719
No. But based on meta analysis, that of use, theory of planned behavior, theory of reasoned action, reason to action approach.

450
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:02,930
These are all variations of one another of like dozens and dozens of studies.

451
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:11,239
When you are able to measure intention, you're able to predict behavior 60% of the time, which is pretty good.

452
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:18,740
It's better than nothing. But you're able to target specifically like which component should I focus on for an intervention?

453
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:26,240
So like just say you find, you know, the intention to do binge drinking is most contingent on norms.

454
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:29,510
You might do a social media campaign, for example,

455
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:35,540
that gets towards people's perceived norms about what people like them do or what their peers are doing.

456
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:44,030
If you find out that, like someone's intention to exercise relates to their perceived behavioral control,

457
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:49,370
you want to kind of like boost their self-efficacy or their confidence to be able to do so.

458
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:57,860
And generally, like with intention, what people mean by attitude toward the act is, is it fun and does it feel good?

459
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:01,370
That's like the only way you can get people to do things in public health,

460
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:06,800
really, which sometimes they're not fun and they don't feel like wearing mask,

461
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:14,870
but that once you're able to figure that out, you're able to shape potentially people's attitudes by of something,

462
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:17,900
by changing like the way that it's messaged or conveyed.

463
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:32,680
Another example of a really well-established theory is social cognitive theory as t so this one talks about how you have personal processes,

464
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,660
behavioral processes and environmental processes.

465
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:45,340
So within these, each of these are constructs that we can measure through a set of questions to determine overall the relationship between this,

466
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,630
how you've talked about CTE in your classes, right? Yeah.

467
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:54,070
This is like kind of like, you know, this.

468
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:57,640
Do you want to know? You go ahead. Okay. Like this.

469
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:07,239
But that the theory that's like the example when it's like a kid with like a like a monkey doll sees some kids,

470
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:14,709
other kids punching it and you kind of like replicate that behavior and make them feel the right one note.

471
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:19,890
That might not be it, but it's kind of like the baby elephant experience.

472
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:26,350
Like in my brain, the most the biggest thing we focus on is self-efficacy.

473
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:32,570
So if you're smoking, do I believe I have the power to quit smoking?

474
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,520
Gotcha. And if I don't, then that's not going to happen.

475
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:44,060
It's just. It's okay. It's not. It's. It's the consequence.

476
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:52,700
Well, I'll let them keep looking at it. Which one is the mom? The kids watching them punch the monkey bozo doll.

477
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:58,069
I remember what you're talking about because I thought that was funny. But what was that trying to tell us?

478
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:05,740
I'm not sure. But was it basically like kids for good behavior for other kids or the kids didn't want to see the one?

479
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:11,400
The past was just like they were alone. And then it's like they watched a video or something and it's like, okay.

480
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:16,220
Or there's one kid already playing around with this and beating up.

481
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:20,000
Well, the other kids that haven't done it before, were they what were they doing?

482
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:28,040
Oh, that's social learning theory. Sorry. So that is from Bandura, where he talks about.

483
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:34,420
People see a behavior and whether it's rewarded, punished.

484
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:39,250
They may, you know, imitate or learn how to model after that.

485
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,710
So not social cognitive theory. That was social and certainly theories around like human behavior.

486
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:50,410
Yes. It's hard to keep track, but they're they're really well established despite my memory.

487
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:54,040
So the difference is between conceptual things.

488
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:59,580
So, okay, like here we have these well-established theories, here we have constructs within those theories.

489
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:08,830
So I guess it's self efficacy as a construct. And then you have a conceptual framework like the International Tobacco Control Conceptual Framework.

490
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:14,350
Somebody has developed this. Has it been validated or tested extensively?

491
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:20,530
No. And then you have like your underlying lens to which you create your research.

492
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:27,100
So like a positive orientation, you don't necessarily have to worry about this unless you pursue it.

493
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:38,770
So a theory is a type of conceptual framework, but a conceptual framework is not a type of theory.

494
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,679
More time. A theory.

495
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:52,540
A theory is a type of conceptual framework, but a conceptual framework is not a theory like how a square can be a rectangle, but not vice versa.

496
00:51:54,250 --> 00:52:02,500
So again, here we have like this is a core type of conceptual framework, but it is well specified, has been studied and tested.

497
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,660
The conceptual framework is more schematic non-linear.

498
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:12,580
It may apply to different types of things and it may not necessarily be well-defined or testable.

499
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,079
Yeah, that's a type of conceptual framework.

500
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:25,480
I mean, it's like a murder map, but like a map, for example, is a conceptual framework or a chart of a crime or a collection.

501
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:33,700
In communication, we can use graphics public health like the social ecological model planning frameworks

502
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:38,799
like precede proceed if you use like a logic model within your intervention,

503
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:46,750
that's a type of conceptual framework. If you have a research agenda or study agenda that or like some kind of like picture

504
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:51,310
that you've made that kind of describes like what's your lean in public health?

505
00:52:52,210 --> 00:53:02,050
So most people use this to help explain how you do your research, but it can also be used for particular studies with no established theory.

506
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:07,210
So in the workplace you can apply theories to the workplace.

507
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:13,510
It's so difficult because that's basically been my work for the last three years.

508
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:21,069
So it's been it's more common with psychosocial factors that you actually just see theoretical and conceptual frameworks and models

509
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:32,080
because this is not as well studied as like smoking behavior or diet or exercise like these things have been studied extensively,

510
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,730
like to the like and degree.

511
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:42,309
I'm surprised sometimes there's still more to find out because I feel like, you know, for example, for some things like with diet,

512
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:49,870
like every few years they'll go like back and forth on coffee, like, coffee's good for you, coffee's terrible for you.

513
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:55,060
And again, like, you know, these are harder to measure.

514
00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:03,190
So as we mentioned, the so now what's the difference between conceptualization and operationalization?

515
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:09,040
You'll be able to you have to be able to describe these to me as you're developing your survey.

516
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:14,469
As mentioned, the construct is the building block of the theory.

517
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:25,900
So these are terms that we've used to identify the phenomena, but like self-efficacy, intention, job satisfaction, turnover, intention.

518
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:35,770
How do we measure that? Okay, so really we're trying to go from the abstract to the non abstract.

519
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:39,340
So here's the real world.

520
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:44,320
We have the construct that we are interested in, right?

521
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:50,979
We have some kind of measurement process. There will be era when we're obtaining that because again,

522
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:56,430
of the diagram I showed you last week versus the measurement side excuse me versus the construction,

523
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:59,800
it's I we're going on the measurement side of survey development and you get data.

524
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:09,880
But measurement is not writing items on the survey, nor is it interviewing people or is it selecting a scale?

525
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:19,540
So what the heck does that actually mean? It's really an iterative process, though.

526
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:26,040
Okay. First you have a research question with a construct.

527
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:30,150
You identify what the contract is. We define it conceptually.

528
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:34,230
We define it operationally. I'll tell you what that means.

529
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:38,730
Second, we have actual items to measure it, maybe 3 to 4 items.

530
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:43,380
We collect data on it. We code it, we analyze it, we find it.

531
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:48,300
And sometimes we find that our findings are garbage.

532
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:53,100
So then we have to start all over again with the construct.

533
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:59,579
With a construct, though. It's also super important to say where is this coming from?

534
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:04,830
Because there can be a lot of different definitions of a construct.

535
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:13,200
You could say This is Josh's definition of self-efficacy, or you can say This has been Dora's definition of self-efficacy.

536
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:18,740
So this is the reason action approach, which is the theory of planned behavior.

537
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:28,680
But like a cop, like 20 years later and this is what it's blown up to after consensus meetings, joint writings, a lot of testing, the constructs.

538
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:35,040
So we found out now that, yes, there are these three things that I talked about that inform intention,

539
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:40,500
but we've been able to break down this construct in just two sub constructs.

540
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:48,450
And now we found that these salient beliefs underneath the construct inform the actual construct.

541
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,480
And then you have environmental and other factors.

542
00:56:51,480 --> 00:57:00,690
And this is very complicated, but through the process of extensive testing like this is how they validated these constructs,

543
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:08,820
essentially, you're not going to have to go back. What is that spin of behavior or what field would you consider that to be like the previous slide?

544
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,920
Just only kind of for that to be filed under survey research on the server.

545
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:27,810
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, unless you're doing like a like a like just only surveys on things that are very are not constructs and are very tangible.

546
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:32,580
So you only ever ask people about their age and their, like, race and ethnicity,

547
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:39,120
and you only collect like, you know, lung capacity measurements and stuff like that.

548
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:43,590
But when you start to get into the like, more abstract.

549
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:51,390
Yeah. Yeah. So when you base your survey on these different constructs and stuff then, or is that thinking too much?

550
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:56,840
Oh, you could. You don't have to. But like, let's just say.

551
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:01,810
Like what? Like, what's something that you might be interested in for this class?

552
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:11,640
No so much. I guess the perceived environmental like in a community.

553
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:14,820
What's the environment like? The community with an oak?

554
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:19,090
Uh, that's broad.

555
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:24,700
Yeah. Okay. So maybe that your research question would be something like.

556
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:31,840
To what extent do people's perceived environment.

557
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:37,240
Or to what extent do people's lived environment affect their perceived stress?

558
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:41,559
Okay. So that's starting out with your research question.

559
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:50,430
So obviously, like perceived stress would be one of your construct, but in terms of lived environment, like it's up to you what you want to include.

560
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:55,780
So for you lived environment could be very much like what kind of dwelling do you live in?

561
00:58:55,780 --> 00:59:03,969
Do you live in apartment? Do you live in a townhouse? Like how many how many sides of your walls do you have a neighbor on on each side?

562
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:07,540
Like these are like contracts. These are very measurable things, right?

563
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:11,290
Like 11 apartment that has like three other units in it.

564
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:16,030
And I'm on the I'm, you know, sandwiched between like two floors and stuff like that.

565
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:30,910
Whereas like, you know, if you wanted to think about lived environment in a different way, that was more abstract, like quality of life, for example.

566
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:45,309
Like a. Ease of ease of access to transportation like these aren't necessarily as solidified because these are somewhat people's perceptions,

567
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:54,100
but also somewhat abstract. So it totally depends on, like, what you want to ask.

568
00:59:54,430 --> 01:00:05,450
Gotcha. Mm hmm. So. The reason such an approach in the last slide does provide a very explicit measurement procedure.

569
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:12,709
This doesn't happen a lot. And so like the example papers that I put in canvas for you,

570
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:20,140
I chose them because the authors were nice enough to tell you what the questions were and what the scales were.

571
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:25,010
But so many times you read people's research and they don't like share that with you.

572
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:28,159
And it's super frustrating, especially the older papers.

573
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:33,590
Now they're more pushing towards like data transparency where they ask people, you know,

574
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:39,409
as an online supplement or appendix that can you include your survey or whatever.

575
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:45,920
Because back in the day it was all very like proprietary and like academic shared my stuff with other people.

576
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:49,969
But now you're like, Yeah, I want people to use my stuff. I want people to cite me.

577
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:55,310
Like, I want people to be able to, like, reproduce this to make sure it's rigorous enough.

578
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:01,010
So for every construct you'll have two different components the conceptual component.

579
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:04,040
What is this in mean in terms of words?

580
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:09,590
Okay. And if you're using somebody's definition, you have to say where it's coming from.

581
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:16,870
So job satisfaction, the conceptual definition would be how satisfied someone has with their job.

582
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:24,560
Basic is that whereas the operational definition would be how to measure it with general procedures,

583
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:31,219
so rules on how to measure, how to phrase what is rated, what you might use.

584
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:37,430
Adjectives decide how you're going to score and calculate those kinds of things and make sure you're consistent.

585
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:43,009
If this is something you're creating on your own, sometimes, if you're using someone's validated questionnaire,

586
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:47,630
they'll also be very nice and include a code or do detailed directions on how to do these things.

587
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:59,210
So if I'm looking at something called the construct of intention, it is conceptually a person's readiness to perform a behavior.

588
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:07,670
But the operational definition is it's actually a belief rating on a five or seven point scale.

589
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:11,150
And here are two example items.

590
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:22,310
I will meditate at least once a week for the next three months in my meditating at least once a week for the next three months is okay.

591
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:30,080
So conceptual definition I specified goods coming from operational definition how I'm choosing to measure it.

592
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:36,620
And then here are some sample items. Do these questions seem super similar?

593
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:49,850
Yes. Ideally you would need another a third one that is also super similar statistically to validate the internal reliability of this construct.

594
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:53,650
Does it drive survey takers crazy?

595
01:02:53,660 --> 01:03:00,590
Yes. Was I told by my pilot testers, hey, do you know these two questions are asking something very similar and.

596
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:09,080
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. But again, this is if you're trying to validate a construct that is not already validated.

597
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:18,470
So here's an example where just say on the previous slide you saw intention where we had two questions.

598
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,000
If we had, we wanted to determine attitude and we had four questions.

599
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:29,930
We wanted to have a perceived norm and we had three questions. And then we had perceived behavioral control and we had three questions.

600
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:36,050
The Alpha sign stands for Promax Alpha or Internal Reliability Consistency,

601
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:41,870
and this is something that you generally always want to calculate when you're doing survey items.

602
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:45,229
You yourself don't have to worry about that doing that in this class.

603
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:52,550
I'm just telling you conceptually, you also can just like if you know our space status, they all do it for you.

604
01:03:53,570 --> 01:04:00,260
But with Cronenberg's Alpha, generally you're looking for anything like 0.7 and above.

605
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:10,480
So just say, for example. Like my contract was like workload.

606
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:20,580
So the three questions I choose for workload might be like, in a day, I cannot accomplish all the tasks I want to.

607
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:29,170
I feel like the work I have to do in an eight hour day is manageable and like, you know, something else, right?

608
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:35,620
And then I find the internal reliability, like between those three questions, like how much are they actually related to each other?

609
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:40,120
And I might get a value that's like 0.85. Yay, great.

610
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:46,600
We're above 0.7. So the my internal reliability for the workload construct is pretty high.

611
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:55,000
Whereas if for workload, I chose some questions like, you know, my coworkers support me,

612
01:04:56,140 --> 01:05:04,830
my workplace provides therapy and like, you know, I can eat lunch whenever I want.

613
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:11,739
And then I do the internal reliability consistency of those three questions together for workload.

614
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:19,569
And it's like point one, well, duh, because like what we call from from face can face validity,

615
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:24,130
meaning like just off the bat from like looking at them, they don't seem related in any way.

616
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:30,820
Right? But this is like a more quantitative way to actually determine that.

617
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:38,860
And then the. Pearson Ah, the correlation is looking at how strongly each construct actually relates to intention.

618
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:43,510
So between the three of these, based on meditating at least once a week for the next three months,

619
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:51,820
perceived behavioral control has the greatest effect on the intention to perform the behavior and then attitude has the least amount.

620
01:05:52,540 --> 01:06:00,249
And so you don't have to like do this, but conceptually understand it to be able to kind of like speak to what you're going to do with your survey

621
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:08,020
data more than I'm just going to count the percentages of people who will say strongly agree or disagree like,

622
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:10,989
you know, what is your predictor variable?

623
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:18,700
What are your like, you know, independent variables, like how are you going to try to look at the relationship between things?

624
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:30,970
So that was a regression. You can also do correlations where you look at not only how the constructs correlate to the dependent variable,

625
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:35,050
but the correlations with each other on a crosstabs.

626
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:40,660
Here's another one. So behavioral belief.

627
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:50,170
My meditating at least once a week for the next three months will reduce my stress so you can see how they are coded.

628
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:55,240
This is to five point versions where it's negative two to positive two.

629
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:02,830
So people did very likely to likely and then they did very good and very bad.

630
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:12,160
Okay, more examples. So attitude toward the act is defined conceptually as evaluation of a behavior is good or bad,

631
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:16,720
and then the operational definition is a semantic differential scale.

632
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:19,389
If we have something like safety climate,

633
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:26,170
the conceptual definition is shared perceptions of employees about the importance of safety within their organization.

634
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:31,060
At a point in time, the operational definition, it's a little more complicated.

635
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:41,170
There's no real scale for this. So you actually have to measure things like safety, commitment, medication, safety, training,

636
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:50,829
safety procedures and determine how they all relate in like either through structural equation modeling or like a confirmatory factor analysis.

637
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:55,510
So for people who say survey research is easy,

638
01:07:55,630 --> 01:08:01,850
it's not it's not is a lot of safety find people interested because interesting because I mean I

639
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:05,469
have worked in environment safety and a new safety climate is one of those things where it's like,

640
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:08,820
oh yeah, we want to have more of a nebulous concept. In that sense.

641
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:16,030
They're really backed up with a lot of research. Oh yeah. But like people throw that term or like they throw around the term,

642
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:21,159
like safety culture, but that means like something different to like everybody, right?

643
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:25,090
So when you check measurement, do a large pilot study, you don't have to do this.

644
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:30,460
But like if you just say, like if you want to check measurement, you start out the, the,

645
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:38,770
the Non-pharmacological Pain Management Approach survey that I started with, I finished with 29 questions.

646
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:45,819
I started with like 150 and they were like, there was no way.

647
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:49,719
So I was eager this logging target that was like, I know, but we can't.

648
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:52,720
We took a lot of validated scales and tried to smash them together.

649
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:57,520
This is just conceptually, okay.

650
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:06,040
So when you're doing reliability, what you're looking for is the chrome x alpha, whereas you're looking for validity, you're looking at these content.

651
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,460
Content validity and construct validity.

652
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:15,000
You don't have to do this, but this is an example to like check to make sure, like, okay, am I doing the right thing?

653
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:26,730
I did this. So attitude is playing the role as an independent variable.

654
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:32,070
This is a conceptual definition. This is the operational definition.

655
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:39,990
I was looking at you people choosing to use a respirator for the next for the next shift over the next two weeks.

656
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:41,730
And I had some like scales.

657
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:51,570
The level of measurement is ordinal, but the scale can be treated as interval if you convert it from like negative three to positive three.

658
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:55,680
And then what are your ways you're going to assess quality? But you don't have to do this.

659
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,170
This is a doctor. This is a doctoral level work.

660
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:05,680
So would that just be like for your own use pretty much after the fact, like understand the survey questions in software.

661
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:11,490
It's a little confusing what the reason to have this table, whether they're going to have it.

662
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:19,799
Yeah. Yeah. Because yeah, it's essentially for your own understanding to make sure that you're super clear and especially if you're like very

663
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:27,180
much in that like health behaviorist model or you're trying to apply some theoretical foundation to what you're doing,

664
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:31,079
you better know where that conceptual definition came from.

665
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:35,250
And sometimes people forgot, like, how was I going to measure this?

666
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:39,030
So it doesn't have to be like this crazy detailed, right?

667
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:48,629
Because I actually did this with my former dissertation advisor, Dr. Middle Statt, who worked with Asian, who created this theory.

668
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:52,080
So you can imagine she was like, Get it perfect.

669
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:57,570
Oh, yeah. And then, yeah, she's now retired, but still very involved.

670
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:07,469
But, you know, it doesn't have to be this rigid, but just know, like, make like just make a note to yourself somewhere.

671
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:15,090
Like, if you're choosing to look at like perceived stress, for example, like where who's definition are using, like make sure you can like.

672
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:31,170
Recall that later? Yeah. So validity, like I mentioned, the gold standard is if there are external data available to validate it.

673
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:35,230
But really, there's a couple of ways to check validity.

674
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:38,250
Most of the time you want to do like construct validity.

675
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:41,790
So the construct relates to other data predicted by the theory.

676
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:46,589
So engagement is positively related to persistence in college.

677
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:53,160
Like we know that through a couple of other studies on reliability.

678
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:56,909
Like I said, we can do inter correlation of items chromebox also,

679
01:11:56,910 --> 01:12:03,660
or you can do a repeated interview which is called test retest to see if you get a person to take the survey.

680
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:07,770
Are they going to answer the same way the next time or is it going to be like way off?

681
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:15,000
Okay. Reliability is necessary, but you don't need it to have validity.

682
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:19,770
Your questions can still be valid without being reliable.

683
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:24,330
They can still be good questions, but they don't measure.

684
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:34,530
Jack, you agree? So one is not necessarily without the other, but generally if you have reliability, you have validity.

685
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:47,009
Okay. So this one here is another example of looking at reliability statistics of a couple other a couple of statements, you know,

686
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:52,319
like looking at student faculty interactions, talked of career plans of the faculty member,

687
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,770
worked with them on activities discussed of course, or project, etc.

688
01:12:57,150 --> 01:13:06,180
And then the cool nice thing about all of our statistical packages is once you code your questions,

689
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:12,840
they tell you different permutations of which items are best to go together.

690
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,920
And you say like for this one, here you have one, two, three, four, five,

691
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:23,070
six question items just to measure one construct, which is student faculty interaction.

692
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:33,570
You don't need all of those. So if you wanted to drop one out, they tell you what the Chromebox Alpha is if that item is deleted.

693
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:39,330
So you can do this even in SPSS, which is basically just like fancy excel now.

694
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:45,670
Okay. That's all I had for today. That was a lot.

695
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:55,690
That was a lot of the logistical stuff. Just because I wanted to give you a crash course in, like, survey methodology for your big assignment,

696
01:13:55,690 --> 01:14:00,969
because I wanted you to feel like you were a little bit more confident going into it.

697
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:11,860
And then starting on on Thursday, we'll talk more about like actual theories and conceptual frameworks, but any questions from the group?

698
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:19,320
Okay. All right. Hopefully that was, like, the most dry part.

699
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,530
We got it over with, and I need to deal with it.
