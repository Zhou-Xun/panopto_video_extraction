1
00:00:05,764 --> 00:00:09,935
This video focuses on developing mission
statement, goals, and objectives for

2
00:00:09,935 --> 00:00:11,860
a public health program.

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,940
My name is Paul Flemming, and I'm an
Assistant Professor of Health Behavior and

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,630
Health Education at
the School of Public Health.

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,590
Setting goals and objectives is
a key element of program planning.

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,320
When we look at any of
the program planning models,

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,890
they always include a step related to
developing your goals and objectives.

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,483
Some of these models include
the generalized planning models,

9
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:34,287
the map models and many others.

10
00:00:34,287 --> 00:00:38,922
A mission statement, goals and objectives
should provide a foundation for program

11
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:43,697
planning, a direction for the program, and
a basis on which to evaluate the program.

12
00:00:43,697 --> 00:00:45,287
They move from broad to narrow.

13
00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:48,671
Starting with the mission statement,
and the goals, and finally,

14
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:50,370
with the objectives.

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,300
The mission statement describes
the general focus or purpose of a program.

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,490
It may also reflect the philosophy and
helps to guide where your goals and

17
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,750
objectives will ultimately be.

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,195
An example of a mission statement would
be the mission of the walk up health

19
00:01:05,195 --> 00:01:10,072
promotion program is to provide a wide
variety of primary prevention activities

20
00:01:10,072 --> 00:01:12,102
for residents of the community.

21
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:16,101
Or a different example is this
program aims to help patients and

22
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:19,497
their families understand and
cope with physical and

23
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:24,034
emotional changes associated with
recovery falling cancer surgery.

24
00:01:24,034 --> 00:01:28,366
Program goals are where you want to be,
and it is more specific than a mission

25
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:31,091
statement and
less specific that objectives.

26
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,683
And it's used to explain
the general intent of a program.

27
00:01:34,683 --> 00:01:39,680
One example would be, to decrease intimate
partner violence among youth in Indiana.

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,414
Or another example would be, to reduce
the incidents of H1N1 among students

29
00:01:44,414 --> 00:01:48,229
living in University of Michigan
residential housing units.

30
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:50,844
You'll note,
that these mission statements and

31
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:54,587
goals don't follow a specific formula and
don't give a lot of detail.

32
00:01:54,587 --> 00:01:57,976
That changes once we get
to the program objectives.

33
00:01:57,976 --> 00:02:01,082
Program objectives are written
in measurable terms.

34
00:02:01,082 --> 00:02:05,567
They represenrent smaller steps
that lead to reaching goals.

35
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:10,816
And they're more precise than goals,
they're often labelled as SMART.

36
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:16,540
SMART stands for specific, measurable,
achievable, realistic, and time bound.

37
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,171
You'll note as we give examples
of objectives that the objectives

38
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:23,990
follow each of these characteristics.

39
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,402
A basic formula for
writing program objectives is by when,

40
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:31,790
how much of who will do what.

41
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,130
This isn't necessarily the way you
always have to write objectives, but

42
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,610
each of these elements should be included,
including the when, how much,

43
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,450
who and what.

44
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,218
An example of a program objective
is by December of next year,

45
00:02:45,218 --> 00:02:50,218
80% of the students in grades 6 through
8 in the Riverside County Schools will

46
00:02:50,218 --> 00:02:55,002
self report 60 minutes of moderate to
vigorous physical activity each day on

47
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:57,405
an annual youth behavior risk survey.

48
00:02:57,405 --> 00:02:59,572
So let's break this down.

49
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:04,390
The when is by December of next year,
the how much is 80%,

50
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:10,449
the who is students in grades 6 through
8 in the Riverside County Schools.

51
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:14,388
And the what is self-report 60
minutes of moderate to vigorous

52
00:03:14,388 --> 00:03:18,555
physical activity each day on
an annual youth behavior risk survey.

53
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:24,693
So it's important to note that each of
these have a high degree of specificity.

54
00:03:24,693 --> 00:03:27,787
We're specifically
highlighting that's it 80%.

55
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:31,545
And we're specifically highlighting
that it's students in grades

56
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,143
6 through 8 in
the Riverside County Schools.

57
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:38,895
So whereas our mission or goal might
have said, students in middle school, or

58
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:40,413
just students or youth.

59
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:42,881
When we're writing objectives,

60
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:47,910
we write students in grade 6 through
8 in Riverside County Schools.

61
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,029
Because it's very specific
who we are talking about and

62
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:54,577
who the objective is targeted at.

63
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:59,002
Another example of our program objective
might be, by June 30th of 2023,

64
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:01,605
Allegheny County
commissioners will adopt and

65
00:04:01,605 --> 00:04:07,625
disseminate one policy to prohibit
smoking in all public places.

66
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,844
The when is June 30th, 2023.

67
00:04:09,844 --> 00:04:14,755
The how much, in this case,
is just one because it's a policy.

68
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:19,290
So how much is going from
zero policies to one policy.

69
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,910
The who is Allegheny County commissioners.

70
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,703
And the what is will adopt and

71
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:29,125
disseminate one policy that prohibits
smoking in all public places.

72
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:34,083
I wanna note for this objective that
the who is Allegheny County commissioners.

73
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:39,343
Even though that this program is
ultimately prioritizing county residents,

74
00:04:39,343 --> 00:04:43,016
because the policy will
affect all county residents.

75
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:48,737
The who when we write program objectives
is focused on who will do that action?

76
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:52,289
Now that we understand how
to write program objectives,

77
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:56,211
I wanna talk about the different
types of program objectives.

78
00:04:56,211 --> 00:05:01,011
When we talk about program planning,
there's three major types of program

79
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:05,511
objectives which include outcome
objectives, impact objectives and

80
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:06,946
process objectives.

81
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:10,757
In outcome objective is the ultimate
objective of a program.

82
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:14,196
And target changes in health status,
social benefits,

83
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:16,351
risk factors, or quality of life.

84
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:19,081
Often times for a public health program,

85
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:24,230
the outcome objective is about the health
status change that we're seeking.

86
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:29,274
So this may be changed in
incidence of diabetes or

87
00:05:29,274 --> 00:05:32,356
change in prevalence of HIV.

88
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:35,638
The second type of objective
is the impact objective.

89
00:05:35,638 --> 00:05:39,370
So these are these immediate
observable effects of a program.

90
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,200
They include changes in awareness,

91
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,730
knowledge, attitudes, skills, behaviors,
or changes in the environment.

92
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,720
The third type of program objective
is the process objective.

93
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,904
Basically, this one focuses on what you're
going to do and how you gonna do it?

94
00:05:55,904 --> 00:06:00,460
These process objectives are really about
this service or intervention delivery.

95
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,884
So let's talk about these
things all together.

96
00:06:03,884 --> 00:06:07,693
So when you're developing your goals and
objectives for a program,

97
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:09,411
you wanna start with the goal.

98
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,385
The goal, remember, is broad and

99
00:06:11,385 --> 00:06:14,391
focuses on what is the ultimate
goal of the program.

100
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:17,365
Then you'll move to
developing outcome objective.

101
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:21,530
The outcome objective is the change
in health status that you're seeking.

102
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,893
Once you've figured out what your goal and
out come objective are,

103
00:06:24,893 --> 00:06:27,607
then you'll move to developing
an impact objective.

104
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:31,177
An impact objective are the immediate
observable effects.

105
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:35,463
So this includes things like changes
in skills, behaviors, attitudes,

106
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:37,444
knowledge, or the environment.

107
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:41,784
Once you have that set, you'll move
towards developing the process objectives,

108
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:45,510
which are the actual intervention
things that you'll be doing.

109
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,595
And that tells you what you
program activities are.

110
00:06:47,595 --> 00:06:50,496
So let's walk through an example.

111
00:06:50,496 --> 00:06:53,961
So let's say you're working with
a team and you've decided that

112
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:58,441
you're goal is to reduce risky drinking
and substance use among college students.

113
00:06:58,441 --> 00:07:01,362
Remember, the goal is
the first thing you'll set.

114
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:06,355
Once you've decided on a goal, you'll move
towards developing an outcome objective or

115
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:09,150
possibly multiple outcome objectives.

116
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,689
In this case, the planning team has
decided that their outcome objective is by

117
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:15,497
December 31st, 2021.

118
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:18,785
It will reduce substance abuse
disorders among students in

119
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:22,344
Michigan Community College
from 20% in 2018 to 12%.

120
00:07:22,344 --> 00:07:26,818
So you'll note this outcome objective is
focused on a change in health status,

121
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:30,520
because it's reducing
substance abuse disorders.

122
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,482
Once you have an outcome objective set,

123
00:07:32,482 --> 00:07:35,608
then you'll move towards
developing your impact objectives.

124
00:07:35,608 --> 00:07:40,216
Remember that impact objectives focus
on changes in knowledge, attitudes,

125
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:43,570
skills, behaviors or the environment.

126
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,750
In this case, the impact object
is that by December 31st, 2021,

127
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,070
they'll increase the number of students
in Michigan Community College,

128
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,544
screened for substance abuse disorder,
from 250 in 2018 to 500.

129
00:07:56,544 --> 00:08:01,182
So this impact objective focuses
on a behavior change and

130
00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:06,119
that it is focused on increasing
students who are screened.

131
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,786
Once this impact objective
has been developed,

132
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:13,613
you'll move towards developing a process
objective or multiple process objectives.

133
00:08:13,613 --> 00:08:14,489
In this case,

134
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:19,249
the team has decided that the process
objective would focus on health fairs.

135
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:23,524
By December 31st 2021,
hold ten health fairs for students at

136
00:08:23,524 --> 00:08:28,849
Michigan Community College with substance
abuse disorder screenings available.

137
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:33,070
In the process objective, remember,
tells us what our program activities are.

138
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,410
So ultimately, the program activity
is health fairs on campus.

139
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:42,140
So we know that our program that we're
developing will include health fairs.

140
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,592
So for developing the goals and
objectives, remember, we start from left

141
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:51,413
to right, but when we think about how they
work together will move right to left.

142
00:08:51,413 --> 00:08:53,451
We know that the process objectives and

143
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:57,477
activities are focused on what does
the implementation actually look like?

144
00:08:57,477 --> 00:09:04,380
So the process objectives should be
helping us achieve our impact objectives.

145
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,000
So in this case, by doing health fairs,

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,920
holding ten health fairs, we should be
able to achieve our impact objective.

147
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,891
In this case, of increasing the number
of students who are screened.

148
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,990
Similarly, if we achieve our impact
objective of increasing the number of

149
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,840
students who are screened.

150
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:31,470
We should achieve our outcome objective,
of reducing substance abuse disorders.

151
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:36,010
In this case, the program planners assume
that if more students are screened,

152
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:40,580
then ultimately they can get treatment and
reduce their substance abuse disorder.

153
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,730
So we can see that the process objectives
flow to the impact objectives.

154
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,660
So if we do what we say we're
gonna do in the process objective,

155
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,050
that should lead to changes
in the impact objective,

156
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,800
which will ultimately lead to
changes in the outcome objective.

157
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,635
And of course,

158
00:09:56,635 --> 00:10:00,889
if we achieve our outcome objectives
of reducing substance abuse disorders.

159
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:04,461
Then we would have achieved our
goal of reducing risky drinking and

160
00:10:04,461 --> 00:10:06,642
substance use among college students.

161
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:10,034
I want to note that this
is a simplified version of

162
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:14,277
what the connection between goals and
objectives might be.

163
00:10:14,277 --> 00:10:19,146
Because we only have one goal, one out
come objective, one impact objective,

164
00:10:19,146 --> 00:10:20,899
and one process objective.

165
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:25,612
As I note here, you may end up
having two process objectives that

166
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:28,068
stand from an impact objective.

167
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:32,289
That means that you might have
two different activities that

168
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:36,601
you're ultimately doing to
achieve that impact objective.

169
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:38,520
It may get even more complex.

170
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,800
So you may have an ultimate goal and

171
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,160
you have two outcome objectives
connected to achieving that goal.

172
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,110
For one of the outcome objectives,
you only have one impact objective.

173
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,342
So what that means, is that you only think
that there's one type of change needed,

174
00:10:55,342 --> 00:11:00,070
change related to behaviors, skills,
attitudes, or the environment.

175
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,523
But to achieve this second outcome
objective, you envision that you may

176
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:08,690
need to change both attitudes,
behaviors, and the environment.

177
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,889
And so you may end up having three
different impact objectives.

178
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:16,675
And again,
if you achieve those impact objectives,

179
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:20,384
it should help you achieve
that outcome objective.

180
00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:22,525
Similarly, to add complexity,

181
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:26,506
each impact objective may have
multiple process objective.

182
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:32,930
To achieve this impact objective you
may only have one process objective.

183
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,310
To achieve the second impact objective
you may decide that there are two

184
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,159
different types of
activities you need to do.

185
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,468
To achieve this one,
there may just be one.

186
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:47,298
But to achieve this fourth one, there may
three different process objectives and

187
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:50,457
three corresponding activities
that you need to do.

188
00:11:50,457 --> 00:11:54,187
So as you can see,
this process can become complex.

189
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:59,057
But if you always follow the rule,
that you start by developing your goals,

190
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:02,558
then you move to developing
your outcome objectives,

191
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:06,687
then move to impact impact objectives and
process objectives.

192
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:11,121
And then you can look over and
see whether your process objectives will

193
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:13,902
help you achieve your
impact objectives and

194
00:12:13,902 --> 00:12:19,060
help you achieve your outcome
objectives and ultimately your goal.

195
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,146
So this process can be iterative,
you may make changes along the way.

196
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:26,966
But it's a diagram to show how you
can make sure that your program

197
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:31,217
ultimately is achieving
the goals that you set out.
