1
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,960
hey everyone welcome back.

2
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,120
so let's talk over a few housekeeping items. well

3
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,380
this is the housekeeping items. I greatly enjoyed reading the discussion for the thirty

4
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:41,080
five users. Lisa responded twenty minutes ago.

5
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,180
the class is gonna be done first and have a great experience but

6
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,700
you're more diapers and every church experience than I even expected. so I'm

7
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,800
very much looking forward to interacting with everyone in the class. I haven't said that I wanna

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,433
alert those of you that may not have done the discussion thread yet.

9
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:07,533
I think you remember this is basically just information about your background here

10
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:12,753
today. he's in the changes in the course.

11
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:19,493
week from today. we're gonna get out time about the

12
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:24,913
group case study. create a PowerPoint for. and

13
00:01:24,913 --> 00:01:29,993
remember that are you. you can be given. hey I got a from the

14
00:01:29,993 --> 00:01:35,313
relocation Starkey Road meeting. we sent the major disease out

15
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:40,353
here review either in occupational environmental exposure and time. we're

16
00:01:40,353 --> 00:01:45,713
gonna argue that they were not the occupational and environmental exposure.

17
00:01:45,713 --> 00:01:50,853
and I want the team. the as valid as possible. so it really

18
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:56,321
helped me. I know everyone's background because then I can try to make sure that happens. so

19
00:01:56,321 --> 00:02:01,481
please. you required to do it anyway. you know six percent of your great respond immediately. discuss

20
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:08,561
them. please make sure you respond to this discussion. just help with that.

21
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:13,821
Mira. I'll save you all the hassles are happening which is

22
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:19,541
partly mind transferring from Seattle to Kansas and not yet have my GSI in placement.

23
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:24,701
I apologize for not having had the readings up till

24
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:29,741
probably thirty minutes ago or so. however as you find

25
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:35,301
out. we're we're actually gonna go through for all three the readings were gonna go through.

26
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:40,421
what is the key information and the reading that I really wanted everyone to get out out_of it

27
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:45,621
today. so you'll hear about it anyway. bye.

28
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:50,681
plan for the future. first of all to make sure before

29
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:56,141
noon tomorrow. anything and everything. you could meet for the Thursday session.

30
00:02:56,141 --> 00:03:01,161
you will have and going forward my plan is to make sure that you all

31
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:06,181
have everything you need at least at a minimum one week ahead of time. so

32
00:03:06,181 --> 00:03:11,281
I'll reform. I promise I will. that's with the help of you. bye.

33
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:16,681
okay.

34
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:22,101
right. and then I don't have a time and I'll make in case I forget to make it later

35
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:27,341
is on Thursday. we're you gonna get to see

36
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:33,081
what the assignment for your first two homework. it's not actually due for part of

37
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:38,461
second. but what homework focused on is taking. hey

38
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:44,341
after the new logic study report the literature and sign

39
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:49,441
criteria. tried to hide. well many things but a

40
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:54,541
big party. just trying to decide whether you think this is national cos the relationship

41
00:03:54,541 --> 00:04:01,055
between the exposures and report to help out in this particular study so

42
00:04:01,055 --> 00:04:06,655
we talk about her patients today. that's gonna be right on the mark for what the assignment

43
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:14,695
is about. alright. I'm gonna go through. I'm not sure.

44
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:20,715
have vacation mission and get all the way through the introduction to respiratory diseases

45
00:04:20,715 --> 00:04:26,395
today. but I'm going to go quickly. please stop five

46
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:32,335
and more probably a few others and see if we can get there. if

47
00:04:32,335 --> 00:04:37,495
if I'm going too fast or you having a problem with that. you could raise your hand

48
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:42,635
and point that out to me. but I'm trying to do that. anyway I'll keep it lively and

49
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:48,115
interesting but not be too fast. alright. so

50
00:04:48,115 --> 00:04:53,475
then this person Alice Hamilton. she's considered

51
00:04:53,475 --> 00:04:59,083
the mother if you will occupational health and occupational medicine

52
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:04,083
here in the United State. she played a critical role in getting recognition

53
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:09,883
of all these types of illnesses and injuries that work is potentially facing this country.

54
00:05:09,883 --> 00:05:15,103
she's an important person to know about. and this book she wrote. explain

55
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:20,143
the dangerous train. it's very very fascinating interesting book to

56
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:25,203
understand what she did and what you came up against. this is a photograph of her by the

57
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:31,683
way she was the first female professor at Harvard University.

58
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:37,103
in any any subject matter and

59
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:42,103
this is something she wrote about women and lead industry is about severe over exposure

60
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:47,723
is to lead among women. and this is Terry talking about the fact that

61
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:52,783
at the time. there are virtually no studies looking occupational illnesses and exposures in the

62
00:05:52,783 --> 00:05:57,843
literature. testing that you asked and that she saw all medications and

63
00:05:57,843 --> 00:06:02,965
situations where employers were turning a blind eye to the rest of their

64
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:08,685
workers are facing. she's a hero of mind and many other people.

65
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:14,485
I got a thing on mind. so that's just a little bit about Alice Hamilton.

66
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:19,685
another thing I wanna mention is that a_lot_of things to go through in here care

67
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:24,805
at this point I guess you can call him for additional. you know they're well established illnesses that are well understood and so

68
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:30,265
on. but we do have new problems popping up all the time in both occupational and environmental

69
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:35,805
medicine and that first example up there. so talk to you later. later man.

70
00:06:35,805 --> 00:06:41,347
is eight dear hey Ashley Savo. and I usually reversible

71
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:47,007
type of long disease that can occur and connect her to sleep quickly

72
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:53,027
and what happened was there was a plan in there.

73
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:58,047
where do edition notice it seems like the number

74
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:03,307
of people on this planet. we're having at a very young age were developing surprising

75
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:08,427
respiratory problems across the line to submit around the diagnosis you can make well best

76
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:13,427
they actually taking a sample of the lawn but it's not something you

77
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:18,507
expect to see many young people and there were several people in the same plan and

78
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:23,527
they were making packaging popcorn. you know designed

79
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:28,567
to go on microwave. you know that nice batteries now that you have with the

80
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:33,787
popcorn. that's about right now has nothing to do with butter. hasn't do with the

81
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:38,856
agent that I asked you and so of course

82
00:07:38,856 --> 00:07:43,856
we're nobody. I think I understood this is potentially a risk factor ahead of time but

83
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:48,996
the workers has substantial exposure. partly because no_one was concerned about it at

84
00:07:48,996 --> 00:07:54,216
work and actually the National Institute for our patients safety

85
00:07:54,216 --> 00:08:00,156
and health and I asked here in United_States which is responsible for

86
00:08:00,156 --> 00:08:05,636
what I called the health packet evaluation is where they're at. either manager

87
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:10,736
or owner or a worker to look into a situation with health problems. they will send

88
00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:15,956
out a team of at the genealogy. another experts to look at it. so they played a role

89
00:08:15,956 --> 00:08:22,516
in making the connection between exposure to the Di asset TL and the

90
00:08:22,516 --> 00:08:27,536
development of this lung disease in workers and that you know this happened.

91
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:32,696
but from my point of view recent history. just in two thousand. new lung disease from occupational

92
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:37,774
exposure is going to never heard of before Andy I know someone's gonna ask be there. sorry I

93
00:08:37,774 --> 00:08:42,894
just want a paper for somebody who apparently for years. was making

94
00:08:42,894 --> 00:08:47,974
about small very small kitchen. we're thinking about seven popcorn

95
00:08:47,974 --> 00:08:53,094
today. apparently that was about all he was eating. where there's a suspicion that there maybe

96
00:08:53,094 --> 00:08:59,254
one consumer that actually about lung disease exposure. another exposures are much lower.

97
00:08:59,254 --> 00:09:04,414
I'm not sure direct with you completely out. every single brand of popcorn but I believe

98
00:09:04,414 --> 00:09:11,474
it is at this point but it took them a_while to do that. alright. other examples.

99
00:09:11,474 --> 00:09:17,094
we'll talk more about it and you can just talk to you later we'll talk about persisting organic compounds but

100
00:09:17,094 --> 00:09:23,454
do think they can. it's about sexual hormones among others and cause all kinds of the facts.

101
00:09:23,454 --> 00:09:30,254
couple other examples here I won't go into but just there are new problems coming up all the time.

102
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:35,378
the magnitude of the problem in terms of outpatient exposure. it's very significant for

103
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:40,438
example in two thousand twelve. over four thousand workers died

104
00:09:40,438 --> 00:09:45,838
from to you. work related injury at work.

105
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:51,298
two thousand seven it was estimated. in comparison that more than well over fifty thousand

106
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:56,318
workers direct from work related. all of this. so I don't know the majority

107
00:09:56,318 --> 00:10:02,738
laws are probably work related cancers. so I love they've been work related.

108
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:07,818
long busy. not elected lung disease as well that would be thirty two with the main causes

109
00:10:07,818 --> 00:10:12,858
of death in US workers. and of course does financing that depend on at the DV logic studies and

110
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:18,418
understanding exposures and in response to a exposures and there's

111
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:23,438
an enormous number of entries every year. Andy on this is

112
00:10:23,438 --> 00:10:28,778
more than three million in United_States. among the private sector

113
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:34,038
and another almost eight hundred thousand in governmental workers and two hundred fifty billion

114
00:10:34,038 --> 00:10:39,630
dollars is an estimate the tile. so you can see there even in a

115
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:45,070
high country country like the United_States. there are still extension

116
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:51,930
problems and we'll talk later in the course. maybe making comparisons as well and middle in contact

117
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,790
and his problems right here in Michigan as well. so

118
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,890
please now. bye. and I

119
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:08,110
have a problem I'm gonna have throughout the court which is I think the majority

120
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:14,130
of you probably ready to the exposure assessment course right. six oh one.

121
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:19,270
hands. and then there's a small handful of you that have not taken

122
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:24,370
that court connect event as well. okay. I think I'm gonna sort

123
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,530
of blast through these by way too fast for the four of you. but I don't wanna border

124
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:35,034
out to pieces. if this is be like a reminder of what we're some of the major take on messages

125
00:11:35,034 --> 00:11:40,194
you can look at this in more detail. if you want. you can even you know ask if you want company

126
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:46,494
me about it later but you get of the just of it. okay. so

127
00:11:46,494 --> 00:11:51,734
as I think I mentioned in the first lecture. when when study

128
00:11:51,734 --> 00:11:56,914
fall down. he's looking at occupational or environmental exposures and help out.

129
00:11:56,914 --> 00:12:03,494
usually the biggest problem is poor exposure assessment. so it's an important topic.

130
00:12:03,494 --> 00:12:08,774
there's there's three major routes that they can enter the body I think we talked about that

131
00:12:08,774 --> 00:12:13,894
part. things like concentration is important and you're very interested in looking at the exposure

132
00:12:13,894 --> 00:12:19,594
of Jose's response relationship. what what's the threshold of the reason for developing to

133
00:12:19,594 --> 00:12:24,914
see if you stop and think about it. characteristic of exposure like how are you exposed

134
00:12:24,914 --> 00:12:31,274
on Tessa's exposure and how frequent course seven huge impact on your estimation of exposure.

135
00:12:31,274 --> 00:12:36,464
this is an example where

136
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:41,864
this is this Ukrainian opposition candidate. a politician

137
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:46,924
who I think was not like by the pro Russian

138
00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:52,244
Ukrainian. was poison with two three seven

139
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:57,444
eight. T C D D dot dot. and this is his

140
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:02,724
before and after photos. because one of the things because was on the call for. this is.

141
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:09,944
I guess positive exposure is can cause major problems. especially if they're purpose for

142
00:13:09,944 --> 00:13:15,324
there's also issues with what's referred to different names about multiple chemical

143
00:13:15,324 --> 00:13:20,670
sensitivity to this passing the high percent of the population report fifteen

144
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:28,510
fifty be. I'm usually sensitive and you know something from a host a very low level exposures.

145
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:34,030
thanks. rod of exposure affects the target organ and so on.

146
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:39,170
yeah. did you actually in court did you spend much time talking about licensing as

147
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:45,110
an issue with the latency exposure related to the disease. when when you can. see you on

148
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:51,970
Wednesday. we're located take like two minutes to talk about. alright.

149
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:57,290
so that you see the definition is called in. it's that time little absence

150
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:02,350
from when the exposure began. we have that exposure that's actually part of the disease

151
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:08,290
.com. to when the house second first be identified to be diagnosed.

152
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:13,670
such an important concept which you need to keep in mind because this

153
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:18,741
just real quick. if you know that the latency

154
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:24,041
is in almost everyone is at least thirty years. safer developing a solid

155
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:29,561
tumor cancer from exposure. that helped me right away. it is not gonna do you have a good

156
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:34,761
to look at people within the employment industry with an exposure you're suspicious about for the last twenty five

157
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:39,901
years. because as I know find out what you want negative status. you won't find anything.

158
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:45,361
if the fax doesn't show up for thirty years. I gave example

159
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:50,781
last week about Missus Julie on had cancer and it's best exposure that's typical.

160
00:14:50,781 --> 00:14:56,141
okay. it depends on about the agent in the help the fact

161
00:14:56,141 --> 00:15:01,881
late you can very depending on what help affect your talking about

162
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:07,881
allergic diseases we'll talk more about but there a bit of a special case because you have_to be

163
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:13,121
from us back in event you have_to been exposed. richly and then the later exposure actually causes

164
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:18,203
a problem and it also depends on

165
00:15:18,203 --> 00:15:23,423
how to save this for the lecture on the calling out this but to give you a graphic and

166
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:28,803
a residence example from nice day. so fill because it is a

167
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:34,823
disease from in relation of Christmas. so usually record

168
00:15:34,823 --> 00:15:40,743
which damages. part my brother I want some people. that is the guy from

169
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:46,103
Rent a tire inspection. basically they just can't believe any more. and typically

170
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:51,123
what we see and think about is we expect latency from one exposure

171
00:15:51,123 --> 00:15:56,443
started when the person has a problem. minimum of ten years more likely twenty

172
00:15:56,443 --> 00:16:02,183
twenty five years before you really identify real problem. so this is

173
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:07,263
Dolly Bridge Hamilton that where they where there's a grade in the

174
00:16:07,263 --> 00:16:12,403
nineteen thirties. they were put in a new railway line at

175
00:16:12,403 --> 00:16:18,243
thinking West_Virginia. I remember correctly I might have the date wrong somewhere near West_Virginia

176
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:23,443
and they were basically going through the mountains that was mostly made of.

177
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:28,543
but they made a person seventh and they were using explosive and they were hiring sort

178
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:34,103
of like ten people. this is John the great depression. lots of people unemployed.

179
00:16:34,103 --> 00:16:40,043
if you could sort of and then in the mail there to do the marketing operations

180
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:45,603
for making panel and they were sending people in. basically right after they

181
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:51,243
use exposed. so extremely high levels. so that

182
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:56,623
people would die. so you four times

183
00:16:56,623 --> 00:17:02,403
two or three months after they hire you with.

184
00:17:02,403 --> 00:17:08,441
hello. this is Johnson Long. he has a exposures or so hot

185
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:13,741
hey Adam it's that actually that incident. I got reviewed in congress eventually

186
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:20,361
that probably late December the first. occupational Health law in this country.

187
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:25,461
so it doesn't matter. there's

188
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:31,761
home. I'm not gonna go if you have a great week. how we go about doing all the measurements of exposure

189
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:36,781
and I assume you. you must talk about mathematical now of exposure.

190
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:41,901
somewhat is well. correct. I don't know if you getting questions about it it was that touched

191
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:47,301
on even not so much yet. get different opinion. alright.

192
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:52,601
well we wanna close any examples that

193
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:57,641
and you know recognition of exposure different ways biological markers are

194
00:17:57,641 --> 00:18:03,241
actually can be marked as adults of course on the text you got inside the body

195
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:08,361
course there's personal factors which affect ability which help determine whether or been exposed to the same

196
00:18:08,361 --> 00:18:13,507
exposure to person eight. just compared to personally may cause disease

197
00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:18,967
and one person not the other and family has_to do with these kinds of personal factors.

198
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:24,087
you. so now we're done with exposure with back on occupational

199
00:18:24,087 --> 00:18:30,547
diseases. so do be aware of the existence of the

200
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:35,547
distinction between because addition which we'll talk about a_lot in the next the

201
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:40,947
next presentation. which means that the exposure environment

202
00:18:40,947 --> 00:18:46,147
occupational actually hot disease. without that exposure to the disease with never

203
00:18:46,147 --> 00:18:51,607
occurred in this individual. it would've occurred it's a much later time. okay. but

204
00:18:51,607 --> 00:18:56,627
aggravation can be a huge issue with these exposure as well. typical

205
00:18:56,627 --> 00:19:02,027
type of activation. probably the most probably typical that you would run in to US

206
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:07,587
work place. if somebody has pre- existing. maybe they had a child

207
00:19:07,587 --> 00:19:13,773
and is not for you or maybe it's still active and they are exposed to something at work

208
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:20,473
greatly aggravated. makes it much more severe. so even though

209
00:19:20,473 --> 00:19:25,553
they have asked us not to do new diagnosis. they now have an activation from occupational

210
00:19:25,553 --> 00:19:30,593
exposures. I'm also not gonna spend much time on

211
00:19:30,593 --> 00:19:37,033
surveillance. other than the point out. it is important but important survey on

212
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:42,973
smart smart hierarchy. have you present patient.

213
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:48,273
it's all did in the room they're doing occupational hygiene and industrial hygiene. you're at the top of my list

214
00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:53,493
you're the preferred message. the idea is to remove the lower

215
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:58,747
the exposure to prevent control at before anybody ever yesterday.

216
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:03,867
bye. later measures like during doing surveillance the people

217
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:08,987
that you think has an exposure that Jessica caught. so you should be looking for it. it's

218
00:20:08,987 --> 00:20:14,087
sort of a secondary or maybe you might talked to Sherry approach to the prevention of disease as

219
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:19,167
well. not the preferred method if you can completely prevent it but in practice intense

220
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:25,087
be quite important. in many situations.

221
00:20:25,087 --> 00:20:30,167
so basically it's what you would expect that you gather all kinds of data it now

222
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:35,227
I should data. you the report the findings and

223
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:40,847
you have_to decide whether an intervention is needed to kinda what situation you're in. and

224
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:45,987
then when you if you design intervention is needed. you need to ask and hopefully

225
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:51,107
prove that you and your intervention improve the situation over time. so for example here

226
00:20:51,107 --> 00:20:56,888
in Michigan. let's calling center for Grant

227
00:20:56,888 --> 00:21:02,348
for application of that is that belongs to at the actual state

228
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:08,408
government. they has responsible and Michigan safety and health administration here in Michigan.

229
00:21:08,408 --> 00:21:13,408
but there's also a ten Rosa Mendez. occupational position is actually

230
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:19,188
at Michigan State University. had heads and services

231
00:21:19,188 --> 00:21:25,608
for certain things but everything but like for example they're interested with people getting occupational asthma from

232
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:30,768
Temple Sinai. which or used in the automobile industry extensively.

233
00:21:30,768 --> 00:21:36,328
I wanna get into it right now but and so the physician

234
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:42,688
Lucy. any suggestions but especially positions are changing occupational medicine.

235
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:48,088
actually required by law no other prosecutor figure out do it. to report

236
00:21:48,088 --> 00:21:53,100
any position of an occupational disease through this mechanism

237
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,920
and they have the power to follow back and say we wanna interview everyone of the planter facility.

238
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:05,500
the science surveillance and something that that's active here in Michigan.

239
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:10,580
there's different types of surveillance you might to you. I'm not gonna go and all

240
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,900
those well. I think I wanna go on all Public Health surveillance population

241
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,080
date. so

242
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,120
there is something in Spanish and I asked the nineteen eighties called which is

243
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,520
looking at a doll. love glad that survey. this is mostly looking for occupational exposures

244
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,780
and surveillance and Michigan. I believe one of the state

245
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:42,060
has is currently. and this is where

246
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:47,060
you want. one recording mechanism for all the. so you can look for

247
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:52,640
pattern that might explain what's going on and follow back to where they might be exposures

248
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,198
in work environment

249
00:22:58,198 --> 00:23:03,278
I must get through this one. not it's not important. this is just

250
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:08,538
showing you as an example of where the number of infections

251
00:23:08,538 --> 00:23:14,558
from hepatitis_C declined very dramatically and health care workers.

252
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:19,718
that's due. partly because they were improved control. so say with

253
00:23:19,718 --> 00:23:24,918
everyone being worried about HIV eight. you know a_lot more health care workers actually.

254
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:30,098
we're dying from hepatitis_B even for May and the fact that there's a vaccine

255
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:36,598
for the reason that was in which most house workers are receiving.

256
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:41,718
so this is showing you because it started a dramatic success story. in

257
00:23:41,718 --> 00:23:48,798
terms of these issues.

258
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm just gonna keep going here and

259
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,340
I already mentioned that. ashes in nationals are due for activation of the house

260
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:04,480
and among other things they do they do this next your balance. every so often. not

261
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:12,040
very often and they do walk through and then do those health hazard evaluations I mentioned before.

262
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:17,120
we're gonna come back to Aberdeen allergy and occupational medicine and I for some diseases. you

263
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,680
know hear about it in great depth. so I'm not gonna actually do it here.

264
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:28,440
okay. so take away from this very quick. review

265
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,560
the importance of primary prevention over other control. like even surveillance. you know you

266
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,600
doing from a prevention you would need to surveillance

267
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,700
and that here. even know we have a_lot_of problems. we've not about

268
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:49,000
the centuries like lead poisoning. there are new problems and one

269
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,370
need to be alert to to consider the possibility of something might be due to work for environmental

270
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:59,390
exposure especially in the pattern it's never been seen before.

271
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:05,630
I work. we'll talk more about the low level environment exposure

272
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:11,470
and we do find latency and talked a bit about how very

273
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:18,470
important to surveillance and those with the readings. okay. so

274
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:23,530
any questions or comments on that. I know that was fast. that was on purpose so

275
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:37,470
we can get to the next one. okay.

276
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:43,470
so this is another situation where. I have_to say.

277
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:48,510
so most of you either have taken or are taking everything out based

278
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:53,666
on the hands I saw last week. but I know that you that have not taken

279
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:58,806
at the genealogy course. whenever you can up. talk to me. I John. I

280
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:04,826
don't think not having cake at the genealogy question. it's Wade you from being part of this class.

281
00:26:04,826 --> 00:26:10,566
bye. got me. you have_to work a little bit harder on things and some of your fellow

282
00:26:10,566 --> 00:26:15,806
be because we're in a_lot_of cases

283
00:26:15,806 --> 00:26:21,106
like the first homework we're looking at sort of the relationship between occupational

284
00:26:21,106 --> 00:26:27,286
diseases and their diagnosis or treatment there prevention and how we

285
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:32,798
know what's going on. also environmental this is how we know what's going on shuman population.

286
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:37,958
based on everything your logic study. we are gonna spend an extra hydration.

287
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:43,058
certainly an example of that. for those of you that did take that

288
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:48,398
idea. I have taken everything out court. some of maybe

289
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:53,498
like I've seen this before but most of that is going to be

290
00:26:53,498 --> 00:27:03,718
pretty specific. just occupational environmental exposures and will be different.

291
00:27:03,718 --> 00:27:09,498
okay. so we're gonna be very brief history.

292
00:27:09,498 --> 00:27:14,678
we gonna talk about association versus pod. and we're gonna talk about something

293
00:27:14,678 --> 00:27:19,958
that I think probably have not covering everything else important that you correct.

294
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:25,278
we're gonna talk about general hydration meeting in that population

295
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:30,997
of individuals. is it agent possibly disease versus

296
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:36,617
hey big part of nation which is asking a question. for one particular individual

297
00:27:36,617 --> 00:27:41,797
I'm talking about. is it true that this person say workplace exposure is responsible for his

298
00:27:41,797 --> 00:27:47,017
or her disease. so that's all. General versus Pacific. and

299
00:27:47,017 --> 00:27:52,077
my contract and everything Jesus. did you spend probably not because it's not. it's about

300
00:27:52,077 --> 00:27:58,077
five after genealogy with not doing it. did you spend time talking about ideas how to make a specific

301
00:27:58,077 --> 00:28:04,277
activation from one individual that come up. okay.

302
00:28:04,277 --> 00:28:09,557
and then some she may have cover I wanna talk a little bit about the current basis

303
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:14,597
or how people. you have a genealogy tend to think about conversation at

304
00:28:14,597 --> 00:28:21,117
the end. okay. so

305
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:26,657
@ here at physicians actually at other time.

306
00:28:26,657 --> 00:28:31,869
occupational environmental health related professionals work. you're

307
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:37,049
frequently you gotta get out_of questions about. you said something to Scott. that

308
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:42,109
particular truth for occupational position. one reason is the chicken the truth as we talked

309
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:47,329
about two days ago. it's actually

310
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:53,609
when you're talking about occupational or environmental exposure is causing disease and human population.

311
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:58,689
you cannot do a re analyze clinical trial. it's not

312
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:03,769
gonna be seen as being an ethical thing to do. almost all cases.

313
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:08,969
so that means we're depending on maybe you know

314
00:29:08,969 --> 00:29:14,549
in the Charleston animal studies background but at the end of the day is it causing a problem humans.

315
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:19,629
we are depending on Virginia logic studies to to decide whether we think something is

316
00:29:19,629 --> 00:29:25,249
consul and a card. it's very very important. whether

317
00:29:25,249 --> 00:29:30,549
in association you see if possible right. because it is possible that applies you

318
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:35,779
have problem with something can be done about. if it's just an association. it's like

319
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:41,759
what happened to that population but the next population you look at probably won't be the same association.

320
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:47,999
so it's very important to decide what he think something is possible.

321
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:53,419
which I guess is pretty much with the top of this but I just said. so let's

322
00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:58,479
let's talk about our level of knowledge about some different agent. so just wanted to call up there

323
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:03,799
to figure out. okay. I do think it's controversial

324
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:09,039
whether or not cigarette smoking. so they would possibly associated with increased risk

325
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,759
of cancer. now I was been pretty well laid to rest.

326
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:20,319
same thing for chronic constructive pulmonary. I guess his e-mail chronic bronchitis

327
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:25,599
and cigarette smoking right. that's pretty clear. you know there's

328
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:30,739
a_lot_of controversy at this point about whether exposure to loud

329
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:36,117
noises over time. is a Thursday with hearing loss decrease

330
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:41,397
here. no it's not. I do the same. and I guess

331
00:30:41,397 --> 00:30:46,917
I guess you're probably young enough to be part of this experiment. I think we're doing it. unfortunate

332
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:51,997
grand experiment without that. bye. everyone in the world walking around with

333
00:30:51,997 --> 00:30:57,137
things around her ears and many things claimed to have

334
00:30:57,137 --> 00:31:02,217
control on the. the number that the balls are probably down. I was looking at some data about this

335
00:31:02,217 --> 00:31:07,317
recently. and I'm a little worried that comes twenty or twenty five years we have all the

336
00:31:07,317 --> 00:31:12,377
people in their thirties forties fifties. they have significant noise induced hearing

337
00:31:12,377 --> 00:31:18,657
loss from not occupational exposure.

338
00:31:18,657 --> 00:31:24,077
okay. Murphy and dance on the album how many people either had or know someone

339
00:31:24,077 --> 00:31:29,217
who had all their merger and containing general items removed and had something

340
00:31:29,217 --> 00:31:36,065
outside of their teeth because they were worried about the adverse health effects

341
00:31:36,065 --> 00:31:41,845
one. just wanted you. okay. this is something

342
00:31:41,845 --> 00:31:46,845
that that the DRC is far from clear about the signs

343
00:31:46,845 --> 00:31:52,145
is still out on this one. does that really make a difference in any of that. this position that Marjorie

344
00:31:52,145 --> 00:31:57,665
ever being released from the mountains and that someone

345
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:04,045
how about mold exposure. there's a bathroom in bad shape.

346
00:32:04,045 --> 00:32:09,065
they need to see that you are Ashley coffee that is. because I spoke to her

347
00:32:09,065 --> 00:32:18,425
till five o'clock tomorrow. any changes on that.

348
00:32:18,425 --> 00:32:24,725
there's very special circumstances or there's probably possible data that usually possibly

349
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:30,133
wet as well as the address. but I would say at the following for activation

350
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:35,133
insert condition. there's pretty good today. specifically the people that have pre- existing

351
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:40,533
ass by and expose all concept of time to chat.

352
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:45,593
pretty certainly might be able to activate. Barbara. one of the

353
00:32:45,593 --> 00:32:50,773
case studies that you gonna be one of two of the groups gonna be doing later. I had

354
00:32:50,773 --> 00:32:55,773
to do with this issue and it's a good case study because the literature is not one

355
00:32:55,773 --> 00:33:01,473
hundred percent clear about what what it is or isn't responsible for

356
00:33:01,473 --> 00:33:06,853
activation. alright.

357
00:33:06,853 --> 00:33:12,047
you left a message. this is supposed to be finding out. they want out_of that

358
00:33:12,047 --> 00:33:17,287
over the past several years you get a new story. very often.

359
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:24,887
don't eat any fat necklaces lots fat don't need any sugar. so

360
00:33:24,887 --> 00:33:33,307
but joke about Hopkins Alcon today three seven eight thirty eight.

361
00:33:33,307 --> 00:33:40,067
alright. so see you. hey

362
00:33:40,067 --> 00:33:45,287
mother agent is the cost of disease. we have till

363
00:33:45,287 --> 00:33:50,527
that weren't really either didn't exist are being using

364
00:33:50,527 --> 00:33:55,667
the same way if you go back. call back away from it all backwards eight years now. you go back

365
00:33:55,667 --> 00:34:00,807
to nineteen thirty. Lot of things were not as well as the job. so the first thing

366
00:34:00,807 --> 00:34:06,987
is that there were no grandma's clinical trials.

367
00:34:06,987 --> 00:34:12,654
you know. I just wanna make sure everyone knows what this means. this means that you

368
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:17,734
you for example that physical thing with be you have a group of patients that there disease.

369
00:34:17,734 --> 00:34:23,034
this is standard treatment for and you wanna try. it's eight nine. that you thinking might

370
00:34:23,034 --> 00:34:28,194
be better than your treatment might improve health outcomes. but you don't know

371
00:34:28,194 --> 00:34:33,674
which is why you wanna do this stuff will be ethical to do. if you are a new but it worked or not.

372
00:34:33,674 --> 00:34:38,894
and so you get people to in enroll and they don't get to choose

373
00:34:38,894 --> 00:34:44,334
whether they get standard treatment for the new treatment. they're randomly

374
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:50,454
selected to get one of the other right. and the idea behind that is.

375
00:34:50,454 --> 00:34:55,594
if you sell select. give me all time the reason that might have something to do with

376
00:34:55,594 --> 00:35:01,894
our disease or whether a particular agent is going to help with your disease

377
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:07,054
that maybe associated with whether you want one treatment or the other.

378
00:35:07,054 --> 00:35:12,254
but when you do a random probably tend to get rid of all of those and sounding very both

379
00:35:12,254 --> 00:35:17,300
very both of my just start the relationship between exposure and the statement

380
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,500
of the two treatment and the disease dad because they're both

381
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:28,020
associated simultaneous play with third factor.

382
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:33,260
so they both about whether or not you get the treatment. so stay with whether or not your disease gets better

383
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:39,120
or worse you notice. if you do a random of our clinical trial

384
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:44,240
series. if I should be which is possible. in terms

385
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,380
of re advising people back in in. if you have a large enough group. it's

386
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:54,820
very it's not really possible that the exposure

387
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,840
treat treat my neighbors and Steve is gonna be a survey with some characteristic of the

388
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:06,480
individual. because you randomly decide who was gonna do it. which treatment.

389
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,764
I hope that I sometimes maybe even the people didn't do that the course already

390
00:36:11,764 --> 00:36:17,064
alright so. so we now have that. this is really powerful tool. but we already talked about.

391
00:36:17,064 --> 00:36:22,404
for ethical reasons. we can't do that. we're doing

392
00:36:22,404 --> 00:36:27,444
a study looking at occupational and environmental exposures. almost ever. the

393
00:36:27,444 --> 00:36:32,884
only time we get to grandma's

394
00:36:32,884 --> 00:36:37,944
trial application on file now is when

395
00:36:37,944 --> 00:36:43,504
we're trying to see if they offered intervention. actually it's preventing Tuesday

396
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:49,324
and you don't know whether the intervention works or not. but not in terms of conversation.

397
00:36:49,324 --> 00:36:54,784
okay and the other thing is that we now have a very large scale.

398
00:36:54,784 --> 00:37:00,084
that would be in your studies Robin Don Gamble. you have_to we have

399
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:05,564
with called campaign which Tuesday which is taking eight. select

400
00:37:05,564 --> 00:37:11,044
up there for you in the population to be represented the whole population. and repeatedly going back

401
00:37:11,044 --> 00:37:16,692
and Saturday. all times of questionnaire base but also

402
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:21,692
biological base on things in people's blood in urine. look at over time and then you

403
00:37:21,692 --> 00:37:26,832
can connect it. yeah these huge databases that you can look at. just

404
00:37:26,832 --> 00:37:31,892
if you go back. yeah sixty years ago to Justin and help you answer questions

405
00:37:31,892 --> 00:37:36,992
about relationships between exposure. okay. that's weird.

406
00:37:36,992 --> 00:37:42,332
knowing about. so this is probably

407
00:37:42,332 --> 00:37:48,572
obvious what's up there. the fact did

408
00:37:48,572 --> 00:37:53,592
you find any exposures. just wanted David to see he's out_of doesn't

409
00:37:53,592 --> 00:37:58,672
tell you. bye. so whether that is a Cosco relationship or whether for some other reason to

410
00:37:58,672 --> 00:38:03,692
do have_to do with the design and study. they turned out to be

411
00:38:03,692 --> 00:38:08,852
our bad. I just bad lot. they turned out to be in touch with anyone there isn't really a real Cosco

412
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:15,386
connection. so pack here on our.

413
00:38:15,386 --> 00:38:20,966
you can do a study and claim that you think is the cost of relationship

414
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:26,246
between exposure and visa Company. if you didn't find

415
00:38:26,246 --> 00:38:31,326
association right. so it only goes one direction. so for example

416
00:38:31,326 --> 00:38:36,406
here. I did two examples are. call miners is respiratory disease.

417
00:38:36,406 --> 00:38:42,206
we know that got the working part of the coworkers working with other increase risk for respiratory disease.

418
00:38:42,206 --> 00:38:47,366
they also smoke cigarettes as well not surprisingly there's not much more risk for developing respiratory

419
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:52,386
diseases. there's lots of data on that. whereas if you

420
00:38:52,386 --> 00:38:57,606
if you say every time I go to Salt_Lake_City. it's been rainy. I sent my flight

421
00:38:57,606 --> 00:39:03,806
to Salt_Lake_City. Cos it's raining. that would be in association

422
00:39:03,806 --> 00:39:08,826
probably not possible by the way this is the real picture of Salt_Lake_City with

423
00:39:08,826 --> 00:39:14,028
a rain storm in the mountains. just let you know. okay this

424
00:39:14,028 --> 00:39:19,388
is probably something really really obvious that you can decide the other

425
00:39:19,388 --> 00:39:25,728
classes association. doesn't mean it's call right.

426
00:39:25,728 --> 00:39:31,088
alright. so I figure I covered

427
00:39:31,088 --> 00:39:36,268
what's on here. take me a_lot_of reasons for a statistical association

428
00:39:36,268 --> 00:39:43,048
without it being cos. alright.

429
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:48,128
okay. and then this is the Smart comic relief. I guess

430
00:39:48,128 --> 00:39:54,394
you can read it from their riders look if you screen actually it's probably

431
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:59,514
seem to be ever more. you know while. what's going on politically

432
00:39:59,514 --> 00:40:04,994
in our country. everybody can have their own faxes.

433
00:40:04,994 --> 00:40:10,514
definitely have it. you don't know. okay. so if

434
00:40:10,514 --> 00:40:16,994
this is true pot ration. if there's a cargo relationship. realize

435
00:40:16,994 --> 00:40:22,354
this this is a feature of the material world. it's not my study.

436
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:27,514
if you do how the relationship. is there to be found. it's something real. it's a

437
00:40:27,514 --> 00:40:33,254
fact that can figure out for forty years. possibly related.

438
00:40:33,254 --> 00:40:38,314
it's very substantial business. thanks for the material world. did you

439
00:40:38,314 --> 00:40:43,394
wanna car. okay. and

440
00:40:43,394 --> 00:40:49,354
you can also test it. alright. you can see whether you're finding the association.

441
00:40:49,354 --> 00:40:56,623
alright. so one of the three reading is from

442
00:40:56,623 --> 00:41:02,343
Service Sears. hello Bradford Hill. and.

443
00:41:02,343 --> 00:41:07,423
it's nice to read. it's very nice I lay things out. he did it. this is from

444
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:14,083
nineteen sixty five when you get this and that but I wanna get to look at the light at the bottom.

445
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:21,143
he said what what all I mean very positive he was given a speech about because the accommodation

446
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:26,623
needs that. well the question is with the frequency of done desirable event.

447
00:41:26,623 --> 00:41:31,823
I've been seeing the disease .com. be in by a change in the environmental

448
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:37,543
feature. so if you change or you change often the first. if that's true

449
00:41:37,543 --> 00:41:44,623
then you can start things on that possible. alright.

450
00:41:44,623 --> 00:41:50,183
sorry. so besides

451
00:41:50,183 --> 00:41:55,541
that we're just quoting job from hell in nineteen sixty five.

452
00:41:55,541 --> 00:42:01,041
the other TV sort of document history address

453
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:06,121
was put out by the surgeon general's report. guy Terry I think was his last

454
00:42:06,121 --> 00:42:11,941
name. here last night his working with him and sixty four. so

455
00:42:11,941 --> 00:42:18,221
that's that. the surgeon general that's Ross in Bradford Hill.

456
00:42:18,221 --> 00:42:23,261
and this surgeon general as report said. week. we need to have

457
00:42:23,261 --> 00:42:28,301
criteria and judgment to decide and what they were looking at with the

458
00:42:28,301 --> 00:42:33,601
relationship between and particular. okay.

459
00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:38,741
this is focused on now. in nineteen fifty four. there has

460
00:42:38,741 --> 00:42:43,781
been a number quite nine elegance studies done. starting in the fifties.

461
00:42:43,781 --> 00:42:49,201
that we're strongly suggesting that there was a Cosco relationship

462
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:54,539
between cigarette smoking and lung cancer bye. he was on the edge of Phoenix

463
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:59,599
Dallas and it's back to work by vigorously and sometimes getting time

464
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:05,159
to come out with other points of view and so on. they thought they had to be really careful

465
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:10,259
and I had to talk about what our criteria gonna be. when we are looking at these

466
00:43:10,259 --> 00:43:15,459
a_lot_of studies that are all important and deciding whether or not there's a condo association between

467
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:20,659
tobacco and lung cancer and. so here's

468
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:25,799
the list of criteria that the surgeon general have. you can see where we're gonna

469
00:43:25,799 --> 00:43:30,899
move quickly from from payroll with you. have a couple extra

470
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:35,999
things that is almost identical. very similar. so let's

471
00:43:35,999 --> 00:43:41,219
break this down. the consistency of association.

472
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:46,579
so that if I did that. if you do

473
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:52,741
start in a different population using a different messages. you expect to still

474
00:43:52,741 --> 00:43:58,061
that smoking tobacco products. it's gonna be at Thursday with long cancer. it's not

475
00:43:58,061 --> 00:44:03,521
dependent on something special about the population or just the way you organize your study. so

476
00:44:03,521 --> 00:44:10,121
if that's true card that makes you have a_lot more confidence that they might be a possible association right.

477
00:44:10,121 --> 00:44:15,301
this straightened out station. so for example here and talk about the ratio of lung cancer rates

478
00:44:15,301 --> 00:44:21,021
for smokers as compared to non-smoker rate ratio.

479
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:26,401
so in this case. if if I tell you actually

480
00:44:26,401 --> 00:44:31,601
is like you can hear it never small. it's on sale and it's a two pack

481
00:44:31,601 --> 00:44:36,621
for thirty four years. they're probably somewhere in the order of eleven to

482
00:44:36,621 --> 00:44:41,681
fifteen times more likely to answer the non-smoker. so when you

483
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:46,801
see that. Strong Association. it's become

484
00:44:46,801 --> 00:44:52,155
very difficult to explain away with various kinds of biopsies in your study

485
00:44:52,155 --> 00:45:00,735
you really gotta work out to get that kind of association from bye. alright.

486
00:45:00,735 --> 00:45:05,935
yeah I just want a little here. if this is the association. the

487
00:45:05,935 --> 00:45:11,255
idea that the position that you can say. one component of the exposure disease .com.

488
00:45:11,255 --> 00:45:17,375
can you utilized to take the other. so another words if I walking to work

489
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:22,375
today. I've got you were a cigarette smoker. usually you'll be right.

490
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:27,495
that kind of thing. if it doesn't that's very true.

491
00:45:27,495 --> 00:45:32,515
this one is absolutely essential. this is the one that

492
00:45:32,515 --> 00:45:37,515
if you don't have it. you don't have because ration. I mean it's pretty obvious but

493
00:45:37,515 --> 00:45:42,895
not the last. sometimes it's best if we did a cross sectional

494
00:45:42,895 --> 00:45:48,555
that evening we collected information about exposure and disease. currently

495
00:45:48,555 --> 00:45:53,577
like current exposure at the same time we maybe

496
00:45:53,577 --> 00:45:59,357
in the association but we know every maybe you called the relationship but it might be what we

497
00:45:59,357 --> 00:46:04,417
are thinking of exposure. occurring current because the person artery has a disease.

498
00:46:04,417 --> 00:46:10,597
they have been in the wrong order. alright. see a big condo if it doesn't happen before

499
00:46:10,597 --> 00:46:15,597
the outcome and how Harris is idea this is not

500
00:46:15,597 --> 00:46:20,697
fit in with other things we know about the natural history and biology disease that's

501
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:26,857
useful but as we talked about a_while ago. you were always finding new diseases and suspected.

502
00:46:26,857 --> 00:46:32,841
I your story with cancers okay

503
00:46:32,841 --> 00:46:38,081
so you're up in Bradford Hill. you is a big deal he also did studies

504
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:46,361
on this about the lung cancer and he probably is that key paper were talking about. and

505
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:51,601
and he basically had a question. okay. patient our study.

506
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:57,141
what should you consider before you decide whether it's consul. and this is a safety hazard.

507
00:46:57,141 --> 00:47:02,681
he included and the time

508
00:47:02,681 --> 00:47:09,381
for this homework walk was gonna ask you basically apply for health criteria.

509
00:47:09,381 --> 00:47:14,881
to say whether you think the study that you're gonna read. whether it's convincing that the associations

510
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:20,421
founder are possible or not. and the study are gonna read. I think I mentioned last time.

511
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:25,641
actually had had a huge impact on EPA decisions about

512
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:30,712
what to what level they need to reduce particular PM two

513
00:47:30,712 --> 00:47:35,873
point five. in the Ambien air and outdoor air in the unit. so it's very

514
00:47:35,873 --> 00:47:40,972
important possible and controversial because it's important. so this is

515
00:47:40,972 --> 00:47:46,192
the aspect that he'll had. I think same on strain.

516
00:47:46,192 --> 00:47:51,212
the same on consistency. this is the also the same essentially

517
00:47:51,212 --> 00:47:56,573
rally. we just talked about the same. I got to talk about it does respond to curve

518
00:47:56,573 --> 00:48:02,093
but if there's a possible relationship you might expect that the higher exposure. worst the disease

519
00:48:02,093 --> 00:48:07,353
of the more likely you are to get the disease although that requires

520
00:48:07,353 --> 00:48:13,532
more data and just saying whether there's an association a larger study.

521
00:48:13,532 --> 00:48:18,573
do you think it's possible. well he would listen sorry about that but as I alluded to

522
00:48:18,573 --> 00:48:23,732
a minute ago. you made. I think something possible because

523
00:48:23,732 --> 00:48:29,566
problem like that never been seen before. you might say. well it's not possible it's

524
00:48:29,566 --> 00:48:34,626
little Marshall has a certain odor that smells like butter is gonna cost lung disease and always

525
00:48:34,626 --> 00:48:42,806
people. but turned out to be true that it was causing related

526
00:48:42,806 --> 00:48:47,846
and does it. seriously consider jamming on fact of natural hedge and biology

527
00:48:47,846 --> 00:48:53,266
of disease. so for example

528
00:48:53,266 --> 00:48:58,626
thought I told you that having wrinkled skin on your face.

529
00:48:58,626 --> 00:49:04,026
Kate Lee rental that you got on there. spot with parking people.

530
00:49:04,026 --> 00:49:09,406
so call us. phone now.

531
00:49:09,406 --> 00:49:14,566
if you location between those two. most of. you actually have_to

532
00:49:14,566 --> 00:49:19,606
measure. our record people safeguards people with COPD article faces people

533
00:49:19,606 --> 00:49:24,806
down. I have somebody Monday morning here.

534
00:49:24,806 --> 00:49:30,049
believe it. it's the wrinkles that are causing the long disease no

535
00:49:30,049 --> 00:49:37,188
volunteers. okay. so

536
00:49:37,188 --> 00:49:42,289
would you have an alternate excavation. I guess all those it together. might have an easier time with this

537
00:49:42,289 --> 00:49:47,509
but please it might explain why those two of those any

538
00:49:47,509 --> 00:50:01,989
series.

539
00:50:01,989 --> 00:50:07,688
so you actually got an average increase. Home Medical people say.

540
00:50:07,688 --> 00:50:15,669
bye. Ring Con. bye. okay. okay.

541
00:50:15,669 --> 00:50:20,989
so and then he'll also talk about experiment we actually talked about experiment in the sense

542
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:26,428
that you can apply the occupations are no health issues. please tell you about experiment

543
00:50:26,428 --> 00:50:31,552
intervention. seems you really have good evidence of things possible.

544
00:50:31,552 --> 00:50:36,792
if you intervene change the exposure and you see he's

545
00:50:36,792 --> 00:50:41,933
reduced. that's very. if you do that. quite strong evidence of that or the message

546
00:50:41,933 --> 00:50:47,492
would you be very strong chance of in the real world and demonstrated

547
00:50:47,492 --> 00:50:54,492
that you change the rest of the disease. alright.

548
00:50:54,492 --> 00:50:59,532
I'm allergy. it's similar to some other contact there that might

549
00:50:59,532 --> 00:51:04,532
help you. it might not. that's pretty weak one and it's another but over

550
00:51:04,532 --> 00:51:09,532
lap and receive the original lips are still very influential. that's

551
00:51:09,532 --> 00:51:14,633
what we're talking about. you know they've been fifteen different ways and stuff. had

552
00:51:14,633 --> 00:51:19,673
to call Matt that everyone agrees on this is out_of the side. if you have a possible

553
00:51:19,673 --> 00:51:26,628
relationship and at the genealogy study

554
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:32,088
so now I return to the division specific conversation versus general validation

555
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:37,128
which I'm guessing has been presented to almost any

556
00:51:37,128 --> 00:51:42,548
of you before in that fashion. so general because ration is what we've been tied up

557
00:51:42,548 --> 00:51:47,648
for the last hour or whatever basically. so

558
00:51:47,648 --> 00:51:53,028
our person is with great exposure. more likely to

559
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:58,108
develop the disease by the specific conversation is Mister Jones.

560
00:51:58,108 --> 00:52:03,108
this individual has been busy and he also had

561
00:52:03,108 --> 00:52:08,328
exposure that substance ask. maybe at work. I did that because

562
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:13,808
it increases the risk of developing the disease. so they're

563
00:52:13,808 --> 00:52:18,908
related to course. but as as it is under scored at the bottom. you

564
00:52:18,908 --> 00:52:24,990
can't you can't say this specific conversation without believing or having

565
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:30,150
this is General because they said you can't stay. even though there's no evidence and take

566
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:35,150
everything you logic study a large population and Sons and saxophone disease wives. Mister

567
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:40,331
Jones case. not a_lot. I think something is ex husband. while we got a buzz

568
00:52:40,331 --> 00:52:45,430
and see you to make an argument. so you can make that argument but of course the fact that

569
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:50,750
X can because why doesn't tell you whether that's what caused the disease in this particular

570
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:55,850
individual. and maybe the

571
00:52:55,850 --> 00:53:02,170
case study and do the clinical case studies about a particular individual. and

572
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:07,298
if you're a occupational or environmental conditions of any sort. you're trying

573
00:53:07,298 --> 00:53:12,374
to decide using a person trying to hey Scott

574
00:53:12,374 --> 00:53:17,534
this is process and it could be something that work environment that

575
00:53:17,534 --> 00:53:23,014
you're gonna have_to advertise in specific hydration and you're gonna have_to notify

576
00:53:23,014 --> 00:53:28,034
somewhat higher level more rigorous set of test. to decide

577
00:53:28,034 --> 00:53:33,114
you believe this individual get a caught and so

578
00:53:33,114 --> 00:53:38,174
that comes up all the time. in terms of people that may or may I have

579
00:53:38,174 --> 00:53:43,234
diseases and I'm sure this is on the mother five minutes

580
00:53:43,234 --> 00:53:48,234
before. but I just wanna point. I think I said it last Tuesday

581
00:53:48,234 --> 00:53:53,594
but I just wanna point out this specific position issue. it's hugely

582
00:53:53,594 --> 00:53:58,614
important. today given individual. if you guys are there's a decade

583
00:53:58,614 --> 00:54:04,594
working maybe a specialize job. hey well and you now telling that person

584
00:54:04,594 --> 00:54:09,894
used about the dogs that have not I think he has exposure if you have work. because

585
00:54:09,894 --> 00:54:15,799
your asthma and I don't recommend. even if you take

586
00:54:15,799 --> 00:54:22,019
medicine. try to control your asthma. I do not recommend that you return that work because I think inevitably

587
00:54:22,019 --> 00:54:27,179
what by far the most likely happen is your aunt just gonna get worse and worse. because

588
00:54:27,179 --> 00:54:32,219
you continue to get expose yourself. if you're if you

589
00:54:32,219 --> 00:54:37,619
tell her that you're wrong about it. you know they didn't have two messages.

590
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:42,659
you cannot I cannot that in your life for no reason right. we did a job try to

591
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:47,799
find another job. well that's it. that's it. you can find it.

592
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:52,799
I so and if you're in correct in that specific position here you had a

593
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:58,659
person do that for no reason. website side. it's I can't deal with the dogs and asthma.

594
00:54:58,659 --> 00:55:03,879
and maybe bad. please be getting worse over time you're trying to treat

595
00:55:03,879 --> 00:55:08,919
him and keep getting worse and it never even occurred to you. ask about our

596
00:55:08,919 --> 00:55:14,403
exposure hey missing out there. she's probably with

597
00:55:14,403 --> 00:55:19,503
the help of that individual right to basically present that would be in proper treatment. I can

598
00:55:19,503 --> 00:55:25,763
be allowed to continue to have exposure at the meeting.

599
00:55:25,763 --> 00:55:30,963
alright that's attention. that's why we care about specific times.

600
00:55:30,963 --> 00:55:36,083
so best placement. please set up

601
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:41,543
consideration to look at. with actually put out outside nine back in nineteen seventy nine.

602
00:55:41,543 --> 00:55:47,163
so this is the reading and. so

603
00:55:47,163 --> 00:55:52,443
well background. workers compensation this country.

604
00:55:52,443 --> 00:56:00,043
so if the I get still from work. you're supposed to get some kind of benefit for

605
00:56:00,043 --> 00:56:05,923
compensation for on the job injuries or other times of on the job problems

606
00:56:05,923 --> 00:56:11,153
and this this is expanded. later they started injuries and where

607
00:56:11,153 --> 00:56:17,213
they is we're gonna cover. work related disease. so for example. this is maybe a typical

608
00:56:17,213 --> 00:56:22,233
workshop in the US in the thirties. it is very poor controlled against injuries.

609
00:56:22,233 --> 00:56:28,333
this picture is large group of female

610
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:33,453
working in the radium lifestyle factory. I measured that from

611
00:56:33,453 --> 00:56:39,193
the nineteen twelve. probably for the nineteen five. so what are they doing.

612
00:56:39,193 --> 00:56:44,213
they hired all women. women are. I think it's true but basically living

613
00:56:44,213 --> 00:56:50,093
or Mart textures. you know five dollars. that are. and they're having them. hey

614
00:56:50,093 --> 00:56:56,213
ready containing pain on the watch spaces. so that when you look at the dark

615
00:56:56,213 --> 00:57:01,973
glow and you can read what time it is about three o'clock. this is not the time right

616
00:57:01,973 --> 00:57:07,273
now that I've done it before. so I don't know if I may do this ahead of time and we'll pay for us.

617
00:57:07,273 --> 00:57:12,481
in order to keep it to sharpen. they would like

618
00:57:12,481 --> 00:57:17,641
it all day long and nobody. well first off I need you

619
00:57:17,641 --> 00:57:23,081
to complete with you but nobody was telling maybe in sort of finalizing radiation

620
00:57:23,081 --> 00:57:28,781
changes to your health. in a very high. very substantial. eventually things out.

621
00:57:28,781 --> 00:57:34,201
I can't. this is an outstanding job because they were being exposed to radio

622
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:39,421
for years on. okay. so so traumatic

623
00:57:39,421 --> 00:57:45,241
injuries. you know something falls on your phone networking working across.

624
00:57:45,241 --> 00:57:50,601
that's pretty obvious you walk you can walk when you came in you can work out something happened at work.

625
00:57:50,601 --> 00:57:55,621
this is my for this call through. when you talk about it and see

626
00:57:55,621 --> 00:58:00,641
the outcome. it appears much later. which is kinda thing. I thought that

627
00:58:00,641 --> 00:58:06,761
was in my life and my professional life. trying to come to a conclusion about that.

628
00:58:06,761 --> 00:58:12,905
so

629
00:58:12,905 --> 00:58:17,905
my comic relief I guess. alright. so here's the

630
00:58:17,905 --> 00:58:22,925
seven questions and I actually did actually in your syllabus if you look

631
00:58:22,925 --> 00:58:28,465
at section about the case studies. they said a questions

632
00:58:28,465 --> 00:58:33,725
there there were a little bit differently than this but they're about the same. so

633
00:58:33,725 --> 00:58:40,385
if you're going to end up saying that you believe. let's keep it application the mama

634
00:58:40,385 --> 00:58:45,485
that folder. it needs work environment the person was

635
00:58:45,485 --> 00:58:50,625
in. if this is Bob over in their disease why you have_to go through

636
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:55,705
all these questions and basically for the most part answers are all

637
00:58:55,705 --> 00:59:00,905
positive except maybe for some couple of them need to be negative you'll see in the moment

638
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:05,905
before you're likely to reach for conclusion that it's more probable do not

639
00:59:05,905 --> 00:59:11,589
work because the problem. okay. so

640
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:17,549
answer disease conditions and clearly establish the first question is do you know what what

641
00:59:17,549 --> 00:59:22,589
something wrong. you know that this is wrong. you know what

642
00:59:22,589 --> 00:59:27,709
what disease actually had and then in the literature in their evidence

643
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:34,229
that the disease could be part of the suspect agent. that seems like lots chance right.

644
00:59:34,229 --> 00:59:39,369
that doesn't prove that I called in this individual but it's it's critical that it's been shown that he can

645
00:59:39,369 --> 00:59:45,209
convert in some circumstance and then apart next question about that.

646
00:59:45,209 --> 00:59:50,365
okay. this individual

647
00:59:50,365 --> 00:59:55,845
this is. and even if you know they had some exposure.

648
00:59:55,845 --> 01:00:01,205
the question becomes where they spoken to high level. they expected

649
01:00:01,205 --> 01:00:06,245
to be take her. things go over here there we may not always be a hundred percent sure

650
01:00:06,245 --> 01:00:11,765
how to answer that question but you. if you think about this logically I think you would agree.

651
01:00:11,765 --> 01:00:17,225
you have_to use all of questions I just want you to have your life.

652
01:00:17,225 --> 01:00:22,265
yes reasonably well before you get to the conclusion that this is

653
01:00:22,265 --> 01:00:28,945
just a person that exposure that would be awesome.

654
01:00:28,945 --> 01:00:34,505
okay. and then

655
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:39,525
if you wanna look at other factors put a. you know maybe there's non- occupational

656
01:00:39,525 --> 01:00:44,545
exposure that is responsible. if somebody.

657
01:00:44,545 --> 01:00:49,585
well it's complicated. we could argue about it. well at our event we have a_lot_of

658
01:00:49,585 --> 01:00:54,930
discussion about

659
01:00:54,930 --> 01:01:01,030
agent we're pleased to be a long message.

660
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:07,090
but they're also happy smoker. so you might say well it's

661
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:12,310
imperative. the person doing on smoker. it's a_lot up there. what it

662
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:17,390
what the person was supposed to work. is responsible for that lung cancer why can I just need

663
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:22,590
some cigarette smoking like a laser. many many people and same

664
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:28,170
question. I have no special circumstances in Wade. you know

665
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:34,570
maybe various factors that influence the disease.

666
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:40,090
look the house. for example I just gave like. love you.

667
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:46,570
real family know about but I have someone who was an installation worker and

668
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:52,314
mid seventies. they're older now they were asbestos containing installation

669
01:01:52,314 --> 01:01:58,634
all the time. later. okay always wrapping things in installation factory.

670
01:01:58,634 --> 01:02:05,874
and they also small. every four years.

671
01:02:05,874 --> 01:02:10,974
not long and many times. maybe someone like me saying

672
01:02:10,974 --> 01:02:16,014
I maybe a lawyer. say hey. I have lung cancer ever drama

673
01:02:16,014 --> 01:02:21,034
about. I think I should get compensated by the company I should be.

674
01:02:21,034 --> 01:02:27,054
I work for for my cancer and

675
01:02:27,054 --> 01:02:32,094
so you know a few minutes ago. well

676
01:02:32,094 --> 01:02:37,494
it's most serious maybe decrease the probability that as best this is contribute

677
01:02:37,494 --> 01:02:42,554
towards your lung cancer. there's a boy. have a counter argument to

678
01:02:42,554 --> 01:02:47,934
that. this is not that. so I don't think that you didn't take everything

679
01:02:47,934 --> 01:02:56,632
all together gonna have a town argument anyone yet.

680
01:02:56,632 --> 01:03:01,772
well that's good point. but listen this is this is ever the dialog as it is. well

681
01:03:01,772 --> 01:03:14,072
it's to because both buyers that's. bye. you can have a blessed rest of you. yes.

682
01:03:14,072 --> 01:03:19,912
yeah with us. just call question the answer. are you bet you what I'm trying to get at.

683
01:03:19,912 --> 01:03:32,172
you were expecting me to answer that right now. okay. yeah.

684
01:03:32,172 --> 01:03:38,592
okay. you wanna do something.

685
01:03:38,592 --> 01:03:43,832
okay so I said we're not. bye. so if you look at the real data base the people

686
01:03:43,832 --> 01:03:49,152
like that let's see this is the great website. I think we just doing our have something probably

687
01:03:49,152 --> 01:03:54,260
to drop it off for set up the rent for another smoker never word

688
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:59,300
around about this risk of lung cancer at one. okay. they to compare the

689
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:04,880
rates for other people like give me the bottom of the registration. so if you take someone that was

690
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:09,980
a pretty heavy cigarette smoker for for most of their life

691
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:15,080
that I got long cancer. so they're that heavy smoker.

692
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:20,340
it is probably ten eleven and twelve times more likely the never smoker

693
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:26,180
to get up on cancer again light. okay. yeah. hey.

694
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:31,320
someother work. technically what is best for her. I've been in the fifties

695
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:37,640
sixties and seven eight and had never smoke a cigarette in his or her life. alright.

696
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:44,180
David. bye. you're about. bye. more like

697
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:49,660
individual lot. I have it's not hard to

698
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:54,776
a_lot higher. now here's the kicker what about the people like this

699
01:04:54,776 --> 01:04:59,876
individual. they did both. they had that exposure

700
01:04:59,876 --> 01:05:04,956
answer. love you. have a good day. it's actually

701
01:05:04,956 --> 01:05:10,456
been a little bit hard but it's like it is. basically won't take it. you might expect to be

702
01:05:10,456 --> 01:05:15,836
time. like for you to pay first. so holler five ten five one three three zero

703
01:05:15,836 --> 01:05:21,156
five five nine five three three seven.. you must be fifty times like wasted

704
01:05:21,156 --> 01:05:26,536
out long cancer. the person that was supposed to be there and we'll do residence

705
01:05:26,536 --> 01:05:36,016
said yes it might be more like sixty or seventy time. so actually more than models I get it.

706
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:42,916
okay just think about that and what happened in court. we're between the two lawyers.

707
01:05:42,916 --> 01:05:47,936
yeah the lawyer for the company gets up and says

708
01:05:47,936 --> 01:05:53,206
well heavy cigarette smoker. it's even a bigger risk for everyone. even

709
01:05:53,206 --> 01:05:59,686
if I read this by the rest of the afternoon. you even bigger

710
01:05:59,686 --> 01:06:06,506
and the prosecution margins.

711
01:06:06,506 --> 01:06:11,786
Paul said well.

712
01:06:11,786 --> 01:06:16,806
so he's about. okay. bye. you know the

713
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:22,826
question here is whether is work so if you could trade it in to it. not whether it was a cigarette smoker.

714
01:06:22,826 --> 01:06:27,886
and actually if you look at the not the risk ratio but the after rest

715
01:06:27,886 --> 01:07:28,443
the rest different

716
01:07:28,443 --> 01:07:34,223
this is different than fifty five. time is eight five nine four

717
01:07:34,223 --> 01:07:39,703
fifty five five eight five. so this boiler is probably better than I

718
01:07:39,703 --> 01:07:44,963
probably drive my car and everything so enjoy message. so it's almost

719
01:07:44,963 --> 01:07:50,203
certain. alright. well it's just a certain in terms of ratio.

720
01:07:50,203 --> 01:07:55,603
and this message positive if he's ever smoked in fact

721
01:07:55,603 --> 01:08:00,623
the probability what happened done this work. this test

722
01:08:00,623 --> 01:08:05,963
is haven't been responsible for the fact that he today has lung cancer when he would not have otherwise.

723
01:08:05,963 --> 01:08:12,123
it's much much much higher. he had few cigarettes no emergency.

724
01:08:12,123 --> 01:08:18,563
he needs to be compensated.. you know as you get in to Kevin

725
01:08:18,563 --> 01:08:24,343
Patterson. so you guys are using interaction.

726
01:08:24,343 --> 01:08:29,487
I cannot make it effective to keep making change on your alright gorgeous. I'm about

727
01:08:29,487 --> 01:08:35,107
to go on. alright. okay. so have all the special circumstances

728
01:08:35,107 --> 01:08:40,527
been wait that might some of specials are gonna increase the probability

729
01:08:40,527 --> 01:08:46,687
but the person problem is work related or environment related. a_lot_of them would decrease it.

730
01:08:46,687 --> 01:08:51,847
okay. and then at the just make a decision. I have the burner approved Matt. when I consider

731
01:08:51,847 --> 01:08:57,347
those six questions. the evidence for the disease of this individual.

732
01:08:57,347 --> 01:09:04,207
the results from was activated by conditions. at this individual's work

733
01:09:04,207 --> 01:09:09,387
and. so when you Judy. hey. tell you to use

734
01:09:09,387 --> 01:09:14,607
any more probable than better than fifty percent. our

735
01:09:14,607 --> 01:09:20,087
commit. is it more involved and not over exposure.

736
01:09:20,087 --> 01:09:26,727
either cards are activated. the problem. so that

737
01:09:26,727 --> 01:09:41,967
set that. yeah.

738
01:09:41,967 --> 01:09:49,567
yeah. I don't see. well. okay.

739
01:09:49,567 --> 01:09:58,527
call me.

740
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:04,267
either about half to three in action between.

741
01:10:04,267 --> 01:10:10,527
I don't like that happened. so I've been waiting state law. shit there's really

742
01:10:10,527 --> 01:10:15,787
not a state law case series in state and in different

743
01:10:15,787 --> 01:10:21,027
state and probably two different ways. but that's very good question.

744
01:10:21,027 --> 01:10:27,411
okay. so I wanna go back to the dentist. so tell me can you

745
01:10:27,411 --> 01:10:32,951
did you spend no time. a little bit of time huge amount of time talking about the concept

746
01:10:32,951 --> 01:10:38,051
of counter specials. a_lot_of time. okay. this is

747
01:10:38,051 --> 01:10:45,291
not for you. alright. thanks. bye. hello.

748
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:51,931
hello this is Robin Green. the Bible.

749
01:10:51,931 --> 01:10:57,011
bye. yes it's been very very respect about respect at all. so they wanted

750
01:10:57,011 --> 01:11:02,211
to find a part of a specific disease and they gave it easy ones

751
01:11:02,211 --> 01:11:07,411
on the line. they say it's because of a disease and that is in the best condition.

752
01:11:07,411 --> 01:11:12,451
if you're interested in that free seated. it's been a_while AppleOrder the

753
01:11:12,451 --> 01:11:17,711
disease advance without which disease. even if that either would not

754
01:11:17,711 --> 01:11:23,011
haven't heard at all and would not have heard until sometime later and I'm

755
01:11:23,011 --> 01:11:28,227
talking about a position because so basically that's what the game is at the nations

756
01:11:28,227 --> 01:11:33,667
top and I get involved you know that that that statement and apparently has counter factual

757
01:11:33,667 --> 01:11:39,247
in. thanks account specialist. if that exposure not occurred. the person would not have the disease

758
01:11:39,247 --> 01:11:44,527
exposure didn't her. okay.

759
01:11:44,527 --> 01:11:49,987
so and I used to look at it. could you look to be part of diagrams and. if done. okay.

760
01:11:49,987 --> 01:11:55,107
so this is certainly interesting. thought about interactions and it's for

761
01:11:55,107 --> 01:12:00,547
example before I wanna show you how complicated. thinking about you and your actions can be

762
01:12:00,547 --> 01:12:06,807
between two different possible cognitive agents for .com. so

763
01:12:06,807 --> 01:12:13,987
what we have here. we're supposing that

764
01:12:13,987 --> 01:12:20,607
too. I've sufficient call to come out something. the

765
01:12:20,607 --> 01:12:26,479
ask is. if you have you. hey Andy

766
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:31,739
all at the same time. so you might need to different conditions or statements about

767
01:12:31,739 --> 01:12:36,799
your exposures you had. don't sorry about they are just their region. you have

768
01:12:36,799 --> 01:12:42,119
all three of those. you will get this. if you only have two and three.

769
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:47,379
you will not get the disease. so this is thing. the reason it's call. our circle

770
01:12:47,379 --> 01:12:53,019
is because all three together. the station. the cost of the disease. but

771
01:12:53,019 --> 01:12:58,599
they're all necessary have each of the three. if you only have two of them. you don't get the.

772
01:12:58,599 --> 01:13:04,139
everyone would be on the logic. alright. so in this case there's only three

773
01:13:04,139 --> 01:13:09,253
different mission call for this disease. at either

774
01:13:09,253 --> 01:13:14,253
yet did you. AT&T. or you have_to have you eat something other

775
01:13:14,253 --> 01:13:19,313
than V or you have you be. alright. so

776
01:13:19,313 --> 01:13:24,373
yeah come on three or you never get your live support. you have_to three.

777
01:13:24,373 --> 01:13:31,793
you never get this. everybody's looking out at the time. okay so

778
01:13:31,793 --> 01:13:37,113
what the component components. is there are necessary state to

779
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:42,833
get the disease. so to be and you are already present.

780
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:47,893
what. call toll component is sufficient. so if

781
01:13:47,893 --> 01:13:53,113
be and you are present. what what would dance

782
01:13:53,113 --> 01:13:58,253
happy. look at we're being present

783
01:13:58,253 --> 01:14:03,313
to be present for the patient call. wrong wrong one. this is

784
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:08,853
a call from Monroe three. but it's not. could you call on hold to write

785
01:14:08,853 --> 01:14:13,862
this question you can ignore too because there's no be a

786
01:14:13,862 --> 01:14:19,022
question. what cobble components would be cost efficient. if you already

787
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:24,282
knew that me and you were present. I want give me an answer at that time. next

788
01:14:24,282 --> 01:14:29,322
time. alright.

789
01:14:29,322 --> 01:14:34,422
yeah exactly. either one. alright. this is Jay. hey Ben this is sufficient

790
01:14:34,422 --> 01:14:39,642
you're in Roman number one. if you get he then you're in rolling over three and that's.

791
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:44,842
either in area. okay. bye-bye. everyone. try to give you an idea of how to think about

792
01:14:44,842 --> 01:14:50,142
these diagrams. so let's go a little bit more complicated

793
01:14:50,142 --> 01:14:55,662
situation we're in now. if this is thing set up. there's somebody is only

794
01:14:55,662 --> 01:15:02,782
three position. call

795
01:15:02,782 --> 01:15:08,762
me. yeah you have this is not a factor.

796
01:15:08,762 --> 01:15:13,960
you're gonna go back up if you have you. hey and be at the same

797
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:19,500
time. if

798
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:26,440
this is this is this is

799
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:31,500
one factor might be. it could be almost

800
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:36,700
anything you need just like you know to be that they have a certain

801
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:41,840
genetic variation that they were exposed to a certain

802
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:47,340
substance that they I don't know grew up in Northern Cline.

803
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:53,720
maybe it's by the mass multiple sclerosis and do it for you. okay.

804
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:58,960
so no idea it's not really true. but

805
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:06,240
the reason we're doing it.

806
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:11,488
so so efficient means as soon as I have everything at the Martin

807
01:16:11,488 --> 01:16:16,768
Circle. I'm gonna get the disease. that's all. that's was one position.

808
01:16:16,768 --> 01:16:21,988
okay. so you still don't look happy.

809
01:16:21,988 --> 01:16:27,168
alright. it's up here.

810
01:16:27,168 --> 01:16:32,888
it's a little more complicated because you still have three sufficient parking. anyone of those three.

811
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:38,228
you have all five things at the same time. in that one. you will get

812
01:16:38,228 --> 01:16:43,228
to see. okay. thanks. have a safe. this is more thing inside

813
01:16:43,228 --> 01:16:48,428
in Chicago Circle. so here's a question

814
01:16:48,428 --> 01:16:53,548
for you. one of the time the poll. she did not actually.

815
01:16:53,548 --> 01:16:58,988
there is no actual GE in the real world doesn't exist.

816
01:16:58,988 --> 01:17:04,408
Dan would you save it for you and ask what always. sometimes never

817
01:17:04,408 --> 01:17:09,584
biological the interactive accommodation of disease. so let me know you was gonna be mad. bye

818
01:17:09,584 --> 01:17:14,984
enter interactive accommodations and these would be the same.

819
01:17:14,984 --> 01:17:20,144
if you just happy nosy to. if you just have a note of these. if you have

820
01:17:20,144 --> 01:17:26,024
both of you get this. that's where we're gonna meet. bye. interest in this case. okay.

821
01:17:26,024 --> 01:17:31,444
if this is someone special about additional interaction but it's our mesa way people

822
01:17:31,444 --> 01:17:36,944
think of the time. okay. so she didn't actually exist.

823
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:41,944
would you save it being out always sometimes and never logically or acting the conversation with

824
01:17:41,944 --> 01:17:47,504
disease. so Jean our existing means to resolve the bad right.

825
01:17:47,504 --> 01:17:52,524
nobody ever has. wrong number two because G does not exist. okay.

826
01:17:52,524 --> 01:17:57,764
so you have_to look at people to get together disease by joining

827
01:17:57,764 --> 01:18:03,504
either. number one around about three. so

828
01:18:03,504 --> 01:18:11,920
you ever. do be an ass in one or three

829
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:17,180
this call that

830
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:23,320
would tell you that MG does not exit.

831
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:28,820
jean does not exist. and would never interactive conversation.

832
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:33,900
he's right. because they would never be true that. if you are happy.

833
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:39,180
just heading out. we'll give you the disease. anyway never be true. if you are he had

834
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:44,320
just that indeed we give you the disease because the only three way you can get three ways you can get the diseases

835
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:49,380
I have in all five of those. all five of those and all five of those and if you're it.

836
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:54,400
if you if you got the weather. it

837
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:59,620
depends where you have a CD. but it doesn't depend

838
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:04,860
on whether you have asked. S has nothing to do with this because pass right and

839
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:11,618
exact. vice_versa. okay we're about stop the exact vice_versa for

840
01:19:11,618 --> 01:19:18,518
for. if you have. Angie doesn't exist.

841
01:19:18,518 --> 01:19:23,578
it doesn't matter whether you're busy. that would say. you have a happy happy and never know

842
01:19:23,578 --> 01:19:28,678
if I told you that. yeah. see doesn't

843
01:19:28,678 --> 01:19:33,718
exist. and it doesn't exist. so I'll see

844
01:19:33,718 --> 01:19:39,398
you guys go celebrate that. if I doesn't exist or eliminate that. so this is the only way

845
01:19:39,398 --> 01:19:44,518
you can get their act situation. you say something. alright.

846
01:19:44,518 --> 01:19:49,710
thanks be in. all you have_to interact because they both have_to be present

847
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:55,750
because busy. so this is pointed out that this idea of interaction.

848
01:19:55,750 --> 01:20:01,030
it actually can be much more complex than what you said. at first client. depending

849
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:06,550
on what other factors they can combine the cost that sort of the point of it.

850
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:12,450
we'll talk about some more and I'll try to catch up.

851
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:18,750
yeah we'll come back to this. okay. alright. bye-bye.

852
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:24,570
have a good evening and I'll probably just send you everything

853
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:30,130
before noon tomorrow. John's daughter. I was actually in the Cub_Scouts

854
01:20:30,130 --> 01:21:26,515
for short time
