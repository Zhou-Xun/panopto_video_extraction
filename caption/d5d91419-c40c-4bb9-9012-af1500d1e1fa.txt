1
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:14,260
But. So in the past few weeks, we talk about the water quality regulations and laws.

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:22,240
Whatever contaminants you experience in the water and how we monitor them and what our quality standards are.

3
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,559
So. In terms of water quality management.

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,360
Now we've identified a source of contamination. So what's the source of that?

5
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,370
We know what produced the the pollutants to our water all the time.

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,200
But if you understand better is to say you are to control them, to reduce them, to prevent them.

7
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,180
You need to identify the source of the contamination. So in the world, the.

8
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:55,860
The. One X we clearly defined the source of contamination, which is point sources.

9
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:06,689
That is not possible. So we may see why we defined the poisons are not number of this or discuss before we do that we know yes,

10
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:12,569
we have the Clean Water Act and the EPA is talking in the 1970s.

11
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,600
We see a gradual improve of the water quality in the United States and the Clean Water Act was defined.

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,280
We passed, we request of the local authorities how to maintain the water quality.

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,139
If the water does not meet the willfulness,

14
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:33,960
then you have all this in in the Clean Water Act and we talk about the if they are not reasonable, what happens then that what we need to do.

15
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:45,570
Effort to treat the wounded. We have put development strategies to improve the water quality so the team views to the maximum they note.

16
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,469
One of the ways we have reduced the destructive river by and then how do we

17
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:56,120
implement the strategy we use empty as well to cover up this niche problem.

18
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:07,100
And then we do this and then we do the monitor again. But until the water reach the water quality standards based on the direct use.

19
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,920
One thing I want to keep that in mind is like a bigger picture here.

20
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:18,770
So one, and you want to call this the end that we're talking about based on the density use of that water.

21
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,400
Okay. Is is there a universal one? For example, Annie was this one body.

22
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:31,690
So, first of all, to use. What is useful sauce for drinking water from agricultural one off industrial use.

23
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,330
On the phone question president use all for the effect of the opposite effect.

24
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:45,240
So does the technique is used so in relation to the use of waterboarding, if you have the will to stand up.

25
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,400
And then you need to monitor the water quality to see whether it meets the state or not.

26
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,820
If that's not released, then we do have all discharges to go into the water flow.

27
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:01,740
If that meet the water point is, then what we need to do. If the water column meets the oil.

28
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:09,690
Understand that, then what we need to do. Apply what to many in the world of quantum?

29
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,410
Come on. Remember the. The diagram of the green.

30
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,280
Can you want to exit? Look at this diagram of the Clean Water Act.

31
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:34,810
She? So if you want a middle oil quality, then what do we need?

32
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,570
Look at the Clean Water Act. The diagram of the new one act.

33
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,440
So you're saying if it means what happens to you just monitor and revise as needed?

34
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:16,880
Because if the meat if the one opponent is even better than the one convinced that they could use, what would we apply up to that?

35
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,960
What they need to apply? Yeah.

36
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,200
I need to repeat this this diagram many, many times.

37
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,430
But that's one of the things, the framework when you just think about for the one act.

38
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,500
And I need to get this right.

39
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,990
So which means that if the water is gray water and not I mean, you can still contaminate that.

40
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,520
You need to apply the entity within the entity gradation.

41
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,810
So what you need is a lot of your points and that will need to develop the strategy.

42
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:56,000
Jim Dear Abby Yes. And then once again, until the middle 47.

43
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,020
But if it meets and then there's not an adequate basis.

44
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,190
Okay. So that way we can maintain our good water career.

45
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,690
Right. You don't want to contaminate fruit. Okay, so we need to implement water quality standards.

46
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:20,909
Water quality until it least the world for extended use allow for food, which is the national parks.

47
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,860
You have the pristine water. The water is great. And then you apply private with.

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,030
Okay. Any division. There are certain places that you're allowed to prune to a little bit, but most cases, some,

49
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:40,490
especially with the resources of the national parks, all these resources you cannot control at all.

50
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,730
You can only use the government for them. So that's the way we.

51
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,410
So we justify the Clean Water Act. Supposedly.

52
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,470
Supposedly. I'm a water in the United States.

53
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,340
Definition of the all reasonable person as required by the law.

54
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,570
Right. The Clean Water Act. Required by the law. And also that's our goal.

55
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,040
Okay. So all the work for these guys will be low quality.

56
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,580
And you also check the status of that. What do we need to do?

57
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,590
We can widen the world plenty.

58
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:30,990
So every three years, each state either also court judges authorities like the tribal areas, they have to report the one party to the.

59
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:36,280
So what do you do that you do mostly at one point and then reported it to the.

60
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:46,070
This was a stab at one point. That's how this must come from three Swedish imperial war.

61
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:56,179
But the reality is that the energy support happened more than water quality every three years.

62
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,800
But in reality, it's not always the case. It's even the monitor me.

63
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,970
Then they will come to see whether they meet the war constant or not.

64
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:14,120
And then they come out with a list of these as impure water bodies in the United States and then report that to the EPA.

65
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,620
This is bothersome status here. This is one of the reports.

66
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:34,110
In the 2000 run of the 2000. We have the new report come up but it's about a very similar is that 21,000 waters.

67
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,630
In the report about.

68
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,720
Above 40,000 TV deals and TV. Without me.

69
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,540
That means in the United States in water we have.

70
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:01,630
A large number of the water that you tell the EPA does not meet the water quality standards we set.

71
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:10,230
So based on that they could use and. A large presence has more than one cause.

72
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:25,400
Like phosphorous chemicals that. This is how the 300 miles legs about one third of the less.

73
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,670
Of the impaired water and then 210 million people knew within the mayor's office.

74
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:37,160
Want you to walk. Okay. So.

75
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,450
Or what have. The Clean Water Act defines.

76
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:49,070
We need to make our waterboarding. B The whole point is then that you.

77
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:55,300
On the other hand, we see there's a lot in power in the United States.

78
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,430
But while the case is always tense, he also wants more by those who rule.

79
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,959
For example, the rule was in this area. We have the contentions all the time.

80
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:11,480
Some people never talk about trying to contaminate our water just by.

81
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,200
So this is what happens. This is what happens.

82
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:26,190
Which also means that there's a lot of work we need to do. And the other thing is really the other piece is also about the impact on the body here.

83
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:33,809
The percentage of water impaired that you can see here in the East Coast is some area, MRGO.

84
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,610
Also most likely it's mercury contamination in the Great Lakes.

85
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:47,660
Okay. So. That means we still have a lot of work to do, but it's important in the United States.

86
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,780
And the causes sediments, nutrients, hazardous metals, dissolved oxygen.

87
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:01,690
All these reasons that cause a lot of times there's more than one cause of this impure water used.

88
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:13,930
The think about what's the source of the contamination? 40 about 50% come from the point source and, um, point sources.

89
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:22,140
Some four month points is only 40% number on it and then 10% from points only.

90
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:30,870
So what does this mean? This means that. Most of this contamination could come from someplace else.

91
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:40,140
Okay. Now point sources and number is the major reason for the content they surely wanted to show for sure.

92
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,340
But then only 10% just from the point source.

93
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:49,020
That's for. What's the what's the point of the one point sources. So about.

94
00:10:52,320 --> 00:11:00,610
One third of the water in the United States. It's difficult. Then from the sources about almost 90%.

95
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,390
The number one source of the reason for this contamination.

96
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:15,030
Agricultural talk about what is non-point is an important source that only the components of 2% of the water caused by the process contamination.

97
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:28,130
If you look at this video source for this pollution again.

98
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:39,250
Now. Sources. Agriculture. Suddenly there's industrial others overrunning us.

99
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,690
But. Municipal plant sources for agriculture is a.

100
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,120
Major reason would be coming this. Okay.

101
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:59,210
In those four points. I assure you this is fact. Of course, also a big impact will be on the news.

102
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,560
But in fact, agriculture contamination, you won't really pay attention to it.

103
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:14,660
There's much less attention, which is that this is responsible for more than 50 by one quarter of the.

104
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,930
Contamination, pollution in the United States. In the United States.

105
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:27,550
And unfortunately there's not really much we can do if of time is just.

106
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,650
If you look at these agriculture practices in the United States.

107
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:41,650
And you'll realize. Okay. Your religious populist, bring the company to the field.

108
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:51,429
They use a plane, fly the plane in areas and places they fly the plane, spread all these chemicals into the pesticides, fertilizer.

109
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:57,700
All this can get into the water and for example, nitrogen fertilizer.

110
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,080
They in the west I mean, we are in the New West is a.

111
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:11,750
I've heard you in terms of size and the the the the grunewald effect is contaminated by the footprint.

112
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,280
I mean basically contamination by this agriculture.

113
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:25,200
It contributes like 25% because with the current practice agriculture practice we use,

114
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:34,980
we rely on for maintenance with without our pesticides and heavy and chemical intensive process.

115
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,050
Okay. So with that said, now I understand what is the point of.

116
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:53,430
What point sources? As input of pollution to a war body as discrete identifiable locations.

117
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,820
If you can identify the locations of places. Just identify locations.

118
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:11,420
So this is the Korean War and how the defiance. Defined discrete events, including but not limited to any pipes, bridges, channels, tunnels,

119
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:17,570
conduce of construed, and the operation of vessels floating craft from which protein are the biggest test.

120
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:25,430
These embossed. Examples.

121
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:33,200
Talk about the example you. So you can identify the source of contamination.

122
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:40,710
But if you look at like a specific factory, like automotive or something like that, that's a point of origin that is.

123
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:47,700
You can identify right at the point of. How about the sea?

124
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:57,150
How the the building here. It depends on some else.

125
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:10,060
Just like the building itself. Yes. What's worse is because we have all these sewage system pipes.

126
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:16,810
You when you flushes of the toilet, taking a shower where this water goes.

127
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,410
What is about to go with Clinton in the face? And then distributed to the.

128
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,450
Always watching things. So that's identify the source of contamination.

129
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:35,640
Okay. That's just not very smart stimuli in the rural areas.

130
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,340
For example, you may have used septic tanks in some places.

131
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,780
Okay. So the the seizure development, that's a really.

132
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,620
44 minutes. Okay. Those information.

133
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,680
Industrial sites. Any industrial sites you have plus disposals.

134
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,000
That's poisonous. Solely the waste disposal sites of the.

135
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:16,810
If you go to the Michigan we have a quite a few of these sites are different.

136
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,930
We have some west. Down there. And then you have this if.

137
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:30,710
Discharged the letter from the. This site contains a different type of content.

138
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,590
You can then you do what you really want to see. It's not really that.

139
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:42,920
I mean, I have been to these sites myself. And that's just an identifiable source of contamination.

140
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:51,170
Let's go point sources. The other places in this country and more the operations as also point sources.

141
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,700
Was a peaceful concert of sorts,

142
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:02,110
but general agricultural practices considered important because like the nature of the concentrated annual feeding operations,

143
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,040
we have a lot of places, we have a lot of animal feeding operations.

144
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:13,390
That's a good question. So animal feed operations are not necessarily not necessarily political.

145
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:19,210
For example, you can have a small farm. You have five chicken on your farm.

146
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:25,560
That's not. Coverage for the Edmond de Gaulle is still quick, unquote.

147
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,230
The operations are not not considered anymore operations.

148
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,820
So we think about end of the operation is really concentrated anymore.

149
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:42,310
I cannot remember when that number was not. We can define maybe silence depends on the animal like the animal right outside of animal.

150
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,150
And then you can see that is a concentrated animal to operations.

151
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:53,730
So in the United States, doing the distance, we don't really replace all the animal feeding operations in terms of fuel and eggs.

152
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,940
We only regulate concentrated an operation. Okay.

153
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:09,430
That's considered poisonous. Anyone would have been happy to see that the animal feed operations the farms with lived in Iowa the past four years.

154
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,740
Of those quite a few. Okay. Anyone else for the opportunity to see that?

155
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,280
Places Chicken farm, chicken farm, dairy farm.

156
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,030
And this is hog farms. Okay. Folk farm. Okay.

157
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,990
So I have been to all these farmers. Okay.

158
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:31,599
I'll give you the other five chicken farms. Dairy farms. I've been working there.

159
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:43,540
In fact, try to to to improve the what humans process to it, to look as it was process to see what is good for them and also reduce the contamination.

160
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:50,200
For example, the first thing when you go to the annual for your operations like big farms what the what the experience.

161
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,870
The horrible smell. Horrible smell. Okay, horrible smell.

162
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:03,410
Sometime if you go to the farms like. Maybe miles away, maybe half of coral, miles away.

163
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:09,820
You already know this is so bad, right? Because that's the end of the operations.

164
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,840
Then we decide to release a lot of ammonia into the environment.

165
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,950
And then they have the smell that smells really bad.

166
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:27,700
So we have tried to work with them and by bike through the water to reduce ammonia emission and the missing emission as well.

167
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,090
So that's very good for that, for the environmental protection.

168
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:38,500
But in terms of doing the business with them, it's very difficult to do anything with them because they don't really make a lot of money either way.

169
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:44,250
They work very hard. Okay. The profit margin is not my food.

170
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:52,340
It's not I mean, if you think about all particular environments, it's not I mean, it's not they are public property, okay?

171
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:03,430
It's not really the totality. But yes, that's that's if you think about the pollution that produced as per the figures.

172
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:08,920
Okay. So again, remember, there's a lot of animal feeding operations.

173
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,410
In terms of what the point was, only the content and the operations consider the point sources or the other end of your precious resources.

174
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,900
If you have a future, could you go back? Yes. No, that's not.

175
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,409
And we'll finish with a small farms.

176
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:33,430
There is a few free range and not this, not because you don't consider annual fee increases.

177
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:39,370
The only I mean, if you walk to the movies, there's a movie I cannot remember the title of the movie.

178
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:45,790
Now, don't talk about this. This comes with animal feed operations is pretty cruel, to be honest.

179
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:52,030
But that's how we we we we need to provide the sufficient was increase the population.

180
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,390
We need to provide sufficient protein to people.

181
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:06,040
And that's the way that we. So if you look at this point, sources identify them or false.

182
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,890
If you go to the river, just look at this.

183
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:16,790
Sometimes you see these come out. That's awful. Stonework, outflows and thus pointless contamination.

184
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,300
Okay. And this is an industrial size.

185
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:26,580
This is a, I'm afraid, operations. Some wastewater treatment process, of course.

186
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,270
Industrial sites. So that's all because the. Point sources.

187
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,480
You can identify the source of contamination and source.

188
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:43,030
Okay. That's pointless. Before we talk about low point or what you think is non-point contamination.

189
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:50,950
Maybe they're in the long run of some of the runoff.

190
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,300
That's the importance of agriculture, one of us.

191
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:59,080
Not points of. Okay, diffused. You can identify the source.

192
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:08,020
So with this. Poison was contaminated.

193
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,279
You can identify them from a lot of places.

194
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:19,320
You convened them, you collect them. What can we. To reduce the pollution into the water.

195
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:31,380
What can we do to do that, to reduce the pollution if the water is treated that we know, there's no way we said we can.

196
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,340
We said we stop discharge of the pollutants.

197
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:44,760
So you cannot do that in Flushing. That's how we these systems out of our municipal development, that's how we're doing the system.

198
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:49,130
So you flushing toilets in the shower?

199
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,310
I think the industrial would take all the waste water.

200
00:22:54,130 --> 00:23:03,960
Okay. By the way, I've mentioned that in the 1800s, if you go to London or big cities, that's not really that often is not really the case.

201
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,460
People dump all this into the street, on the street or smells really bad.

202
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:17,280
But now because they see one of these is one of the really infrastructure we have in civilization is we take all these suits of the sanitation system.

203
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,210
We collect them. So that we can keep our crew safe.

204
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:27,130
Okay. So what do we do? We clear them, and then we need to retrieve them.

205
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,780
The reason we pay them is what we don't want just to kill them so that we can just descend into the river.

206
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:40,910
I this important note. That's not the reason we pay them to watch the movie.

207
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:51,040
Okay. As required in the Clean Water Act, you need to remove them before you discharge.

208
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:58,879
So that's the water quality standards required by the. But so you have to release you have to reduce the discharge that's also required.

209
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,920
We're talking about the discharge permits.

210
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,890
You have to give the permission for the discharge. And that permission,

211
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:17,930
defiance was a word quality that you can use to decide what kind of content is allowed to dictate what the Constitution allows you to set.

212
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:38,710
So again, that's. The process we have, we try to the want to talk about the ways in which we work with Watchmen.

213
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,709
Eventually, the treatment is many.

214
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:51,460
Facility proposes purification, water rescues for victims of the drinking water treatment process and treatment for the industrial applications.

215
00:24:52,180 --> 00:25:02,049
Like the semiconductor industry, they have to use very short okay to high purified water and they would either

216
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,650
treat to allow to serve as a wastewater treatment sewage treatment process.

217
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:19,670
So. Okay. In the United States records publicly owned children's books.

218
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:31,110
The best glue with which a member of the lamb would define the war against the public good Old Testament to works.

219
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,430
As was wastewater treatment plants. We have about 16,000.

220
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,910
Arun. A number of cities are probably owned Sherman Oaks,

221
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:49,010
Detroit effects Detroit in the Detroit area which have one of the biggest in the world and the wastewater treatment plant.

222
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:58,900
We crack the. They take the wastewater sewage from the residential area, commercial building,

223
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,840
the industrial facilities as well, and then we choose them and remove them.

224
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:09,510
Okay. And then to the west will remove them and we'll have it so they don't have to reuse them.

225
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:17,150
We'll talk about all these processes. We remove that organic matter sediments, grease oil substitutions.

226
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,170
Whatever you think about. We tried to remove them. To remove them.

227
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,850
In the Clean Water Act. Initially we just handed back a bottle of gin demand.

228
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:35,210
What is biological to demand? What biological demands stand for.

229
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,770
If its high ability indicator indicators higher.

230
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:52,760
Lots of bacteria view the beauty ballot always in demand due to the high, high volume.

231
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,300
What it means there's a higher tendency to.

232
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:03,790
Technological and biological tension over demand and.

233
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:23,120
So. Higher body demand usually means that there is a lot there is a lot of fermentation.

234
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:34,060
A process where it was the oxygen tank of the company.

235
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:40,870
Okay. So what kind of major contaminants would have in the wastewater in a sewage?

236
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:51,980
Fecal matter. Fecal matter? Organic matter.

237
00:27:52,580 --> 00:28:00,170
Organic matter demand bodies therefore emitted organic matter.

238
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,850
In a serious think about organic matters.

239
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:14,270
One of the major source of the major contaminants in this in the west water is again in the fish are use the food.

240
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,370
All this without him is a thing.

241
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:27,090
We get into the wastewater treatment process and that is there you have a high concentration of organic matter would cause a problem.

242
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:30,320
One of the problems of is be eutrophication.

243
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,810
Okay. As a takeover of groundwater,

244
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:42,240
does organic matter promote the growth of all these organisms and then use all the oxygen in the water and there's more less inhabitable.

245
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,340
Okay. So that's beauty.

246
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,120
See, we did the very similar to the beauty.

247
00:28:51,840 --> 00:29:00,480
For the first time we test, we use all the volunteers as the with the organ, no matter what the condition of getting mad in the what.

248
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,620
Beauty is in your body. Great game matters, but that's indicative of matters.

249
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,089
So and this has been a solid federal control bacteria that's conventionally a

250
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:16,230
protein that we are targeting from the first phase with with what you neglect.

251
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:32,919
But then we add a lot of content as to that. So this is how we chew the water out.

252
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:40,990
You're always water. So we first we collect the water from the from the different sides in the different areas.

253
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:50,020
And then we bring them to the wastewater treatment plant, and then we'll do the screening at the ceremony as a primary treatment as the second.

254
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,960
And then we have the second treatment and then we have the some of the potential treatment.

255
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,540
And then we also have a slight remove, slightly more.

256
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:08,290
I will go into the details. I would show you a very large map details. These are solar system.

257
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:20,620
In the city. If you if you pay attention on the street, sometimes you will see these cover there, the iron covers there.

258
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,110
That's a solar system. That's the solar system.

259
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:41,670
We know every morning we go to the opening of the memo's open call in the case of law firm zero.

260
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,350
So you see, Impeach Bourdieu on the streets of a distance.

261
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:51,450
You'll see that cover there for the manhole as the sewage system surfaces.

262
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:54,990
Then they have two, two different types of soil. Three type of difference to sewage system.

263
00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,389
Why the sanitary sewer system that's like from Friday the tornado this come to to

264
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:04,950
the to the to this to the pipes we also have the storm source system to stormwater.

265
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:12,320
So sometimes they have combines, they use the same piping system pipes underground.

266
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:19,200
So they do give us the most of that. We also have a separate sanitary sewer system or the.

267
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:22,730
And so some sources them.

268
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,920
But in the old building the old development we have combined source system.

269
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,120
So basically all the fuss, the toilets flashing all this.

270
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,559
They traveled together with the storm water.

271
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:42,400
You have the heavy rain, all this trouble to get it in anywhere fast because the combined solar system would carry the water from there.

272
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:54,459
We have the inflow. For example, here you have the. From home with flush and then the pipes and sometimes the broken pipes.

273
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,270
All these pipes here. They can have some infiltration then to restore.

274
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,440
And then we have the stone wall so they can come.

275
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:08,979
Sometimes they have to come by the pipes and even sometimes with heavy cracks, broken pipes, these folks on the ground for a long time.

276
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:14,469
And you have a lot of issues with that. But that is so that's what is manholes used.

277
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,090
Sometimes families get access to these pipes so they can fix it.

278
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,760
Sometimes you need to fix them. How to fix it. That's how we take the.

279
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,920
Okay. You can imagine now in the building in the in the city development.

280
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,240
You have a very complex system. Okay.

281
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:36,390
Now, very obviously, a lot of times we don't know where these pipes are.

282
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,910
Right. So you don't really know where the broken pipes are.

283
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:44,360
All these pipes and no mention the drinking water pipes.

284
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:49,010
And drinking water pipes, we don't know. But now with wastewater sometimes just don't know where the pipes up.

285
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:53,070
It's kind of like maze underground. Okay.

286
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,140
All these pipes. So we use pipes.

287
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,219
Took the water to the west where to implant multiple cases.

288
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:09,620
We use gravity. So this types of relatively speaking pretty deep underground.

289
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:17,570
So use a gravity like from when you flush the toilet, the whistle gets the pipes, but we use black.

290
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,440
So when you would go to the wastewater treatment plant.

291
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:27,930
Most of the time we're getting the door enabled at some place, not in the modern era.

292
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:35,480
Hi. Do you want to. Yes. On high such high prices by the was.

293
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:43,810
What would you do with that. None of these. The reason for that, we'll try to use gravity to move the water on these pipes.

294
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:48,730
And then if this new grab does not work, then you have to use pumps.

295
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:58,210
These are pumps. Let's take a quick break and then we'll talk about how do we treat them?

296
00:33:58,810 --> 00:35:54,850
How do we show that? Anyway, that's what's interesting.

297
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,139
Okay. So where's Waldo?

298
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:54,470
We're taking everything you can think of. If you see the work when it arrives in the West virtual plant.

299
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:59,680
It looks pretty bad, but that smells bad.

300
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:11,770
Also, you can imagine Dick Cheney's office and I think the operators in the West, which I'm glad I can tell you what they see.

301
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:19,440
I mean, you see some of them also. But in fact, on the matter of fact, 99%, 99.9% are still what?

302
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:26,970
Okay. I still worry that we do have all these stories,

303
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:34,460
different kind of stories about this as they were 1% of the science coming through and then a mike always seems angry.

304
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:41,560
Okay. Angry. So that's make it quite challenging.

305
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,920
Think about this because the large portion.

306
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:53,180
99.9% of water, you need to remove like 0.1% of the salt.

307
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,670
All this. The other performance, this.

308
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:09,600
The only high damage so that's make it to work is not easier to do I mean to be if it is like 50% this is very easy to do but this is not.

309
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:16,450
Um, organic matters. We have all different kinds of organic matter in the water.

310
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:20,920
The major, one of the major source of organic. I try to remove them and I plan on em.

311
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,990
Think about in the kitchen, um, in food restaurants.

312
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:31,060
So all this organic matter of getting to the water matter by the beauty and the seaweed.

313
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,600
Okay, again, this is how we will choose them.

314
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,520
We have four major steps. Okay, four major steps.

315
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:46,160
Remember this? Four major steps. One of these, quote, primary preemie treatments.

316
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,350
But you cannot get the water all to the to the pump station here.

317
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:56,480
And then you pump it up to the to the treatment process.

318
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:01,520
We have the primary treatment called Primary Stephanie, and the screening.

319
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:06,290
And the primary said only as a first step.

320
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:16,160
Just a big front tank. And then neither one of them get through them still down the the the the flow and then all these big items.

321
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,300
So instead of all stone, you yourself out to the bottom.

322
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:26,620
And those are some of the floating to the top. That's her primary duty as a primary treatment.

323
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:36,280
And then when they renew the second tank and then pump to the second instruments.

324
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,810
Secondly, treatments we normally use biological treatment process.

325
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,910
But through the process, I use Michael Williams to digest all game matters.

326
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:56,120
Okay. We pump all this oxygen air so that it can improve,

327
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,290
provide the altitude in the water through the microwave ovens use the object to

328
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:05,930
digest is organic method of that it will have another secondary set on a tank.

329
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,660
Let's try to remove all this excessive growth of organisms in the water.

330
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:16,100
You. Okay.

331
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:23,819
And then that the so-called tertiary treatment or disaffection take or treatment can

332
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:31,870
remove the the the the remaining peasants in the water or some additional treatment.

333
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:36,960
And that would remove first was likely some of the specific contaminants in the water.

334
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:44,010
But here for the ones we remove that is tried to remove the presence during this process.

335
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,720
During this process, we create a lot of sludge.

336
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:54,920
So. Okay. From the premise that the new tank from the security state learning tank.

337
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:59,080
What if it uses again. These solid tumors.

338
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:05,560
Don't forget about this state. At the wastewater treatment process.

339
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:10,330
Now, yes, we remove this from the water discharge. That's not end of the walk.

340
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:17,350
Okay. You are not complete. Yes, because we do have a lot of solid teeth.

341
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,090
From the boats to the new tanks. And this has to be treated.

342
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,140
Okay. We'll talk. Took a hobby, which is great. But this has to be treated.

343
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:36,190
So think about this. We have all the West sonnets for this.

344
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,750
Some of these degraded by our biological process. Organic matter degraded.

345
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:45,820
Great. But now we have all the sodium. Now you can change them.

346
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:53,310
So in the bottom line kingdom. That's a critical part of the treatment process.

347
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:02,970
Okay. You haven't seen it. Whether? When they put them like that, you just separate them from the water.

348
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,420
You cannot just dump anywhere. But I have to admit.

349
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:11,010
So that's the four major steps. Okay.

350
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:17,770
Four major steps. Primary treatments, secondary treatments, tertiary instruments, all of the disinfection.

351
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,720
And then this is Tony's treatment. Okay.

352
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:25,260
Starting the treatment as the first major step in the treatment process.

353
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:36,400
So let's go through the each step just to look at how do we work, what do we remove was a major goal to remove these contaminants for each space.

354
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:44,260
So primary waste for human process to remove insoluble like grease grease trash objects because the all these different tests,

355
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:49,270
some people probably just dump everything to the sink as long as they're practice

356
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:53,409
because that's everything you dump there it'll get into the wastewater treatment.

357
00:42:53,410 --> 00:43:01,750
Replace, grease remove. And then primary sedimentation posted about through the authorities.

358
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,410
So, for example, when you receive the wastewater here, these are screened.

359
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:22,859
They have. And then. His group moves as well the grab I was not all game to settle out so this how we remove first step is primary treatment and

360
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:31,800
to remove this big large objects and then we have this the primary clarifier and then this is again is probably Q5 tank.

361
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:41,130
So some of them could very be because depending on the capacity how much water you treat, you may have some run them in parallel.

362
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:48,660
Okay. You get on the, the, the, the size of the and the amount of the wastewater water you receive.

363
00:43:49,080 --> 00:44:00,450
You may need to put this several of this clarifies in parallel this how long and then most of the time the water stay here for one 2 hours.

364
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:05,580
Okay. One, 2 hours. Just let this slow down.

365
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:09,600
So that's the oldest set of all objects of through object.

366
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,620
I've got the bottom and they have a square. The square.

367
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,820
So this is what we will see that we'll see in the wastewater treatment plant.

368
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:26,569
Okay. Primary qualifier. And the water comes from the Efron's boat, primarily effort from the west.

369
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:33,540
What you can come this quote from evidence of this the word come out from here the word becomes an cleaner.

370
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:38,600
But just because there are contaminants and then they put the secondary west, much of it.

371
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:47,200
Okay. The major purpose for the security of instruments is to remove all gang members.

372
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:54,610
Okay. When we set up first brought up, this was the alternative.

373
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:59,150
The primary source primarily contaminated a lot of. Okay.

374
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,500
Because I do.

375
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:14,680
They do cause of world problems, but otherwise the work they receive in World War II is your fight, and there is no opposition to the war.

376
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:23,410
That's really bad. Okay. As a photographer just across the river, we see the corner of Five Oaks in there.

377
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:30,220
So all these if they come out. Oil floating on the surface that qualified.

378
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:34,800
That's all that matters. We have the different ways.

379
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:47,690
We most of the time, we use this to use the microorganisms and oxygen and exercise even nowadays is still the best process.

380
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:53,440
What is accurate is that it's basically you use microwaves plus oxygen.

381
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:59,450
So they're working together to remove organic methods. Okay.

382
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:06,000
They want to get the removal given. I just mentioned the water process, the water wastewater.

383
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:16,370
99.9% are still water. All of this is sort of a silver story in the water is very tiny, probably a percentage.

384
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:27,190
You need to remove that. It's not easy. So the most efficient way, if I were using my opponents, they would digest or get amendments.

385
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:31,690
They will work for you. But I just want what they need.

386
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:38,290
They need it. Then object to oxidize this organic mechanism.

387
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:44,469
This is a ballad, a true image of a relation. Take it easy.

388
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:47,620
The Impala has too many tanks. So what happens? Defense.

389
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:51,190
Dave, you're here. I see the bubbles come up. This is crazy.

390
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:55,000
So we publish the ale from the bottom. Into the war.

391
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,380
So basically increased concentration of oxy in the process.

392
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:03,470
So the model you can use out to remove the badges.

393
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:08,740
Okay. Okay. So that's the collaboration tank.

394
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:15,110
This is the process. It is the process of getting the matters becomes biomass.

395
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:19,709
Poor part of them becomes the CO2. They become.

396
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:25,580
The CO2 is this is organic matter. So whether organic matter goes goes to CO2 involvement,

397
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:38,400
Obama's we have the stated intent clarifies that this is activist led activities that we auction some of them where we turn to the true process.

398
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:43,080
To inoculate. Okay.

399
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:50,620
A small portion of that where we can put them back to the to the process here.

400
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:57,430
So this is such a little bit where we think back to here of the prime influence.

401
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:03,069
The reason for that, this process that we didn't really have all the problems that we need for them to work.

402
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:10,640
Right. So here this microphone has especially back here my microwave how be used to already to digest is again matters.

403
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:16,520
So now we need a small portion to read you locally to the system. The system.

404
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:20,730
Risk in the system. Welcome.

405
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:35,830
So again, this is a some of them will use anaerobic digestion, so will produce methane and the CO2.

406
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:42,960
This methane can be collected to use to do this. Okay.

407
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:56,190
So this is where the old game goes. We use biological system process and this is how the the, the, the game and it goes with oxygen with all this.

408
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,870
Probably about 40%.

409
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,390
Becomes CO2, just the CO2. Move out.

410
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:14,630
Okay, move out. Released into the area. And then we have still a large portion becomes the new field.

411
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:21,720
So the bacteria, when they do that device, they take the organ and they divide it, grow and divide the component.

412
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:26,520
So they don't have a large number of the organic matter are still in the water.

413
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:35,550
Okay. My dad was doing the water and then I see the biomass is the sales.

414
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:38,910
So what do you do when you're starting to separate from the water? Otherwise, still.

415
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,950
So you're possessive. So we need to limit themselves on. Okay.

416
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:51,560
That's the reason. That's the reason. We have the second here to slow down to the bottom and remove.

417
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:58,290
So because biomass about 60% is 40% from our.

418
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:02,340
And so we need to sell autonomy to the to the bottom so we can remove them.

419
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,360
That's how we do. And this is the aeration. Thank you.

420
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:14,580
This is the second to clarify. We have and then you can see this is biomass or these biomass that we tried to I to get.

421
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:23,600
Then the cancel down to the bottom they can remove them. A lot of press is, in fact, for the sake of achievement as the DA dealt with the DA.

422
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,380
Okay, just 1/2. The chairman, they've done with the job.

423
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:35,990
So what it looks like here, if you look at here beauty, for example, we start probably with 200.

424
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,830
And then after we do this up left.

425
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:44,330
So you remove a large portion. Okay.

426
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,480
Almost 90% of the organic matter being removed.

427
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:57,460
Okay. I've been removed but a solid you remove quite a lot of slowness and this is when you start exposing them to a lot of suspended solids.

428
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:04,920
But the organic matters you remove. A study of about 90, almost 90% of.

429
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:12,530
A all game out of Iowa. Look at how you remote. And then your instrument.

430
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:20,980
We have no tissue to process the sick in the treatment. Secondly, treatment is to remove or then use biological to move again.

431
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:24,690
And they'll have a tertiary system.

432
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:33,750
So to remove additional phosphorus, nitrogen, bacterial pathogens, metals, organisms depend on sort of like something in what we've seen above.

433
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:39,130
So they can remove them. And this is a pass through the Treasury representative filters.

434
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,840
It's one of the things you tune process center filters.

435
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:48,469
And then this is again, we use disinfection. To kill the president.

436
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:55,440
That's the pleasure of it. Okay. There's some crazy that keeps some of the worst, which would give them the kind of competition for.

437
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,340
I don't have either time. But now, yes, most president,

438
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:09,430
you have to have a position because this president come out and also the the additional remove of the nitrogen, that's a requirement.

439
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:15,130
You have to use technology to remove them. So in Ann Arbor we used to use Corey.

440
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:18,820
This is what we talk about. Use Corey. Corey.

441
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:25,200
The disinfectant is one of the effective gas used to disinfect drinking water.

442
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:36,180
We use waste water. We also use Corey. But the Corey one coming this fall, quite a large amount, huge amount of ice that's the highest.

443
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:44,940
So it's like a lot of complaints from the neighborhood about that. The other is really the and the Corey reaction was all done with produce a smells.

444
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:49,510
I don't know. Have you been to that location? Nope.

445
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:56,020
So that vacation is part of the reason for me getting all the way to the east.

446
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:59,080
You'll see that place pretty nice. I mean, we joke.

447
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:06,030
That's a very nice post. You can use that. I do jog there every week.

448
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:10,300
Every week? Once a week. That's very nice place.

449
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:18,430
But then you go to West Virginia and sometimes in the pub there's a little bit snails there, but it is much better than before, but still.

450
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:23,489
Okay. So that's one of the reasons the switch from the chlorine disinfectant to you,

451
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:29,410
which is a virtue because you is a relatively safe and also pretty effective through this.

452
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:41,139
The problem with that is cost because that you've you've had the costs pretty high when you tried to use that to generate

453
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:48,910
that you realize to use electricity and compared to the car is much cheaper and then the movie's more expensive.

454
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:57,190
So it was a half of the budgets used to provide the electricity to power in the arbor.

455
00:53:57,370 --> 00:54:00,980
And one of the reasons is because the usage is effectively using.

456
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:10,319
So for disinfection we can use make Korea ozone or duvet disinfection a different decision by using most

457
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:16,440
of the places most of the players are still used in the United States still use chlorine and the UV.

458
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:24,680
Yes we have been using UV. Abbott was which in fact. So whether you discharge the warrant.

459
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:36,020
So whether we decide the water of the chimneys through the new status which is heading to the receiver of all rivers.

460
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:42,410
Right. Of some places they use this to water the golf course.

461
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:51,070
Okay. That's a good way to do it. And some places, for example, in Canada, they used to produce the artificial slope.

462
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:58,310
Okay. It's just the water effects of relieve the water.

463
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:04,460
And obviously here we test all these to 1.2 parameters and some some of them it's much better than we reward.

464
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:16,900
Okay. Then we walk. We'll go back come back to this sludge again, a solid treatment.

465
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:22,060
Okay. The storage is the most one of the critical component of the treatment process.

466
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:25,510
Once again, that's okay. Solely the treatment.

467
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:30,890
The story I just mentioned from the primary primary care file from the activist process.

468
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,870
But there is much the story is still down to the bottom of the crater.

469
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:38,880
You have to. Okay. You have a trinity.

470
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:44,100
But the issue with that is, in fact every this.

471
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:50,880
So you sit on the quite like I'm on 100% from the water.

472
00:55:51,990 --> 00:56:01,080
So the first process that you need to do, you have to remove the one. From this life and then we use different process for that.

473
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:09,610
The anaerobic digestion, this again manages obviously the biomass producing the secondary treatment is other biomass bactericidal.

474
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:13,890
Okay. So we need to remove them from the water. How do we do that?

475
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,510
We use some anaerobic digestion.

476
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:27,160
Basically, you digest them, kill them, digest the organic matters, and then they produce CO2 or for methane or CO2, they thousand.

477
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:36,660
We are someone who also uses anaerobic digestion and the other features, some of that, some of die dry.

478
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:44,469
This is how we treat this conditioning. Secrete the watery stabilization or dispose that you use.

479
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:54,700
Okay. This is for them the process we do. This is like huge thing for you to have with which want to remove the water and this is anaerobic digestion

480
00:56:55,060 --> 00:57:02,410
and then the sometimes allow place can bring them to the file up to use we use to bring them to the farm.

481
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:08,049
I will do that during the winter, sometime this summer.

482
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:11,530
And then all of this for you, the benefits. Okay.

483
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:15,730
This is how they will process the fuel that fuels.

484
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:21,450
Imagine this. Okay. From here. From the water.

485
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:25,880
It's great fun from this sludge from this night. You have all positive.

486
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:34,560
Okay. And the culture of some West Aussies there. So there's a lot of concerns, environmental concerns that when you apply this to the.

487
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:45,610
Meant as a footnote of the that the farm like back in the day you can use it as a footnote that they can also use that to stabilize it slowly.

488
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:52,940
By then. One of the one of the challenges we have here is because the content is committed to

489
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:59,470
waste some heavy metals hazards that could become the potential hazards to the workers,

490
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,870
but also become the other locally sourced from more pollution.

491
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:09,930
Think about this, what we can conjure them together. And now you're putting them men and they go through what?

492
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:14,920
I get separated from the world now. You cut back to the left and you go back to what I.

493
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:23,260
But the the process and the the. The by the.

494
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,690
Otherwise you program airfields. Okay.

495
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:35,150
So every week, sometimes from where I was watching them, for example, when they took all these, they were just transported that to the Mansfield.

496
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:40,370
Thumbs. So we're kind of separate from the water.

497
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:49,330
And they were pretty somewhere. Okay. And some of them we use as a non application.

498
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:59,830
Mean just then that application for that purpose. If you think about all these West which are in process for the water here.

499
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:08,000
This is a typical. It is a typical wastewater treatment process.

500
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:15,320
Okay. Jim was watching the process. Anyone can think of issues with this.

501
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:21,490
It's great. We have you've done a fantastic job. Okay to protect our water.

502
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,200
Okay. That's the sanitation system. We have all the sewage.

503
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:33,630
Now get through them. And then we decided to the water to protect our water.

504
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:39,680
Any other issues you can think about and you should think about it.

505
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:52,380
There's a lot of things that are required to be tested for when they are treated.

506
00:59:52,380 --> 01:00:00,180
So to our understanding, the letters safe to discharge, but that might actually be the case.

507
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:06,360
Okay. So first, think about the.

508
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:26,520
What would produce a severe. To see what you went you to talk about CO2, whether CO2 has.

509
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:34,560
Greenhouse gas. Further reduce the produce class in a small area.

510
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:38,870
Write their produce pretty high comes you seem to.

511
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:51,050
Okay. So can we find out other ways for them when you send a jury to see what you did, says, can we have steps,

512
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:56,780
we can produce a more methane and we use our energy source the venue to it as we get together.

513
01:00:57,110 --> 01:01:00,110
Now, for the West, what you process the effects.

514
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:05,390
Why is it you can't walk in the winter in the low temperature this year, walking in winter?

515
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:17,060
Because all these factors in this this this station that produce heat directly through the water in the West Germany, it's pretty high temperature.

516
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,820
Whoa. Okay, so they produce the CO2, and sometimes they produce the heat.

517
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:27,320
Okay, so if you can't recover, that would be waste.

518
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:34,850
And that's because CO2 has a big footprint there in terms of the the the switching process.

519
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:39,950
And also use a lot of energy use a lot of energy for this.

520
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:46,460
But can we use them? For example, if people think about how we use them to generate seed?

521
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:55,940
We have the organic matter there. Let's try to use the process which generates images from across the whole game as the one of our game.

522
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:03,220
And we try to get rid of them. We can try to produce CO2, produce energy, produce electricity from that.

523
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:07,150
So that also they do try to take advantage of this process. You can.

524
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:13,400
So it's not just waste. Yes, it's waste water, but it is resources here.

525
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:19,400
Okay. Marginal fertilizer you can use if we can use it the way that we could.

526
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:23,640
Way as fertilizer. Or get your man.

527
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:28,160
Yes, I'm great, man. We use you can deliver electricity power from.

528
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:34,950
Okay. How is the energy from it, from the process?

529
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:39,350
So this research ongoing, it's not just the Western European process, okay?

530
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,320
It's obviously Hungary right now trying to recover the resources from that.

531
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:53,820
Okay. This study also tried to not try to separate the urine collection system with fecal material because the

532
01:02:53,820 --> 01:03:01,230
urine effects can be used as resources and also because they also generate a lot of issues down the stream.

533
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:10,620
You have to have a very large footprint with octuplet effects to occupy quite a large area in the city for that process.

534
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:16,760
So you can you can probably shoot that to the one third of the required space.

535
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:23,880
If we separate the urine collection system from the. But now with cages that we have, it's very difficult to do it right.

536
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:34,580
And with with the infrastructure we have. Another thing we have to clarify somehow what it is for the West.

537
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:42,130
Watch them and they will take them. Now we can use that as an indication of the health service of the communities.

538
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:52,239
So think about when you go to some of the good doctors free clinics because the urine

539
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:57,880
samples people materials to tested all of you may have this set up as a symptom.

540
01:03:58,090 --> 01:04:01,240
We have to get out with a blood test, urine test.

541
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:10,390
So when I take all this together, as long as you buy for that, by then, you'll be able to evaluate the state of health efforts.

542
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:15,570
Of the community. So kind of like that.

543
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:19,360
So there's a lot of things you can you can do with wastewater.

544
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:27,920
This the system, the infrastructure has been very useful to improve public health, particularly environment dramatically.

545
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:32,600
But just what can we do? Make it a better. Okay.

546
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,700
What can we do to make it better? So we still need them? We still need the.

547
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:48,840
Okay. So what is their will be this year in the US and there will Google wastewater implants if you need some special conditioner, you know.

548
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:54,960
Okay, otherwise I would drive it. Okay. I'll see you on Monday.

549
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:58,110
Thank you.
