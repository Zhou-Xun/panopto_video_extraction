1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
But we're going to go ahead and do that. So welcome, everybody. You're welcome.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,850
Back from the break. I hope you all had a very nice and ideally very relaxing Thanksgiving.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:14,729
It looks like maybe some of us were so relaxed we forgot to come back to class on the Monday after.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,020
Maybe folks will trickle in.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:25,350
So it's hard to believe, but we're now down to our second to last lecture, which is probably a feeling of relief for for all of us.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:35,790
So we've got non-ionizing radiation today. And then on next Monday, we're going to move to our final topic, which is thermal and cold stress.

7
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:46,200
Maybe I'll just put in a quick plug here at the start. So as a reminder, the thermal exposure assessment activity is due next Monday afternoon.

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,800
So please make sure to get that in your class.

9
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:59,970
That was going to be. Heat and cold stress that was to be related to the topic that we have to the excitement for next year.

10
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,110
Yeah. So basically here I can go ahead and pull up the website here.

11
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,490
It's a great question, Velma.

12
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:15,420
So, you know, looking at our assignments here, the thermal exposure assessment, so you guys already completed the exposure activity log.

13
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,910
That was what you turned in basically in the first week of class.

14
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:25,709
And so the thermal exposure assessment assignment is going to involve you all reviewing what happened to you all the way back

15
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:34,530
in September and essentially applying what we're going to learn about with regards to how we handle and measure heat stress.

16
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,100
And we will and you'll be uploading basically your interpretations of what happened to you.

17
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:48,690
So one thing I'll highlight and I'll mention this again when the assignment is actually do is, you know,

18
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,800
you all live to that day that you recorded in terms of your activity log,

19
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,080
but inevitably you're going to be like, what did I mean when I wrote this particular entry down?

20
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,860
And so it's a good example of just how difficult it is for people to recall.

21
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,420
And even if you've got a diary kept on that same day, it can be tough to to sort of interpret that.

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,040
But really the goal here with this particular assignment is for you to take those values that

23
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,040
you were exposed to and figure out where you anywhere close to the TLB for heat stress that day.

24
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,389
It's a great question. All right.

25
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:30,660
So today we have what is full disclosure, easily my least favorite topic of physical hazards, which is non-ionizing radiation.

26
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,680
And I think I told you all maybe at the very first lecture, but I'll just repeat it.

27
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:42,000
When I sat for the certified industrial hygienist exam, I was like, Wow, this is really too much to learn.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,100
I got to start cutting some topics that I'm just never going to focus on. And I was like, not ionizing radiation.

29
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:53,640
Is that even a thing? I don't need to study that. And so I was able to just barely scrape through that section and pass the test.

30
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,910
And now, of course, as penance for my blowing off this entire discipline, I find myself teaching it every year.

31
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:07,020
So we are going to focus on that. And I think radiation and there are some interesting aspects to it, I shouldn't completely toss it under the bus.

32
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,809
But basically what we're going to talk about today are a number of different kind of subtypes of non-ionizing radiation.

33
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,150
So we'll start out with the sort of lowest frequency stuff which we call sub radio frequency,

34
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:25,080
and then we're going to steadily move up the electromagnetic spectrum or the non-ionizing portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

35
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,680
So we'll talk about radio frequency and microwaves and ultimately get to optical radiation and lasers.

36
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,499
So, you know, this is going to be a pretty high level review of each of these.

37
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,090
Some topics we're going to talk about kind of some of the fundamentals that you need to know about these.

38
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:48,600
We'll also talk about the health effects and of course, very importantly, the control strategies that we can implement if we do have a problem.

39
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:59,040
And maybe by way of a little bit of further disclaimer here, I'll say, you know, for for many of the topics that we've touched on in this class noise,

40
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,249
especially the heat stress also and potentially whole body vibration and maybe ionizing radiation,

41
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,740
there's a chance that you're going to sort of interact with or have some responsibility for those things in your career.

42
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:21,270
Again, full disclosure, in my experience, most hygienists aren't really going to deal with non ionizing radiation in the workplace and very few people

43
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,559
who are sort of general DHS practitioners are probably going to get involved in these topics as well.

44
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,040
So I introduce them to you. Just so you know, this hazard is out there,

45
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,310
but this is probably the one that I think the fewest of you will have any opportunity to kind of engage with professionally.

46
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:46,200
Yeah. Patrick Do we normally leave those kind of frequencies to physicists and astronomers that like,

47
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,330
measure like and just normal physics in general or like detect gravitational waves and stuff like that?

48
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,889
Great question. So there are certainly disciplines that focus on these.

49
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,690
And so, you know, astronomers use some of these frequencies for space exploration and sensing.

50
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:08,910
Absolutely. So those folks are responsible for kind of designing the the big telescopes and interpreting the signals.

51
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:16,739
The health and safety role here is just essentially to make sure that when we're doing that, sensing, we're not putting people's health at risk.

52
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,190
So they're kind of responsible for the instruments they design them.

53
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,270
And our job is just to say, okay, this instrument's in play now.

54
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:30,150
Does it present any health risk either to the workers or potentially to the general public as well?

55
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:36,959
So, you know, like with ionizing radiation, where if you've got a problem of any magnitude,

56
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,650
you're going to want to get a certified physicist in there because that's what they do.

57
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,910
There's not really an equivalent health physicist for non-ionizing radiation.

58
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:51,210
So it will often, if you are involved in this stuff, are going to be you working directly with sort of the experts who,

59
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,959
you know, will know way more about non-ionizing radiation, about you.

60
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,560
But on the flip side, probably don't know anything about the health impacts of it.

61
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,309
Does that answer your question? Yeah. Yeah, I did follow up and answer that. Okay, perfect.

62
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,550
Yeah. If I ramble long enough, I can answer most any question.

63
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,530
So, you know, before we dive into exposure to non-ionizing radiation,

64
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:21,359
I'll just highlight a very special part of our country that actually doesn't have cell or wi fi signals in it.

65
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,860
And so all of us are being bombarded all day long with 5G and 4G and wi fi and other electromagnetic frequencies.

66
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,160
And that's actually fine.

67
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,100
We don't think and we'll talk about this, but generally we don't think there's any adverse health impacts associated with that.

68
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,690
But to come back to Patrick's question, those waves, while they may not be harming our health,

69
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:49,500
can wreak havoc on sensors that are trying to look in that particular frequency for, you know, life in space, for instance.

70
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,620
And so back in 1958, the federal government established the National Radio Quiet Zone.

71
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,200
And so this is a 13,000 square mile area that's primarily in West Virginia,

72
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,220
but a little corner of it is in Virginia and another little corner in Maryland.

73
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,510
And basically, if you get into this 13,000 square mile zone, there's no cell service, there's no wi fi.

74
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:18,389
There's one low frequency radio station. And it's one of the few places in the U.S. where you can go in.

75
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:23,570
There are still old school. Old telephone booths because people are still talking on landlines.

76
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,190
So kind of a anachronistic thing to contemplate here.

77
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,030
But basically when the National Radio Astronomy Observatory was set up,

78
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:39,259
so this is the Roberts Seabird Telescope, the world's largest, as you can see, fully steerable radio telescope.

79
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,530
And in fact, the dish of this thing is two acres in the area.

80
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:50,870
So this is enormous, represents a huge investment, of course, in terms of dollars, you know, taller than the Washington Monument.

81
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,899
So when this thing was built, the government realized we are looking for very minor signals in outer space.

82
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:03,979
And if someone's, you know, this was built back long before wi fi and 5G were invented,

83
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:10,100
but if someone's got a radio station nearby that's totally overwhelmed, these very minor signals we're looking for in space.

84
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:18,560
So we need to create a zone that's going to protect this antenna from picking up, you know, someone listening to AM Radio.

85
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:29,089
And so, as I said, we've got this pretty enormous 13,000 square mile facility here with people who actually live inside this area.

86
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,100
So there's a couple of towns in here.

87
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,629
And again, it's kind of unusual in that you go into this area and you start to see signs like, of course, authorized vehicles only.

88
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:44,540
Nothing special about that. But gosh, you're entering now this specific zone around the instruments.

89
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:50,540
So you can't use vehicles that use spark plugs, for instance.

90
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,579
You have to use a diesel vehicle because spark plugs create their own electromagnetic energy,

91
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:03,379
whereas diesel just works on compression, basically, you know, no portable electronics don't leave or installing the equipment here.

92
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:12,710
So pretty serious stuff. Again, all designed to make us as able as we are to to sense what's coming in from outer space.

93
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,440
So it's kind of an interesting thought like, wow,

94
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:22,459
I'm living in an area that is essentially stuck in the 1950s in terms of technology, and that may appeal to some.

95
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,970
But I suspect for many of us in the room, that would be, you know, like [INAUDIBLE] on earth,

96
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,600
not having wi fi and 5G and the Internet and Instagram and so forth.

97
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:39,739
Maybe I'm projecting apologies. So that's just one example where the government kind of foresaw this issue of, you know,

98
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:45,649
increasingly crowded electromagnetic frequencies and spectrum and carved out a bunch of land to say,

99
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:50,120
hey, we're going to dedicate this to, for instance, deep space exploration.

100
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:59,530
So I've already talked about kind of the we'll say the the bands of non-ionizing radiation frequencies that we're going to cover today.

101
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,620
I mentioned optical radiation already is a broad category.

102
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:10,899
We even subdivide that further into wavelengths of infrared visible light and ultraviolet light.

103
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:16,570
And as I said, we'll talk about lasers as kind of their own special category at the very end of class.

104
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,850
When I first started my career, right after my master's degree,

105
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,540
I was working for a consulting group at the University of Washington that did

106
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,099
essentially free consulting for small and medium businesses in Washington State.

107
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,239
It was a great job, but occasionally people would get our number and be like, Oh, free consulting.

108
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,990
I have a question. And the question that we got most often and all of us would be like,

109
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,709
I think you need to take this call would be people calling in and saying they just put

110
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,700
in a new streetlight across the street and now it's it's doing mind control on me.

111
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:53,230
And so I think of all the physical hazards. This one is most tightly wound in with conspiracy theories about mind control.

112
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,220
Or, you know, the government is scanning your brain somehow.

113
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:05,680
And, you know, it's it's maybe not hard to imagine for someone who doesn't have an education in this area but is prone to conspiracy theories,

114
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,030
you know, why wouldn't the government have a raid that's going to, you know, program my mind to do things I don't want to?

115
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,170
And I will say, if this is in fact the case, typically a tinfoil hat is not going to be the solution that we're looking for.

116
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,180
We'll talk about that a little more as we go to.

117
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:27,950
So whenever we're talking about non ionizing radiation, we're on the electromagnetic spectrum and we've looked at this previously.

118
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,659
You know, I'll show you a detailed figure here in a few minutes.

119
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:38,470
But basically, you know, we're talking about just like with ionizing radiation, the transfer of energy at the speed of light.

120
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,200
And as that energy is moving, it's creating both an electric and a magnetic field.

121
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,269
And so we're talking about an electromagnetic wave that propagates out through space.

122
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:56,979
And so that wave can be subdivided into an electric field that's going to be orthogonal to the magnetic field.

123
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:04,690
So whenever we got an electric field, we're going to have a corresponding magnetic field and it's going to be essentially 90 degrees off axis there.

124
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,270
So this complicates things because when we're considering non-ionizing radiation,

125
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:17,049
we need to think about both the electrical field and the magnetic field and the different impacts that those might have on our health,

126
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:23,050
which we'll talk about. First, though, you know, when we're talking about an electromagnetic wave,

127
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,980
we've got a couple of different factors that we can describe that wave with.

128
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:32,800
One is the wavelength. And we've talked about this now for noise and for ionizing radiation as well.

129
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,860
Same definition here where it's what's the distance it takes to complete one cycle of a wave.

130
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:45,550
So one fold change in field strength from high to low and from polarity, positive to negative,

131
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:52,390
and then frequency, you know, it's how many waves cycles are occurring in a one second period.

132
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:57,490
So those concepts we've touched on before, they're still absolutely relevant here.

133
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:03,040
I think this is the only equation we're going to look at today, and it's a pretty simple one.

134
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,520
So here we've got the relationship basically between the speed of light, which the energy is moving at.

135
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,700
So three times ten to the eight meters per second and we can basically use that and the frequency or the wavelength to compute the other parameters.

136
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:26,260
So, you know, the speed of light is equal to the wavelength times, the frequency of an electromagnetic wave.

137
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,379
So let's talk about the spectrum again.

138
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,580
And thinking back to the first month or so of class, we were up here at the right, though I will mention again,

139
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:43,430
not all of these graphs are created identically in sometimes the ionizing bands are at the left of the figure, but here they're at the right.

140
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,849
So we talked about x rays, we talked about gamma rays.

141
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:54,380
We talked about how those things can break bonds within our body at the subcellular level and also damage our DNA.

142
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,270
What we're focused on here is this whole non-ionizing spectrum.

143
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:05,630
And again, just as a reminder, as we move from non-ionizing to ionizing, we're getting more and more kind of boom.

144
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:15,020
So you've got more energetic waves. We've got increasing frequency, very low frequencies down here in the low end of the non-ionizing range and very,

145
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,099
very high frequencies for ionizing radiation. And again,

146
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,589
we've got sort of dramatically increasing wavelengths from down at the subatomic

147
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,999
level all the way up to when we get down here to some radio frequency.

148
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,150
We can have wavelengths that are, you know, 100 kilometers.

149
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:43,610
And so I've already mentioned we've got some radio frequency, we've got radio frequency, we've got microwave, infrared, visible light and ultraviolet.

150
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,330
And you can see these things have different impacts on the body.

151
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,850
And so we'll we'll go into these in more detail.

152
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:59,060
But typically for some radio frequency and radio frequency, we're concerned about actual electric or magnetic fields getting induced in our body.

153
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:08,270
And we'll talk about why that might be a concern. And so sources that we're thinking about here might be things like power lines and AM and FM radios.

154
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:15,800
When we get up to the microwave range. Now, we're worried not about currents in our body, but about thermal impacts on our body.

155
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,920
So we make it heating like direct heating of our tissues.

156
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,290
That's problematic when we get up into infrared and visible light and ultraviolet.

157
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,200
Now we're worried more about kind of optical effects here.

158
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:33,740
So if we've got sources like heat lamps or tanning booths, obviously those can influence our skin.

159
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,260
They can give us a hand. It could also give us a sunburn and they can also be quite harmful to our eyes.

160
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:45,350
So sort of the left, two thirds of the figure here is what we're going to cover in class today.

161
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:54,770
Now, this is easily the busiest figure I've ever seen and certainly the busiest figure that I think I presented in class.

162
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,500
But I couldn't resist including it because it's got so much useful information crammed into one figure here.

163
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:07,790
And so we can kind of unpack this a little bit at the top, we're looking at wavelength and so this is meters here.

164
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:13,700
So we can start to think about wavelengths of ten meters, 100 meters,

165
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:20,270
maybe a thousand meters, again between each and each wave of this electromagnetic source.

166
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:26,479
And so the figures at the top here are just to kind of put this in in sort of a lay terminology here.

167
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:34,340
So, you know, wavelengths down here at the low end of the non-ionizing frequency range are as long as a football field or maybe even kilometers long,

168
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:45,170
we've got wavelengths that are, you know, approximately the size of of a typical human's height, down to things like a baseball, a paperclip.

169
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:54,350
Certainly, as we're transitioning from non-ionizing to ionizing radiation, we're down at the size of sort of units of life, like viruses and bacteria.

170
00:16:54,830 --> 00:17:03,920
And then, as I said, when we get up to the really high range ionizing radiation, we're down to the subatomic level in terms of size of a wavelength.

171
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:12,079
We've also got biological effects here. So as I already mentioned, but I'll just reiterate here at the very low frequency,

172
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:17,360
we're talking about currents that are getting induced in our body, electrical or magnetic, a little higher up.

173
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:24,380
We're worried about heating. And then up here in the the optical range, we're worried about excitation of our skin and our eyes.

174
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,820
And then, of course, for ionizing radiation. We're talking about DNA damage.

175
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,120
We've got different frequency ranges.

176
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:41,150
So the wavelengths go from very long to very short and the frequencies go from relatively low to very, very high as we move across the spectrum here.

177
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:50,089
And then just in terms of some common sources here, so as I said, down in the sub radio frequency and radio frequency range,

178
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:56,059
we've got things like radio stations, things like your smartphone that probably most of you have on you,

179
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,900
things like wi fi routers and microwave ovens.

180
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:09,109
And then we can move up into, for instance, things like body scanners that are used for security in that infrared range.

181
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:17,000
We might have night vision goggles, Flickr are used in military applications, primarily the tanning booth, etc.

182
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:27,380
And then we've already talked about sort of how we use ionizing radiation in terms of, you know, medical imaging, baggage screening, things like that.

183
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:33,590
So again, a very busy graph, but it does cram a lot of sort of useful information in here about the different frequencies,

184
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:38,870
the different wavelengths, types of sources and some of the health effects that we're concerned about.

185
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:50,219
So it turns out there really are. Well, there's really only one body in the world that has TV's that kind of or that has exposure limits,

186
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:57,180
let's say generically, that span this whole enormous range of the non-ionizing radiation frequencies.

187
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,159
And that's HGH.

188
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:07,260
So as you can see here, HGH has done what I've already done for you and sort of broken this up into different bands and they've identified,

189
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:14,400
well, which one of the Teles that HGH is put out is relevant for that particular band of frequencies.

190
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:19,800
And so the terms I've used to describe these bands so far are pretty consistent with the 12.

191
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,389
So again, sort of seven radio frequency, radio frequency and microwave,

192
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:30,500
and then we get up into optical radiation and again, you know, in terms of wavelengths.

193
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,489
So the previous graph sort of ended at football field sized wavelengths.

194
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:43,320
But if you get down to even lower frequencies, you can have wavelengths that are thousands of kilometers potentially in length.

195
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,969
So just an enormous range of the spectrum that we're looking at here.

196
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,000
And we're going to break down each of these twelves as we go.

197
00:19:52,470 --> 00:20:01,080
So I've mentioned a magnetic wave and a corresponding sort of parallel or orthogonal electric wave as well.

198
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,990
And so let's think about these things in a little more detail.

199
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,660
Hopefully this is bringing back maybe bad memories from physics, but so we'll keep it very light and airy.

200
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:15,659
But when we talk about electric fields here, we're talking about a couple of different things.

201
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,470
So one is we might have a positive charge and a negative charge.

202
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:28,560
And so we could think about the field sort of emanating out from the positive charge and emanating in towards the negative charge.

203
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:36,270
And we can also think, in addition to sort of a mono polar, where we're focused just on the positive or just on the negative,

204
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:45,510
we can think about a dipole where we have a positive and negative field here going on where as you can see,

205
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:50,700
we've got the electric field is flowing from the positive point here to the negative point.

206
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:58,950
The electric field is governed by the inverse square law. So we've talked about that now for ionizing radiation and for noise.

207
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:05,009
And I'll just bring us back to the fact that the inverse square law means that if we make a pretty small change in the

208
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:11,790
distance between a source of non-ionizing radiation and a person that could have a huge impact on their exposure.

209
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:18,209
So let's always keep that in mind. And, you know, you all know this from grade school, but opposites attract.

210
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:27,090
So opposite charges attract. So again, a positive charge is going to be drawn to a negative charge and light charges tend to repel each other.

211
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,620
That's almost all we need to know about electric fields for today's lecture.

212
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:40,439
The other thing I'll mention is anytime we've got people in proximity to an electric field, as I mentioned previously,

213
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:47,300
there's this possibility that an electric field is going to be induced or a current is going to be induced in the human body.

214
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:54,150
And so if you imagine power transmission lines and these criss cross every town in the United States,

215
00:21:55,170 --> 00:22:00,150
so you may recall that power transmission lines operate on an alternating current.

216
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,129
And so that AC current,

217
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:10,050
the same thing that comes out of our wall outlets essentially reverses 60 times a second and we get 60 hertz electricity out of the wall.

218
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:19,829
So that means 60 times a second. If you're standing near a high voltage line, the polarity is reversing to positive, from positive to negative.

219
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:24,600
And each time it does that, it's inducing a current in your body.

220
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,780
So you're we're constantly flip flopping when we're in a room like this or near a power line 60 times a second.

221
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:37,080
This current is being induced in our body now the the actual amount of force.

222
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,550
So sort of how much of the electricity in the electrical field is being

223
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,599
converted into our current in our body depends on the voltage of the power line.

224
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,480
So we have pretty low voltage coming out of the wall.

225
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:56,550
But if you are standing next to a high voltage power line, you know, there's a tremendous amount of electrical field there.

226
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:04,169
We're also going to talk about a number of different units that we can use to measure different types of non-ionizing radiation.

227
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:08,489
And one of the ones that we'll come back to pretty consistently is volts per meter.

228
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,750
So that's just a measure of how strong an electric field is.

229
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,520
So as I said, any time you've got an electric field, we always have a corresponding magnetic field.

230
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:26,159
The moving electric charges create this, and the magnetic field is perpendicular to the direction of the current flow.

231
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,920
So some of you may remember the the right hand rule for figuring out which direction is the magnetic field moving in.

232
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,410
So if you wrap your hand around an electric line and you know which direction the power is flowing,

233
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:44,160
the direction of the magnetic field is going to be in the direction that your fingers are pointing around that line.

234
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:50,040
And so this magnetic force is proportional to how much current is flowing

235
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:55,860
through here and what's the distance between the source and any nearby objects.

236
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:02,339
And so if we're standing near that electric line and we're getting electric field induced in our body,

237
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,240
we are also getting a magnetic current induced in our body.

238
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:14,610
And so every time the polarity on this line changes from positive or negative, we're going to get a change in our magnetic current here.

239
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:23,339
And when we're talking about magnetic fields, we're going to be using slightly different units here instead of volts per meter for Electric Field.

240
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:31,469
Now we're looking at essentially amps per meter. So let's start to think about some applications here.

241
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:38,130
And so some radiofrequency energy is really the lowest end of the non-ionizing radiation spectrum.

242
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:44,730
So this is sources that have frequencies between zero and 30,000 hertz.

243
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:52,950
And we can describe these some radio frequency fields again by either their electric field strength or their magnetic field strength.

244
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:59,339
And so I'll call electric field strength just a capital E you've already talked about how that's measured in volts,

245
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,680
perimeter and magnetic field strength we'll call Capital H and that's in amps per meter.

246
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,640
So those are kind of our basic units here.

247
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:18,540
We can also quantify the magnetic field in terms of what's called a flux density, sort of how much magnetic energy is moving over time.

248
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,090
And so some of you may be familiar with units of Tesla.

249
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:28,169
And wait a second, Patrick. And so here we're looking at volts volt seconds per meter squared.

250
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:39,060
So again, just a measurement of the movement of energy, just like any flux, it's sort of the movement of energy per unit area.

251
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:45,630
Yeah. Patrick What would be an example of zero kilohertz frequency?

252
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:52,290
So zero kilohertz, I mean, doesn't even exist that wouldn't exist, right?

253
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,899
That that implies that there's no motion in coming.

254
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:01,950
So, you know, 0.00001 kilohertz would be something zero kilohertz would be just an absence of electrical energy.

255
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,149
Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

256
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,809
So some radio frequency sources and we've already touched on some of these, as I said,

257
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:18,060
high voltage power lines and things like monitors, especially the old style cathode ray tube or CRT monitor.

258
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:24,030
These are maybe not so common anymore. Maybe alarm clocks are also a dying breed.

259
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:30,059
But in Michigan, I think electric blankets are still sort of a viable source and things like hair dryer.

260
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,660
So we're talking common everyday types of objects here.

261
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,390
Nothing, nothing special about these.

262
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:46,230
And so if we do have exposure to electric or magnetic fields in this 0 to 30 kilohertz frequency range, what might happen to us?

263
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,320
Well, it turns out there's the possibility that you might get shocked.

264
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,220
So any time there's an electric field and you interrupt that field,

265
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,140
you have the potential to get shocked as you touch something and modify that field.

266
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,120
And off the field is strong enough. There's a possibility that you could potentially get burned.

267
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,930
But here the shock response is far more common.

268
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:13,949
And so that's where the electric field for magnetic fields, we're pretty uncertain.

269
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:21,150
I would say there's been nothing definitive connecting strong radiofrequency magnetic fields to health impacts.

270
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:28,200
Some of you may recall, although this is before your time, but back in the mid eighties to early nineties,

271
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:34,120
there was a sort of hypothesis put forth that kids who live near high,

272
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:40,500
high voltage power lines and have strong electric and magnetic fields might be at increased risk of leukemia.

273
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:49,440
And so there were a couple of studies, not particularly well done in the U.S. that identified so-called cancer clusters of childhood leukemia cases.

274
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,049
And we're trying to make the connection to well, look, you know,

275
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:56,970
these kids were more likely to live under a power line than kids who didn't develop leukemia.

276
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,330
Again, I think this hypothesis remains just that.

277
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:06,450
Is it conceivable? It is. Is the science definitive or has there been a strong association demonstrated?

278
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:13,980
There's not. But I would say that's kind of the one sort of lingering health impact from these sub radiofrequency magnetic fields that,

279
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:21,660
you know, could be certainly a reasonable thought, but just has never been demonstrated convincingly.

280
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:28,559
So in terms of a tally and I should make the point here throughout this class,

281
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,180
I've tried to address, you know, many of these physical hazards are present in the community.

282
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:37,560
We have public exposures and virtually all of them are present in some kind of workplace.

283
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:44,760
For the community, there's very few standards or guidelines available for anything related to non-ionizing radiation

284
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:52,079
other than like the FCC has restrictions on how much energy can come out of a cell phone,

285
00:28:52,080 --> 00:29:00,840
for instance, and other types of regulations. But those in many cases are not especially health motivated, but the TLDs are always self-motivated.

286
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:07,860
And so when ECJ has looked at the body of evidence for some radiofrequency electric fields,

287
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,340
they basically have said, we think that a ceiling value here is most appropriate,

288
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:20,630
a ceiling value being a level that you could be exposed to all the time for as long as you want, but you should never exceed.

289
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,139
And so they've divided this up into different frequency ranges.

290
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,850
So for the really low frequencies all the way down to just a little bit above zero,

291
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:35,250
to get to Patrick's point, there's a limit here of 25,000 volts per meter.

292
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:44,430
And then there's a range here from 220 to 3000 hertz where there's sort of a sliding scale, depending on the specific frequency.

293
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:56,700
And when we get up into the higher frequency range of 3000 to 30000, there's another just static limit here basically of 18, 142 volts per meter.

294
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:04,530
So that's for electric fields, for magnetic fields. HGH has taken a pretty similar approach here.

295
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:08,730
Here, the units that we're talking about are ceiling values.

296
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:17,130
In terms of Miller, Tesla, again, a measure of magnetic flux density, which always sounds strangely exotic to me.

297
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:22,230
And once again, we've got a couple of different frequency ranges identified here.

298
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:29,280
You'll also see in this case, HGH has said we're going to differentiate between an exposure to your whole body.

299
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:35,340
So if you're standing in the middle of this magnetic field versus if it's a pretty localized field

300
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:40,470
and it's just your arms or your legs being exposed or potentially just your hands and your feet.

301
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,200
And so maybe not surprisingly,

302
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:51,300
the whole body exposure limit is lower than what you're permitted to be exposed to if it's just your arms and legs or just your hands and feet.

303
00:30:52,590 --> 00:31:01,200
The other thing I'll point out here is for the frequency ranges of 1 to 2 and a half kilohertz and two and a half to 30 kilohertz.

304
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:10,110
They've basically said you shouldn't have essentially more than a one milli amp current here if you're

305
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:15,420
actually touching a source as opposed to just being in a field without actually touching anything.

306
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:21,809
So separately of frequency, again, something we're surrounded by all the time,

307
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:26,070
but it's really not something we're going to interact with from a professional perspective.

308
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,350
Radio frequency in microwaves,

309
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:36,210
we're certainly also coming into contact with and may be a little more likely to encounter this sort of in a professional role here.

310
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:46,079
And so radio frequency runs from 30000 to 3 sorry, 30,000 hertz to 300 megahertz here,

311
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,700
and then microwave starts at 300 megahertz and goes all the way up to 300 gigahertz.

312
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:59,549
So that's a huge range. And so for radio frequency, we're talking about things like, you know, FM radios, as I said,

313
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:05,550
wi fi routers, all of our smart devices and for microwaves, of course, microwave ovens.

314
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,140
But there's also microwave transmitters for communication.

315
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:20,970
And there's so-called radio frequency and microwave heaters that are used for sealing operations, for instance, in industrial applications.

316
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,420
So when we're talking about radio frequency and microwaves, we're still thinking about field strength.

317
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,430
So we're still talking about the electric field.

318
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:36,030
How many volts per meter of electric energy do we have in this field and how many amps per liter of magnetic energy?

319
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,260
But for radio frequency and microwaves, we've also got something defined for us here called a specific absorption rate.

320
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:47,310
And so this rate is in watts per kilogram.

321
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And so it's basically what's the rate that I'm absorbing watts of energy per kilogram of body mass.

322
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,230
And so because we have sort of a standardization here to size,

323
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:05,130
we can talk about a specific absorption rate for our head, for our whole body, for one person compared to the next.

324
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:11,520
And we can also talk about specific absorption. So if we take that rate and we multiply it by time,

325
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:18,930
then we get the specific absorption or basically a measure of what is the dose of radio frequency or microwave energy that got into me.

326
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,110
And so this is one of the things that, for instance, the.

327
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,270
Since sea has set limits on.

328
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:31,120
So if you hold your smartphone up to your head, you know, we want to make sure we're not baking your head with too much energy.

329
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,370
And so there would be limits put on in terms of the specific absorption rate and specific absorption

330
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:42,760
for a given person holding a cell phone up to their head for sort of a reasonable amount of time.

331
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,919
Yeah. So from this, you didn't do that.

332
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:52,149
You put that into the specifics when you heard the specifications, when you're designing like hospital equipment.

333
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:57,400
So like, did they have to calculate that when like producing like the MRI and PET scan and all that?

334
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:03,640
Yeah. So it's going to be factored in two ways. One is just going to be like the total energy of the device.

335
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:12,010
So, you know, an MRI's get some limit on how much power it can create and the overall sort of ceiling strength of the magnetic field.

336
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:17,290
But then for each procedure, there's going to be a calculation done to figure out, well, you know,

337
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,540
how much of that energy is actually getting into the person for this particular procedure.

338
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:29,710
You know, the the device design is going to be something set by the manufacturer that's not going to be changing from day to day.

339
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:37,989
But depending on different procedures, the software that's running that MRI machine is going to need to account for, well, how long is this procedure?

340
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:44,170
How big is the person? And try to make sure we're not getting into sort of a danger zone in terms of energy?

341
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:51,579
Is that are there limits then that the government regulates as to how how powerful they can be?

342
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:55,420
So so medical devices are definitely not my specialty.

343
00:34:55,420 --> 00:35:00,100
My suspicion is there would be, but I don't know what those specific limits are.

344
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,190
I'd be happy to to check that out offline and then get back to you on that.

345
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,540
It's a great question.

346
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:14,169
I mean, so for any medical device, whether it's an X-ray machine or an MRI or something else, you know, medicine is like first do no harm, right?

347
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:18,520
So we want to make sure that while taking a picture of someone's brain or something else,

348
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,000
we're not, you know, accidentally inducing additional health effects.

349
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:27,160
I think in the case of magnetic fields, as I said earlier,

350
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:33,520
the sort of epidemiological literature relating magnetic exposures to health impacts is pretty weak.

351
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:40,180
So those might not be quite as strong. But for an electrical field, you don't want someone sitting in an MRI machine getting shocked constantly.

352
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,020
That would be bad.

353
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:47,440
So there's going to be sort of some practical ceilings in there, too, that are there for comfort as much as for for protecting health.

354
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:57,530
Yeah, great point. We can also think about a couple of other sort of concepts here, one of them being power density.

355
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:01,940
And so this is expressed in units of watts per meter squared.

356
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:09,920
So that's very analogous to a sound intensity that we talked about previously, which uses those same units of what's per meter squared.

357
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,240
So that's how much energy is flowing through a particular surface.

358
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:22,070
That surface could be, you know, some generic square meter of air could be, you know, a square centimeter of human flesh, whatever.

359
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:29,900
And as I said, when we're talking about magnetic fields, we are concerned about inducing currents in our tissue.

360
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:39,230
And so for for those fields, they're going to tend to want to travel through us and get to ground some other source of magnetism.

361
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:44,240
The other point I'll make, Patrick, just in response to your your great question is,

362
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:48,110
you know, all of us are being exposed to magnetic energy all the time.

363
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:57,620
We're sitting on a giant magnet, the Earth. And so oftentimes the the levels that we're getting exposed to for magnetic energy are

364
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:03,080
relatively trivial compared to like our our just ongoing exposure to planetary magnetism.

365
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:08,510
So that may be one of the reason why it's pretty difficult to tease out any epidemiological effects.

366
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,249
And as I said, we can also get contact currents.

367
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:21,379
So if I'm touching a particular object, I can cause that energy to flow through me and cause shocks again.

368
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,300
And typically, that's our hands we're worried about.

369
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:32,360
So in terms of health effects here, both radio frequency and microwave, as I said a few slides ago, the primary effect here is thermal.

370
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,749
So you know what happens when you put your frozen burrito in the microwave?

371
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:44,990
It heats up, right? Well, our tissue, our human body gets the same effect when we're exposed to high levels of RF or microwave.

372
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:51,200
And so, you know, we're definitely not trying to cook people here and we don't hit levels anywhere

373
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,310
close to what's needed to actually cause the internal cooking of tissues.

374
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:00,889
But there is something that's been noted quite a bit among workers,

375
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:08,330
especially those who are working near strong sources of microwave energy that it's gotten it's name of microwave sickness.

376
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:18,050
And so the idea here is if you're a line worker and you're up on a microwave tower, you have some potentially quite high exposures.

377
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,610
And it is possible that your core body temperature would be influenced and would start to raise.

378
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:26,600
So we're basically we're not cooking you, but we're definitely heating you on the inside here.

379
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,720
And so the symptoms here are things like headache and dizziness, which you don't want when you're 400 feet off the ground.

380
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,710
Irritability, sleeplessness. Actually, that sounds a lot like grad school to me.

381
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,910
I don't know if you guys, but it's called microwave sickness. It is reversible.

382
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:47,000
So these are things you're going to generally experience, you know, in the field or shortly afterwards.

383
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,150
And then if you're not back in the field for a while, they will resolve.

384
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:59,900
There's also been, again, a suggestion here, but the evidence is pretty weak that radiofrequency exposure might be linked to cancer.

385
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:10,520
And so probably many of you at some point have seen, you know, a headline in the news like cell phones cause cancer, cause brain cancer or whatever.

386
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:17,270
And, you know, almost inevitably, a couple of days later, they'll be some other study that's like cell phones do not cause cancer.

387
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:23,000
And so this is very much a point of contention, I would say, in the scientific literature.

388
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:29,540
There are certainly studies out there that suggest that there's a link between radio frequency exposure and cancer.

389
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,489
But for every one of those, there's at least one that says, no, we haven't seen this.

390
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,330
I will tell you, I may be skipping ahead, but I'll just mention this now.

391
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:45,790
You know, oftentimes the the distinction between these studies saying, hey, this causes cancers,

392
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:51,560
this doesn't is the distinction between an animal study and a human study.

393
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:58,520
So in an animal study, you know, you can blast an animal with whatever you want as long as you get it through the animal care committee.

394
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:04,460
And you could give them exceptionally high exposures to radio frequency, for instance.

395
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:07,130
And you know what their exposure is. Absolutely.

396
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:15,890
Whereas in a human epidemiological study, we are just typically making a wild swag about what your radio frequency exposure might be.

397
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:23,060
We're not monitoring this. Typically, it's like, Well, how often do you use your cell phone and what kinds of sources do you have in your home?

398
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:26,360
Maybe we'll take a little bit of dosimetry, but that's relatively rare.

399
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:31,669
And so you might imagine in an animal study where you absolutely control the environment

400
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:35,959
and the conditions and you can blast an animal with huge amounts of radio frequency,

401
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,060
you might say, yeah, this actually causes cancer.

402
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,209
Much more difficult to prove in humans because we don't, number one, know what the exposure is very accurately.

403
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:49,400
And number two, it's often orders of magnitude lower than what they're giving to lab animals.

404
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,850
So, you know, just from a public health perspective,

405
00:40:52,850 --> 00:41:00,420
I'll encourage all of you to be skeptical when you read these studies and they do pop up in the media from time to time and start thinking about all,

406
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,460
you know, what kind of study is this?

407
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,820
Are they reporting all the details I need to know before they jump to this conclusion that cell phones cause cancer or don't?

408
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:12,170
That's that's sort of our obligation as public health practitioners.

409
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:23,149
One other concept I mentioned, so we talked about the specific absorption rate before and it turns out that for certain wavelengths,

410
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:28,580
the human body essentially becomes resonant to this radio frequency.

411
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:35,600
And so if you've got a wavelength that's about the dimension of a human body, so wavelength on the order of, let's say 5 to 7 feet,

412
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:43,700
somewhere in that range, our body can tend to act as an antenna and that becomes sort of the frequency range at which we are most susceptible.

413
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,400
So that's very analogous to vibration and noise like we've talked about previously.

414
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:56,479
So this is one of the rare instances where OSHA actually has a permissible exposure limit.

415
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:06,980
So there's a legal rule for RF in microwave radiation and it's ten milliwatts per centimeter squared, basically a ceiling level.

416
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:14,059
So if OSHA were to come out and actually measure in a workplace and the levels everywhere were below that particular level,

417
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:19,160
they would say there's there's no exposure problem here. You can be exposed at that level as long as you want.

418
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:28,459
We just don't want you to go above it. And as is kind of the norm or typical, HGH has a much more nuanced and maybe more confusing approach, frankly,

419
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:39,020
where they've got frequency across the bottom here and they've got field strengths here in terms of magnetic field and electric field.

420
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,180
And so here is a curve that we can follow for magnetic field specifically.

421
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:47,330
So how many amps per meter are we allowed?

422
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,130
And then there's an electric field strength curve that's basically parallel.

423
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,830
And then once we move up to the higher frequencies here, there's a power density curve.

424
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,620
So as I said, most of you are probably not going to deal with this stuff in your career.

425
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:08,449
And if you do, you know, this one lecture is not going to be enough to set you up for success here.

426
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:15,800
It's it's a pretty nuanced field, but sufficient to know that all of us are getting exposed to this stuff all the time.

427
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:20,870
Some, especially workers, can have potentially much higher exposures than everyone else.

428
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,280
So even ACG, I just realized, wow, this stuff can be super confusing.

429
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:36,819
And so they've started to, I think, to their credit, create materials that sort of relate well in a certain exposure frequency range.

430
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:43,959
What are our primary concerns here is that the electric field, the magnetic field, the power density and but also,

431
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:50,680
you know, if you're exposed in those ranges of frequencies, what what's the sort of risk to the person here?

432
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,830
Is it going to be a contact current or maybe a a shock?

433
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:57,130
Is it going to be heating of deeper tissues?

434
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:02,470
Is it going to be potentially burns either at the surface or deep in the skin?

435
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:07,360
And again, where are the sources that you might find people being exposed to this?

436
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:16,599
So I think this has been pretty lacking from age in the past in that they've put out, you know, strong scientific guidelines,

437
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:21,880
but haven't necessarily made it easy for you and me to read these standards and be like, what does this actually mean?

438
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:26,079
So I do give them credit for starting to distill this into something where you could look and say,

439
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,159
okay, the non-ionizing radiation frequency spectrum is huge.

440
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,330
Let me figure out what is the range that I'm concerned about,

441
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:40,120
what are the particular impacts or measurements that I need to make, and what are the health outcomes of concern?

442
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:45,339
Here now for measuring radio frequency in microwave radiation.

443
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:49,239
I've actually got a meter here, so I'll I'll pass this around and what I'll encourage.

444
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:56,469
So for those of you who have your phones on you, you might just pick up your phone and place it next to the sensor here and watch the display.

445
00:44:56,470 --> 00:45:01,510
So right now, this is set to I just got your glasses.

446
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:05,800
I can't even do glasses. Again, this is set to micro watts per meter squared.

447
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:11,350
And so your phone is constantly transmitting and, you know, GPS, location, etc.

448
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:14,860
And so even if you're not doing anything with your phone, if you hold the sensor up,

449
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:21,909
you should see the the strength of the field jump potentially by an order of magnitude.

450
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:27,969
Yet once they're increase when you're on phone call, you know, that's a great question.

451
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:33,220
So I haven't actually made a call on my phone for quite some time to check this.

452
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,280
What I have done is if you, for instance,

453
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:42,399
put this sensor up to your phone and you start to write a text and the phone starts to communicate with the cellular network,

454
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,610
you should see a jump, I suspect, with a phone call.

455
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:50,020
It probably goes up much, much higher than that. But I've never actually tested a face time.

456
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:56,919
Yeah. So the more demanding and more demanding, more energy, you would expect there to be a stronger field?

457
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,430
Absolutely. Yeah. So maybe on the break, we can all step out.

458
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,070
We'll make a quick FaceTime call and see what we find. So so this is a sensor.

459
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:11,379
I mean, one thing that I'll point out is I've mentioned that this is not really something that most

460
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,160
of us are going to measure either in the workplace or almost certainly not in the community.

461
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,780
And if you just look at the display of the instrument while you're standing there,

462
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:21,730
maybe even holding it still, you'll see it jumps up and down quite a bit.

463
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:31,780
So I'd like a chemical or a more tangible exposure where concentrations don't typically jump radically over short periods of time.

464
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,920
EMF can go from nothing to a huge exposure in a fraction of a second.

465
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:43,030
And so it becomes difficult, as you'll see as you look at the meter display, to sort of figure out what is the actual level here.

466
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:52,149
It's all over the place playing on three different scales. Yeah. So, so there's a couple of options that we have here.

467
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:59,410
Again, we, we think about an electromagnetic wave as an electric field in an orthogonal magnetic field,

468
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:03,010
meaning we have multiple axes that we need to measure here.

469
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:09,610
And so just like with vibration, there are sort of cheaper sensors out there that measure just a single axis.

470
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:17,020
And so for that, you need to be very conscious as to, well, what, where's my source and what's the axis around that?

471
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:24,850
Or like you're passing around right now, there are tracks of sensors that are getting a vector sum across all three axes.

472
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:30,070
And then there are some things like these magnetic loop sensors that you can

473
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,900
place in a fixed position and sort of observe how the field changes over time.

474
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,190
I'll also say I have check this out on the App Store.

475
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,610
I'm assuming it's the same for Android phones.

476
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:49,690
There are tons of apps out there, so your phone by default is an EMF sensor, right?

477
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:54,970
That's the whole focus of it. It communicates using electromagnetic frequencies.

478
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:58,840
And so all the sensors in there that are looking for you and your cell tower,

479
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:06,400
the nearest Wi-Fi signal can also be used as effectively a low grade version of the instrument that you're passing around right now.

480
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:15,670
So there's tons of apps out there. If you look for EMF detector, if you look for ghost detector, there's like ten times more.

481
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,930
So I'll just throw this out if you want to spend some time on the App Store.

482
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,490
So, you know, folks have.

483
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:27,320
They said, Oh, well, you know, if we're sensing the paranormal, it would be in the electromagnetic frequencies that we would pick those things up.

484
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:32,770
So there are tons of apps out there that are, you know, sort of marketed as to find the ghost in your house.

485
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:42,420
It just it says so much about our society, frankly. And then, of course, there's always the question of, well, gosh, if I've got that app on my phone,

486
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:48,680
and I were to compare that to an instrument designed for measuring EMF, what are the results?

487
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:55,079
And I will say no one to my knowledge has done this type of test, unlike in the field of sound,

488
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:02,100
where there's actually a number of studies now that have compared like an app based sound level meter to an actual sound level meter.

489
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:06,959
This is really the Wild West, but the idea that, gosh,

490
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:14,700
all of us are carrying an MF sensor in our in our pockets, in our bag, somewhere on our person most of the day.

491
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:21,440
Wouldn't it be cool if we could tap into some of the data from the phone and inform our epidemiological studies for that?

492
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:30,630
It turns out your phone is constantly capturing information about the field strength around you, how much energy is is being received.

493
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:36,840
But for privacy reasons, that data, of course, is not available to us as researchers.

494
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:42,570
So so there's this whole treasure trove of information, but we haven't figured out a good way to access it yet.

495
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:54,030
So I mentioned that we could have a shock from being an electric for a magnetic field, but there's also this potential for a contact current.

496
00:49:54,030 --> 00:50:01,259
Meaning I touch something that's energized and I get a shock that way, and there's various different types of instruments used here.

497
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:06,300
So there are plates that you can stand on that basically measure the current moving through you.

498
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:12,830
There are dosimeters that sort of look at your body as an antenna and figure out how much energy is being received by your body.

499
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:20,430
So there are ways to do this. Again, probably nothing any of you will do in your careers, but on the off chance you are faced with this,

500
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:23,570
hopefully you'll remember from this lecture, I think there are instruments for that.

501
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:29,670
Let me find somebody who knows something about those in terms of controls here.

502
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:34,719
So as always, we want to eliminate EMF wherever we can.

503
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:41,610
That's not very practical in our modern society, where we're being bathed in it constantly, we can start to think about engineering controls.

504
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:49,589
You know, maybe we can reduce the amount of energy that's being transmitted or received in a given circumstance.

505
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:53,760
So that would be like a substitution approach from an engineering control.

506
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:00,630
There are actually inclusions and shielding materials that are built specifically to block EMF.

507
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,389
Of course, we can also think about, well,

508
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:10,110
where are the people in relation to the source of radio frequency microwave and can I get them a little further away?

509
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:16,439
That's going to make huge reductions. And in terms of administrative controls and PPD,

510
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:23,430
there are actually specialized types of footwear and protective clothing and even gloves

511
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:28,379
that are designed not so much to shield the body from an electric or magnetic field,

512
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,520
but to shield you from a contact current.

513
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:38,189
As I said, you know, just increasing the distance or limiting the duration of the exposure.

514
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:44,280
So if we've got somebody who's climbing up on a microwave tower, you know, maybe that's not a job we want them to do for 8 hours.

515
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,970
Maybe we limit their exposure by saying you can only be up there for 2 hours tops.

516
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:56,520
And of course, we can excuse me post signs, you know, warning people to stay out of high, magnetic or electric fields.

517
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:05,850
So I don't know how many of you have heard of this. Just to try to tie this into our daily lives, there's this concept of smart meters, sickness.

518
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:17,339
And so I can attest, a couple of summers ago, our local power supplier was going around in the city installing smart meters.

519
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:25,740
So these were wi fi enabled meters that would allow DP essentially to talk to your meter from a centralized location.

520
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:32,219
And that lets them do two things. So one is they can figure out exactly how much power you're using and charge you for it.

521
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:39,090
So that's a pretty strong rationale for them. And they don't have to come out and actually read your email or physically maybe get into your house.

522
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:41,940
Now they can do it all wirelessly whenever to.

523
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:50,370
Now they can start to develop programs that essentially let them take control of your power meter and cut down your household usage.

524
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:57,840
So they might say, hey, if you're willing to give us control during peak electricity usage hours during the day, we'll cut your rate.

525
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,770
And I don't know if any of you have been offered a program like this.

526
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:06,149
We get fliers in the mail all the time and it's like, hey, if you enroll in this program,

527
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:11,910
we may cut your power at times of peak demand, but you're going to pay 30% less for power than you would otherwise.

528
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:18,870
So it's just a way for them to incentivize. Hey, we we, you know, there's a finite amount of electricity we can produce.

529
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:21,330
And it's a really hot summer day and everyone's got their AC on.

530
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:28,260
And we're at risk of a brownout, we can start cutting supply not altogether, but cutting it down to some users who have paid less.

531
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:33,180
Sort of as a tradeoff there. So, you know, that's a fine idea.

532
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:39,059
From a conservation perspective, I think it makes sense. But there was actually a protest in the city here over people saying,

533
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:47,160
I don't want a smart meter in my house because I'm worried that I'm going to get sick from the the emissions from this meter here.

534
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:54,749
And so there's a number of groups that sort of tried to respond to this, not just in Ann Arbor.

535
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:57,600
This was happening nationally, tried to respond and just say, well,

536
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:04,739
let's talk about how much exposure you're getting from different types of sources of radio frequency or microwaves.

537
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:09,060
And so here we've got a scale and units of microbots per centimeter squared.

538
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:13,400
And so, you know, one of the obvious comparisons, again, is your cell phone.

539
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:18,350
Like you're specifically holding this up to your brain, basically to take a call.

540
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,570
So that's really kind of the worst case exposure potential.

541
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:28,710
And typically you're going to have maybe a 5000 micro wide centimeters squared

542
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:33,809
maximum exposure and maybe the minimum exposure expected is going to be a thousand.

543
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:37,190
So sort of your average exposure is going to be somewhere in that range.

544
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:43,589
So that's a point of reference for us. You know, I don't know about you all, but when my frozen burrito is in the microwave,

545
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:46,680
I'm like sitting right outside the door watching it revolve around.

546
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:52,680
So that's, you know, I could probably control that exposure by moving away or just not doing it, but it's irresistible.

547
00:54:53,490 --> 00:55:01,110
And so here we're talking about basically an order of magnitude less right at your microwave oven, maybe one foot away.

548
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:07,860
We can think about, you know, sitting three feet away from a Wi-Fi router, as I am right now.

549
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:13,830
And your exposure there is going to be, you know, less than one microwave per centimeter squared.

550
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:21,090
And, you know, just having an FM radio station broadcasting in your vicinity is going to give you some small exposure.

551
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:26,129
And so you can see if you're sitting right next to your smart meter.

552
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:30,090
So if your foot away from this meter, which often is installed on the outside of your house,

553
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:33,930
you're getting maybe 200 micrograms per centimeter squared.

554
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:40,470
And if you're sitting three feet away, so three times the distance now we've gone down to 1/10 of the exposure.

555
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,879
So I appreciate people who create graphs like this.

556
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,660
I mean, of course we can quibble about the specific numbers on here.

557
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:55,150
Is it 1005 thousand? Probably not. But is a range it's it's reasonable and just sort of demonstrating that, hey,

558
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:01,740
the exposure you're getting from the smart meter is like two orders of magnitude less than you're getting when you use your cell phone.

559
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,530
And, you know, many of us have our cell phone on us all day long.

560
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:12,540
So it's like, let's just put this on a scale here for comparison and recognize that the additional exposure from a smart meter in your house,

561
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:16,950
which again is typically on the outside of your house and you're going to be probably not within

562
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:22,350
even three feet of it is pretty trivial compared to other sort of parts of our modern life.

563
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:30,450
So related to this smart meters sickness is the whole concept of electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

564
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:36,090
And so this is actually appeared in the scientific literature in the past 15 years or so.

565
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:39,630
This is not a recognized medical diagnosis.

566
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:48,660
But even back in 2005, when this was actually I shouldn't say that was done in the last 15 years, this has been done over a longer period of time.

567
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:55,530
But in 2005, there were several authors who said, well, let's let's look at the literature here.

568
00:56:56,130 --> 00:57:01,620
And so, you know, if you are hypersensitive to electromagnetic energy,

569
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:08,519
meaning if you're in a space that's got energy in these particular frequency ranges, you're going to know that.

570
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,760
And maybe you might feel like you perceive it and it's harming you.

571
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:19,310
Well, if that's true, you ought to be able to tell in a blind sort of taste test whether you're being exposed or not.

572
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:27,480
And so you can imagine doing experimental tests here where you put a person in a room and they have no idea what the electrical field is.

573
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:32,850
Sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not. And you ask them to identify, you know, are you being exposed right now or not?

574
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:43,350
And so even back in 2005, they found 31 studies that had been done on a total of over 700 people who said they had electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

575
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:54,780
So 24, the vast majority of those 31 studies found no evidence that anyone was able to perceive whether they were in an RF or a microwave field.

576
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,320
And for the remaining seven studies, there were kind of mixed results.

577
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:08,130
And so I imagine maybe in your AP classes or by a statistics, you've all talked about what a meta analysis is.

578
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:14,400
So this idea that, hey, there's a bunch of data and studies out there already, we can look at the studies individually,

579
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,510
but it would be great if we pulled them all together and did sort of a master

580
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:24,300
analysis across all 725 individuals and saw sort of what is the pooled effect.

581
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:34,580
And in this case, they found no evidence of any ability to to actually detect or perceived EMF among these so-called hypersensitive participants.

582
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:38,220
So, you know, do people believe they have this?

583
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:43,090
Absolutely. Is there sort of scientific evidence that it's a possibility?

584
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:45,750
I would say that evidence is is relatively weak.

585
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:53,670
Nevertheless, there are people, you know, if if you are concerned that being exposed to EMF energy is harming your health,

586
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:58,890
you know, that's something we want to understand about you. And that's a stressor that we could maybe work on.

587
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:04,950
And so people have continued and they've developed things like this electromagnetic field sensitivity scale.

588
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,849
I will point out this is not so much about health outcomes.

589
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:13,200
In fact, it's not about health at all, but rather about your perceptions of EMF.

590
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,599
So, you know, you can see some of these questions.

591
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:24,239
I would not mind living next to a high voltage transmission line if the apartment I had was nice at music concerts or similar events.

592
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:30,899
It's disturbing to know that there's a lot of electrical equipment around me and easily alerted when I'm around electrical equipment.

593
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:37,380
So this is something that we can, you know, sort of subjectively assess in people.

594
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:44,190
Again, I think the evidence that they are actually able to perceive the electromagnetic energy is pretty scant.

595
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:53,460
But if they think they are, you know, that that can still maybe tie into their stress and their perceived risk to their health.

596
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,000
All right. I tell you what, we are at the point where we'll shift into optical radiation now.

597
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:07,660
So let's take our usual break, be back maybe at 6 minutes after, and then we'll continue our march up the electromagnetic spectrum.

598
01:00:13,714 --> 01:00:16,864
You're just like, Sit there. Are you all right, folks?

599
01:00:18,094 --> 01:00:24,454
I know it's hard to come back to 1998 radiation after a break, but we're over the hump now.

600
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:32,554
That's the good news. Um, so we've talked now about some radio frequency, about radio frequency, about microwave.

601
01:00:32,554 --> 01:00:42,333
And again, we're increasing in frequency and decreasing in wavelength as we march up the spectrum here until we hit optical radiation.

602
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:50,224
And so here, in terms of wavelengths, we're now down to the nanometer to millimeter range,

603
01:00:50,224 --> 01:00:56,794
so much smaller than what we were talking about previously with regards to, for instance, sub radio frequency radiation.

604
01:00:58,204 --> 01:01:08,764
And so once again, we can turn to HGH and just giving them props once more for trying to make their materials a little bit more accessible.

605
01:01:09,724 --> 01:01:12,273
You know, something that I think I've mentioned previously,

606
01:01:12,274 --> 01:01:19,353
but it always fears repeating when we're talking about HGH and we're talking about the TELLY'S, the threshold limit values.

607
01:01:19,354 --> 01:01:24,843
These are designed to be interpreted and applied by trained industrial hygiene is.

608
01:01:24,844 --> 01:01:30,573
So HGH makes it very clear these are not just for somebody to pick up and be like, oh, that's a limit.

609
01:01:30,574 --> 01:01:35,074
I can apply that without any training or education. That's that's not the case here.

610
01:01:35,704 --> 01:01:41,734
But even for trained industrial hygienists, I think sometimes these gloves can be a bit much to take.

611
01:01:42,214 --> 01:01:45,634
And so they've now started to produce tables like you see here,

612
01:01:45,634 --> 01:01:54,754
where now they're listening different types of sources that are common sources for high potential exposures to optical radiation.

613
01:01:55,684 --> 01:02:00,663
So things like art welding and arc lamps, high intensity discharge lamps,

614
01:02:00,664 --> 01:02:11,104
fluorescence thermal sources and then sort of especially relevant in our Kobe the area, things like UV or ultraviolet germicidal lamps.

615
01:02:11,614 --> 01:02:17,733
And so they're starting to give us some guidance as to, hey, you know, is this likely to happen?

616
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:24,784
Like there's two diamonds for this particular combination of, you know, arc sources and ultraviolet light,

617
01:02:25,294 --> 01:02:31,533
or is it possible or is it unlikely for for where we see blanks on the Matrix here?

618
01:02:31,534 --> 01:02:37,714
So, again, trying to make the products here a little bit more useful to the end user.

619
01:02:39,124 --> 01:02:48,033
So with regards to optical radiation, we've got basically three major regions we're talking about here, ultraviolet, visible, light and infrared.

620
01:02:48,034 --> 01:02:53,224
And just to make things even more confusing, the two of these we break up into sub bands.

621
01:02:53,734 --> 01:03:00,664
So for Ultraviolet and you are probably all intuitively aware of this or aware of this from products you bought, for instance,

622
01:03:00,664 --> 01:03:10,084
sunscreen, you may know that there's uv-c, there's UVB, and there should be a and so visible light we don't break down into bands.

623
01:03:10,084 --> 01:03:14,493
And then for infrared we've got infrared, a high RB and high air.

624
01:03:14,494 --> 01:03:25,474
C And so in terms of moving up the up the electromagnetic spectrum towards the point where we transition from non-ionizing to ionizing,

625
01:03:26,194 --> 01:03:28,624
this is sort of the least energetic infrared.

626
01:03:28,624 --> 01:03:38,013
Then we move to visible and then ultraviolet actually is the frequency range where we make that jump from non-ionizing to ionizing radiation.

627
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:41,663
So some types of ultraviolet light can actually be ionizing.

628
01:03:41,664 --> 01:03:44,014
And we'll talk about that a little bit more in a moment.

629
01:03:46,354 --> 01:03:55,114
So keeping the focus on will, where where might be encounter these things or these types of optical radiation in daily life?

630
01:03:55,114 --> 01:04:02,554
Well, of course, we've got our our giant, fiery orb in the sky, which I think will emerge again in about five months come April or so.

631
01:04:02,554 --> 01:04:05,794
The sun is a huge source of optical radiation.

632
01:04:07,084 --> 01:04:10,264
We've also got things like primary metal manufacturing.

633
01:04:10,264 --> 01:04:14,794
So anytime you are melting down metal, aluminum, steel, tin,

634
01:04:14,794 --> 01:04:26,254
whatever that will put off a huge amount of optical radiation at welding operations can also put out tremendous amounts of optical radiation, as do.

635
01:04:26,824 --> 01:04:31,714
Incandescent light bulbs, as well as the LED bulbs that are more common or increasingly common.

636
01:04:32,074 --> 01:04:35,614
And then things like lasers, which I said or will end up today's lecture on.

637
01:04:38,234 --> 01:04:45,254
So starting with the longer wavelengths here, well, it will begin with infrared or thermal radiation or I.R.

638
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:54,484
And so here we we create these bands of infrared A, B and C because the bands actually have different targets within the body.

639
01:04:54,494 --> 01:05:01,514
So infrared, eh, turns out to be the most penetrating and infrared C is the least penetrating.

640
01:05:01,514 --> 01:05:07,044
So if we're worried about sort of deep burns, infrared A is what's going to get deepest into our skin.

641
01:05:07,064 --> 01:05:10,274
Infrared C is what's going to burn the sort of the surface of our skin.

642
01:05:11,234 --> 01:05:17,294
And for actually all types of infrared, it's actually the eye that is our key organ here.

643
01:05:17,294 --> 01:05:23,503
And so if we take a look at a cross-section of the eyes, so we've got the lens up here in the front,

644
01:05:23,504 --> 01:05:28,844
the cornea at the outer edge of the eye, and then the retina, of course, where our our sensing occurs.

645
01:05:29,234 --> 01:05:35,054
And what we are looking at here is the different bands of optical radiation here.

646
01:05:35,054 --> 01:05:38,414
So we've got ultraviolet, we've got infrared and invisible in the middle.

647
01:05:39,164 --> 01:05:49,604
And you can see ultraviolet uv-c and UVB tend to penetrate to the lens of the eye, whereas UVA can go all the way through the eye back to the retina.

648
01:05:50,144 --> 01:05:57,223
Visible light, of course, is what we're we're proceeding with our eyes that absolutely goes through to the retina and then the infrared.

649
01:05:57,224 --> 01:06:03,674
A also blasts straight through to the retina, whereas infrared B and C are stopped earlier in the eye.

650
01:06:04,064 --> 01:06:08,474
So the retina is kind of our most sensitive part of our eye in terms of exposure.

651
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:16,754
And from this we would say, well, UVA is a risk factor, but actually infrared and visible light are what are going to be most harmful to the retina.

652
01:06:17,414 --> 01:06:24,764
And so if we think about occupations, for instance, where there's been historically a high amount of exposure to infrared energy,

653
01:06:24,764 --> 01:06:30,224
those would include things like working in a foundry with molten metal, but also glassblowing.

654
01:06:30,224 --> 01:06:37,093
So if any of you have ever seen someone blow glass by hand, you know that they'll heat the glass in the furnace and they pull it out.

655
01:06:37,094 --> 01:06:42,824
And that molten glass is like a foot from their face and it is just blasting their eyes with infrared energy.

656
01:06:43,184 --> 01:06:53,083
And so that's an occupation where historically eye issues from optical radiation have been a huge issue and then cooks as well.

657
01:06:53,084 --> 01:06:59,354
So people who are exposed to heat lamps, for instance, at a fast food restaurant, those can have a pretty high exposure as well.

658
01:07:00,674 --> 01:07:06,674
So if you've got a really high intensity exposure to infrared, you can absolutely get skin burns from,

659
01:07:06,914 --> 01:07:11,084
you know, standing next to a heat lamp or being too close to molten glass.

660
01:07:11,864 --> 01:07:15,044
But historically, it's been more kind of the low intensity,

661
01:07:15,044 --> 01:07:21,254
but chronic exposures like among glass blowers that have led to injuries that are primarily in the eye.

662
01:07:21,764 --> 01:07:29,204
And so, as is so often the case, where we've learned how the human body gets damaged from workers who got damaged by something,

663
01:07:29,954 --> 01:07:36,554
cataracts are often referred to as glass blowers, cataracts, if they are associated with infrared exposure.

664
01:07:37,034 --> 01:07:42,493
So cataracts, you know, pacification of the lens, basically, meaning you just can't see.

665
01:07:42,494 --> 01:07:47,323
Clearly, you're looking through a cloudy lens, essentially, or potentially even retinal burns.

666
01:07:47,324 --> 01:07:49,934
All those things are very bad outcomes.

667
01:07:51,434 --> 01:08:00,674
So the TLG for infrared is in fact so hideously complicated that I'm not even going to distill it down for you beyond this single slide.

668
01:08:01,274 --> 01:08:06,764
Again, this is something that really you don't want to be messing with this unless you are more deeply trained than,

669
01:08:06,944 --> 01:08:10,964
you know, a 20 minute lecture on this and invisible hazards.

670
01:08:11,894 --> 01:08:14,113
But I can't tell you sort of the notion here as well.

671
01:08:14,114 --> 01:08:20,204
We want to keep people's eyes safe over an eight hour work shift that's very consistent with all the other 12 years.

672
01:08:20,714 --> 01:08:25,513
And here we're looking at the region from 770 nanometers to one millimeter.

673
01:08:25,514 --> 01:08:33,464
So the the infrared region plus a little bit. And the reason I'm not going into the details here and how the TLB is employed is

674
01:08:33,464 --> 01:08:38,353
because it is quite different and much more involved than most of the other TLB.

675
01:08:38,354 --> 01:08:43,933
So here there are different scenarios for exposure, durations and angles.

676
01:08:43,934 --> 01:08:52,304
There are certain wavelength regions. Each exposure is assigned something called a hazard function and you can identify different target effects.

677
01:08:52,304 --> 01:08:56,894
Are you interested in skin? Are you interested in eye lens, retina, etc.?

678
01:08:57,614 --> 01:09:03,554
The ultimate goal of the TLB is we absolutely want to prevent against retinal thermal injury.

679
01:09:03,554 --> 01:09:08,383
So again, the eye here is the most vulnerable organ in the body to infrared.

680
01:09:08,384 --> 01:09:17,684
So that's the one we absolutely want to protect against. And we want to protect primarily against the risk of cataracts and retinal burns.

681
01:09:18,044 --> 01:09:22,873
Though the TLB does make an interesting point, which actually hadn't occurred to me until I read it.

682
01:09:22,874 --> 01:09:26,054
But you know, if you've got workers, well, taking a step back,

683
01:09:26,474 --> 01:09:31,904
if the lens of your eye is one of the things that might get damaged, then we certainly want to protect people's lenses.

684
01:09:32,324 --> 01:09:37,124
If people have had cataract surgery and some people don't have a lens.

685
01:09:37,304 --> 01:09:41,983
Anymore, or they're using a lens from a different animal that has very different properties.

686
01:09:41,984 --> 01:09:45,404
And so in this case, they have a whole different section of this.

687
01:09:45,404 --> 01:09:48,824
Tell me specifically for people who have had cataract surgery.

688
01:09:48,824 --> 01:09:52,903
So, you know, just like with a chemical exposure, we might say, well,

689
01:09:52,904 --> 01:09:57,194
there's sort of what is the typical person exposed to versus what is the pregnant woman

690
01:09:57,194 --> 01:10:02,504
exposed to as the most vulnerable worker who's getting exposed to herself and her her fetus?

691
01:10:02,714 --> 01:10:10,514
In this case, we have this very vulnerable group of workers who are potentially at risk of extra eye injury or

692
01:10:10,934 --> 01:10:15,374
of getting their eyes injured at levels of exposure that probably wouldn't be harmful to others.

693
01:10:18,044 --> 01:10:21,984
In terms of measuring infrared. There's lots of gizmos out there that will do this today.

694
01:10:22,004 --> 01:10:26,174
So there's infrared radiometer is that are used, for instance,

695
01:10:26,744 --> 01:10:32,624
at border crossings to sort of take a look and make sure people aren't being smuggled in inside a container.

696
01:10:33,434 --> 01:10:40,724
There's infrared cameras, in fact, just a couple of years ago by a little infrared camera that snaps into my iPhone.

697
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:45,194
And the reason I did this is I wanted to do some thermal imaging at my house.

698
01:10:45,194 --> 01:10:48,394
I was looking at my power bills and I was like, this is this is crazy.

699
01:10:48,404 --> 01:10:51,044
It's like we're venting heat directly to the atmosphere.

700
01:10:51,044 --> 01:10:56,504
And so I bought this thermal camera and looked at a bunch of my walls and realized, Oh, we are venting heat to the atmosphere.

701
01:10:56,514 --> 01:11:01,934
These walls have no insulation whatsoever. So so that was a great sort of application.

702
01:11:02,084 --> 01:11:07,243
This, for instance, is my fireplace and my cat can do lots of stuff with these cameras.

703
01:11:07,244 --> 01:11:11,714
It's kind of fun. But the this sensing technology has, again,

704
01:11:11,714 --> 01:11:15,374
kind of shifted away from really specialized instruments like it's been historically

705
01:11:15,584 --> 01:11:18,314
to something you can pick up with the Amazon and run off your smartphone.

706
01:11:18,764 --> 01:11:26,323
And, you know, so home inspectors, folks like that will carry these things around because they're a great way to very quickly look at a wall and say,

707
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:29,644
like, are you losing heat from that wall from that window?

708
01:11:29,654 --> 01:11:32,924
Or even worse or better, depending on your viewpoint?

709
01:11:33,434 --> 01:11:36,673
You can take a thermal picture of a wall in your house.

710
01:11:36,674 --> 01:11:44,444
And if you see cold areas that are sort of oriented up and down, that can indicate you have a water leak inside the walls.

711
01:11:44,444 --> 01:11:48,044
So that can be a great way to sort of suss out, wait, we've got leaks here.

712
01:11:48,044 --> 01:11:51,344
This is bad, or at least we found it and now we can fix it.

713
01:11:52,604 --> 01:12:03,644
So infrared can be very useful, but again, can be harmful. Moving up the frequency spectrum now to wavelengths of 400 to 770 nanometers.

714
01:12:03,644 --> 01:12:11,533
These are the visible light spectrum. And, you know, these these figures are a dime a dozen on the Internet.

715
01:12:11,534 --> 01:12:17,744
But the idea here being that different frequencies of light are going to be more or less penetrating into our eye.

716
01:12:18,104 --> 01:12:21,583
They're all going to reach the retina to some degree, otherwise we wouldn't perceive them.

717
01:12:21,584 --> 01:12:29,294
But here you can see sort of the transition zone between blue and I'm not quite colorblind, but I also am not very good with colors.

718
01:12:29,294 --> 01:12:35,294
I'll call that violet ish. That region is going to tend to be most penetrating into the eye.

719
01:12:35,834 --> 01:12:40,224
So for visible light, we've got a couple of different outcomes we're worried about here.

720
01:12:40,244 --> 01:12:42,584
One is, of course, retinal impacts.

721
01:12:43,394 --> 01:12:49,574
Anyone who's been outside on a sunny day for too long without sunscreen knows you can also get thermal skin burns from visible light.

722
01:12:51,134 --> 01:12:58,363
There's something called the aversion response to visible light, which I mean to look back to in a few slides, this blue light hazard, again,

723
01:12:58,364 --> 01:13:05,504
this range here from about 425 to 450 nanometers is sort of especially harmful to the retina,

724
01:13:06,074 --> 01:13:09,824
and it's going to give us the greatest chance of a retinal injury.

725
01:13:10,904 --> 01:13:18,404
And the TLC for Visible Light is kind of similar to the one for infrared that I can show you because it's so hideously complex.

726
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:22,334
It's just a different range of wavelengths here.

727
01:13:22,604 --> 01:13:29,774
400 to 700 nanometers. And in terms of actually measuring visible radiation, this is something people have been doing for a long, long time.

728
01:13:29,774 --> 01:13:36,164
Photographers, for instance, will use light meters to figure out, you know, do I have enough light here to do my photo shoot?

729
01:13:37,424 --> 01:13:42,823
And they measure light in a couple of different ways that are analogous to the other hazards we talked about.

730
01:13:42,824 --> 01:13:46,214
So they can look at luminance, which is the flux of energy.

731
01:13:46,214 --> 01:13:50,924
So how much light is traveling through, you know, a square centimeter per second.

732
01:13:51,614 --> 01:13:56,144
Or they can use units of Lux, which is essentially lumens.

733
01:13:56,144 --> 01:14:00,274
So the flux of energy but per square meter per area.

734
01:14:01,424 --> 01:14:05,833
And so I'm not aware of a light meter app for a smartphone,

735
01:14:05,834 --> 01:14:12,764
but I'm virtually 100% confident that they are probably out there because, again, most smartphones now have cameras on them.

736
01:14:12,764 --> 01:14:14,684
They're going to have a light sensor built in.

737
01:14:15,164 --> 01:14:23,084
So the idea that, you know, here's another physical hazard that we might actually someday have the potential to measure exposures for people.

738
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:27,163
That's pretty exciting. And I forgot I added this slide. Let me amend my earlier statement.

739
01:14:27,164 --> 01:14:33,494
There are absolutely light meter apps that you can download for smart phones, and here are examples of a couple.

740
01:14:34,124 --> 01:14:38,833
So again, taking advantage of sensors that are built in, they're not so you know how much light you're exposed to,

741
01:14:38,834 --> 01:14:44,624
but so your camera knows and we can now maybe incorporate those into epidemiology as well.

742
01:14:46,384 --> 01:14:54,514
And so now we find ourselves at the upper end of the non-ionizing radiation frequency, spectra and ultraviolet radiation.

743
01:14:54,664 --> 01:14:59,044
And so, as I said earlier, the sun here is really our major source of concern.

744
01:15:00,124 --> 01:15:08,614
We've talked about uv-c, UVB and you be a UBC is primarily absorbed in the atmosphere.

745
01:15:08,794 --> 01:15:12,513
So the emissions that we're receiving from the sun,

746
01:15:12,514 --> 01:15:18,754
the atmosphere is really stripping out the UBC and it's the UVB and UVA that are really making it through.

747
01:15:19,774 --> 01:15:21,483
That's in terms of solar radiation.

748
01:15:21,484 --> 01:15:30,424
Of course, we have other sources, you know, manmade or human made sources here on the surface of the planet that could still generate UBC.

749
01:15:31,544 --> 01:15:35,054
And so UBC and UVB.

750
01:15:35,554 --> 01:15:44,614
So if we look at the frequency or excuse me, the wavelength ranges here, so UBC is 100 to 280 nanometers and UVB is 282 315.

751
01:15:45,184 --> 01:15:50,493
So ultraviolet light in that range is called actinic ultraviolet light.

752
01:15:50,494 --> 01:15:54,184
This would be a great question to ask you on a final exam. So take a note.

753
01:15:55,234 --> 01:16:00,574
And those particular wavelengths are capable of causing chemical reactions.

754
01:16:00,574 --> 01:16:05,164
They are capable of causing ionization to be specific.

755
01:16:05,164 --> 01:16:13,054
And so it's not a guarantee, but it is a possibility that we have ionizing radiation in those ultraviolet bands.

756
01:16:14,284 --> 01:16:26,614
So in terms of what the health impacts here are, UBC, if it's or if oxygen is exposed to UBC, we can actually get the creation of ozone here.

757
01:16:27,004 --> 01:16:34,534
So some of you may have seen there are products sold called ozone generators that are marketed as like room air cleaners.

758
01:16:35,464 --> 01:16:38,403
Not a good idea. Ozone is actually not very good for your lungs.

759
01:16:38,404 --> 01:16:43,834
So the idea of cleaning the air while you're damaging your lungs, I don't think that really pencils out.

760
01:16:45,064 --> 01:16:50,914
But the really important property of UBC is there's this Germicidal region where you can actually find

761
01:16:50,914 --> 01:16:57,034
specific frequencies that will kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus or other types of viruses and bacteria.

762
01:16:57,034 --> 01:17:00,003
So that's a very practical wavelength.

763
01:17:00,004 --> 01:17:08,313
And there have been a ton of products created during the COVID pandemic that use UBC with the idea of sterilizing your environment.

764
01:17:08,314 --> 01:17:13,714
In fact, I think I saw a news item a couple of days ago where the the FDA,

765
01:17:13,744 --> 01:17:20,464
the Food and Drug Administration, was calling for a recall of several products that use UBC.

766
01:17:20,464 --> 01:17:28,024
They're like sterilizing wands, the idea being you run into it over your kitchen counter or the subway strap or whatever.

767
01:17:28,354 --> 01:17:36,153
And they were putting out like several thousand times what the FDA limits for for those types of products.

768
01:17:36,154 --> 01:17:39,274
And so, you know, it's America. There's a dollar to be had.

769
01:17:39,274 --> 01:17:41,284
People will find a way to make that dollar.

770
01:17:41,284 --> 01:17:49,434
But this idea that you're actually putting yourself at risk of skin burns in your goal of killing SARS-CoV-2, not a good tradeoff.

771
01:17:50,884 --> 01:17:59,284
And UVB and a little bit UVA here are responsible for erythema, reddening of your skin.

772
01:18:00,094 --> 01:18:03,094
And then any of you who have ever had a black light in your room.

773
01:18:03,094 --> 01:18:07,834
I had several in college. That's the UVA frequencies that we're talking about there.

774
01:18:08,824 --> 01:18:14,764
So in terms of what ultraviolet energy does to our our body, there's a couple of different things that the erythema,

775
01:18:14,764 --> 01:18:22,114
as I said, just reddening of the skin is really a function primarily of UVB and UBC exposures.

776
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:33,964
Now carcinogens, excuse me, CARCINOGENESIS or, you know, the creation of cancer specifically in skin cancer here is specifically tied to UVB.

777
01:18:34,564 --> 01:18:42,904
So although we have been studying ultraviolet light for decades, you know, it's really UVB that we've pinned the skin cancer risk on.

778
01:18:43,834 --> 01:18:52,014
Another thing we have to think about is not everybody is equally susceptible to UVB or to the other types of UVB.

779
01:18:52,024 --> 01:18:53,074
So, for instance,

780
01:18:53,494 --> 01:19:00,964
there are workers who are exposed to particular chemicals in coal tar pits is a good example that are so-called photosensitive sores.

781
01:19:01,204 --> 01:19:09,904
And they basically make you more more susceptible to erythema and potentially to cancer than someone who is not exposed to that substance.

782
01:19:10,204 --> 01:19:17,794
There's also actually a pretty large number of medications, prescription medications that people take that may make them photosensitive as well.

783
01:19:18,394 --> 01:19:25,324
So here's another kind of complicated or if we're trying to understand what's the population, the risk of skin cancer from UV light,

784
01:19:25,684 --> 01:19:29,104
we need to have a good handle on well what fraction of the population is actually

785
01:19:29,314 --> 01:19:33,214
at greater risk due to their medications or their occupational exposures.

786
01:19:35,224 --> 01:19:45,114
So as you can see here, UV A is sort of the most penetrating or more penetrating than UVB here in terms of getting into your skin, the effects of age.

787
01:19:45,284 --> 01:19:52,244
You know, wrinkling and discoloration of skin primarily linked to UVB and skin toughening.

788
01:19:52,414 --> 01:20:00,014
That sort of leathery impact that people with lots of sun exposure get is primarily a UVB and uv-c impact.

789
01:20:00,764 --> 01:20:04,003
So the skin's one target organ, the eye is the other one.

790
01:20:04,004 --> 01:20:12,314
And so it turns out UVA C and UVB are primarily absorbed here in your cornea and in your lens.

791
01:20:12,674 --> 01:20:22,634
And so it turns out if you have a ton of UVB exposure, excuse me, U.V. exposure and your cornea can get inflamed.

792
01:20:22,844 --> 01:20:32,174
And so if any of you have ever been out skiing, for instance, on a super bright day and a D or at the beach all day and a super bright day,

793
01:20:32,264 --> 01:20:37,034
at the end of the day, it feels like you have to stand in your eyes. That's photo keratitis, actually.

794
01:20:37,034 --> 01:20:38,674
That's inflammation of the cornea.

795
01:20:38,684 --> 01:20:46,634
It will typically resolve within 48 hours, but that's a sign basically that your cornea got too much ultraviolet light.

796
01:20:47,894 --> 01:20:58,514
And it's possible that cataracts are a result specifically of UVA, UVB, excuse me, and potentially uv-c exposure here.

797
01:20:58,524 --> 01:21:04,394
So, you know, with all optical radiation, again, the eye is always an organ of concern here.

798
01:21:05,594 --> 01:21:11,444
Now, when it comes to ultraviolet radiation here, this is actinic radiation.

799
01:21:11,444 --> 01:21:14,834
So this is going to be referring to UVB and UV-C.

800
01:21:15,374 --> 01:21:24,074
And in this case, HGH has presented their TV kind of like we've seen for vibration and noise, where they say, how long can you be exposed per day?

801
01:21:24,584 --> 01:21:32,564
And what's the effective irradiance here radiance being in this case, milliwatts per centimeter squared of ultraviolet energy.

802
01:21:33,134 --> 01:21:40,003
And so this is kind of useful because if you're taking a, you know, an overall measurement of all the UV energy and the UVB and you see bands,

803
01:21:40,004 --> 01:21:48,094
then you can say, okay, you know, how long can I be outside without protection given this particular exposure?

804
01:21:50,084 --> 01:21:55,724
So I mentioned coronaviruses here, and I'll just dig into this a little bit further.

805
01:21:55,724 --> 01:22:01,724
And so early in the pandemic, people were thinking, well, gosh, you know, we've got this SARS-CoV-2 virus.

806
01:22:02,414 --> 01:22:06,104
It would be great if we could just kill this rather than people getting infected,

807
01:22:06,494 --> 01:22:13,454
especially in health care facilities where this notion of a nosocomial infection, in other words, an infection you pick up,

808
01:22:13,454 --> 01:22:17,353
not outside the hospital, but when you're in the hospital getting treated, you know,

809
01:22:17,354 --> 01:22:22,564
how can we prevent people from getting COVID from a visit to the hospital for another reason?

810
01:22:22,574 --> 01:22:30,044
And so lots of folks did research and started to figure out that there's a particular wavelength,

811
01:22:30,044 --> 01:22:35,444
222 nanometers that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is especially vulnerable to.

812
01:22:35,504 --> 01:22:41,563
So that's in the Uv-c range. And so people started developing lots of products here.

813
01:22:41,564 --> 01:22:46,274
There were robots developed that would basically go into a room after a procedure

814
01:22:46,274 --> 01:22:51,224
was performed and just essentially spray the whole room down with uv-c light,

815
01:22:51,494 --> 01:22:54,704
ideally sterilizing every surface. So that's pretty cool.

816
01:22:56,444 --> 01:23:04,243
But as the pandemic wore on, we started to realize this isn't so much a surface transmission virus, it's more of an airborne virus.

817
01:23:04,244 --> 01:23:10,364
And so, you know, cleaning the exam table, not a bad idea, but it's not going to cut down on the stuff in the air.

818
01:23:10,934 --> 01:23:19,094
And so then there was a move. And these products are there are many of them on the market today to create some sort of UVC

819
01:23:19,124 --> 01:23:26,023
transmitter that would sit above head height in a room and essentially irradiate the upper,

820
01:23:26,024 --> 01:23:32,264
say, one eighth or 1/10 of the room height with uv-c see light.

821
01:23:32,534 --> 01:23:36,073
So the idea here is we don't want this beam facing down, right?

822
01:23:36,074 --> 01:23:39,974
Because then we're beaming uv-c directly into people's eyes. That would be bad.

823
01:23:41,144 --> 01:23:46,484
So this is not necessarily going to be an effective control if you and I and Nicole are standing three feet away.

824
01:23:46,694 --> 01:23:50,563
You know, the airway above me is getting clean, but you're passing COVID directly to me.

825
01:23:50,564 --> 01:23:57,974
So it's not a it's not a fix for localized transmission, but it could clean, you know, generally the whole room air space.

826
01:23:57,974 --> 01:24:03,224
And if you have these in every room of a building, you know, as the air turns over from the air handling system,

827
01:24:03,224 --> 01:24:11,054
you're cleaning lots and lots of of air volume and ideally eliminating the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

828
01:24:11,064 --> 01:24:19,094
So I think this is a clever approach to to engineering controls, sort of acknowledging, hey, uv-c is bad for people.

829
01:24:19,094 --> 01:24:22,214
We don't want it on people, but we do want it on the air that they're breathing.

830
01:24:22,934 --> 01:24:26,804
And so these products have been invented to be applied in rooms.

831
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:33,284
They've also been invented to be applied in ventilation ducts. So you're cleaning the air as it's being moved around the facility.

832
01:24:33,704 --> 01:24:43,754
So all great ideas in general. And, you know, ideally these will be expanded upon to maybe influence other pathogens that are transmitted by air, too.

833
01:24:44,894 --> 01:24:54,454
And just as a reminder here, this is uv-c we're talking about UVB might have some ability as a germicidal energy.

834
01:24:54,464 --> 01:25:04,454
UVA really has none. And so I put this up only to highlight that engineers have figured out ways to design lamps.

835
01:25:04,464 --> 01:25:07,793
So they put out their energy at a very specific wavelength.

836
01:25:07,794 --> 01:25:17,994
And so if we were designing a lamp to sterilize the SARS-CoV-2 virus, again, we'd want to be down here in this 222 nanometer wavelength region.

837
01:25:19,984 --> 01:25:21,813
So a couple of issues with sterilization.

838
01:25:21,814 --> 01:25:28,144
I mean, this idea of a robot coming into the room and cleaning the room after someone's in there, you know, probably putting people out of work.

839
01:25:28,194 --> 01:25:32,974
The hygienist in me doesn't like that, but good from an infection control perspective.

840
01:25:33,484 --> 01:25:38,764
But the other thing to think about is this uv-c energy can only sterilize the

841
01:25:38,764 --> 01:25:44,974
corona virus or any virus or bacteria if it's directly exposed to that energy.

842
01:25:45,424 --> 01:25:52,714
So for instance, if I've got a lot of soil and dust and other contamination on a surface, the movie is not going to be able to penetrate that.

843
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:57,844
And there may be, you know, sort of viable virus left underneath that.

844
01:25:58,894 --> 01:26:05,074
The other thing to think about is UV sterilization works great on nice flat surfaces.

845
01:26:05,314 --> 01:26:13,174
If I was trying to sterilize my backpack or a bag, you know, all the wrinkles increases in your bag create shadows.

846
01:26:13,324 --> 01:26:16,714
And if visible light can't get in there, you can't get in there either.

847
01:26:17,104 --> 01:26:21,544
So it's great for sterilizing flat surfaces, not so much for sterilizing clothing.

848
01:26:21,674 --> 01:26:27,484
I mean, you'd never want to do it on your person or for sterilizing bags or other sort of uneven surfaces.

849
01:26:28,834 --> 01:26:36,874
Now, I made this slide before I saw that FDA announcement about some of the UVC lamps actually being much,

850
01:26:36,874 --> 01:26:40,444
much more than they mean much, much more powerful than they should.

851
01:26:40,744 --> 01:26:46,324
But typically, the uv-c lamps that are sold to you and I as consumers are pretty low dose.

852
01:26:46,864 --> 01:26:54,153
So the other thing to think about is if you've got a super powerful uv-c source, you probably only need to zap the surface for a second or two.

853
01:26:54,154 --> 01:27:00,334
But the weaker and weaker your source becomes, it's safer, but it means you have to hold it there for a lot longer.

854
01:27:00,844 --> 01:27:05,884
So if you are just doing a quick pass over lots of surfaces with a really low energy lamp,

855
01:27:05,884 --> 01:27:11,344
you're wasting your time because you're not actually giving the virus enough energy to sterilize it.

856
01:27:12,244 --> 01:27:16,014
And again, this probably doesn't need to be said, but I'll say it anyway.

857
01:27:16,024 --> 01:27:17,763
These are not the sort of things where you're like, Oh,

858
01:27:17,764 --> 01:27:21,934
I think I got some coronavirus on my skin and zap your skin because that's going to give you a burn.

859
01:27:21,944 --> 01:27:29,194
Yeah. Or it could attaching, I don't know, because uv-c transfer through fiber optic cables in a way that you can kind of brush

860
01:27:29,194 --> 01:27:33,754
over a surface with a physical brush because that will account for the surface.

861
01:27:34,594 --> 01:27:39,604
No differences. Yeah. So I'm not aware of a product like that in theory.

862
01:27:40,024 --> 01:27:45,094
If you had a lamp and you had I don't know if it would be fiber optics, but something that to channel that light.

863
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:51,844
Again, there's maybe money to be had there. Go to the patent office and get that idea in there quickly.

864
01:27:54,124 --> 01:27:59,433
And I'll also mention that UV is not just useful for air and surface cleaning.

865
01:27:59,434 --> 01:28:06,334
It's actually used for water purification in some water treatment plants, including here in Ann Arbor.

866
01:28:06,754 --> 01:28:13,924
And so the idea is, again, you've got water that's coming in that in this case would have already been treated physically.

867
01:28:13,924 --> 01:28:17,914
So it's already been filtered. It's already had settling in sedimentation.

868
01:28:18,214 --> 01:28:22,954
This is kind of the final dose, if you will, of sterilization.

869
01:28:23,314 --> 01:28:27,874
And so you pass the water through a chamber and you just bathe that chamber in UV light.

870
01:28:27,874 --> 01:28:31,234
In this case, you might make it across the whole uv-c spectrum.

871
01:28:31,804 --> 01:28:35,943
Or if you're in an area where there's one particular pathogen that's especially problematic,

872
01:28:35,944 --> 01:28:40,894
you would tune your lab to that particular wavelength that that pathogen is susceptible to.

873
01:28:41,404 --> 01:28:46,594
So this is an alternative, or you could use it in addition to things like chlorination for disinfection.

874
01:28:49,014 --> 01:28:53,154
And I mentioned that there are certainly other things that you gets used for.

875
01:28:53,184 --> 01:29:00,894
So, you know, it's used in plural chemistry and DNA analysis from a kind of laboratory perspective.

876
01:29:00,894 --> 01:29:07,104
It's also used for instruments that are used to detect mercury and then UVB and UVA.

877
01:29:07,134 --> 01:29:10,584
You know, there are, again, DNA applications here.

878
01:29:10,644 --> 01:29:12,324
There's curing.

879
01:29:12,744 --> 01:29:20,784
So I have Invisalign braces that I got at the start of the year here, and they put the material on and then they cured it with an ultraviolet pen.

880
01:29:21,744 --> 01:29:25,734
Rather than having me sit around and wait for who knows how long for the stuff to cure on its own.

881
01:29:25,744 --> 01:29:29,214
So we we use this stuff in lots and lots of applications.

882
01:29:29,994 --> 01:29:32,994
And again, there's different technologies available to measure this.

883
01:29:33,004 --> 01:29:38,364
There's devices that you might sit out in an area and take a measurement.

884
01:29:38,364 --> 01:29:43,733
There are more symmetric approaches. There's personal U.V. monitors now.

885
01:29:43,734 --> 01:29:49,974
So this is something, again, you, you know, snap onto your your beach bag with a carabiner.

886
01:29:49,974 --> 01:29:53,904
And this thing is going to keep track of your UV exposure over the course of a day.

887
01:29:54,294 --> 01:30:02,424
I'll also mention the last time we took a vacation to the tropics, my wife brought some sunscreen along that came in a container.

888
01:30:02,724 --> 01:30:08,033
There was UV sensitive, so the container would change colors as it was exposed to Evie as a way to remind,

889
01:30:08,034 --> 01:30:11,663
you're like, Oh my God, that's supposed to be white. It's bright blue. I should probably put more sunscreen on.

890
01:30:11,664 --> 01:30:22,764
So very practical applications here in terms of control of the optical radiation, you know, we could think about reduce and replace wherever possible.

891
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:29,784
There are barriers or enclosures that are specifically designed to cut out certain frequencies of light or certain wavelengths of light.

892
01:30:29,784 --> 01:30:36,594
So if you've ever been into a welding shop, you know, when a welder strikes an arc, it's it's mesmerizing.

893
01:30:36,604 --> 01:30:40,014
It's almost impossible to look away if you're not very smart like me.

894
01:30:41,604 --> 01:30:43,884
And so, you know, people know this.

895
01:30:43,884 --> 01:30:50,664
And so they have created different materials that you can put up around a welding operation where on this side of the curtain,

896
01:30:50,934 --> 01:30:53,274
on the welder side, I'm getting exposed.

897
01:30:53,274 --> 01:30:59,513
But on the far side, this translucent material that the light is passing through is essentially attenuating that.

898
01:30:59,514 --> 01:31:05,604
So I can now look directly at the arc. So there's a barrier, essentially engineering control.

899
01:31:06,174 --> 01:31:12,924
And in terms of administrative controls, of course, we've also got limiting exposure time, job rotation like we talked about.

900
01:31:13,314 --> 01:31:18,354
And for some really high sources or high level sources of ultraviolet exposure,

901
01:31:19,194 --> 01:31:26,904
there are things like interlocks that we could put on meaning like there's a chamber and I'm using lots of UV light to cure a product in a factory.

902
01:31:27,354 --> 01:31:30,144
And if I were to put my hand in there, I would be burned quite badly.

903
01:31:30,144 --> 01:31:35,813
So an interlock, for instance, might say I've got two controls on the outside of the device,

904
01:31:35,814 --> 01:31:40,944
and to operate the device, my hands have to be outside to depress the trigger, basically.

905
01:31:40,944 --> 01:31:47,274
And so through this interlock system, it's physically impossible for me to to be in there while the area is getting irradiated.

906
01:31:49,524 --> 01:31:55,524
There's also, of course, PPE here, and maybe I'll block or I'll put sunscreen into this category.

907
01:31:55,954 --> 01:32:00,744
Know, sunscreen and sunblock are two forms, I would say, of PPE.

908
01:32:01,074 --> 01:32:02,724
I'll also say there's clothing you can buy.

909
01:32:02,724 --> 01:32:07,853
So if any of you have been to a sporting goods store and you've seen shirts or clothes that have a UPF label on that,

910
01:32:07,854 --> 01:32:14,664
that's an ultraviolet protection factor. It's basically the sun protection factor, the SPF, but for clothing material.

911
01:32:15,474 --> 01:32:19,974
And so those clothes are specifically designed to keep out ultraviolet light.

912
01:32:21,444 --> 01:32:30,233
So one thing to keep in mind with sunscreen and I can't remember if I have a slide here, I don't, but I'll mention it.

913
01:32:30,234 --> 01:32:40,194
So sunscreen, if you buy it here in the US, you can see SPF values of 50, 60, 70, maybe even higher than that.

914
01:32:40,824 --> 01:32:45,024
If you go to Europe, you will find no values greater than 50.

915
01:32:45,024 --> 01:32:52,224
And in fact, the European Union has essentially forbid American manufacturers of sunscreen from labeling

916
01:32:52,464 --> 01:32:56,874
sunscreen as having an SPF greater than 50 because it's essentially physically impossible.

917
01:32:57,264 --> 01:33:03,413
So it's all this marketing gimmickry that is so common and prevalent in the U.S. But the EU has said,

918
01:33:03,414 --> 01:33:09,054
no, you can't low consumers into a false sense of confidence by you know,

919
01:33:09,054 --> 01:33:15,383
the the assumption here is if if an uninformed consumer says, well, this SPF is 25 and this one's 50,

920
01:33:15,384 --> 01:33:20,634
the 50 must mean I can wear it twice as long as SPF of 100 must mean I can wear it four times as long.

921
01:33:20,844 --> 01:33:26,124
So they're worried about confusion there in addition to, you know, sort of false advertising.

922
01:33:26,124 --> 01:33:32,274
So there's another sort of tension between the U.S. and the EU in terms of regulating PPE in this case.

923
01:33:34,044 --> 01:33:37,013
And then the one other thing I'll mention is in terms of eye protection.

924
01:33:37,014 --> 01:33:42,744
So welder's helmets, for instance, are based on a property called an optical density.

925
01:33:43,224 --> 01:33:51,834
I showed you the example, I think two sessions ago of sort of wearing sunglasses versus wearing a welder's helmet going outside.

926
01:33:52,344 --> 01:33:58,284
Welder's helmets really do need to be substantially attenuating because the welder's face is often very,

927
01:33:58,284 --> 01:34:08,603
very close to this really intense source of UV light. And so the so-called shade number on welding helmets, more shade means it blocks more.

928
01:34:08,604 --> 01:34:15,714
Light is a way, essentially, that we can look at a helmet and decide, is this sufficient protection for the type of welding that's happening?

929
01:34:17,334 --> 01:34:20,904
All right. And then we're in the homestretch now. So just moving on to lasers.

930
01:34:21,774 --> 01:34:26,634
So lasers are a specific form of optical radiation that, as you can see,

931
01:34:26,634 --> 01:34:35,454
propagates with very low spread of the beam or sort of low divergence beam or a high coherent beam is is another way to think of this.

932
01:34:36,044 --> 01:34:43,034
And lasers can be monochromatic, so just a single wavelength, or they can be multiple wavelengths and phase a coherent laser.

933
01:34:43,824 --> 01:34:49,614
They can also be so called continuous wave, meaning they are continuously emitting photons or they can be pulsed,

934
01:34:49,614 --> 01:34:54,984
meaning they're firing pulses of photons that are you know, the pulses are much faster than the human eye can detect.

935
01:34:55,374 --> 01:35:02,783
So they appear continuous. I'll also say if you go online, you can buy some insanely high powered lasers.

936
01:35:02,784 --> 01:35:07,884
So this is someone shooting their laser across the bay towards the Oakland Bay Bridge.

937
01:35:08,574 --> 01:35:15,294
And I think on that same website, they have photos of this person using this off the shelf laser to like catch clothes on fire and stuff.

938
01:35:15,714 --> 01:35:21,624
So I'm not saying you should go out and buy one, but they are out there for sale and very, very dangerous.

939
01:35:22,614 --> 01:35:30,774
I'll mention that there's tons of different kinds of lasers out there, and mostly they're differentiated by the power and also by the media.

940
01:35:31,104 --> 01:35:36,594
So like a carbon dioxide laser has specific applications for the wavelength that it puts out.

941
01:35:36,864 --> 01:35:41,124
And those are different applications than an argon or an exam or gas laser.

942
01:35:41,124 --> 01:35:49,853
So there's a whole host of them out there. When it comes to lasers, there's three kind of main exposure scenarios that we're concerned about.

943
01:35:49,854 --> 01:35:53,664
So the one that comes to mind maybe first is direct exposure.

944
01:35:54,084 --> 01:35:58,163
So so-called intra beam viewing, meaning the beam is going directly into your eye.

945
01:35:58,164 --> 01:36:04,584
That's bad. There's so-called specular reflection, too, meaning the laser is not going directly into your eye,

946
01:36:04,584 --> 01:36:11,574
but rather bouncing off something, maybe a highly reflective surface like a mirror or maybe even a matte surface like the wall here.

947
01:36:12,504 --> 01:36:20,334
And then there's indirect exposure where basically we've got diffusion happening at multiple different angles here.

948
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:28,224
So when it comes to lasers, again, we're most concerned about the eye like we are for all optical radiation.

949
01:36:29,154 --> 01:36:32,994
It's possible that a laser can hurt the cornea, the iris, the lens, the retina,

950
01:36:32,994 --> 01:36:37,014
even to burn directly into the optic nerve connecting your retina to your brain.

951
01:36:38,004 --> 01:36:43,464
And really the depth of the burn is going to be dependent on the wavelength of the laser.

952
01:36:44,124 --> 01:36:51,353
Now, I mentioned the immersion aversion response before, so it turns out an important factor for protecting anybody from optical radiation

953
01:36:51,354 --> 01:36:55,404
is the fact that people don't like to have bright light shown in their eyes.

954
01:36:55,764 --> 01:37:01,583
And so the typical reaction time is a quarter of a second between when a bright light or a laser in

955
01:37:01,584 --> 01:37:06,504
a visible spectrum shines into your eyes and when you're going to involuntarily jerk and look away.

956
01:37:07,164 --> 01:37:11,483
And so that's fine if you've got a laser that's firing for more than a quarter of a second.

957
01:37:11,484 --> 01:37:18,234
But if you've got a laser that's firing in pulses of less than a quarter of a second or a laser that's not in the visible wavelengths,

958
01:37:18,234 --> 01:37:21,414
that aversion response is not going to kick in. It's not going to be helpful.

959
01:37:23,184 --> 01:37:29,934
The skin is a secondary target here. So, you know, a skin injury, of course, the outer layer of skin on our bodies is dead.

960
01:37:30,204 --> 01:37:34,853
That tends to be the layer that accumulates most of the damage with lasers.

961
01:37:34,854 --> 01:37:40,464
You know, unlike ionizing radiation, even the most penetrating damage is typically going to recover over time.

962
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:48,504
And it turns out carbon dioxide, lasers, that particular frequency they put out are the worst basically for human skin,

963
01:37:48,504 --> 01:37:54,534
because the wavelength is the one that penetrates most deeply and because the beam is invisible to the eye.

964
01:37:55,044 --> 01:37:57,294
So that's kind of a bad combination there.

965
01:37:58,194 --> 01:38:05,454
Now, in terms of classifying lasers, there's sort of this old system that we use really exclusively here in the US,

966
01:38:05,454 --> 01:38:14,544
and then there's a new system that's used in the rest of the world and even in parts of the U.S. For both of these increase increasing class means,

967
01:38:14,544 --> 01:38:17,064
increasing energy and increasing health risk.

968
01:38:18,294 --> 01:38:27,384
So in presenting the old system here of class one to class four in Roman numerals, because that's what's in the ocean standards and regulations.

969
01:38:27,684 --> 01:38:31,374
And then the new system is sort of how most products are marketed today.

970
01:38:31,374 --> 01:38:35,994
So we've got a real disconnect between how it's regulated and how lasers are sold.

971
01:38:36,534 --> 01:38:41,483
But again, the idea that a higher class is going to be more dangerous is consistent.

972
01:38:41,484 --> 01:38:49,494
I'll also say who even knows how they come up with this stuff? Like we've got a two, a two or three, a3d versus a two, a two and a3r.

973
01:38:49,494 --> 01:38:53,754
It's like just random random letters that people have chosen out of a hat.

974
01:38:54,594 --> 01:38:56,514
So walking through these quickly,

975
01:38:56,874 --> 01:39:03,084
a class one laser is like the kind of laser you're going to get at a pet shop to drive your cat crazy if you're mean.

976
01:39:03,774 --> 01:39:08,594
So this is exempt from labeling. They're weak enough that they really don't present any hazard at all.

977
01:39:08,604 --> 01:39:12,324
And of course, we always recommend labeling anything that's potentially hazardous.

978
01:39:13,074 --> 01:39:15,894
And the reason I say this is not hazardous is this class of.

979
01:39:16,014 --> 01:39:24,624
Laser puts out energy that you could stare directly into for more than 10000 seconds without risk of harm if you chose to do so.

980
01:39:24,624 --> 01:39:30,144
So that's that's pretty safe. So very, very low output on the order of Microbots here.

981
01:39:31,104 --> 01:39:36,804
Now, one thing to keep in mind, you know, a class one laser is often what is sitting at the grocery store.

982
01:39:37,134 --> 01:39:40,164
It's scanning your your products as you check out.

983
01:39:40,584 --> 01:39:44,694
It may be labeled class one, but it's possible if you're the maintenance person who comes along that,

984
01:39:44,694 --> 01:39:49,104
fix that and you crack the glass open and now it's more like a class three inside.

985
01:39:49,524 --> 01:39:58,854
So even a class one laser could be more harmful if you open it up, for instance, for servicing in class two and class two.

986
01:39:58,884 --> 01:40:03,173
Here again, these are not going to be able to cause accidental injury because they're weak enough

987
01:40:03,174 --> 01:40:07,644
that you're going to and they're visible enough that you're going to turn away. The aversion response is going to kick in.

988
01:40:08,154 --> 01:40:11,654
But in this case, if you did force yourself to look and, you know,

989
01:40:11,844 --> 01:40:16,284
you beamed it directly into your eye for a while, it is possible that some people would get damaged.

990
01:40:17,424 --> 01:40:18,774
You know, class two A,

991
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:26,124
you're you're still going to be able to to gaze into for a thousand plus seconds with no risk in class two is a little bit more powerful,

992
01:40:26,544 --> 01:40:34,694
still less than the one. Miller What a class three A is not going to be able to hurt you as long as you're looking with your unaided eye.

993
01:40:34,704 --> 01:40:40,944
But if you were to shine that through binoculars or a telescope in your eye, it could get further focused in hard on you.

994
01:40:41,784 --> 01:40:47,574
And these are the kinds of things that you see out all the time for road crews who are doing surveys of roadways.

995
01:40:47,904 --> 01:40:52,524
So we're sort of moving up in the power output. Now we're up to less than five milliwatts.

996
01:40:53,784 --> 01:40:56,784
Class three B is a moderate output here.

997
01:40:56,784 --> 01:41:00,054
So now we're up to half. Of what? That's a little more oomph there.

998
01:41:00,354 --> 01:41:05,994
These can change your eye if you beam it directly into your eye, even for a short duration.

999
01:41:06,534 --> 01:41:15,024
But the good news is, generally, they won't catch things on fire. And here we want very specific control measures to reduce the risk of these lasers.

1000
01:41:15,564 --> 01:41:21,894
And then we come to Class four. And these are like the the bad ones. So more than a half a lot of output here.

1001
01:41:22,224 --> 01:41:26,273
These can hurt you, whether you look into them indirectly, directly, excuse me,

1002
01:41:26,274 --> 01:41:31,524
or whether they're bouncing off surfaces, even matte surfaces like this into your eyes.

1003
01:41:32,244 --> 01:41:37,014
And these are also the kinds of things that can, you know, present a fire hazard.

1004
01:41:37,494 --> 01:41:39,204
So in terms of engineering controls,

1005
01:41:39,204 --> 01:41:47,664
really what we want to do here is have an area that's controlled that the laser is used inside and the light doesn't travel outside that area.

1006
01:41:48,354 --> 01:41:52,614
If we've got a really powerful laser, we might say, I don't want someone in the room with that laser.

1007
01:41:52,614 --> 01:41:57,474
We'll monitor the laser with the camera so the person's eyes are never physically in that space.

1008
01:41:58,014 --> 01:42:02,514
And then in terms of administrative controls, if you've got powerful lasers in a company,

1009
01:42:02,514 --> 01:42:05,694
you're going to need to have a laser safety officer designated.

1010
01:42:05,694 --> 01:42:08,964
You're going to want to have signs. This is maybe my favorite site of all time.

1011
01:42:09,864 --> 01:42:13,704
You're gonna want to have standard operating procedures and maybe medical approval.

1012
01:42:13,714 --> 01:42:21,984
So if you've got people who have cataract surgery or skin sensitivity or other issues, you know, maybe they shouldn't be in your room with the lasers.

1013
01:42:22,734 --> 01:42:28,684
And then just wrapping up in terms of PPE, you know, we don't want clothing that's going to burst into flames if the laser hits it.

1014
01:42:28,704 --> 01:42:34,613
So for class fours, we're going to want heat and flame resistant. And there is a ton of different eyewear out there,

1015
01:42:34,614 --> 01:42:43,554
all sort of equally attractive as this that's specifically tuned to an optical density that will attenuate your laser down to a safe level.

1016
01:42:44,694 --> 01:42:48,714
All right. With that, we're out of time. Next class is our last class, as I said.

1017
01:42:48,714 --> 01:42:53,454
And we will be talking about thermal and cold stress. So thanks, everybody, and I will see you next week.
