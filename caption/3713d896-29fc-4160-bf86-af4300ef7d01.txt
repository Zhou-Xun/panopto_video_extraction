1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,590
All right, so give me a minute. If everything's good.

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,330
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if we've officially that. No, so far.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,410
Yeah, I did. So you took over the course from Carol?

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The thing going on? Yeah.

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:35,990
Yeah, I know. It was fun. And then I was like, you know, I'll tell you what happened, but I really think so.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,020
Yeah. It's a learning process for all. Oh, yeah. No, it's really great, actually.

7
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,070
How are you going to the hospital? Uh, yeah. Six and a half years.

8
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,490
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,040
Yeah. Do it here. Yeah. Well, this is scary is the IP.

10
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,580
I mean, I discovered ship insurance over there, and so I met her through that.

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,010
We had been. Last year.

12
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:13,490
She was the manager. She was the man of the year.

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,740
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, she plays and sometimes.

14
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,100
Yes. So this this is this class has been going for over 11 years.

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,820
I'm really grateful for people like you.

16
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,380
You know, people you give these lectures.

17
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,890
Oh, sure. Yeah. Well, I'm glad you like it is, because I can talk.

18
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,130
I do research. You know, I can talk about. But I don't.

19
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,480
I just don't have the breath, you know? Yeah.

20
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:56,270
Yeah. I think the topic, like, that's. It's nice to have different like boots on the ground.

21
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,340
Oh, it's really important. That's really important. All right, let's see.

22
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,650
You probably want to have the, you know, presentation.

23
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,250
Yeah. Yeah. There you go. All right. Terrific. And those are my questions here.

24
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:22,400
All right. So hello, so very delighted to have Dr. Petit come and talk to us about a very important topic, which antibiotic stewardship.

25
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,620
And so just.

26
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,620
Yeah, please register for the symposium if I didn't say that.

27
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:40,699
Well, you know, um, and you know, there, there will be coffee and frank foods, but there will be really good lectures.

28
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,349
And I know you should all have that time available because it's during class at least the morning.

29
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:53,900
So please come and there is lunch provided. And so it helps to register because we have to tell them how much lunch to provide.

30
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,490
Yes. So it's your tax dollars at work.

31
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,989
So thank you so much. Yeah, thanks for having me.

32
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:09,410
So and I appreciate that you trajectory to actually experience it so they kind of know.

33
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:21,980
Sure. So I learned about antibiotic stewardship when I was a resident, but then it was just me having to call to get antibiotics approved.

34
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:29,180
And it was really scary because they it was like asking someone who knew way more than me about antibiotics if I could use this antibiotic.

35
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:39,049
And then as an infectious disease fellow, I was on the other end of that and learning more about like why it matters as much,

36
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:44,480
which was not something I focused on during my residency and then got to start to work on antimicrobial

37
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,799
stewardship projects and loved that I could do something that was both like in doing it and doing stewardship.

38
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,140
I could focus on the patient in front of me,

39
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:01,490
but also focus on something that is a shared resource for society at large and trying to help improve on a bigger scale.

40
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:11,780
So I liked that I could do both things. I also liked that it was something where it could be a part of my job, like for administrative tasks,

41
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,849
but also then the intervention project base work of it lends itself to research too.

42
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,660
So it kind of was like killing two birds with one stone from that respect.

43
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:30,680
But when I came to them six and a half years ago, there wasn't an outpatient stewardship program, which still even now there aren't very many.

44
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,060
But it's as we'll talk about, becoming more and more common.

45
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:41,540
And so I had the opportunity to then develop and then leading the outpatient stewardship program.

46
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,130
So I worked both in the hospital for stewardship and outside of the hospital in our clinics.

47
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,919
And so that's what we're going to talk about today, is kind of stewardship in the hospital and outside of the hospital.

48
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,020
And while the overall theme of preventing antibiotic resistance is there in both and improving patient care,

49
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,670
there are different kind of tools and techniques that we use.

50
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:11,730
So my goals and objectives today are to outline the core elements of an acute care amicable stewardship program or inpatient.

51
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,940
Compare the differences between inpatient and outpatient stewardship,

52
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,170
and review some tools and techniques used in both spaces by microbial stewardship programs.

53
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,210
And apparently I have weird animations on the surface, but also highlighting the need for animal stewardship.

54
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:32,970
So this has been called the end of the antibiotic era.

55
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,520
There are different images and posters of the W.H.O. and CDC trying to kind of get that message across.

56
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:47,640
And I will say that over the course of the last five years, I definitely had more patients asking me like, do I really need that antibiotic?

57
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,360
So things are starting to kind of change and it's starting to get out into public knowledge.

58
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,370
But that may also be a little bit of like the Ann Arbor bubble and may not know.

59
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,790
It probably doesn't really fully extend.

60
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:08,610
And we see this because if you look at the development of antibiotics, which is the blue line,

61
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:16,320
you can see that then resistance really has been identified for basically every antibiotic after a period of time once we start using it.

62
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:23,730
So which is why we need to keep developing more and use them on them when we need them.

63
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:35,969
But the antibiotic pipeline and this is a dated, although is mostly still true, the antibiotic pipeline has just decreased over time.

64
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,520
And so we're not keeping up with the pace of resistance.

65
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:45,990
In the last couple of years, there have been a couple more gram negative agents that have been developed,

66
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:56,640
but again, not really at the pace that we need. And if you want to know why that's happening, it's because one developing new drug takes years.

67
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:05,190
And so this is what's happening today really started eight, ten years ago where there wasn't enough development happening.

68
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,149
The return on investment is low compared to a drug for a chronic disease.

69
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,070
So you think about developing something for diabetes and a patient is going to take it

70
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,600
for the rest of their life versus an antibiotic where we're like shorter is better.

71
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,090
So treat for three days and like the kind of money that the drug company can make is so much lower.

72
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:31,590
Drug development costs a lot. Once new drugs are made, then as stewards, we're like, don't use it.

73
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,500
Like we need to save it for when we need it.

74
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:40,649
And so then, you know, a drug company is not going to make what they need, but there are lots of new HIV drugs,

75
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,850
for example, antiretrovirals, because that's a drug for chronic disease at this point.

76
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:53,370
And so and then another issue is that there's a lack of FDA guidance regarding which studies are evidence

77
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,689
that the agency finds acceptable to demonstrate efficacy of new drugs in the setting of antibiotics,

78
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,740
or a lot of non-inferiority studies and issues with like even once things are shown,

79
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,780
the approval process has been really challenging and there have been some new drugs that don't end up getting approved.

80
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,669
So this isn't antibiotic development.

81
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:15,150
It's not really set up for success within our like market system.

82
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:31,080
So each year there are is a significant amount of antibiotic resistant infections and then also deaths from those infections.

83
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:46,880
And so this is broken up between just gram negative or antibiotic resistance and then specifically your spouse

84
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:54,050
or extended spectrum beta lactams or a group of gram negative bacteria that are common and like sorry,

85
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:07,680
it's try it here. Common and like urinary tract infections and abdominal infections and things that are common in hospitalized patients.

86
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,090
And this has been rising and the cost of treating these infections is also very high.

87
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,320
So if you look at the cases over time, they've been increasing.

88
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:32,180
So we think about antibiotic use and overuse leading to antibiotic resistance,

89
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:40,460
also increasing costs, increase of Clostridium difficile, increase in adverse drug events.

90
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:46,730
And a study recently showed that of patients admitted to the hospital if given an antibiotic,

91
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,600
20% of them or one in five have an antibiotic associated adverse drug IT.

92
00:09:52,400 --> 00:10:03,500
And antibiotics account for one fifth of ATV related visits to the ED for adults and

93
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:09,010
is the top reason for advance adverse drug events related to kids going to the e.d.

94
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,870
So antibiotic use itself is the most important modifiable driver of antibiotic resistance.

95
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,900
And a recent study showed that increased resistance or increased antibiotic use in a

96
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,490
neighborhood outside of the hospital increases the risk of a multidrug resistant infection.

97
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:44,790
So thinking of our neighbors that we see on TV and Mr. Rogers, you wouldn't want to give your favorite neighbor of MDR infection.

98
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,260
So just like thinking about this again as a shared resource.

99
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:58,390
Antibiotic resistant infections lead to higher health care costs, poor health outcomes and more toxic treatments.

100
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:08,710
So the CDC has been looking at this for a while and shows that antibiotic use is really common in hospitals.

101
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:14,320
So we think about basically half of patients admitted to the hospital at any given time receive an antibiotic.

102
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:20,170
And that's been really stable. And there has been a shift to a more broad spectrum use over time.

103
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,450
And looking at that use, up to half of it has been considered inappropriate in these studies.

104
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,139
So it's being used commonly, and that makes sense because people come in really sick.

105
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,520
You're trying to sort out what's going on, but often the antibiotic isn't needed.

106
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:49,360
And that's just in the hospital. Outside of the hospital is where most antibiotic use is, is where most antibiotics are used,

107
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,940
and which is why it's important to also think about adaptation structure.

108
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:10,450
So how can we do decrease antibiotic use? So we want to focus, I spelled wisely wrong on antibiotic appropriateness.

109
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,500
So I think about this with a couple of different kind of groupings.

110
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:21,220
So one is antibiotic overdiagnosis. So does a patient need an antibiotic at all?

111
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,910
So like, is this an infection that would improve with the use of an antibiotic?

112
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,860
And I'll use this kind of symbol on prior slides to indicate that the next antibiotic selection.

113
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:39,220
So they need an antibiotic. But have I chosen the most targeted antibiotic that I can for that infection?

114
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,220
And then the four antibiotic duration being the third thing that we think about.

115
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:52,060
So they need an antibiotic that I've chosen the shortest duration possible to treat their infection because every day counts.

116
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,360
That's a real change, isn't it? The duration. Yeah.

117
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,660
Yeah. It is hard to get it wrong. Get it fast.

118
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,020
Yeah. And it used to be very much.

119
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:13,510
I mean, and I still hear this all the time that you should take the whole course of antibiotics, otherwise you'll develop resistance.

120
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:27,520
But really, the resistance that develops most infections is not the resistance of that infection you're treating, but inside of your own microbiome.

121
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,120
And the longer you're taking antibiotics, the more that you're affecting all the other bacteria.

122
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,280
So inventory prescribing patterns vary by region and country,

123
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:42,309
which also tells us that we can improve because if some places are doing it or giving a lot less antibiotics,

124
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:47,890
the likelihood that there's really that many less infections in the south versus the north or whatever doesn't really make sense.

125
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,880
So this is by country showing and this is really old but really hasn't changed showing that

126
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,650
the United States is one of the highest users of antibiotics compared to other countries.

127
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,470
And then if you think about countries that are higher use of higher uses of antibiotics, you see more resistance.

128
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:16,940
So this is pulling data on antibiotic use from 2015.

129
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,520
And you can see that it really varies.

130
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,890
Sweden knows what's going on. Right.

131
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:30,950
Like they're doing a really good job from a stewardship perspective and it's something that they have as a country have really focused on.

132
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,670
But other places have a lot more work to do.

133
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:43,100
And then if you look to you think about the antibiotic resistance being much more in certain countries than other.

134
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:55,210
And a lot of that is driven by antibiotic use. So if we look at the United States and outpatient prescribing rates and dividing it up by region.

135
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:02,140
I already mentioned that some one region uses significantly more than others.

136
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:15,130
Anyone have a guess as to which higher user? Maybe gas doesn't come, so maybe ding, ding, ding.

137
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:22,510
Yeah. And then compare that to the west, which is a much lower user.

138
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:28,870
So certainly in the Midwest, we're kind of in the middle. Right. So certainly big variations.

139
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:39,070
So ten years ago when they were we were first trying to think about antibiotic use outside of the hospital being an issue.

140
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:45,910
The CDC helped lead a big study looking at antibiotic prescribing and tried to kind of quantify the problem to understand it.

141
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,540
So they found that over the course of a year,

142
00:15:53,770 --> 00:16:01,110
almost 300 million course of antibiotics were given with a rate of over five prescriptions written yearly for every six people.

143
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:09,249
So almost like on average person. And if you think about like yourself, how many times in the last year have you gotten an antibiotic?

144
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,520
Sometimes in the last five years. So it's not necessarily every individual.

145
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,140
Right, but so some are really getting a lot.

146
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:23,709
The highest group prescribing is Pedes, but among adults, it's those older than 65, which makes a lot of sense.

147
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:29,890
Right? Like kids, ear infections, sinus infections, other things.

148
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,620
Strep tends to happen more often in children.

149
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,940
And then in a lot of ways, there's so many similarities between kids and older adults, and then more infections happen at that point.

150
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,820
Again, this our regional variation. The highest prescribers were in family practice,

151
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:53,440
which also kind of makes sense in that they are seeing the whole spectrum and so they're taking care of both those patient populations.

152
00:16:54,550 --> 00:17:01,770
A surprise found in the study was that dentists accounted for 10% of antibiotic use, which is huge, right.

153
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:08,860
So that highlighted a need for storage up within dentistry and making sure that

154
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,310
antibiotics were being used appropriately and again in the most targeted possible.

155
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:19,120
And then also lower education and income with the patient was associated with higher prescribing.

156
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,850
And some of that may have also been we can theorize what that may be,

157
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:33,190
but like volume in those clinics harder to do follow up potentially and so wanting to get the antibiotic for just in case.

158
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,820
So thinking about those three different ways that we think about how we can impact antibiotic use.

159
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:50,880
First, thinking about overdiagnosis. So many infections or abnormal tests don't require antibiotics.

160
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:57,160
And this has been like a big effort that we've been trying to target.

161
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:07,299
So one of the common things that we see is treatment of asymptomatic bacteria or a positive urine culture in a patient that doesn't have symptoms,

162
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:16,360
that does not require a treatment. Bronchitis is a huge example of an infection that doesn't require antibiotics that often gets antibiotics.

163
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:23,560
Most COVID doesn't require antibiotics, but often patients still are getting antibiotics.

164
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:31,030
For COVID, sinusitis often does it require antibiotics, and some otitis media doesn't require antibiotics.

165
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:43,510
So different studies have tried to look at the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing in the U.S. And so this one looked across different

166
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:51,459
diagnoses and found that one of the highest areas of antibiotic overuse in outpatient setting is in acute respiratory infections.

167
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,920
So thinking about coughs and colds and found that 50% of antibiotics prescribed were unnecessary

168
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:01,569
and considering that's like the biggest bulk of type of infection in the outpatient space,

169
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:08,470
this is a big area to target. Among all diagnoses, about 30% of antibiotics were unnecessary.

170
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:19,750
And within the way this study was done, they really couldn't get as good of a handle on whether or not the diagnosis was appropriate, too.

171
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:27,700
So this was like somebody coding for a diagnosis where an antibiotic is not indicated versus so like coding

172
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:34,209
for a viral infection or acute a first point actually giving an antibiotic versus coding for sinusitis.

173
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,390
And maybe they need antibiotics or maybe not, but they gave the benefit of the doubt there.

174
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:43,650
So 30% really is an underestimate. So I'm thinking about selection.

175
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,959
There have been multiple studies looking at different diagnoses and whether or not

176
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,510
the prescription is appropriate or that the antibiotic selection is appropriate.

177
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:59,879
So, for example, in the U.S., looking across acute otitis media of sinusitis,

178
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,980
pharyngitis found that the antibiotic selected was appropriate about 50% of the time.

179
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,460
So definitely room for improvement in those matters because targeted is better for antibiotics.

180
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:17,690
So broad spectrum antibiotic in multiple studies has been associated with increased risk of mortality,

181
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:27,540
acute kidney injury, Clostridium difficile very or vancomycin resistant enterococcus they're existing gram negatives.

182
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,540
So adverse events, bad outcomes, more resistance associated with broad spectrum use.

183
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:40,530
So targeted is better. And that's why we care about selection and then thinking about antibiotic duration.

184
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:49,290
So shorter is better. Mostly there's never anything that's like 100% rate, but duration is really mostly based on historical precedent.

185
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:56,820
So fact or fiction, I guess we already just talked about this giving too little antibiotics can select for resistance.

186
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,870
So, no, that's not what we should be thinking,

187
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:08,640
that longer durations of antibiotics actually are what's associated with increased resistance in your microbiome and your patient's microbiome.

188
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,320
And that's what we see in the hospital, especially, too.

189
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:21,629
So more and more studies are being done to challenge this dogma of how long we really need to give antibiotics.

190
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,920
And time and again,

191
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:32,040
they find that these studies have found that giving less antibiotics results in the same outcomes for across multiple different infections.

192
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:44,120
And despite different guideline recommendations for treatment durations, we see that repeatedly durations are too long.

193
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:49,410
So acute sinusitis, what antibiotics are needed should be treated for 5 to 7 days.

194
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,710
But a study found that over two thirds of courses were given for ten days or more.

195
00:21:54,790 --> 00:22:01,749
And if you exclude azithromycin, which is like a five pack, that really lasts for about ten days based off its duration,

196
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,430
which is commonly used inappropriately for sinusitis, it would be 90% of cases.

197
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:10,300
So just everyone's prescribing it too long or prescribing the wrong antibiotic.

198
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:18,880
In England, they looked at different upper respiratory infections and found that two thirds of antibiotics

199
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:24,940
exceeded treatment durations and that half for bladder infections extended durations.

200
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:31,180
And in Canada, across multiple different types of infections, found that about 20% were longer than recommended.

201
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,810
So here is where we think that every day counts.

202
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:43,360
So additional days of antibiotics are associated with increased and rising risk of CHF or acute kidney injury in studies.

203
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:50,110
So stopping an antibiotic earlier, even when appropriate, is important.

204
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:58,680
So we've tried to look at what the factors are associated with in inappropriate outpatient prescribing.

205
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:04,430
And so what's causing this? If we have guidelines that recommend certain things, why are patients getting more?

206
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:10,150
So there are clinic factors like what type of clinic?

207
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:19,070
And so this study looked at where there were more visits with antibiotics prescribed inappropriately for that type for a respiratory diagnosis.

208
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,870
And urgent care centers. What really stood out here as an area to target for improvement?

209
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:31,800
Retail clinics where a lot of people I think would have a lot of people in it would have expected to have poor prescribing, actually.

210
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,360
But we're doing very well. And I think a lot of that is like that.

211
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,530
They have very clear algorithms that are stewardship friendly,

212
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:45,739
that are really driven by and treated by advanced practice practitioners and just, you know,

213
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:53,000
the rules are followed and go for there versus urgent care where I think they see a lot more

214
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,350
variety and a wider variety and patients are a little bit sicker than in the retail clinics.

215
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:04,870
And so there's a lot more room potentially for kind of concern about if I don't treat this patient today, do they have close follow up their PCP?

216
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:15,530
You know, are they going to be okay? Do they have it because it's more of like a health care safety net and a lot of way to clinician factors.

217
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,730
So in general,

218
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:25,879
so one said it showed that adults looking along different primary care homes seen by

219
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,840
an advanced practice practitioner were 50% more likely to receive an antibiotic.

220
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:38,150
And then late and mid-career physicians or those that have been around for longer are associate with longer duration,

221
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:45,050
which makes sense because that's how they were trained. And kind of stepping back and trying to change practice can be really hard.

222
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,140
And then there are patient factors.

223
00:24:48,740 --> 00:25:03,610
So longer duration was associated with female patients, younger age, less office visits overall that practice in more rural practices.

224
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:07,430
So again, thinking about that patient, not being able to come back necessarily as easily.

225
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:15,200
And then treatment of antibiotics in the study using antibiotics inappropriately for a viral infection was associated with patients who are older,

226
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,680
had more co-morbidities, patients who had increased office visits and then larger, more rural practices.

227
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:29,670
So, again, I think antibiotics are being used here for, you know, patients that are frail or can't come back that just in case mortality.

228
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:37,310
There's a lot of thinking that antibiotics are safe and it's safer to give the antibiotics as opposed to thinking about the harms associated with it.

229
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,390
So the first George Bush was inpatient in a microbial structure programs.

230
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:54,080
So what exactly is admirable stewardship? It's the effort to measure antibiotic prescribing, to improve antibiotic prescribing.

231
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:59,930
And so the antibiotics are only prescribed when they're needed.

232
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:07,190
And this is also to minimize misdiagnoses or delayed diagnoses leading to other use of antibiotics and to ensure that the right drug,

233
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:14,329
dose and duration are selected when an antibiotic is needed. Which was not to say, basically,

234
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:22,010
we want to help empower physicians or clinicians to make the best antibiotic choice possible for the patient to help improve their care.

235
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:32,389
So the goals of an amicable stewardship program are to ensure appropriate and microbial use to improve patient outcomes and

236
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:40,130
reduce adverse events to reduce or attenuate advancing antimicrobial resistance and to decrease health care expenditures.

237
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:50,999
So stewardship teams are often made up of multiple people when resources are available,

238
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,910
but then also they really collaborate across the health care system to work on different types of projects.

239
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:07,920
So the directors of an ACP program ideally should be covered by a infectious disease physician and an infectious disease trained pharmacist.

240
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:16,140
And then that group may be bigger or smaller or bigger from there, but ideally both.

241
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:23,250
Some hospital resources only allow for one or the other, and then they work with many different people.

242
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:30,659
So work with infection prevention, hospital epidemiologists, administrators, lots of work with informatics, the micro lab,

243
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:40,860
or close partners with other clinical pharmacy specialists and other and then other specialists as we work on projects directed.

244
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,550
So for example, when working on head and neck infections, working with the anti.

245
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,940
So the CDC has different core elements of hospital antibiotic stewardship programs

246
00:27:53,940 --> 00:28:00,360
that each hospital or each surgery program is recommended to use for best success.

247
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:05,320
And this is then backed up by the Joint Commission.

248
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:15,029
So we'll go through each one. The first is leadership commitment, meaning that that you are the hospital is dedicating the necessary human,

249
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,750
financial and I.T. support needed for the program.

250
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:24,000
And then accountability is appointing a single leader responsible for the program's outcomes.

251
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,760
So, again, every physician or pharmacist. Then there's drug expertise.

252
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,310
So appointing a single pharmacist leader responsible to help improve antibiotic use action.

253
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:44,810
So at the very base implementing at least one action each year, for example,

254
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:54,020
systemic evaluation of ongoing treatment or for example, like doing an antibiotic timeout after 48 hours.

255
00:28:54,020 --> 00:29:01,520
But I'll show you many examples of interventions tracking, so monitoring, antibiotic prescribing and resistance patterns across the hospital,

256
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:11,810
reporting out to relevant staff and educating clinicians and also in our patients about resistance and improving prescribing.

257
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:21,229
So there are core strategies that are used and then there are additional strategies.

258
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:29,540
And so every Antibiotics Stewardship Program really needs to use the core strategies and then kind of within the toolkit, use other things.

259
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:37,790
So those core strategies are audit with feedback and intervention in either formulary or restriction or pre-authorization.

260
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:41,090
So that like calling to get approval for an antibiotic, for example.

261
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,680
And then there are many additional strategies which we'll kind of go through.

262
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:51,920
So I think about any kind of intervention that we develop and pulling from a

263
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,820
toolkit to help determine which tools we want to use for that intervention.

264
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:06,600
So one tool is that formulary restrictions are saying these broader antibiotics, not just anyone in the hospital, can use.

265
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,890
You have to get the advice from an I.D., physician or pharmacist to make sure that that's what's needed for your patient.

266
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,849
There's de-escalation as a tool also in certain types of conditions, allowing for broader use upfront,

267
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:23,400
but making sure there's a time point where you're working to target and narrow as you have more information

268
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:31,830
improving the dose or dose optimization of the antibiotic to better treat the infection within it.

269
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:38,040
Different clinical decision support tools to help nudge prescribers to make the right choice.

270
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:44,959
Posters throughout the hospital and work rooms or pocket cards or pocket cards.

271
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,790
Now really more like pdf things on your phone because people have less like stuff in their pockets.

272
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:59,150
Focusing on switching from I.V. to intravenous to oral medications to decrease adverse events.

273
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,139
Working through order sets to help make sure that orders that are being used for

274
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:10,670
different admissions help improve are focusing on improving antibiotic use,

275
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,260
education of the clinicians throughout the hospital,

276
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:26,270
development of guidelines that use both national guidelines but clarify them for your local setting and then audit and feedback.

277
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:30,620
So reviewing certain cases and telling people how they did or how they could improve.

278
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:44,480
So this study looked at the impact of either just giving some education and then letting people do what they want.

279
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:55,700
Or education, plus oversight from an amicable stewardship program and basically found that education alone is not impactful or effective.

280
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,940
And it's really that additional kind of hands on help and support that's needed for the best improvement.

281
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:15,280
So. It's really kind of focusing on all these different things to help improve care.

282
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:25,540
So again, it was those teams that had the the in microbial stewardship team that were more likely to

283
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:31,360
see a decrease in aromatics and an improvement in those receiving a guideline appropriate.

284
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:38,229
Those patients also then seen by those teams, had a shorter length of stay, which is good.

285
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:44,020
So they were getting better markedly in back home. But in-hospital mortality rates didn't differ between the two groups.

286
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:52,610
So there are kind of more broader general interventions like drug restriction.

287
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:58,519
But a lot of what startup does is actually creating very much infection or symptoms syndrome,

288
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,200
specific interventions like for a community acquired pneumonia or UTX, for example.

289
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:14,259
So this is an example done at U of M of a bundle which really stewardship stole all those bundled

290
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:20,799
approach from IP and started using it for stewardship effectively to help manage staph aureus bacteremia,

291
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,750
which is a really common infection that we see in ID and that for many years was.

292
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:35,820
Staff itself can kind of surprise and how aggressive it can be.

293
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:40,950
And it's really important to kind of go through all these different checks and make sure that infection

294
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:46,060
has been checked for in many places and it wasn't being done in leading to bad patient outcomes.

295
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,660
So creating the bundle that was driven by stewardship in order to help improve care.

296
00:33:53,700 --> 00:34:02,470
And so with this. Yeah.

297
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:13,570
So looking at the completion of the bundle, so again, the pre or sorry, the pre intervention group was just doing usual care.

298
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:23,379
The post ESP intervention required that a kind of stewardship consult basically happened for each patient with staph aureus, bacteremia.

299
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:28,810
There was an alert. They knew about them, they went after them and said, Make sure you do these six things.

300
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,450
So for that intervention, they use formulary or.

301
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:41,910
Sorry, that's not it. So.

302
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:50,510
And with that. In the post intervention group.

303
00:34:53,480 --> 00:35:01,040
Oh, sorry. All the endpoints were completed, much more likely to be completed as somebody was holding their hand through it.

304
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:10,580
But looking at outcomes, there was less readmission in 30 days for patients where all of those that bundle had been completed.

305
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:15,410
So again, showing an improvement in outcomes with stewardship, hand-holding and support.

306
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:27,280
So some challenges to antibiotic stewardship are that there is a culture in health care of autonomy.

307
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:37,690
So telling clinicians what to do and that their prescription is not ideal and that you should switch to something else can create friction.

308
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:46,930
Education is an important part of all stewardship, but is not enough or is not sufficient on its own.

309
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,900
And that requires a lot more resources to do more than just education.

310
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:57,520
Single time points. Compensation is an issue and then overall workload.

311
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:11,700
Overall workload to be an issue, meaning for the clinician who is being asked to call to get an antibiotic approved

312
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,169
or kind of being paused and what they're doing and when they're really busy,

313
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:23,790
it doesn't always try to make sure that your stewardship intervention is at the right time and goes with the workflow is really important.

314
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:31,650
So it's important to help convince prescribers and clinicians that their actions are linked to resistance.

315
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:38,340
So kind of overcoming just that decision of like trying to be safe for that individual patient,

316
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:43,710
but thinking about society, a lot of prescribers don't think that they are the problem.

317
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:52,950
And so trying to help convince them and really a lot of that comes from that individual audit and feedback because when just percentages are shown,

318
00:36:53,010 --> 00:37:00,360
they don't see themselves as part of the issue, helping them overcome the fear of that individual patient.

319
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,659
So talking them through the case that you've reviewed it and that you think that this would

320
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:10,500
be a better choice overcoming the viewpoint that some prescribers have of stewardship,

321
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,459
that they're just trying to like pick the cheaper antibiotic, try to help control costs.

322
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:21,960
And that's true because like the older antibiotics, the ones we're trying to get more and use less of, the newer ones are significantly cheaper.

323
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,660
But that's kind of a side benefit and not the reason that we're doing these

324
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,760
things and then trying to avoid a stewardship being viewed as the antibiotic.

325
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,059
Please. So like I'm in control. You're not in control.

326
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,620
I'm going to decide what you get to do, what you don't. And instead being like, this is a partnership.

327
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:42,390
We're both trying to make sure that the care of the patient is the best possible, which is the goal.

328
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:54,020
And then another big challenge and you have to accept that I think we have not done a good job of it is patient education

329
00:37:55,250 --> 00:38:02,990
and trying to help patients know when antibiotics are necessary or not and change some different long held beliefs.

330
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:12,200
So encouraging and a lot of this really needs to happen more in the outpatient space so that antibiotics are really useful for bacterial infections,

331
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:20,300
not for viral infections. And what what infections are more likely to be viral versus bacterial, that not all fevers are due to an infection.

332
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:24,950
And fevers can be caused by a lot of different things and that not all infections are due to bacteria.

333
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:31,820
One thing that can help and some of that is some different rapid diagnostics.

334
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:39,170
There are more and more tests for viral infections, which is really helpful versus being like, well, I don't think you have a bacterial infection.

335
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:45,950
I think you have a viral infection. But being able to be like, see, this is influenza or this is RSV or this is COVID can be really helpful.

336
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:54,199
Another thing that's helpful is that we have a lot more access to the patients setting to rapid susceptibility testing so

337
00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:02,779
that for patients who have multi-drug resistant organisms or who are more likely to have other drug resistant organisms,

338
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:06,800
we can get that information back more quickly to get them on the most targeted antibiotic.

339
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,310
So as of 2017,

340
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:24,340
the Joint Commission that accredited hospitals required each hospital to have a stewardship program which hospitals had started to across the country.

341
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:30,059
But it is as of now, I think it's really 98% of hospitals across the country,

342
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,110
even small critical access hospitals have some kind of stewardship program, which is awesome.

343
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,230
Ideally, you have that bigger team, right?

344
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:44,040
But a lot of smaller hospitals, there isn't necessarily even an I.V. trained physician or an Ivy trained pharmacist.

345
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:51,540
So it's somebody else who's not only trained but gets appointed to be the leader of this kind of specialized knowledge.

346
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:59,460
CMS proposed a rule that. Sorry.

347
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,600
So the other point I want to make, so it was impatience towards the ship that came first.

348
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,580
But then as of two years ago, outpatient stewardship is also required,

349
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,059
which is having much slower uptake and partly because the joint commission accredits hospitals.

350
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:21,750
So those outpatient clinics are associate with the hospital in order for a joint commission to accredited,

351
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,630
have to have an outpatient stewardship program or be starting to do this.

352
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:31,229
This work versus so many outpatient clinics are associated with the hospital and so they don't really care about the joint commission in the same way.

353
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:36,570
So it doesn't have the same teeth to it. So when was this proposed by CNS?

354
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:44,260
About the. So is that a couple of years ago?

355
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:47,790
I'm pretty sure. So I think that it is required now. Okay.

356
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:55,820
Yeah. So I'm pretty certain that it is requiredto just partly offset the 98%.

357
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,020
Stewardship really is what's required. Right.

358
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,520
And even joint commission requiring it alone isn't enough because not all hospitals are joint commission accredited.

359
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,270
So it's really the CMA portion because Medicare patients come everywhere.

360
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:14,840
Yeah. And so then to talk a little bit about outpatient and microbial stewardship.

361
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:19,450
So there are as I said, there are CDC core elements for inpatient.

362
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:24,680
There were seven, there are four for outpatient. So first is commitment.

363
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:32,960
So this idea of committing as a clinic to improving antibiotic prescribing and stewardship.

364
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,650
So writing in displaying public comments in support of antibiotics,

365
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:42,500
identifying a single leader who's responsible for antibiotic stewardship activities within a facility.

366
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:50,540
And so often this would not be an infectious disease provider because many clinics don't offer including stewardship related duties in

367
00:41:50,540 --> 00:42:02,059
that in the job description for that person who's appointed and then thinking throughout the clinic of trying to keep the same message.

368
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:08,570
Right, so that the medical assistant who's rooming the patient isn't like, oh, that sounds bad, ultimately antibiotic.

369
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,260
Right? And then you have to reframe after the physician in the room.

370
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,260
So trying to make sure that all the staff is being educated in the same way.

371
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,650
So the second core element is action for policy and practice.

372
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:26,090
So that's using evidence based diagnostic criteria and treatment recommendations.

373
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:33,620
There's different ways that you can try to do this. So one example is using delayed prescribing practices or watchful waiting.

374
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:40,849
So the the person with the sinus infection who's been sick for three days probably doesn't need an antibiotic yet.

375
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:45,230
But after they've been sick for seven days, if they're not getting any better or they got better or they got worse,

376
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:54,350
having that antibiotic ready for them if they need it is one approach about I don't really like it because I think it gives mixed messages.

377
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:58,370
It's better just to make it so that the patient can easily contact you again if they're not getting better,

378
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,670
providing communication skills, training for clinicians.

379
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:13,190
So helping clinicians have tools to better have these conversations with patients because a lot of people come with like,

380
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,870
well, my snot is green and my pediatrician always gave this to me.

381
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:21,229
And then my other doctor and then I moved here. And you're telling me that I can't get an antibiotic?

382
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:27,410
I need that, right? That's the only way I get better rate. And so trying to help think about how to frame those conversations for success.

383
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:38,270
One tool for action is to require explicit written justification in the medical record for non recommended antibiotic prescribing.

384
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:46,339
So you go to prescribe an antibiotic and have an ICD ten code or like the billing code as a viral infection.

385
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,639
And it says like, wait, you shouldn't be giving an antibiotic. Why are you doing that?

386
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:57,980
You need to write down why you think it's appropriate for this patient providing support in the medical record or in the EMR,

387
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:03,110
just like an inpatient that helps nudge providers to make the right decision.

388
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,660
And then another thing that's recommended is using that like telephone triage

389
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:13,910
call centers to help improve antibiotic use and prevent unnecessary visits.

390
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:20,180
And video visits are becoming a really helpful tool for that to, you know, so the person who is like,

391
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:28,040
do I need antibiotics for a sinus infection or not doesn't need to miss work to come to the appointment and then feel like

392
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:34,219
I really need something to because I just have to miss half a day of work and wanting to walk away with a prescription,

393
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:39,140
instead making it easier to have a phone visit with a nurse or a video visit.

394
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,200
And then the third core element is tracking reporting.

395
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:51,650
So it may be having the physicians of the practice self evaluate their antibiotic prescribing practices,

396
00:44:52,910 --> 00:45:03,530
making sure that medical education involves quality improvement and antibiotic tracking, implementing one action per year and tracking on that action.

397
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:09,110
So we're going to decrease fluoroquinolone use in urinary tract infections and then

398
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,260
assessing that over the year and then assessing and sharing performance on quality measures.

399
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:25,330
So within these there's so different technique toolboxes for our patient.

400
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:29,010
So academic detailing is one technique that's used here.

401
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:37,690
So this is borrowed from the, the pharmaceutical world.

402
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,110
So having that steward, that person who's appointed,

403
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:49,629
kind of entering the workroom and having those conversations with people that they know and that they get to know about their patients,

404
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,740
about their antibiotic use.

405
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:58,400
Poster based interventions and I'll show you an example of that in a second was delayed prescribing practices like we just talked about,

406
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,510
recall decision support, telephone triage,

407
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:07,450
audit and feedback can be used in outpatient setting to very effectively education

408
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:13,629
guidelines for antibiotic know about it or guidelines for outpatient indirect prescribing,

409
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:17,680
not just for inpatient and then telemedicine support like we were just talking about.

410
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:26,030
So this is like one of the first big randomized controlled trials done in the outpatient space for stewardship.

411
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:30,379
And it's a classic. It uses a nudge of a poster.

412
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:39,950
So it was a RC T among five different outpatient primary care clinics, and they looked at almost 1000 adult acute respiratory infection visits.

413
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:46,280
The intervention was 12 weeks of a poster being displayed versus no poster being displayed.

414
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:52,940
In the poster was a commitment letter illustrated example on the second and then four outcomes.

415
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:58,580
They looked at inappropriate antibiotic prescribing rates, which was based off of ICD ten codes.

416
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:08,180
So this was not supposed to be used in the study, but this is an example that the CDC has available that clinics can kind of poll use.

417
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:13,429
And so it's like a letter from your doctor that's like posted on the wall saying, you know,

418
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:17,090
I commit to prescribing antibiotics when they're needed and not, but they're not to help you.

419
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:28,460
So this poster nudge, when you're thinking about the different tools used, is both education and poster based interventions.

420
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:33,680
So for education it was both like provider education within the tool.

421
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,830
Like Here's this poster you should sign and then patient education, because while they're waiting for you to come, they're reading that letter.

422
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:51,529
So they saw a decrease in inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for the control.

423
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:57,710
Actually, there was an increase. And for those who had the poster, there was a decrease of 20% absolute reduction.

424
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:05,390
And importantly, they also look to see that there wasn't a diagnosed diagnosis code shifting.

425
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:11,690
So, you know, more ICD ten for antibiotic appropriate diagnoses.

426
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:14,520
So it wasn't like, oh, okay, fine. I'm just going to say that, look,

427
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:19,219
they have you can code like bacterial sinusitis even though you don't know like I'm going

428
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:24,049
to say they have these things or they say they have pneumonia instead of bronchitis,

429
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:32,420
but they didn't see that they were the same and also found that appropriate antibiotic prescribing didn't change.

430
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:37,160
So the same people who should have gotten antibiotics got them, but people who didn't need them got less.

431
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:43,910
So takeaways is that this is a really easy thing for clinics to do if you don't have a lot of resources.

432
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:47,100
Putting up some posters is, especially since they're already made for you,

433
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:52,070
you just have to sign them or laminate them is pretty much as simple as you can get.

434
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:57,770
It's really low cost, low personnel, and it can't hurt.

435
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:02,450
It's not going to cause any harm. So classic intervention.

436
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:10,970
This next study is like one of the other biggest studies done that patients do ship space.

437
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:19,460
It was a cluster, randomized controlled trial looking at 47 primary care practices in Boston, L.A. So the two cohorts,

438
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:28,040
almost 250 clinicians, were randomized to receive no intervention, one intervention, two or three for 18 months.

439
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:33,770
And we'll go through what those interventions are. All clinicians received education on antibiotic prescribing guidelines.

440
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:40,219
So that was the base. So even those who had no got the education and were told what the right thing to do or the ideal thing

441
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:46,460
to do was in the outcomes they looked at were the same inappropriate antibiotic prescribing rate.

442
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:54,500
And so that was among visits specifically with a non specified upper respiratory tract infection, acute bronchitis and influenza.

443
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:02,090
So those three interventions were all different behavioral interventions. So the first was suggested alternatives.

444
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,860
So they had electronic order signs that suggested non antibiotic treatment.

445
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:14,329
So if a provider had, you know, you or I as their diagnosis code and were prescribing antibiotics,

446
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:21,350
something popped up and said, actually, would you like to recommend Afrin or sailing nasal spray and hydration and ibuprofen?

447
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:27,290
The combo justification is what I'd already mentioned, where they had two free text,

448
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:31,730
why they thought an antibiotic was appropriate, even though the diagnosis does not need an antibiotic.

449
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:42,320
And then there is peer comparisons. So they would send emails to clinicians comparing their prescribing with those of top performers.

450
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:46,909
So those in the top 10% of appropriate antibiotic prescribing were being told that they

451
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:50,870
were a top performer and the rest were being told that they were not a top performer,

452
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:54,320
which is highly motivating among a bunch of type-A people.

453
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:02,180
So here in the toolbox for this intervention, they used clinical decision support,

454
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:09,890
audit and feedback with these peer prescribing comparisons, education, and they developed guidelines.

455
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:21,930
So they had 15,000 visits at baseline and 17,000 visits after the intervention in the control group.

456
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:26,250
The mean inappropriate average prescribing did decrease.

457
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:37,530
But if there were more decreases in the different interventions, those would suggest alternatives a credible justification or peer comparison.

458
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:45,430
But they looked at these same the same group of you say all these different clinics.

459
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:53,220
A year later, after they had pulled away all of these resources and the only thing that sustained was pure comparison.

460
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,610
So having been told for 18 months, you were a higher, low performer, and then for 12 months it was gone.

461
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:02,220
But it motivated change that persisted for a year.

462
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:14,049
But taking away the accountable justification, taking away the alternative borders that pop up once you're not seeing it anymore.

463
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:16,740
It wasn't something that they were thinking about or was impacting anything.

464
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:25,330
So this kind of shows the need for sustainable interventions, things that can be there and persist, which those things could right,

465
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:32,700
like the accountable justification could stay and not be removed, but the importance of building things in that can persist and not be taken away.

466
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:43,059
So overall key points are that both in the hospital and outside of the hospital,

467
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:49,630
antibiotic overuse is really common, and that overuse can be in three different ways, either from overdiagnosis.

468
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:56,650
So they don't really have an infection that requires an antibiotic, drug selection or duration.

469
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,450
So again, I'm thinking that targeted is better and everyday counts.

470
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,820
Antibiotic overuse causes harm both and side effects, cost and resistance.

471
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:16,629
And that is why we really need to shift clinicians from thinking that antibiotic use is doing the safe thing for the patient,

472
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:22,810
the just in case thing, and instead thinking on the other side about the harm that it can cause, both for your patient and for their neighbor.

473
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:31,600
The core elements are a really critical starting point as people are building programs or improving upon programs, both inpatient and outpatient.

474
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:37,659
And there's overlap between the targets and techniques we use for inpatient outpatient stewardship.

475
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:40,660
But there's also ones that kind of seem to work a little bit better at each.

476
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:45,610
But either way, designing sustainable interventions are important, especially in settings of low resources.

477
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,560
And I went faster than expected. So I'm done. Any questions?

478
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:56,090
Questions just have more visiting and more for the new patients.

479
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:00,320
They might be a dumb question. We're just like giving it a blow.

480
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:08,080
So a physician prescribes. For the induction too long description.

481
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:14,020
Where is the nursing staff? So they wait because they're the ones that are administering them and about right.

482
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:18,540
So would they be able to say like. Like.

483
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:23,450
Yeah. So that's a little complex.

484
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,690
So what are it in general? Antibiotics prescribed.

485
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:32,210
The nurse administers it for many reasons.

486
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,520
Some of that also being from a nursing education standpoint.

487
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,340
Well, there's a lot of experience that's gained throughout.

488
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:49,190
There's not necessarily as much like antibiotic to certain infection information that's taught, especially from the inpatient side.

489
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:52,160
But you start talking about more and more multi-drug resistant organisms.

490
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,659
That being said, there's lots of practical political experience that happens and knowing like,

491
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,730
okay, when I have a patient with pneumonia, this is what we treat it with.

492
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:06,739
But all of the but like some of the more nuanced data,

493
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:11,900
like do we really need the broader antibiotic or not for this patient isn't necessarily like a part of the education.

494
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:19,790
I would also say that some nurses would feel comfortable raising their hand and saying, Hey, are you sure we need this?

495
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:26,810
And others would not. And that's for a lot of different kind of like personal reasons, too.

496
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:33,290
But one of the big stewardship focuses over the last couple of years has been

497
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:38,240
improving nursing education around this topic for really exactly that reason.

498
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:43,880
Like it's one more kind of part of the Swiss cheese model of like, are we giving the patient the right antibiotic?

499
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:49,160
Are we optimizing their care? And the more people that can be thinking about that for that patient, the better.

500
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:54,650
Because we're all people in rollic busy and rushing and so more people thinking about this better.

501
00:55:55,610 --> 00:56:02,000
And so that's also. So that's the way I hadn't really thought about nursing education as much, though,

502
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:09,889
because a lot of the focus has been more on trying to help decrease testing and that bedside nurse being important for that.

503
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:14,960
So, oh, their urine smells funny. That's not a part of the diagnosis of UTI.

504
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:23,150
We don't need to be suggesting a urine culture because 80% of patients hospitalized or sorry,

505
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,490
40% of patients hospitalized have bacteria in their urine.

506
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,320
If you just check one, it doesn't mean that it needs to be treated.

507
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:39,049
So it's been more around like diagnostic stewardship because the nurse has a lot of power and and rightfully so.

508
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:45,180
I mean, like this is what I'm noticing about the patient. So we should do this and think about, like, training centers, right?

509
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,710
Like the intern comes in is like, okay, whatever you say.

510
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:54,800
So helping kind of improve that overdiagnosis component.

511
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:04,010
Yeah. There's some question about are there in search of programs that exist for antivirals, antifungals as well?

512
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:15,260
Yes. So that is encompassed in an inpatient and I would say as an outpatient antimicrobial stewardship program, too.

513
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:20,530
But antivirals until COVID really were few and far between other then Tamiflu for flu.

514
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:28,100
But it's just all encompassed. So it's really an antimicrobial stewardship program, not an antibiotic stewardship program.

515
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:34,000
So it's thinking about all of those things. Antifungal stewardship comes into play much more with our immunocompromised patients because that's

516
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:40,219
what gets fungal infections in antivirals really comes more into play with that those patients as well,

517
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:44,480
because we have such a limited number of antivirals that really the treatments end up

518
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,770
being more for the types of infections that patients that are immunosuppressed get.

519
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:53,900
But it's really parts of like Candida Auris that maybe you guys have talked about.

520
00:57:54,260 --> 00:58:02,960
But and there's other Candida or sorry aspergillus drug resistance that's happening in,

521
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:07,820
I think the Netherlands in Europe in general, that luckily we've seen very little of here.

522
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:15,200
But those are important reasons for us to use those other Italian factors that are only when they're needed.

523
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:22,490
So we talk about antibiotics being the bulk of things, but all of it is fair game questions.

524
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:31,290
I just remember that. So this is a whole but that is for a long time they were practice,

525
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:37,440
they were treatment guidelines like particularly for Ukiah, if it's like an outpatient facilities like health service.

526
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:44,849
And we were conducting studies and you get the health service and the nurses, you know, were following it religiously,

527
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:48,960
but the doctors were prescribed whatever they wanted, even though they were involved in this.

528
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:53,000
And we had one physician who just liked to prescribe Moxa.

529
00:58:53,040 --> 00:59:00,360
So and, and I was doing the medical studies and I could tell them that it's just not going to work and it's the worst idea.

530
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:02,640
Yeah, but you know,

531
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:13,320
it's just not going to work at because of about half of people's mouth was at that point already and in the eighties were almost always resistant.

532
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,650
So it was just it was just like I thought about I hope you retire.

533
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:23,130
Right? It's not all like autonomy. Like some some some physicians are like, you're not going to tell me what to do.

534
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:27,480
Like, I know I said that's why I went into medicine so that I could but.

535
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:34,500
But I think it's crazy. Yeah. Which is where like those communication skills, not just like for patients come into handy,

536
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:41,069
but also like a lot of what I do is talking to other physicians and trying to help them improve their antibiotic use.

537
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:45,930
And so trying to make it clear that I'm not just trying to, like, stop antibiotics or narrow that,

538
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:51,300
but I'm trying to help optimize the antibiotics for your patient like we have the same goal.

539
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,900
Right. Um, but yeah,

540
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,200
I should use a hierarchy to think because I'm medicine is really pretty her

541
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:03,510
whole and then people train the stooges tend to be young relative to the rest.

542
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:06,870
So I mean that's going to change. But yeah, yeah.

543
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:14,009
I think one thing that helps a lot is that most people who are working in stewardship are also very politically active.

544
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,010
So like I'm around it in the hospital a quarter of the year,

545
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:22,620
and so I'm taking care of patients with the same providers who are later calling for me when I'm just covering on the pager.

546
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:27,059
And so it's like they know me as a person who takes care of patients with them.

547
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:31,080
So that makes it a very different conversation to, you know,

548
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:38,580
it'd be a lot harder if it's like the only way that they know me is in discussing things over the phone about a patient.

549
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:42,000
I'm not taking care of the nurses.

550
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,230
So I was involved in the mission in Antibiotic Resistance Reduction Network for many years.

551
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:51,030
And we we actually did an intervention, but we started out by doing qualitative surveys.

552
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:54,870
And I talked to providers and HMOs, particularly doing the outpatient.

553
01:00:55,290 --> 01:01:00,960
And they really felt that if they go rating in patient satisfaction.

554
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:09,720
And so, like, they were in this weird band that would be read by patient satisfaction and they were limited to 15 minutes per patient.

555
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:14,270
Yeah. And so it was a real problem for them.

556
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:18,629
And we designed intervention and this is people trying to.

557
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:24,720
But there was like a, it was like a prescription for someone with a cold, you know, bed rest, sleep and all that.

558
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:30,719
And, you know, we also saw like a 20% reduction while I used it,

559
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:36,780
but I was just really taken by how the physicians felt like, you know, but I mean, these patients.

560
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:43,530
So that's a huge deal. So and that part of that too comes with the communication skills again.

561
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:51,479
So trying to help people feel comfortable with those conversations and feel like they can navigate them in a way that's not going to make

562
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:59,880
somebody angry who has a fixed belief that's been reinforced over years because we're really trying to really shift people's thinking.

563
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:14,970
And so, yeah, I was at a convening with the CDC and Pew Charitable Trusts in the spring that they brought a bunch of telemedicine providers there.

564
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:21,720
And that issue was discussed because in telemedicine, like especially in like doctors on demand and stuff, right?

565
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:25,710
Like if your patient isn't happy with their service, they're just never going to come back, right?

566
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:28,890
Like it's very easy for them to go somewhere else and it's a business. Right.

567
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:37,919
And so there was a lot of concern about when you think about infections like a doc on demand,

568
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:43,770
telemedicine visit, acute upper respiratory infection is going to be one of the biggest, most common things.

569
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:45,690
And most of the time, it doesn't need an antibiotic.

570
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:57,330
And so they looked at that as they tried to implement stewardship interventions and actually found like that the decrease in score was like very,

571
01:02:57,330 --> 01:03:05,159
very minimal. So a lot of this too is like fear that that's going to impact things, but it's not always borne out in actual scores.

572
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,080
But there's a big fear of that.

573
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:16,560
Yeah, I mean, I mean, I think a lot of medical practice is just the laying of hands, you know, particularly with the family practice kind of medicine.

574
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:19,770
People want to be reassured that they're going to get better. Yeah, they will.

575
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:30,359
But it's faster to give them a drug. Right. So there was a study that showed I didn't mention that antibiotic prescribing

576
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:34,200
inappropriately is much higher at the end of the day than in the beginning.

577
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:38,370
But it's like, you know, you're trying to get out of there, like you have to pick up your kids from day care or whatever.

578
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:44,730
You're tired for the whole day, like. Okay, fine. Which is unfortunate.

579
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:48,190
Yeah. You mean you have to be human?

580
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:52,500
Right? Yep. Other questions or comments.

581
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:58,620
And this is really important area and I think really infectious infection control a lot.

582
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:09,240
So and I know you didn't elaborate, but some antibiotic resistant adverse effects are fatal.

583
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:12,719
I mean, you probably are familiar with like anaphylactic shock,

584
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:18,150
but there are other very bad things that can happen when you've taken a bite out of it.

585
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:22,260
You can go blind, you can go to kidney failure.

586
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:26,520
You're hearing that. That's horrible. So what's it called?

587
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:33,960
The way the skin falls off receiving toxic epidermal necrosis or stevens-johnson?

588
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,980
Yeah, right. So these are non-trivial and a population level they occur.

589
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:49,350
So I have a paper on that actually a long time ago, um, we looked at, we just estimated the adverse impacts associated with it.

590
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:57,840
But in the same paper what we showed was the greatest predictor of getting it out of it was if you had free access to patient care.

591
01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:07,160
So if you went to see a physician, you know, because you could and you didn't have any costs associated, you were just, you know, just having access.

592
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:16,500
So I suspect outpatient wise antibiotic prescribing probably went down during COVID because people were really reluctant to pay for it.

593
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:22,500
So it went down except for azithromycin use. And that was because of inappropriate prescribing for COVID.

594
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,610
But now it's back up to where it was and actually higher. Yeah.

595
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:30,000
Yeah. So it's definitely something for us to work on.

596
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:39,329
Another thing we try to teach providers to say like for what is like you or I conversations is, you know,

597
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:43,740
I'm not going to give you an antibiotic today because I don't think it's going to help you get better any more quickly.

598
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:47,340
You can use honey, you can use hydration, ibuprofen, like different things.

599
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:53,069
And I don't want to give you diarrhea. Like like this is the harm that I'm trying to avoid for you.

600
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:58,760
And this won't help you. So trying to help. Yeah. Is there any outreach to, I mean, dentists in this economy?

601
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:06,139
So their people are starting to do work in that. Space and it's definitely been called out as an issue.

602
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:11,540
But, you know, there's so much less like overlap between the medical world and the dental world.

603
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:19,130
So I think more to be done. Yeah. And actually just for infection control and dental settings because.

604
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:22,490
Oh, yeah, yeah. So I mean that.

605
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:26,690
Yeah, we did a study on that when we were in classes of move forward.

606
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:34,950
Yeah. In terms of the lack of training in people who are supposed to be sterilizing instruments and so forth and the cleaning and,

607
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:43,390
and then the other prescribing. I mean, I had a student who got a root canal and got seeded in the hospital.

608
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:49,910
Yeah. So there's also like, dentists aren't as aware of antimicrobial resistance locally.

609
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,469
Right. Which makes sense. Like, wow, they know that.

610
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:58,160
And so there's a lot of prescribing of clindamycin when patients have a penicillin allergies and we didn't go into this,

611
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:05,090
but penicillin allergies, 95% of the time are not real.

612
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:13,790
And the prescription of of a different antibiotic in the setting of a penicillin allergy really means that you're giving a patient,

613
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:20,120
most of the time a drug that is not as good for their type of infection, and more likely that it's not going to be effective.

614
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:27,440
And Clindamycin is a good example. So Strep Edge Gnosis is one of the most common bacteria that's at least part of infections,

615
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:35,959
oral adaptogenic infections, and we see about 30% resistance of Clinton to strep engineers.

616
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:41,780
S And so it is a common thing that we see in the hospital where somebody said they had a personality allergy because

617
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:46,610
they got a rash when they were a kid because probably because they got a penicillin when they had a viral infection.

618
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:49,010
And we see rashes happen in that circumstance.

619
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:55,070
And then they got Glenda and then everything got worse, and then they end up needing a surgical debridement and it's awful.

620
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:59,030
So which I see very commonly.

621
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:03,790
So yeah. So thank you very for.

622
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:12,260
I hope to see you all at the symposium from today.

623
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:19,490
It will be really fun, I promise. And you can go in and get one.

624
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:36,300
And I think I'm almost done with you down here on that side of the room.

625
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:48,530
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know that.

626
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:53,420
But I swear I'm not set. I don't know. I like some of my.
