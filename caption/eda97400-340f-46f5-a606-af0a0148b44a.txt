1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:14,490
But there was a lot that I was like, Oh, yeah, I know, I know what you're thinking,

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:26,080
which is you should be referring to something like, Yeah, you see that reality.

3
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:33,370
Like I didn't even like because it.

4
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:51,630
Yeah, I think, I think because you can never really hear if you can get, you know, it's like it's looks like it's recorded.

5
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,140
All right. So first off, my name is Paul Lambert.

6
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:04,980
I'm one of the associate technical directors of the microbiology lab over in CRC for the hospital in the Michigan Medicine Hospital System.

7
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,980
I'm going to give you a talk today on clinical microbiology and what we do over there,

8
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,050
a little bit of background of different organisms that we work out,

9
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:23,249
some lifecycles that are relevant to our work and also relevant to the presentation.

10
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:30,320
Today, I'm told that Joanne usually gives you a half lecture and then have discussion, small group discussion sections.

11
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:39,450
I wasn't aware of that. I prepared the slides to go through 80 minutes today, so we'll just bypass the discussion.

12
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,340
Although I do encourage you to interrupt me at any time.

13
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,540
This is my first time back in person lecturing.

14
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:55,570
You've done a lot of the lecturing, so I may not notice your hand, so feel free to shout out.

15
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:06,240
That's okay. I'm not too easily offended. So anyways let's jump right into the students are somewhat basic so on review for a

16
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,580
lot of you maybe you then we'll get into some of the meat later on first of all,

17
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:22,410
start talking about the diagnostic cycle. Obviously it all starts with the patient, goes to a physician generally to look into some sort of problem.

18
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,030
Physician examines the patient, the patient produces a specimen of some type.

19
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:35,340
That specimen is generally going to the lab or the big black box of the lab, which encompasses a lot of pathology, including microbiology.

20
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,750
And then back we get results back to the physician now where you all are likely going to

21
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:50,740
be integrated into the process of using you on your chosen path of employment or career,

22
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:57,060
public health or epidemiology or something like that. That's what the public health system comes in.

23
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:04,800
It's coming from us generally. Results from us, results of notice, organisms of notice from the microbiology lab.

24
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,940
Specifically, we're talking about reportable organisms, reportable conditions.

25
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:17,080
And then the physician is also reporting those conditions and syndromes, the public health lab as well.

26
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,690
You're also dealing with the patient.

27
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:29,559
I could actually put public health around as an encompassing Venn diagram, almost around all of these topics here in the diagnostic cycle.

28
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:38,740
But generally speaking, I deal a lot with the state public health lab in the county lab almost every day and different issues,

29
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:49,030
whether it's monkeypox, whether it was COVID not too long ago, or any of the various reportable random report that we run into every day.

30
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,620
But in terms of the general goals of the Clinical Micro Lab, speaking to my expertize,

31
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,969
you know, we're there to recover pathogens from clinical specimens.

32
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:11,379
We also recover plenty of other bacteria. But one of our key roles is to help decipher between a pathogen and normal flora and report only pathogens

33
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:17,470
to the clinician so they're not spending their time and accidentally treating unimportant organisms,

34
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:26,050
reclassifying pathogenic organisms, organisms to the species level based on morphologic, biochemical or molecular properties.

35
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,049
We're shifting a lot more towards the molecular side.

36
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:37,990
As you might imagine, this is all been happening within just a revolution in clinical microbiology in the past 10 to 20 years.

37
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,320
The other key part of our job is assessing the individual activity of antimicrobial agents.

38
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,300
We talk a lot about that today,

39
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,639
but susceptibility testing is a key component of our job to quantify the load of organism to assist in patient management.

40
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,800
This gets back to the concept of recovering pathogens and defining which are pathogens.

41
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,430
A lot of organisms have a kind of a dual role,

42
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:12,160
if you think about organisms on a spectrum between pathogen and normal flora or oropharyngeal for something like that.

43
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,030
One of these organisms live somewhere in the middle and depending on their quantity,

44
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:23,830
and if they're in the wrong spot, they can be considered pathogen or they can be considered a just a normal victim.

45
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,290
And of course, we need to accomplish all these goals as safely and efficiently as possible.

46
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:38,350
So this is a real brief single slide on where I'm coming from in your lab for Michigan Medicine.

47
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,640
We process about 500,000 billable tests annually.

48
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:50,990
The primary one of those is urine cultures followed on the right here you'll see all the different other types of cultures that we process.

49
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,440
Is group A, strep group B, strep methicillin resistant staph aureus very screens,

50
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:02,260
respiratory cultures that could be anything from a sputum culture to a bronchial or garage culture.

51
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,030
Sterile specimens, non-sterile specimens, wound cultures.

52
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:13,930
Those are different categories because they get worked up differently depending on what area of the body they're coming from.

53
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:25,270
And then, of course, positive bloods, we only see about 7000 positive ones, but we're generally processing about 50,000, which was just a few in.

54
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,700
Generally processing about 50,000 blood cultures in general.

55
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,679
And then the different subsections of the lab.

56
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,200
Obviously we have a specimen processing area and that's really a key component of the lab where the specimens are coming in.

57
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,220
They're being played into the appropriate media being ordered for the appropriate test code.

58
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,969
Yes. QUESTION What do you mean by positive bloods? Oh, okay.

59
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,720
So blood cultures, we'll talk a little bit about this later.

60
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,840
But blood cultures come from all over the hospitals.

61
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:04,150
Sometimes our patient as well, they come in a bottle with broth in them and inoculated with a supposedly 8 to 10 miles of blood.

62
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,170
They go on an instrument, they're incubated for up to five days,

63
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:18,790
and whenever they're triggered as positive or they're not noted to be positive, they're pulled off the instrument and identification ensues.

64
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:29,560
Only about 15% of those 50,000 bottles that are incubated or sent to us actually grow anything.

65
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,440
So the vast majority of blood cultures are negative, actually.

66
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:41,309
So yeah, the different areas of the lab, specimen processing, key, aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology.

67
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:47,639
We'll talk about that in a little bit about the differences there. Susceptibility testing, micro bacteriology.

68
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,500
So that's a culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, for example,

69
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:59,920
or more commonly other members of the Mycobacterium family mycology that's your fungal and yeast culturing area.

70
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,210
Parasitology Molecular Diagnostics. Molecular diagnostics used to be called virology.

71
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:14,260
What you'll see, there's no the roles on there because all virology is moved to molecular techniques and also other bacteria,

72
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:22,080
other parasites, other fungus, other organisms in general are moving more towards molecular diagnostics away from classic techniques.

73
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,129
And then we also have a lab at the hospital core.

74
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:33,930
Like I told you, the big lab is a north campus research complex and we just moved out there about 40 years ago.

75
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,269
It does have a little bit of a gap then between where the specimens are collected.

76
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:48,089
There's a there's hourly courier that runs specimens from the hospital to us in the lab, adds about a one or two hour processing time to cultures.

77
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:54,930
But we found that that's not incredibly significant to the care of the patients, thankfully.

78
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,130
But we do have a core lab there that we leave right at the hospital.

79
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,840
That's where the blood cultures are managed because those aren't critical that they're handled very quickly.

80
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:15,480
And we also do some respiratory PCR testing for the emergency departments so that they can turn people around quickly, get them in and out again.

81
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:23,310
One of the hidden secrets I think of all laboratory medicine is the vast majority of our results are negative.

82
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,620
So that's and that's a good thing because it gives people the faster we get a negative result out to you,

83
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,930
the faster you can move on to the next part of your diagnostic or your differential,

84
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:43,890
the faster you can maybe send somebody home with the knowledge that they don't have influenza or they don't have COVID for other test examples.

85
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:51,059
So moving on to the different types of microorganisms that we in macro organisms, frankly,

86
00:09:51,060 --> 00:10:01,140
that we work on and identify in the clinical lab ranges for everything from your typical bacteria free living, single celled organisms,

87
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:08,820
things that you've all likely heard of like Staphylococcus aureus, E.coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,

88
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:16,290
maybe getting a little more or less likely, but those are things that we easily culture identify routinely in the lab.

89
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:27,270
Other things, other bacteria that are less easily cultured, more fastidious organisms would be something like a mycoplasma genus.

90
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:33,899
These are organisms that lack a cell wall so they can be cultured, but they don't stay well and they don't grow very quickly.

91
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,960
So a couple examples. Mycoplasma pneumonia.

92
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:46,050
Mycoplasma pneumonia is a common the common cause of walking pneumonia in general in not too long ago,

93
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,560
ten years ago or so, was cultured with a 15 day culture.

94
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,910
So you can imagine from a public health perspective that might be helpful to know

95
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,930
that you've got an outbreak of walking pneumonia or mycoplasma pneumonia happening,

96
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,550
not very helpful clinically.

97
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:10,740
So we have rapidly over the past decade implemented molecular tests for a lot of these non cultural or very long cultured organisms.

98
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,730
Another mycoplasma of interest is mycoplasma genitalia.

99
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,190
It's one of these organisms that is part of our sexually transmitted infection panel.

100
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,430
Another one of those is continuing to grow with us, which is down in the next bullet there,

101
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:33,270
which is another organism that, because of its nature is an obligate intracellular parasitic bacteria.

102
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:39,299
We require a very complicated cell culture system to actually grow that organism in the lab.

103
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:46,080
So we have molecular tests, PCR tests, amplifying the nucleic acid of these organisms to detect them,

104
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,410
getting results within one day of a specimen receipt.

105
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,979
Free currency is another example of an obligate intracellular parasitic bacteria.

106
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:02,100
But we don't have PCR or nucleic acid amplification tests for this group of organisms.

107
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:10,120
We instead look for these using serologic methods. So again, not possible to cultured in the lab, at least in a timely fashion.

108
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:16,810
So we instead look for evidence of disease looking for antibodies towards this organism in the host.

109
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:23,470
Anybody happened to know rickettsia rickettsia this species and genus is responsible for?

110
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:29,190
It's kind of a. Misnomer of a name, but it's kind of an interesting one to know.

111
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,370
It's Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, which incidentally is not really found in the Rocky Mountains.

112
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,540
For the most part, it's mostly in the southeastern United States, but it's a tick borne disease or as a broad borne disease.

113
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:51,330
And it's just one of those that falls in that category of fastidious obligate intracellular camp culture.

114
00:12:51,840 --> 00:13:00,159
We don't even have pictures for it because it's just not that common. So fungus a little more complex than bacteria.

115
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,520
They're multicellular generally with organelles and cell walls.

116
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,919
And just to define the fungus a little more precisely, we're talking about yeasts common.

117
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,360
He's made of Candida albicans Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

118
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:23,080
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, you know, is very important in bread and beer, but actually it can be pathogenic in some cases.

119
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,680
So it's one of those is on that spectrum wherever here is helpful.

120
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,660
Normal flora sometimes organism but in some patient populations it can actually be pathogenic.

121
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:41,410
Other fungus include the molds and the dimers. We'll talk more in detail about these organisms later slides, but in the mold category,

122
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:50,170
these are generally environmental organisms that take advantage of immunocompromised hosts and cause disease in those in those patients.

123
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:55,540
So we're thinking like things like aspergillus, zygote, may seeds.

124
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,700
We'll talk more about their defining characteristics later. The dialog are a really fun.

125
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,860
One of my favorite. One of the things that I've been looking at for a long time,

126
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:11,500
Candida albicans is actually somewhat of a demand, but it doesn't really fall in the technical category.

127
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:20,940
These are things like the pandemic. My courses that you might have heard of, like Glass or Macy's, this is a plasma like city.

128
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:28,450
It is in the southwest. These are really interesting fungal organisms that have a more vigorous lifestyle.

129
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:39,150
And again, we'll touch on that in later. Slides are getting more complex than the bacteria in the fungus you get into the parasites that we identify,

130
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,239
we don't generally grow parasites in the lab, fungus in bacteria.

131
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,040
We're culturing those for the most part,

132
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:54,190
identify the parasites we're looking at microscopically for evidence either either for protozoa which are unicellular free living amoebae,

133
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,280
or you care about organisms, things like acanthamoeba.

134
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:03,070
You've probably heard of acanthamoeba in contact lens infections.

135
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:12,820
Giardia is a common one. If you happen to be an outdoor enthusiast or you have a dog you probably heard of Giardina Plasmodium.

136
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:23,109
Anybody referred to Plasmodium before malaria. So we don't see that much around here, but definitely can't see it in returning travelers and amoeba,

137
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:31,479
hostility is another one that's generally a third world parasite, but pretty aggressive helminths.

138
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:39,549
On the other hand, protozoa we're looking for microscopically. We're looking for those in stool specimens generally, or other specimens.

139
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:45,200
Acanthamoeba We'd be looking at an ocular specimen. Comments.

140
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:49,510
We're actually talking about the pathogenic Indo parasites, not the actor.

141
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:58,020
The larger parasites live outside the body, but we're talking about worms that live within the pathogen eyes, within the body,

142
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:04,899
things like tapeworms, roundworms, hookworms, etc. Those are things that we're either looking for one or two things.

143
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:12,370
We're either looking microscopically for their eggs. So you might hear of parasitology oftentimes referred to as over in parasites.

144
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,850
So we're looking for the over the eggs of these parasites in stool.

145
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:26,290
And then by the shape and description and morphologic characteristics of their eggs, you actually define which helminth they've come from.

146
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:33,670
Again, we don't see a lot of this, particularly in the age of COVID, with international travel lockdown for the most part.

147
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:40,960
But as travel returns, we're starting to see more and more of these helminth infections in immigrant populations and returning travelers,

148
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:47,060
for example, arthropods of medical importance.

149
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:53,980
The other parasite category would be arthropods such as ticks and lice.

150
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:01,630
And generally, thankfully, the most common tick in our neck of the woods is dermis under very harbors.

151
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,850
And here it really is not carrying any disease vectors with it.

152
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:16,700
Things of these scapula. Scapula is, on the other hand, is the carrying agent of Lyme disease or Borrelia burgdorferi.

153
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:27,190
That also is our in our area, but less common much more common in the northeast, Minnesota, Wisconsin area, it's actually a little more common.

154
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:31,629
So we're kind of in an island of of a little lower prevalence of that disease.

155
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:37,330
But we play a role in the micro lab where we get ticks submitted to us often.

156
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:47,020
We can't detect really we can't detect Rickettsia directly, but we can tell you that it's either a German center tick or a ex-city tick,

157
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,670
or one of these other Lone Star ticks or another take from another part of the country.

158
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:59,980
And that helps give the condition information that as to whether their patient is at risk or not for acquiring Lyme disease,

159
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,790
Rocky Mountain, Spotted Fever or one of these other things that our tick associated.

160
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:14,670
And then going completely in the opposite direction from parasites and down to viruses, which are considered basically the simplest,

161
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:25,260
quote unquote living organisms really exist just to replicate within ourselves and consist of either DNA or RNA in a protein code.

162
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,580
Some have envelope, some have not. Some are naked viruses.

163
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:35,730
And you? I don't know if I included any slides in this presentation, but.

164
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:43,180
Not too long in the past. Long enough. I started in this business in 2009.

165
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:54,760
We were doing a virus culture back then and where you'd actually have human cell or other cell monolayers that you'd exposed to patient's specimen.

166
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:01,240
And if that patient's respiratory specimen had influenza, the influenza would, in fact, the cell line.

167
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,559
And you'd get a very specific cytoplasmic effect on that cell line,

168
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,330
and you'd be able to see that microscopically and identify the patient's specimen had

169
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:16,560
influenza in it or rhinovirus or no virus or any of the other many viruses we did.

170
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,440
But again, helpful from a public health perspective to know that.

171
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,580
But it took 7 to 10 days oftentimes to culture these viruses.

172
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:32,710
So not very helpful. So, again, as you might imagine, we moved very quickly from 2009 to current day,

173
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:39,610
from Cultured and June to PCR as the gold standard for detecting those viruses.

174
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,530
So when we're talking about all these different micro-organisms that we have to identify, at the end of the day,

175
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:54,860
we have to have a good understanding of the intrinsic properties of the microbe, all major microorganisms.

176
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:03,410
That is, they all have unique or fairly unique morphologies and chemical compositions that can be measured and documented.

177
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:09,680
They all have defined growth requirements. Very important to know that when you're growing and setting up cultures for the different

178
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:15,350
organisms host regions is important to understand in terms of the fastidious organisms,

179
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:24,470
in particular viability in the free state. Knowing whether or not they'll actually even culture without a host organism.

180
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,629
Susceptibility to genetic change. This is very important.

181
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,860
And we've seen very recently in SARS-CoV-2.

182
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:39,010
Right. I mean, we all saw how quickly that changed, mutated away from vaccines, away from our own immunity.

183
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:48,060
And actually, it's changed away from a lot of the targeted PCR assays that were initially designed for SARS-CoV-2,

184
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:57,040
so much so that a couple of the sub strains that existed a year or so ago were

185
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,390
actually identified as certain dropouts of one of our targets of our PCR.

186
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:10,480
And that's because SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, which is very susceptible to mutation and susceptible to genetic change,

187
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:19,090
as opposed to something like monkeypox, which is a very stable virus, DNA virus, not very susceptible to change.

188
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:30,120
So thankfully, our our diagnostics and our vaccines, even vaccines to some degree against smallpox, still have some activity against these drugs.

189
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,610
Antigenic characteristics is an important characteristic to understand about organisms.

190
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:45,600
For things like giardia, giardia is detectable by microscopy, but that takes time and expertize.

191
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:51,330
There are actually little lateral flow immunoassays almost like pregnancy tests

192
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,070
that you can put a little stool on and it looks through the antigen for giardia.

193
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:02,069
It's very specific in Virginia, and we can do those within 30 minutes of getting a specimen.

194
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:08,950
Whereas, you know, microscopically examining that stool for giardia takes much more expertize and time.

195
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:18,720
So understanding which organisms you can rapidly detect energetically is important in understanding the response to the chemotherapeutic agents.

196
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,690
We can actually use specific response to specific drugs as an identifying characteristic as well.

197
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:31,020
If you've got a particular class of organism that's only susceptible or resistant to your particular drug,

198
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:37,200
Iapetus is often used to identify strep pneumo because of its unique susceptibility to that drug.

199
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:48,460
And growth of organisms just a little more specifically breaking that down, because this is really crucial to what we do in the microbiology lab,

200
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:58,630
although perhaps less so in that if we think 10 to 20 years from now because of the direction everything's moving to molecular techniques.

201
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,170
But as of right now, even though we have a lot of PCR techniques,

202
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:10,300
we still need to grow the majority of our organisms from a patient specimen before we can actually identify and work them out.

203
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:18,530
So we have to know which ones are obligate arrows, which are microorganisms that grow freely in there and cannot grow in the absence of oxygen.

204
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:24,730
So those are things that will we set it up in an Arabic bottle, in an anaerobic bottle for blood culture.

205
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,580
We would expect only to see that in the Arabic bottle,

206
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:35,530
and then vice versa of the obligate anaerobes would only grow in the anaerobic bottle and are actually very susceptible to the presence of air.

207
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,049
Which is an important concept. We won't talk about this today, but in the specimen collection and protecting specimens from oxygen,

208
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:48,940
if you're actually looking for an anaerobic organism at the time,

209
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,470
there are arrow tolerant anaerobes,

210
00:23:50,480 --> 00:24:01,570
low acuity bacterium are probably that probably probiotic bacteria that grow in the air but pretty poorly but grow much better in robotically.

211
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,819
And facultative areas like E.coli which will grow both aerobically and anaerobic.

212
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:12,260
They. What generally grew a little better in one or the other.

213
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,340
It's also important to recognize the different sizes of organisms that we're working with.

214
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:24,600
They're not bacteria for the most part are evolving in this light microscopy range right at the end of it.

215
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:32,309
So it's important to recognize that it's at the end because a lot of other areas in pathology, maybe in your laboratory experience,

216
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:36,510
you recognize and I've got the next slide here, we'll talk a little bit about microscopy,

217
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:41,250
but we're right at the edge of what we can see by light microscopy.

218
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:46,590
When we're looking at bacteria, we're using techniques eye objective, ocular lens,

219
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:52,110
and then with a 100 X objective, which is oil emerging to get the proper optics,

220
00:24:52,620 --> 00:25:02,910
actually see these things, you generally don't go much higher than that with microscopy, ordinary, ordinary light microscopy.

221
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,129
So we're not going to see any viruses or any evidence of virus with our microscopy.

222
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:14,430
But parasites, bacteria all are comfortably in that group.

223
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:19,409
They're 100 x magnification, which is 100 X times ten.

224
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,090
Right. So a total of 1000 x.

225
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:31,770
We do have an electron microscopy lab in the pathology department for some limited studies, but it's not typically used very much diagnostically.

226
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:37,770
And then when you get down to X-rays and hours, obviously that's not clinically relevant.

227
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:48,280
So just really critically reviewing what this is as crucial as the culture is to the microbiology lab,

228
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:57,580
staining and microscopy is still a crucial component as well because every specimen type,

229
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:03,910
for the most part, with the exception of urine, is going to get a gram stain at the beginning of its culture process.

230
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,810
Respiratorie cultures actually have a gram stain that helps cancel some inappropriate specimens.

231
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:15,100
So if you see a lot of epithelial cells in your respiratory specimen,

232
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:22,030
you know that that's actually more spit than a lower respiratory culture and we can cancel that because of that.

233
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:26,439
So we see a lot of different things. We see the presence of inflammatory cells,

234
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:36,910
which tells us that it was a good quality sample that's actually sampling the infectious component of a of a sample rather than just swabbing,

235
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:46,060
let's say, a wound abscess that has no plans or no inflammatory cells in front, going to give that less relevance when it grows something because,

236
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:51,160
you know, you didn't really catch the infective component of that wound.

237
00:26:53,120 --> 00:27:02,910
So anyways, like I said, vast majority of microscopy clinical macro lab is using a 100 x objective with emerging oil intact,

238
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:09,139
sort of total a thousand x. You're not going to see bacteria for the most part lower than that at 40 x,

239
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:17,750
although we do use a 40 x hydride without oil immersion and the tax objective for fungal cultures in parasitology.

240
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:27,340
All right. So it's staining technique. So obviously we're not we're doing Web probes rarely, but for the most part, we're standing these organisms.

241
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,830
Before we do that, our microscopy, we're starting off the most.

242
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,680
The key the key most key steps are staying, I guess, in the microbiology lab.

243
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,250
Could we consider the gram stain? I'm sure you're all familiar with Gram.

244
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:49,030
Positive from your lab courses. It starts with the crystal violet steam primary.

245
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:57,730
Steam secondary. As you're gonna start a saffron, and then you've got a deep stain and a deep colorize or in a fixative agent in between.

246
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:09,540
Where word matters and when we're down to brass tacks here, your gram positive organisms have this thick layer of peptidoglycan around them.

247
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:16,650
Gram negatives actually have a similar less thick layer to the glycan, but it's covered up by this outer membrane.

248
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,930
So the peptidoglycan is taking up the violet stain on the crystal violet.

249
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:28,020
It's not releasing it on this stain because it's a very tight affinity,

250
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:36,120
but the outer membrane is protecting the gram negative from that stain, so it's only getting stained by that.

251
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,470
Gonna stay in the saffron and the pink or the red color. Why does this matter?

252
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:46,559
I give you this same slide to the med students that come through our lab because

253
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,280
they're seeing results for us that say something like gram variable bacilli.

254
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,720
And they want to know, how does that happen? How do you get gram variable bacilli?

255
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,170
I thought it had to be gram positive or gram gram negative.

256
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,290
Well, that's because there's a couple of different ways you can be.

257
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:10,470
Some gram positive organisms have very thin layers of peptidoglycan, or they're older, they've been growing for longer in the presence of antibiotics.

258
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:16,380
And when that peptidoglycan layer thins, it doesn't hold on to the gram positive stain as well.

259
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:22,020
And so you get some decolonization happening and standing with the saffron and you get

260
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:26,880
kind of a gram variable and we'll see a couple examples of that to come on the flip side.

261
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:35,250
Gram negative organisms, if they start losing some integrity in this outer membrane either generally from antibiotics is what we have

262
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:43,920
time to see this most often it's what we like to call drugs or bugs on drugs because they look really strange,

263
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:49,380
their morphologies unusual because they're losing that integrity of that outer membrane.

264
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:58,050
And that also lets the peptidoglycan stain inside and behind the outer membrane and you get that gram variable appearance.

265
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:07,110
So this is just a routine example of a gram negative bacilli.

266
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,870
This is an integrity. It's very common for interns to have this kind of short boxes.

267
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:18,720
And that's what you'll see here in the slide in particular. The point I included is it's not extremely uniform.

268
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:27,270
There is definitely some variability in the size and shapes and this is all one organism, one strain of like the E coli.

269
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:37,439
And similarly, gram positive talk sign is what's depicted here can look a little different depending on the field.

270
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,290
So you see a pair of here, a short chain right here, what looks to be a cluster right here.

271
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:53,729
And what is important to note here is we're not looking at one image and making a decision on whether or not we're drawing things.

272
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:59,630
Clusters are chains that trans pairs, all the different morphologies that exist are.

273
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,620
These are the key ones that we use in the lab.

274
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:10,950
We're looking generally at hundreds and hundreds of gram stain images to get a comprehensive assessment of what's actually in the specimen.

275
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:21,630
And as important as that is to a clinician to know that their blood culture, for example, is growing gram positive toxin clusters,

276
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:30,870
it still doesn't tell the whole story because that gram positive toxin clusters could be a staphylococcus aureus,

277
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:35,820
which is obviously pretty important to note. It's generally a pathogen.

278
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,430
Generally, if you have staph aureus in your blood,

279
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:46,200
that's likely going to be indicating you may have a patient with sepsis or at the very least, bacteremia with an organism.

280
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:55,680
But it could also be staphylococcus epidermidis. And by the name itself, you're likely to recognize that that is a skin four organism.

281
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:01,020
And those can be those are actually quite common contaminants of our blood cultures.

282
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:07,620
So when you're drawing a blood culture, there's a lot of attention put to decontaminating the site of the drug.

283
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:15,960
But it's not perfect. We have rates of contamination in our blood cultures of between 1%,

284
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:25,640
and I use it in parts of the hospital where they have extra drying and not under a lot of stress too.

285
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:29,100
Rates like 3 to 5% contamination in places like that.

286
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,120
Eddie, where you can imagine that it's a very stressful environment.

287
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:40,560
They're maybe not decontaminating the site of the drain as well as it could be, and you get some break through of contaminated organisms.

288
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,540
And that applies to almost every one of these gram positive organism.

289
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:54,870
Examples. Chains. Chains could be something as significant as group A strep could be something as insignificant as a virulence.

290
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,610
Strep member Alpha Hemolytic We'll see one of those in the next slide.

291
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:08,820
That's also commonly a contaminant. Some of these are very distinctive to particular organisms.

292
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:17,860
These are what are called lancet shaped, liberal neurotoxin, very diagnostic for streptococcus pneumoniae.

293
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:28,650
These are so called Neisseria, what we call kind of kids being shaped kindergarten or they're difficult to say.

294
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:36,180
But as you can see, they're actually more like diploid taco bacilli, in effect, and that that fits with the organism that they represent,

295
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:43,050
which is Neisseria Meningitidis Sometimes Neisseria gonorrhea can also look the same way,

296
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:48,600
but similarly can so can other normal flora members of Neisseria.

297
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,360
So that's that one's less diagnostically. On the bacilli side.

298
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:03,290
You've got a lot of variety and we don't tend to define or give like small wavy

299
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:10,890
gram negative so or thin narrow gram negative bacilli or grandfather bacilli.

300
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:17,480
These are generally described just as a bulk category of gram positive or gram negative bacilli.

301
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,050
The cargo bars are interesting though, because those are very unique.

302
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,320
On the gram negative side, we're talking mostly haemophilus are the gram negative categories.

303
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:36,340
So I and and also some very interesting smaller bacilli or less cargo bacilli, more bacilli and things like Francis.

304
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:41,180
So Brucella oftentimes things that you may have heard of from a public health perspective

305
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:48,049
can also show up as very small gram negative bacilli on the gram positive side of bacilli.

306
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:54,620
We're talking more things like granny bacterium, which are not nearly as small.

307
00:34:54,620 --> 00:35:04,370
And you'll see this in the gram saving example coming up. Not nearly as small as the gram negatives, but definitely identifiable by their small size.

308
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:10,790
Fusiform bacilli are also unique but generally only seen in anaerobes.

309
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:25,180
And Spider kids we have on here because occasionally you'll see them in some very rare cases of really bad oral infections like trench mouth.

310
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,610
If you've ever heard of that,

311
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:35,949
you can actually get some some normal for old Trump animal well not normal flora but pathogenic Trump animal pathogens not the Trump animal pallidum,

312
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:40,900
but Trump animal or other Trump an evil spirit is causing disease in the mouth.

313
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:48,099
And actually, there are some theories of what if you can stretch the term normal flora a little bit,

314
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:54,940
but there are disparities in our normal world for most people.

315
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:03,850
Otherwise the pathogenic irrelevance barricades of note like Trump and even Pallidum or the causative agent of syphilis.

316
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:13,900
We're generally not seeing that by Gram ever. That's another organism that doesn't have culture, doesn't have grand seen as irrelevant diagnostic,

317
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,950
doesn't even have molecular avenues for diagnosis.

318
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:21,820
It's generally diagnosed using serologic methods as well.

319
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:32,880
So we'll just go over a few ground stations here just for a comprehensive, comprehensive analysis to show you what we're talking about.

320
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,459
This is a gram positive dioxide clusters.

321
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:44,670
Very easy to see that these are clustering and you actually see some packets of clusters here in their natural

322
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:52,020
kind of formation and they start off at like five and then move that into these additional clustering.

323
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:58,350
This is very common for staphylococcus, but again, not helpful to define within a species.

324
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:03,790
Helps you to find a genus. Here.

325
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,170
As I mentioned, streptococcus phylogeny is group strep a little bit ago,

326
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:14,900
very long chain organism streptococcus pneumoniae, very common to see it in these diploid side arrangements here.

327
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:21,110
But you also see these short pains are pairs of chain chains.

328
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:24,920
Of pairs are chains of pairs that occasionally occur.

329
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:37,160
We actually just had a clinically relevant case last week, Friday, where it was called Streptococcus or was called Gram Positive Cox in chains.

330
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,930
The clinical team was very suspicious of strep pneumo.

331
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:47,400
Is that a pediatric patient? So we had to review the side and recognize that, yeah,

332
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:53,780
in fact there was is very short chains of pairs and there was a significant value to the clinical team

333
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:59,030
knowing right at the same stage of the ground stain the struggling role was on the differential,

334
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:04,100
very high on the differential. Some things are a little confusing.

335
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:07,970
Strep mutations is a streptococcus species, so it should be in chains.

336
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,570
But you can see here that this is actually clustering somewhat.

337
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:16,580
And that's, again, where you need to have your techs looking at multiple fields.

338
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,000
Very important to look at multiple fields and get a comprehensive view of a

339
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,330
culture for a specimen to make sure that this is actually not a cluster of genes.

340
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:32,210
And you might see in the next field an actual nice looking chain with the same shaped organism.

341
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,220
And you can make that determination.

342
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:44,700
Enterococcus ratio is a another type of strep that sometimes can mimic strep numero a little bit in terms of its peers,

343
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:48,600
but it does form longer chains and generally help rule it out.

344
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:55,490
And rods are really kind of neat. This is one of my favorite ones. No Cardi Asteroids.

345
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:04,420
Common cause of respiratory infections due to soil exposure, sometimes not fully immunocompromised.

346
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:13,340
So those with a weakened immune system and even in the fully immune recombinant if they're exposed to high inoculum.

347
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:14,810
Well, you'll see.

348
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:21,620
Again, here's a breeding ground staining pattern that I told you about where it's not fully gram positive or not fully gram negative.

349
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,649
And that's because this organism has very little peptidoglycan.

350
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:34,520
It's truly a gram positive organism, but it also has other member other components of the cell wall,

351
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:41,960
waxy components, almost like micro bacterial components that kind of resists the stain to some degree.

352
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:52,430
On the other hand, Bacillus is very commonly one of these that over 80 calories is very easily due to a thinning of the peptidoglycan layer.

353
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:59,960
And it's also important to note, I'm sure you've all heard of bacillus anthracis before because of agent of anthrax.

354
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:05,330
You'll note that it's really not easily distinguishable from Bacillus Serious,

355
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:13,250
which is a much more common bacillus species, usually associated with sometimes food poisoning episodes.

356
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,879
But it's actually a very common normal floral member as well.

357
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,390
We see a lot of it seasonally as a blood culture contaminant.

358
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:31,730
In the summary, the spores are in the environment, but it's really difficult to just distinguish these two by gram stain alone.

359
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:38,760
And then here those corynebacterium is small, little darker bacilli I was telling you about that are quite different,

360
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:50,270
distinguishable on gram say and typically have been referred to as the rinds before or gram positive flora.

361
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:57,920
But there are different members of this genus that are now rising to pathogenic status.

362
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:07,969
Probably the one that you may recognize the most would be the bacterium diphtheria across the region of the area.

363
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:15,350
But that one itself actually does not culture very well at all in our hands, has some very fastidious characteristics.

364
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,919
So that's another one that would be diagnosed not by culture,

365
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,900
but actually by detection of toxin on a public health side rather than in a clinical lab.

366
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:35,020
They're looking at more in the gram negative side than there's some gram st of the gram negative rods, pretty much indistinguishable.

367
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:42,799
That was an coli. This is a club nouveau all in that injury family very similar overlapping looking gram saying so

368
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:49,040
not a lot we can do from identification perspective when it comes to the interns down here some

369
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:58,459
other interns sit here and let it go cause a common causative agent of food poisoning again here's

370
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:04,700
its cousin there's in the past is again recognizing that locally is the agent behind plague.

371
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:10,130
But again it's very difficult to determine just looking at ground stain,

372
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,809
you're not going to really be able to determine any difference or recognize either

373
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:20,600
any of these would say alone pseudomonas aeruginosa is an environmental bug,

374
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,650
also very tightly associated with hospital acquired infections.

375
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:34,970
That one's a little thinner than the intern typical internal that or phenotype more of a type but

376
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:41,450
still again not generally possible from gram standalone to make it a differentiating characteristic.

377
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,530
Talking about the kidney bean shaped difficult cocks are difficult to argue with.

378
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:52,510
So I have Neisseria again. See that overlap between Neisseria gonorrhea?

379
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,820
You also see a little bit of the capsular material in some of these, which is kind of neat.

380
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:09,429
Neisseria Meningitidis bacterial meningitis scars looks very similar, and then a little overlap, but slightly different.

381
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:12,710
More of an elongated gram negative pair.

382
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:18,310
Sort of like a capsule. Again, there's a capsule around this Acinetobacter Baumannii as well.

383
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:23,329
Basically, the bacteria is another tightly linked hospital.

384
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:28,180
They acquired an infection generally found in the environment otherwise.

385
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:34,030
And here are those tiny little gram negative. Clark Obviously the marvelous influenza.

386
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:41,770
Some of you may have heard that it'd be a pretty common agent of pneumonia, pediatric pneumonia in the past.

387
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:46,510
Less so now that we have vaccines for it.

388
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:54,689
Okay. So that's you know, we can give the physicians some very valuable information,

389
00:43:54,690 --> 00:44:00,540
even though it's not very specific on the presence of bacteria in their specimens.

390
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,190
From the grand scale of what we have to do after that, though,

391
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:10,860
is get them to grow and then biochemically characterize them, biochemically characterize them.

392
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,740
We need to know the specific nutrients that are required for their growth, need to know their growth requirements.

393
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:24,870
From an atmospheric perspective, it's good to know whether or not they produce pigments that helps the texts on the bench recognize

394
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:29,040
things visually right off the bat without doing any complicated biochemical techniques.

395
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,890
There's also whether or not they grow in the presence of inhibitors and again speaking to

396
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:40,590
whether or not antigen detection or antigen amino acids are relevant to their identification.

397
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,540
And we have new technique to which I think is coming up with a couple of slides where we're

398
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:54,389
actually using protein spectroscopy to actually identify organisms within like 5 to 10 minutes.

399
00:44:54,390 --> 00:45:05,060
It's really an amazing development. But before we get to that identification, we do have the culture to isolate the bacteria.

400
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:09,680
And so I'll just give you a couple of slides on the principles of cultivate cultivation in the lab.

401
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:17,780
The nutritional requirements identify non fastidious bacteria that can grow on kind of routine sugars,

402
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:23,090
those that are fastidious and need complex or unusual growth requirements.

403
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:30,649
And whether or not we can get everything that we need to grow on solid media or there is an advantage to using liquid or broth.

404
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:33,770
So blood cultures is a great example.

405
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:46,400
In the past, blood cultures were all done on solid media, but you don't get as great of a degree of sensitivity and solid media as you do with abroad.

406
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:53,030
As you can imagine, no solid media or these plates of order, which I'll show you an example of right here.

407
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:56,660
This is kind of our workforce order, which is our sheet blogger plate.

408
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:04,719
You can only play maybe like 100 microliters a specimen or so before it just gives the

409
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,790
plates to wet and doesn't drying it too much specimen on there with a broth culture.

410
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:16,120
You can add, as I mentioned already with blood cultures, you can add, you know, eight, ten mils in each cultured bottle.

411
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:24,570
So you're increasing your inoculum by, you know, 100 to 100 fold in some cases and getting much more sensitive analysis.

412
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:28,719
Now, that doesn't work with swabs, specimens, tissue specimens.

413
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:38,920
Again, generally, you're not going to get that much more of an increase in sensitivity from a broth, as you would from a culture director.

414
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:45,159
The other thing you don't get from a broth that you get from a direct culture is you get a quantifiable result.

415
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:51,580
If I put 100 microliters down on a plate, I know exactly two colonies grow or ten colonies grow.

416
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:59,110
I'm going to see a fuze per mil were in that original specimen. If I put ten meals into a bottle and the bottle goes positive,

417
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:05,740
I don't know if that went positive from an initial inoculum of one C of you per mil or 100 C infused per meal.

418
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:13,210
That's why every so there's value in having both solid phase and liquid phase in your diagnostic algorithm.

419
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:17,530
So the other thing that you get with some of these media,

420
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:28,180
this particular one is non differential or nonselective and that it will grow pretty much any organism or most organisms uniformly,

421
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:34,809
but it's differential in that it will show us differential characteristics of hemolysis.

422
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:39,010
So group strep, for example, is a strong baby hemolytic.

423
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:44,800
So it's like seeing the red blood cells and clearing the media of that red color.

424
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:52,270
You can have alpha hemolysis strep pneumo is Alpha Hemolytic, which is just a partial lysis of the red cells.

425
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:57,810
So you get this kind of greenish color, which is also why some streptococcus are drawn here.

426
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:04,479
Dan Strep through that green color. And then things like Enterococcus equalized.

427
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,580
Sometimes we'll grow on this agar and B gamma or lack of MRSA.

428
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:14,200
So these are all characteristics of the text are using on that initial culture step.

429
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:21,060
They'll get a kind of a preliminary idea of what the organism might be and whether it needs to be further worked out.

430
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:27,440
Now this McCarty order is probably the number two most important logger in the lab.

431
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:34,850
This is both selective and differential, so it's selective in that it only grows gram negative organisms.

432
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:44,690
It has crystal violet actually in the media which will inhibit and screw with the gram positive growth on the ah on the media.

433
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:51,180
The differential component comes in the lactose that's in the media.

434
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:58,020
And if you're lactose fermenter, there's a page component page indicator in the media that turns this nice.

435
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:04,890
Painkiller. When lactose ferment, fermentation is occurring.

436
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:15,090
So you get lactose positive, lactose fermenters showing up this way and lactose negative organisms showing up this way or not fermenters again.

437
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:22,380
This is also that on that initial pass, initial culture result, before we even get to biochemical identification,

438
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:30,900
the med techs working these cultures up can actually get an idea of what the organism might be, what category it falls in.

439
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:41,200
And frankly, it was more helpful ten years ago or so before we had our are identification methodologies that give us an idea within 10 minutes.

440
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:46,530
In the past, we had to use chemical identification panels,

441
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:54,089
which I'm going to guess most of you played with some manner of this in a lab class where you had to identify an organism.

442
00:49:54,090 --> 00:50:00,720
Maybe in a micro, basic micro class, they're generally smaller than these large panels.

443
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:07,950
They maybe had one strip of biochemical reagents where you inoculate small degree of organism in each well.

444
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,440
And then you let it sit for an overnight growth.

445
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:19,960
So the organism growing in the well with glucose, with ravenous, with inositol, with derivatives, with lysine.

446
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:26,620
And then the next day you see, well, yeah, utilize glucose in turn the page indicator yellow.

447
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:33,090
So it's actually utilizing that as a carbon source versus some of these other ones.

448
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:37,140
We're actually looking for less of a carbon source utilization.

449
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:47,860
These are all the carbon sources, more of a biochemical interaction with the different chemical substrate like citrate or arginine or anything.

450
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:53,110
So all of that put together with all of those.

451
00:50:53,200 --> 00:51:01,860
And I guess even before these micro, well, biochemical panels existed, folks were doing these biochemicals in two test tube racks.

452
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:10,470
Right? All for one organism. One organism from one culture, which probably is upwards of three or four different organisms in the culture.

453
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,620
So a lot of time and effort put into biochemical identification.

454
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,450
And at the end of the day, it wasn't even extremely accurate all the time.

455
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:22,900
You'd oftentimes give me an ID that was 75% likely.

456
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:26,980
This is E coli, 50% likelihood that it's a nerve actor.

457
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:34,270
So depending on where you go, most labs nowadays are using a different technique called maldi-tof.

458
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:42,820
But there are still labs and state labs even that are still using biochemical methods of identification.

459
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,360
So it's good to understand the concepts behind that, at least.

460
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:54,590
But so this is maldi-tof. It is mass spec, mass spectrometry.

461
00:51:55,580 --> 00:52:08,060
Instead, the initials MALDI Dots. The acronym stands for Matrix Associated Laser DESORPTION Ionization Time of Flight Technology.

462
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:11,870
And I want to see if I hope this will work and we'll see if it works or not.

463
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,640
Are you guys? You're not seeing that.

464
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:42,730
Dragon Dragon over. The Maldi-Tof process is a two things procedure.

465
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:48,110
Initially the samples are fixed in a crystalline matrix.

466
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:53,030
In the initial ionization step, they are bombarded by a laser.

467
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:59,540
The sample molecules vaporize into the vacuum while b so this a little background quickly.

468
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:06,440
Each of those little spots is on a slide about the size of the microscope slide, but it's a metal slide.

469
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:11,300
And so you can imagine these little spots is probably like one millimeter in diameter.

470
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:20,239
And each of those can well would have one little smear of a colony from a patient culture.

471
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:29,570
So you in a full slide, which the attacks are running at any given time during the day, they're probably have 30 to 40 different patients.

472
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:39,469
30 to 40 different isolates were given number of patients on a single slide and it's interrogating each side of the laser in a matter of seconds.

473
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:47,240
So if we just keep this going, so exactly what's happens at the same time high voltage is that applied to accelerate the charge particles.

474
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:56,780
The second stage, it's breaking up the bacteria those on that slide in that little circle, in the protein components.

475
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:03,590
And it's going to divide them to separate them then based on their size and charge ratios of this vacuum to.

476
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,290
Yellow particles will impinge upon the linear detector.

477
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:16,669
And then there is a detector up on the top. After after the separation occurs, higher mass molecules will arrive later than lighter ones.

478
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:23,749
And each organism, basically even different strains within species making possibly have their own unique masses directly signals

479
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:29,750
that you'll see or that are generated over time to the specific mass of the particle along the time dimensions,

480
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:36,380
starting with the hand on their own. You know, this type of patterning of different regular organisms isn't extremely helpful,

481
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:42,169
but if you've got an already established database of thousands of organisms where you know,

482
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:46,160
they're balancing in addition to extending the flight distance.

483
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:51,080
So it's just brings into additional mass usage of it.

484
00:54:51,080 --> 00:55:00,410
But this is really was revolutionary when it was introduced to microbiology because

485
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:07,250
you can do those 30 to 40 different isolates in a matter of ten or 15 minutes.

486
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:11,720
So we went from biochemical identification that took an overnight cycle with,

487
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:19,340
you can imagine stacks and stacks of those biochemical ID plates to mass spec identification,

488
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:27,229
which is incredibly precise, incredibly sensitive, incredibly accurate in a matter of minutes.

489
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:35,120
So that gives your clinician that broad culture that we said gram positive dioxide and clusters as soon as it grows on a plate.

490
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:43,880
Instead of waiting a 24 hour cycle for an ID panel to come out, we can tell them the idea within 15 minutes of putting it on the maldi-tof.

491
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:50,509
So that is really slick. It kind of takes away a little the the beauty.

492
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:53,020
So you end up having a micro lab class or something.

493
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:58,000
They're still teaching biochemicals and expecting you to memorize which ones are lactose positive.

494
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:01,370
Which ones are lactose negative? Which ones are indole positive?

495
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:07,260
That will be around for probably another 5 to 10 years before they completely replace that with.

496
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,960
How do you do identification? By Maldi-Tof.

497
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:17,219
What are the the tricks be done and others are already done because there are organisms that don't discriminate.

498
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:20,730
And all these are some significant ones like E Coli and shigella.

499
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:25,590
The overlap between their patterns, surprisingly, is is indistinguishable.

500
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:30,660
So we have to use biochemical tests to actually distinguish those two from each other.

501
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:38,280
Strep NU and strep minus group, which is a beard, and strep also indistinguishable by maldi-tof.

502
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:45,380
So again, we have to use different methods, different, smaller, rapid benchtop biochemicals.

503
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:51,390
And then there are organisms like Taddeo bacteria, which is one.

504
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:55,890
Anybody ever heard of the adjacent groups of organisms before?

505
00:56:56,490 --> 00:57:01,800
So the Haystack Group is a group of fastidious organisms that grow very poorly in culture,

506
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:10,380
typically associated with endocarditis that are represented by a haemophilus aggregated bacteria,

507
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:18,720
taddeo bacterium of Okinawa and King Island groups or species, genesis and journey of bacterium.

508
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:25,170
She does not identify by this method at all because we don't have enough strain types in there for it to match to.

509
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:34,650
So it's an example of one that we have to go back to the old biochemical until we build up the database of the members of that genus and species.

510
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:44,410
So just a quick overview of what we've done. We've talked a little bit about the steering, the importance of standing in microscopic exam classical,

511
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:50,299
and we haven't talked really about Immunofluorescence. It's really taking this out of the presentation because we just don't do

512
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:58,100
Immunofluorescence anymore to the most part for bacteria for fungal and mycobacteria.

513
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:04,549
We'll talk about those methods in a couple of slides. We do use direct antigen detection and antibody action.

514
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:08,390
We talked about those in the different organisms those are relevant for.

515
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:15,800
And then obviously culture is a key component to our our work in the micro lab using different media,

516
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,000
different culture conditions, even more colony morphology to guide work out.

517
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:28,980
Metabolism of substrates in the biochemical reviews in organisms are now becoming less important

518
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,590
in terms of word maldi-tof and molecular identification is kind of taking precedence.

519
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:41,910
And then we'll talk later about nucleic acid amplification testing and the importance of that.

520
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:53,810
As as I said, in viral terms, that's really taking over viral diagnostics and is actually taking over some things in the bacterial realm, too,

521
00:58:53,820 --> 00:59:00,870
like Clostridium difficile is now a PCR detected organic organism through strep good old

522
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:05,700
group strep rapid tests that you may have had as a kid in the pediatrician's office.

523
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:12,360
Those are now being replaced by PCR tests because they're much more accurate, sensitive and specific.

524
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:18,119
So I mentioned earlier we talked a little bit about blood culture because there is a crucial

525
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:26,880
component of what we do every hour in the hour delay in the identification of a septic patient.

526
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:32,400
It increases the mortality risk for that patient, zero 7%.

527
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,140
So you get to a pretty high mortality risk.

528
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:45,930
So if you're delaying that identification of an organism by 10 to 12 hours, so we need to do these things as quickly as possible.

529
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:50,310
As soon as the blood gets to us in this bottle, which has some media in it.

530
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:58,860
We throw it on one of these instruments at the hospital. You can see this is like a honeycombed drawer holding dozens and dozens of bottles.

531
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:09,720
Like I said, we do about 50,000 a year. This is really a glorified incubator with some optics on the back end of each honeycomb,

532
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:18,900
the optics are interrogating a pad that's at the bottom of every bottle that's sensitive to concentrations of carbon dioxide.

533
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:28,530
So as the lady interrogates this pad and looks for reduction of fluorescence, is continually doing that about every 5 minutes.

534
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:32,370
And then as soon as growth is detected,

535
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:40,620
the growth occurs in the bottle of carbon dioxide is usually produced as a part of the metabolic byproduct that increases the fluorescence of the pad

536
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:52,740
on the bottom and you get a curve of growth that occurs on detecting that fluorescence change which is detected by the instrument as a growth curve,

537
01:00:53,400 --> 01:01:02,670
sets off an alarm. One thing I didn't mention is that our labs are all 24 seven, so anytime during the day blood culture goes farther,

538
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:11,180
alarm goes off or runs over to the instrument, pulls it off, and the first thing they're going to do is a gram stain.

539
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:18,000
They're going to do a gram say to look and see if it's a gram, positive toxin clusters, Jane's gram negative rod, what it say.

540
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:23,160
And that's going to be reported to the clinician within 30 minutes of that culture grown positive

541
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:27,990
because that's what they need to know in terms of starting a period of therapy for that patient.

542
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:37,790
The next thing that we have, which is kind of a new revolution in micro, is what's called rapid blood culture, molecular analysis.

543
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:42,140
So like I said, you've got a blood culture with gram positive consonant clusters.

544
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:49,700
It's good to know that much. At least you have a good feeling that that could be a true infection recruit through substance,

545
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:52,640
through bacteremia, but it could be a contaminant as well.

546
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:59,450
So we've implemented molecular testing right after that blood culture goes positive as well.

547
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:07,579
That can give you as a result, in 2 to 3 hours. It's called very gene, although we're switching away from this through another similar method soon.

548
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:13,220
So don't remember that name. Just remember molecular rapid molecular blood cultures.

549
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:22,010
And that gives us an identification of these limited organisms down here within that 2 to 3 hour window.

550
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:26,360
Whereas normally we would take them now about from that blood culture we'd have to play

551
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:31,790
it to solid media in was an overnight growth cycle for the solid media to grow colonies.

552
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:37,880
And then from those colonies you would use the maldi-tof and we don't an identification right away but that would take

553
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:45,020
24 hours from detection of growth these molecular for at least these significant organisms here like staph aureus.

554
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:52,480
Streptococcal actor strep numerous typologies we know those within two or 3 hours of

555
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:58,420
that probably positive again impacting that mortality impact of a positive culture.

556
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:07,110
We also have someone here that are common contaminants like staph epidermidis and some of the other strep groups.

557
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:14,040
So Benjy knows this group is actually interesting because it can be a contaminant, but it can also be associated with Anderton.

558
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:18,570
Itis so important to know that right away, as soon as possible.

559
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,630
You also see down here some mechanisms of resistance.

560
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:32,270
Everybody sort of mersa. I'm sure nurses are a very similar brain nurses, methicillin resistant staph aureus.

561
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:39,410
Mac Aging in the mac aging is the gene that confers Vaseline resistance in staph aureus.

562
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:45,059
And so we can not only say staph aureus within 2 to 3 hours of positive,

563
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:52,850
but also we can tell you if it's methicillin resistant or methicillin susceptible, again, impacting what therapy you're going to choose to use.

564
01:03:54,420 --> 01:04:00,720
Vancomycin resistance is also associated with very vancomycin resistant enterococcus.

565
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:07,110
So those two are on here as well. And then also very important from a public health perspective.

566
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:12,330
ESPN also was a big deal 20, 20 years ago or so.

567
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:16,949
Are they still impact in therapy? Of course, and choice of therapy.

568
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:20,280
But they're not horses way out of the barn.

569
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:25,860
The horse is still in the barn is the campbell-bannerman is in front of Henry's producers.

570
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:32,430
Most common that we have here in the United States is called the KPC or Club Annual Carbapenems.

571
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:42,730
And this is a enzyme that knocks out all your beta lactams, inactivates all those, including the carbon venomous, so and also the several spores.

572
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:50,189
So you're really in a pinch if you've got a KPC when it's producing E coli or club pneumo, for example,

573
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:57,149
in your plant culture in terms of what therapeutics you can use, some of these other ones are more common around the world.

574
01:04:57,150 --> 01:05:05,760
And the M is the New Delhi Botanical Beta Lactam ace. It's probably second most common in the United States now, at least in the in third category,

575
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:12,990
we see a decent number of Oxford Carbapenem cases in our AC meta back organisms.

576
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:21,749
And again, the importance of these within 2 to 3 hours of culture is really giving the person a chance to get them on the right.

577
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:24,870
Antibiotics. From the public health perspective,

578
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:31,110
it also gives the clinician the chance and the infection prevention is a chance to get those people under the right precautions.

579
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:35,760
So we're not spreading these mechanisms around the hospital to other patients.

580
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:44,040
Most of these methods, mechanisms of resistance are plasmid based and so they're easily transmissible from organism, the organism.

581
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:57,799
Specific passages of note staph aureus or her skin through this pretty quick because I am way behind time and I always do this

582
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:06,540
I apologize too much plan so several is some group service we've talked about a lot of these organisms E coli including you.

583
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:14,900
The main point of the loving slides is just the fact that think of that spectrum again that e coli is normal GI flora.

584
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:15,829
We all care.

585
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:25,810
E coli, it's where it gets in is wrong areas and acquires resistance mechanisms, acquires pathogenicity mechanisms, requires toxins as well.

586
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:35,760
It causes problems. So I want to get into mycology a little bit and make bacteriology and the special handling it requires the acid testing,

587
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:45,480
extended incubation required for these. The idea required is and the idea it's practically it's primarily done by morphology.

588
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:53,760
And we have limited biochemical and molecular I.D. tools to identify RDF BS or acid falciparum this sort.

589
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:59,990
So general characteristics of the Mycobacterium family, then nano travel rods.

590
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:07,640
These cells have a high lipid content, so they resist the germs and they're often seen in Graham Stephenson's ghost organisms.

591
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:12,890
They are very slow growers. They range only from 3 to 60 days.

592
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:17,360
Recalling the appearance of micro bacterium.

593
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,930
Tuberculosis, for example, can take up to two months to grow.

594
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:27,100
And there is more than 180 recognized species. So it's a very diverse group of organisms.

595
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:30,829
And although we probably rarely only hear about half a dozen or so,

596
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:37,760
primarily as the key pathogens, a lot of these organisms are environmental in nature, too.

597
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:45,740
So it's only by reaching that attention barrier somehow that they cause infections.

598
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:57,250
So why are they called acid fest bacteria? The acid test staining concept is a little different than a gram stain,

599
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:02,479
although it still has a primary and secondary staining strategy in the primary scene.

600
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,070
In this case is taken up by all organisms thick.

601
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:12,890
So all the acid, various bacteria with its high lipid content prevents it from being colorized.

602
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:22,969
So that six cell wall of the FP kind of plays the role of attempting to like it in this case and resists being colorized with an acid alcohol.

603
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:25,930
So that's where you get your term acid fast.

604
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:33,430
It's holding fast to the stain in the presence of acid and then other bacteria which decolonize really take up the contrast.

605
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:36,739
So we have two different stains that we used in the clinical lab.

606
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:47,180
One is a ziel nielson or quinine stain, which is used as a primary carbon fiber and kind of a red stain in the car staining malachite green.

607
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:53,750
And then the other, the immunofluorescence thing that we utilize in.

608
01:08:55,590 --> 01:09:02,050
Therapy diagnostics is the army in Rolling Stone, and that stains some uniforms,

609
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:08,000
just fluorescent stains with the army rotating as a primary in the counter stain is potassium.

610
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:14,080
So why do we have two different stains for this organism group? It's very efficiency of screening.

611
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:24,040
So with a this is the one time really where you I can say that you can use 400 X to actually screen for bacteria.

612
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:27,520
And that's when you're looking at under a fluorescent scope.

613
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:37,090
You're able to then quickly screen sputum and efficiently screen a large quantity of sputum for RFP as the best facility.

614
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:46,690
And in most cases where you're screening sputum for a IFB, you're looking for in those patients that are at high risk for TB produces.

615
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:51,760
So you want to make sure you have a very highly sensitive method to detect these.

616
01:09:52,030 --> 01:10:00,520
If we are particularly you're looking for tuberculosis, but like any stain, this is a positive right here, by the way.

617
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:08,019
This is positive for FDA, but we can't tell if that's mycobacterium tuberculosis or what's more commonly found in

618
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:16,840
respiratoire is mycobacterium avium group or mycobacterium 4 to 1 of the rabbit draws.

619
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:24,489
For other tissue type tissue types, we have our solid phase staining.

620
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:31,840
The Zale Neilson stain, which you can see here, is the red staining much larger because we're able to review these of a thousand

621
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:39,850
x acidophilus bacilli in the background of acid fast negative organisms.

622
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:52,380
This is just an example of a Kenyan strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis when it does do this, causing a phenomenon here or phenotype.

623
01:10:52,920 --> 01:11:02,940
You see, this is actually chains of mycobacterium tuberculosis organism bacilli that are multiple chains cording together.

624
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,580
You can imagine that that's very positive.

625
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,720
Like for, like a bacterium. Tuberculosis.

626
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:13,560
Rarely seen, though, because that's a very heavily infected specimen.

627
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:23,229
General characteristics of the TV complex, the TV complex as a whole.

628
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:25,150
You've probably heard mostly of TV.

629
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:32,860
We speak generally of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or tuberculosis as TB is the primary cause, but it's actually a complex.

630
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:36,460
There's actually a number of species within that complex.

631
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:42,070
Bovis, Bovis, BCG and advocate as well that all cause TB.

632
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:52,210
But generally there is no need to distinguish among these species and they're all just lumped under Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex identification.

633
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:58,700
Epidemiology briefly. Quarter of the world's population are infected with tuberculosis.

634
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:08,270
10,000 new cases in the U.S. annually. Generally, in the homeless or prison population, 30 million are already infected with latent disease,

635
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:13,670
and drug resistant strains are increasing due to noncompliance with treatment.

636
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:19,670
Internationally, generally, complications from infection, longer treatment regimens.

637
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:24,800
Delays in the identification of resistant strains and social factors.

638
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:32,630
Overcrowding. Homeless. This is really a big problem in the world as a whole.

639
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:40,850
Our diagnostics for TB are just now getting into the phase of nucleic acid diagnostics,

640
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:49,340
very sensitive PCR diagnostics that can give you an ID within days of receiving a specimen.

641
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:57,410
As you can imagine, culture diagnostics for this organism can take 1 to 2 months to grow can be somewhat challenging.

642
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:04,730
More commonly, though, in our population we see a lot of like mycobacterium avium complex,

643
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:10,070
slow growing organism, pulmonary and disseminated disease in the immunocompromised and elderly,

644
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:17,210
or the typical mycobacteria group which are generally also caused rapid growing mega bacterium,

645
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:21,499
superficial and bloodstream infections in the immunocompromised.

646
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:29,680
Again, some examples of these species include abscesses complex July 24 to urogenital.

647
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:37,640
These things these are definitely these two categories are what we see much more often in our NFP population.

648
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:45,499
Mycology finally touching on fungus and yeast widely distributed in nature.

649
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:56,210
We're talking environmental organisms generally hundreds of thousands of different types, all eukaryotic highly developed cellular structures here.

650
01:13:57,110 --> 01:14:01,910
Facultative the anaerobic are strictly aerobic in terms of their growth characteristics.

651
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:08,600
We do grow these as well and these are kind of in between the bacterial growth cycle,

652
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:14,420
which bacteria will generally grow up to visible colony one or two days,

653
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:21,530
fungus and yeast users will generally grow to a visible colony within 2 to 3 and 2 to 4 days.

654
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:31,760
Fungus aspergillus, for example. Some of these other local fungi can take 1 to 2 weeks to grow.

655
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:36,710
To grow at least to grow the identify identifying structures within them.

656
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:43,640
Quickly moving through here, major developments in mycology.

657
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:53,000
These infections have increased over the recent past two decades because of an increase in hospital or patients.

658
01:14:53,510 --> 01:15:01,940
Immunocompromised and elderly patients. Thankfully, we've had a decent cycle of newly developed and affordable drugs.

659
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:09,710
We have the ability to do any fungal susceptibility testing for the yeast and for some of the fungal organisms.

660
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,730
And there's been limited resistance generally from those drugs.

661
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:22,700
But again, where it's developed, there are been newly developed, final drug antifungal drones going about anybody.

662
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:26,810
You're hurt a little bit you probably have with your public health background.

663
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:39,180
Candida auris. Well, anybody in the know is there a couple of nods of the Senate or is is a member of east and came to fame right before COVID.

664
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:46,870
So it kind of it was big news in the public health community and then went away during COVID and it's coming back again right now.

665
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:54,179
But it's a beast that's claim to fame is that it's found very commonly in the hospital.

666
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:54,960
These settings,

667
01:15:55,530 --> 01:16:04,079
it's has a generally pretty resistant antifungal profile and it's really hard to get out of the environment once you have it in the environment.

668
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,590
So kind of an infection prevention nightmare bug.

669
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:16,919
But again, we can culture and we can identify it using PCR methods so we have much better tools in place right now.

670
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:25,590
We can even do susceptibility testing for it in our. So we're well prepared for that, at least in that bug.

671
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:35,340
And again, in coordination with our infection prevention and public health colleagues, we have developed strategies to detect that organism.

672
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:43,600
And nip it in the bud. I think we'll have time to get to the dime or the dime of some.

673
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,600
Really interesting because at environmental temperatures.

674
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,079
Well. Let's just talk about the molds quickly.

675
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:55,150
Molds are always in their eye. Cilia and vegetative material.

676
01:16:55,630 --> 01:17:03,190
Hi. For all you know, you're thinking mold. You're thinking what you commonly see in the environment with hyphae and spores.

677
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:07,990
Yeasts are much more like bacteria. These are pleated media.

678
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:12,040
They have colonies, creamy colonies, looking.

679
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:15,520
And, you know, each colony here is one yeast that was plated.

680
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:20,110
The die morphs are really interesting in that in their environmental forward,

681
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:25,360
environmental temperature and conditions they form molds all that growth.

682
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:34,570
But then if you put them in the human body or 37 physiologic conditions, they actually convert to a pathogenic yeast like form.

683
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:49,280
And I think I've got time to get to those. I'll skip over the Easter quickly to some examples of Candida albicans in culture direct stained

684
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:56,330
from oral scrapings where all German albicans is carried by a lot of us in our normal flora.

685
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:02,190
Mold the some of the images here.

686
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:06,540
Aspergillus flavors, the different aspergillus species.

687
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:14,910
We're growing these in the lab and using their structure that we see microscopically with the different stains

688
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:21,540
that we can use for fungal organisms to help identify them along with their morphologic characteristics.

689
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:27,210
So not a lot of fancy tools for when it comes to fungal diagnostics.

690
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:35,880
It's all classic color, texture, morphological descriptions that helps identify them.

691
01:18:37,890 --> 01:18:43,560
And we have a steaming need for fungal organisms as well. Go cold before when it's another fluorescent stain.

692
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:50,490
This is really important on the criminal side because these organisms which are the mucus my see these group and they have

693
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:59,760
kind of like a ribbon like morphology compared to the very thin acute branching aspergillus or environmental organisms.

694
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:04,320
These guys are terrible pathogens or not terrible.

695
01:19:05,090 --> 01:19:12,390
They're really good pathogens. They can destroy tissue in a matter of hours.

696
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:19,660
And thankfully, it really only effects the most severely immunocompromised.

697
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:26,190
So not a problem for immuno competent people, but immunocompromised.

698
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:30,749
It's really important that we identify this as soon as possible because the only effective treatment

699
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:36,240
really is debridement and getting as much of the organism out as possible from the infected tissue.

700
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:46,610
This is another example of the hyphae, the hyper subject walls, the area of the foul lines, all of this.

701
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:54,080
This image right here, taken as a whole, is what a good check would use to identify an astragalus or a zygote,

702
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,650
either from culture or from direct specimen.
