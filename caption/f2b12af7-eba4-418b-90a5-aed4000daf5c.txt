1
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,460
Marisa Eisenberg: It started.

2
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:09,210
Marisa Eisenberg: awesome thanks Morgan and then um yeah so welcome back i'm guys have been working with Michael for a little while I it sounds like you did game theory this morning and.

3
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:20,280
Marisa Eisenberg: How did that go everything interesting usually games areas a little bit more abstract so it's a little bit kind of usually people kind of come out of it being with this is cool, but I think I would need to do a lot more reading.

4
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,310
Marisa Eisenberg: But but yeah good okay.

5
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:38,460
Marisa Eisenberg: All right, well today, so this afternoon, what we're going to do, we were going to do, networks and sampling methods and things of that nature, but I think some of that we're going to end up pushing to tomorrow and then what we're going to do this afternoon is.

6
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:38,790
Marisa Eisenberg: work.

7
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:47,820
Marisa Eisenberg: Talk about agent based models and then maybe we'll start network models and then we'll do sort of sampling methods and things like that tomorrow and let's see.

8
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,320
Marisa Eisenberg: Tomorrow, so one other thing tomorrow oh yeah here we go.

9
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:02,100
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah yeah it's again, it does have a lot of assumptions, you can weaken the assumptions and make it much more flexible, but then.

10
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:10,800
Marisa Eisenberg: Increasingly, as you start to shift towards a situation where you can't do as much analysis and you have to just use simulation to explore it.

11
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:28,320
Marisa Eisenberg: And, and so yeah, so I think it's it's it's tricky it has a very beautiful theory, if you can use it, but it's cheap it's hard to know um yeah so that's a good good observation and yeah but so Okay, so today we'll do agent based models and we'll get into networks.

12
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:36,150
Marisa Eisenberg: And then tomorrow we're going to do, will do some sampling stuff and then the other thing we're going to do tomorrow is.

13
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:47,220
Marisa Eisenberg: we're going to take a little bit of the time to work on a project like our sort of proposal for something that you would want to do if you could and then do some peer feedback on that, but.

14
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:55,770
Marisa Eisenberg: So we have the I think the proposal templates is up on the website Now let me just see if it is if it is.

15
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:57,900
Marisa Eisenberg: well.

16
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:04,080
Marisa Eisenberg: Maybe it's not okay on the break i'll put it i'll post it, and then we can.

17
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:17,730
Marisa Eisenberg: Maybe after the break we'll talk about kind of like what would be involved there and kind of how that's gonna work so i'll table that for the moment okay um any questions about material so far things like that, before we get started.

18
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,590
All right.

19
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,080
Marisa Eisenberg: i'll share my screen.

20
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:38,490
Marisa Eisenberg: career talk first about agent based models and how people see an agent based models before probably some having some haven't i'm guessing have.

21
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,480
Marisa Eisenberg: You all done a little bit maybe you've heard of them I kind of thing.

22
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:54,210
Marisa Eisenberg: And okay so we're gonna, so I think when we as we get into agent based models it's important to kind of maybe bring us back to this question, we asked on the first day of how to choose a modeling framework.

23
00:16:54,540 --> 00:17:02,130
Marisa Eisenberg: And some of the different kinds of questions that you, you would ask yourself as you're deciding what kind of modeling framework, you want to do, I just want to kind of.

24
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:11,340
Marisa Eisenberg: put this back in everybody's heads because we're going to agent based modeling is a very different flavor of modeling framework, then a lot of the other ones we've talked about so far and so.

25
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:22,800
Marisa Eisenberg: You know it's a it's a good one for you to kind of start reminding yourself that of what kinds of things there what kinds of questions you might ask as you're deciding what kind of framework to use so.

26
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:29,910
Marisa Eisenberg: And as we also talked about agent based models and sometimes I find when people are learning about.

27
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,260
Marisa Eisenberg: sort of modeling they'll they'll get comfortable with a particular flavor of model and then sort of.

28
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:51,480
Marisa Eisenberg: I don't know there's like a tendency to want to just use that hammer on every nail available, and I think it's it's useful to note that you can you can often model, the same process with many different frameworks and so.

29
00:17:52,770 --> 00:18:03,300
Marisa Eisenberg: it's useful to think about whether sometimes you can implement sort of the same or equivalent model in different frameworks, and so there may be ways to use something you're more comfortable with.

30
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:12,120
Marisa Eisenberg: that's actually equivalent to doing an agent based model or an O D, or whatever, but it's in a framework that you might sort of feel more at home with so.

31
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:23,430
Marisa Eisenberg: But on the other hand, sometimes you want to explicitly make you know, do something different so data just kind of throwing that out there, so, as you know, there's lots of examples where i've seen.

32
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:30,600
Marisa Eisenberg: You know plenty of times, where you'll implement maybe i've seen people implement, for instance, maybe an agent based model or.

33
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:37,650
Marisa Eisenberg: stochastic model for let's say an infectious disease outbreak and then it turns out that the assumptions that you make.

34
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,590
Marisa Eisenberg: Or the size of the population, mean that stochastics he doesn't play that much of a role or mean that you don't actually need.

35
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,090
Marisa Eisenberg: The individual level heterogeneity that comes with an agent based model and so.

36
00:18:48,420 --> 00:19:00,930
Marisa Eisenberg: it's equivalent actually to an O D or something else, and so they're just kind of thinking about how these different frameworks can be equivalent under different circumstances so just kind of prefacing this whole section, with a little bit of that okay so.

37
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,640
Marisa Eisenberg: agent based model so when you're thinking about how to choose a modeling framework.

38
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:14,700
Marisa Eisenberg: Of course, it depends on the question you're trying to answer agent based models and we're going to talk a little bit more about what exactly is an agent based model in a minute.

39
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:24,990
Marisa Eisenberg: But they tend to be particularly advantageous for questions where individual level heterogeneity or variation is is important so.

40
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:36,390
Marisa Eisenberg: situations where you really need to know about the exact the spatial position of individual people within your system or you have individuals with properties that very.

41
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:48,690
Marisa Eisenberg: At the like at the individual level that are going to make an impact for your larger population dynamics, you know it also sometimes it's the case that people will implement things in an agent based modeling framework.

42
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,650
Marisa Eisenberg: Sometimes they're just more clearer or interpreted will.

43
00:19:53,430 --> 00:20:02,580
Marisa Eisenberg: In agent based models or differential equations or whatever it, even if this you get the same answer in either case there's you know there'll be times, where it's just a more intuitive.

44
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,640
Marisa Eisenberg: To enter in implement something in a particular framework and okay um.

45
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:14,670
Marisa Eisenberg: The The one thing that I also did want to flag is that when you're thinking about how to choose a modeling framework.

46
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:24,870
Marisa Eisenberg: You know, be cautious, if the modeling framework you choose affect your results this definitely happens and if that's the case, it means that something about the.

47
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:33,270
Marisa Eisenberg: assumptions inherent in these different modeling frameworks is actually playing a role and what happens in your simulations of the outcome of interest.

48
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:40,860
Marisa Eisenberg: And so, this brings us back to this idea of model comparison, we talked about yesterday and that like whirlwind intro to the Ai see.

49
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:50,880
Marisa Eisenberg: You know, but the idea is that you really want to be working with ideally you want to be working with multiple modeling frameworks implementing the same question.

50
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:59,550
Marisa Eisenberg: In multiple different frameworks, so that you can find make sure that none of the assumptions inherent in any one of your frameworks is affecting the outcomes that you're getting so.

51
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:06,240
Marisa Eisenberg: we'll talk more about this later it'll probably get pushed to tomorrow with the sampling stuff but, but just kind of wanted to flag back.

52
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:14,070
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, so top down versus bottom up, so these are two kind of main major philosophical perspectives on model building.

53
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:22,020
Marisa Eisenberg: top down the big idea, there is to sort of start with the understanding of the larger sort of like big picture.

54
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:28,590
Marisa Eisenberg: system and then break down or decompose that larger idea into smaller subsystems.

55
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:39,780
Marisa Eisenberg: The bottom up view is you start with sort of the micro level processes, the way that individuals interact and then you couple those together to build up to emergent behaviors at the macro level.

56
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:56,670
Marisa Eisenberg: And agent based modeling is really taking more of this bottom up type of view you're building individual level processes and then coupling individuals in in us in a single system to see what the emergent behaviors are.

57
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:04,830
Marisa Eisenberg: And that said a lot of different models and modeling frameworks can really sort of be built or thought of from either perspective.

58
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:13,380
Marisa Eisenberg: And you know, there are advantages and disadvantages to each and I will say that oftentimes top down and bottom up.

59
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:23,550
Marisa Eisenberg: gets conflated with the idea that top down models are simple models and bottom up models are detailed models, but that's not necessarily really quite true you can.

60
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:31,410
Marisa Eisenberg: have seen plenty of things that would call themselves plenty of models that would sort of be called a top down approach that end up quite complicated and.

61
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:45,930
Marisa Eisenberg: or very detailed and plenty of bottom up models that actually operate on extremely simple rules, they just have a lot of agents and so they're actually sort of very simple so anyway just sort of something to kind of food for thought kind of think about.

62
00:22:47,130 --> 00:23:01,140
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, so that was my little preface and questions on the preface it was kind of more of a philosophical ramble I guess and but the let's dive into agent based models, more specifically, so agent based models.

63
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:14,370
Marisa Eisenberg: Are they typically have sort of three main components, there are the agents themselves, so there are independent agents are individuals that move and interact and explore their environment and operate on a set of rules.

64
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:27,210
Marisa Eisenberg: So they use some coded up set of rules for how they move around and do whatever it's they're doing there's an environment so that's whatever world simulated world that the agents existence so.

65
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:33,390
Marisa Eisenberg: This can be a static environment like a grid, or it can be a dynamic environment, maybe it's a.

66
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:42,780
Marisa Eisenberg: You know, a space that has resources or different you know things in the environment that agents can interact with and.

67
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:52,530
Marisa Eisenberg: There are also then rules or interactions that govern both how the agents and the environment behave how they interact what they do all those kinds of things.

68
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,280
Marisa Eisenberg: And so, those are kind of the three main components of agent based models.

69
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:02,580
Marisa Eisenberg: Almost all of you have probably actually used an agent based model at some point in your life because video games are agent based models.

70
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:19,470
Marisa Eisenberg: And so, if you ever played a video game from PAC man to zelda you know you're you've used an agent based model, the so the the non player characters are agents in this agent based model, it has some kind of environment, so you know, Mario can.

71
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:28,560
Marisa Eisenberg: You know walk on this part of the thing, but if he was here he'll fall, so the environment has different features that, in effect, you know how the agents behave.

72
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:36,060
Marisa Eisenberg: The agents have rules that govern you know what they do, they move back and forth, or they you know fight or whatever it is.

73
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:42,300
Marisa Eisenberg: The difference of course with a video game is that there's one special agent that you control right and so.

74
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:51,780
Marisa Eisenberg: That agent operates on a different set of rules and you're providing the behavior and the rule set that governs how that one special agent behaves but basically.

75
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:56,820
Marisa Eisenberg: Any video game that you play as an agent based model of something and so.

76
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:04,320
Marisa Eisenberg: When you're thinking about a about agent based models for a public health question oftentimes video games can be kind of a useful analogy.

77
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:16,620
Marisa Eisenberg: And the advantage of agent based models in general, well, some of the advantages and they can really them, the biggest thing, I think, as they can handle situations where you can't view the population as an aggregate.

78
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:28,830
Marisa Eisenberg: So where you need that heterogeneity so like the mark off types of models that we talked about on Tuesday the you know any of these compartmentalize odd you know any of these kind of compartmentalize types of models.

79
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:42,660
Marisa Eisenberg: are almost always going to be faster and easier to implement than an agent based model, but they can't really deal with individual level variation and that's something that an agent based model can do, and so, when you need.

80
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:53,010
Marisa Eisenberg: heterogeneity across individuals and you can't view them as an aggregate like a compartment or something like that that's where an agent based model can really shine.

81
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:07,410
Marisa Eisenberg: agent based models are often also just a natural way to describe the system, so we, we often think about when we describe how a disease is transmitted or the natural history of something or.

82
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:17,940
Marisa Eisenberg: You know, a particular system, we often think about it in terms of individuals and their decisions, our actions do does this person go get vaccinated or not does you know those kinds of things.

83
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:27,690
Marisa Eisenberg: And so, that is a very natural way to build an agent based model you think through what processes individuals are undergoing.

84
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:33,720
Marisa Eisenberg: And you should have code those up and so it's a very natural kind of way to describe the system.

85
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:47,520
Marisa Eisenberg: And it builds from the micro level in this case, thinking about the individual process to the macro level so what's the overall emergent behavior that individual decision making leads to at the population scale and.

86
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:56,940
Marisa Eisenberg: And so the other thing, of course, agent based models are very flexible you, you can code up individuals to operate on any rules that you want so there's no.

87
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:06,420
Marisa Eisenberg: need to assume things like everybody in a compartment you know is is equivalent an energy exchange interchangeable.

88
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:13,470
Marisa Eisenberg: You know, none of that stuff is required, you can cut it up, however, you want to so it can account for as much complexity or detail as you like.

89
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:21,120
Marisa Eisenberg: That of course is obviously a very dangerous statement, and you know it kit that's a strength and a weakness right, so the disadvantages well.

90
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:31,620
Marisa Eisenberg: One thing you know agent based models are really just code so they're often so there's not a mathematical framework for writing down as sort of like.

91
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:46,740
Marisa Eisenberg: If I told you a differential equation i'd like you to simulate I can write down the equations for that differential equation, and all of us would implement it and get the same answer you know kind of as long as we implemented it correctly, and you know we would all get the same thing.

92
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:54,360
Marisa Eisenberg: agent based models are much harder that way because it's it's code if there isn't a set of equations or a sort of short form.

93
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:06,360
Marisa Eisenberg: easy to share version that explains how the model behaves you can describe it in words, but people will implement a verbal description in lots of different ways, when they go to code it so.

94
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:18,090
Marisa Eisenberg: it's harder to develop and document and validates there's also fewer analytical tools for understanding the dynamics are doing parameter estimation, and you know when you talk about something like.

95
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:27,270
Marisa Eisenberg: differential equations or a lot of the stochastic models that we've looked at there's a huge literature that's been built up built up in mathematics and physics, for a long time.

96
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:38,730
Marisa Eisenberg: That means that we have a lot of tools already agent based models are a much newer thing, and so there just isn't that same degree of literature, or you know kind of history and so.

97
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:53,280
Marisa Eisenberg: they're also You know, as I mentioned they're very flexible but that lens them towards complexity or complicated ignis depending on what you think and that's both a strength and a weakness right, it is the number of times that i've seen.

98
00:28:54,420 --> 00:29:04,650
Marisa Eisenberg: You know people you know researchers try end up there's a temptation to put every detail that you know about the system into the model.

99
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:15,060
Marisa Eisenberg: Even when it's not necessarily needed, and then it can end up making your model very complicated and so um you know.

100
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:28,500
Marisa Eisenberg: That example of did I tell the HIV model example story On Monday I think I did, where the who is on sorry I don't know if I told her no I did okay yeah so you know that example of that who model.

101
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:37,320
Marisa Eisenberg: of HIV that wildly under predicted the number of cases of HIV that we were going to see you know kind of fell victim to this a little bit where.

102
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:45,420
Marisa Eisenberg: They built a model that was very complicated and realistic but because of that it's sort of hid the fact that they were making some assumptions that weren't quite right.

103
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:53,580
Marisa Eisenberg: And so, putting in a lot of detail can actually make it harder to evaluate whether your model has realistic assumptions or not, and so.

104
00:29:54,390 --> 00:30:00,330
Marisa Eisenberg: You know it's that's a danger, I guess, with the agent based modeling framework and okay.

105
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:07,530
Marisa Eisenberg: When it comes to thinking about the dynamics of agent based models it's hard to build a sort of general mathematical theory of agent based model dynamics.

106
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:17,370
Marisa Eisenberg: There are mathematical theories for lots of kind of Sub classes of agent based models sort of you know, different chunks oh wait I missed a question sorry um.

107
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:29,790
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah okay so So how do you validate the sorry this was how do you validate the assumptions of any of the models presenting all types of models or What do you mean with validation yeah so.

108
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:35,760
Marisa Eisenberg: I think there so there's a couple of different things, so one thing you know if you.

109
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:48,870
Marisa Eisenberg: If you have data on whether those assumptions are valid or not, that can obviously help you in terms of figuring it out, I think the biggest thing that often what happens is that we make some assumptions and we don't really know if they're if they're.

110
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:57,480
Marisa Eisenberg: A reasonable fit for the real system, and so I think usually really what it is, is that it's not necessarily that you can validate the assumptions.

111
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:05,670
Marisa Eisenberg: But it's more like you want to do, I mean you got to it in your question, you want to do a lot of model comparison, so you want to make multiple models that.

112
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:20,880
Marisa Eisenberg: That make different assumptions and then ask the same question of all of those models and see if you get the same answer, and if you don't then that that can at least guide you towards what additional information do you need you know, in order to figure out which which thing is correct.

113
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:34,770
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah more confusion for readers yeah when you present your eventual results yeah it's true, I mean you're not wrong it is, it is tricky, but it also is kind of necessary right like you know.

114
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:42,540
Marisa Eisenberg: I mean, and a lot of that probably ends up going to the supplements like it's very often that what ends up happening is that.

115
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,260
Marisa Eisenberg: You know you have a thing that says Okay, we tried this with five other models.

116
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,850
Marisa Eisenberg: they're all in the supplements, you can read it, if you want and that's kind of what happens.

117
00:31:51,030 --> 00:32:00,630
Marisa Eisenberg: Unless, of course, the models give wildly different answers and then now you're in a whole different thing right then now you've got a whole nother paper to write before you can write the paper you meant to read in the first place right.

118
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:17,910
Marisa Eisenberg: But um but yeah but, so I will say that, for those of you who are taking the tobacco modeling class and CES net the the the like console is a consortium that's NIH funded and they do a lot of really cool model comparison work where.

119
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:24,960
Marisa Eisenberg: they'll basically for for different kinds of cancer i'm sure they'll talk about it in the tobacco class for like the lungs that long.

120
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:40,290
Marisa Eisenberg: But for lung cancer, but basically the system that network will fund multiple different institutions separately to ask the same question but build totally independent models and then these multiple institutions all.

121
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:48,660
Marisa Eisenberg: answer the same question what's the optimal screening schedule for lung cancer how frequently should you get a mammogram whatever the question of interest is um.

122
00:32:49,260 --> 00:33:01,800
Marisa Eisenberg: And then they'll come they'll each work on this independently and then combine their efforts, you know, and I i've been impressed when looking at how Raphael has kind of navigated this isn't that stuff.

123
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:18,240
Marisa Eisenberg: I really like that they're sort of explicitly incorporating model comparison into into that work, which I think is kind of cool, but so if you're taking that class you'll probably hear more about that from from that group but anyway um okay yeah.

124
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:25,350
Marisa Eisenberg: That was a does that answer feels everybody good more questions I kind of went on a tangent there.

125
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:30,960
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, so when it comes to thinking about the dynamics of agent based models so.

126
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:38,640
Marisa Eisenberg: it's it's a little harder, so we talked about on Monday, remember, we talked about phase planes and equilibrium values and all these kinds of things.

127
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,320
Marisa Eisenberg: You don't necessarily have the same things for agent based models, they can do a lot of different kinds of patterns, but there are sort of.

128
00:33:47,280 --> 00:34:00,480
Marisa Eisenberg: Common things that will crop up it's not exactly as formal as as it would be for differential equations but you often see things like stable constant steady states oscillations or repeating patterns or things that are kind of.

129
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:07,380
Marisa Eisenberg: sort of chaotic ish in the sense that they have an organized but non repeating structure so things that.

130
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:15,840
Marisa Eisenberg: You know, oh it always makes kind of a circle, but it's not exactly a circle kind of a thing, and sometimes you just get disorder all sorts of different things.

131
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:33,570
Marisa Eisenberg: And we're going to talk here about some how we design build and simulate agent based models, you know explore this parameter space we'll talk about that mostly tomorrow and document them all of this kind of thing, but first I thought let's try out simulating an agent based model.

132
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,870
Marisa Eisenberg: And so, this is.

133
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:44,670
Marisa Eisenberg: put this in the chat, this is a forest fire model, and let me share my screen.

134
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:50,820
I didn't do it.

135
00:34:52,350 --> 00:35:01,560
Marisa Eisenberg: You share there we go Okay, so this is a forest fire model, and so, if you watch this model for a minute you'll see that the trees.

136
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:11,580
Marisa Eisenberg: grow, so this is actually a really fun system, and then a firewall that you just saw in there, so this is a great fun system for really, really simple coding.

137
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:20,490
Marisa Eisenberg: Nikki case who does a bunch of I don't know if any of you have encountered Nikki cases interactive before but they make a lot of really cool.

138
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:28,410
Marisa Eisenberg: Just kind of interesting interactive online things and one of the things that they made is this.

139
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:37,980
Marisa Eisenberg: awesome emoji simulator so you can code up your own agent based models in this and use emoji to represent the various agents that are doing different things.

140
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:46,560
Marisa Eisenberg: And it's really neat so I thought I would start us with this forest fire model and so on the right hand panel here is.

141
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,830
Marisa Eisenberg: The the Code, the rules that govern what they do, and so what you can see, with this forest fire model is that.

142
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:59,370
Marisa Eisenberg: Empty spots, with a point 3% chance turned into a tree, so a tree will grow in an empty spot.

143
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:09,840
Marisa Eisenberg: A tree has the point oh 1% chance of catching on fire, and if at least one of its neighbors are on fire than it to will catch on fire.

144
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,220
Marisa Eisenberg: And then the fire just turns into an empty spot because it just burns away.

145
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:21,690
Marisa Eisenberg: And so you can play around with this model, you can change the ratio of things that you start with so maybe you start with.

146
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:35,100
Marisa Eisenberg: All trees and then you get a big burst of fire, you know you can do a lot of different things and and you can speed it up or slow down, you can also draw you can pause and then like draw.

147
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:46,200
Marisa Eisenberg: Whatever you want, so you could draw a little fire here and then hit play and let it go and you can do a lot of different stuff, but I want you all to just take a minute take like.

148
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:59,850
Marisa Eisenberg: two to three minutes and play around with this, you know try different populations try different parameter values so change the probability of turning into a tree or turning into fire.

149
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:11,310
Marisa Eisenberg: You know, try some different things i've got some suggestions on the slide that i'll switch back to sharing now and and then let's talk about what you observed so just you know play around for.

150
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:19,080
Marisa Eisenberg: four minutes and then and then and then we'll let's talk about what you observed, maybe two minutes later yeah.

151
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:34,050
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay did everybody get a chance to do a little exploring, and so what What did you notice any interesting things.

152
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:41,640
Marisa Eisenberg: Interesting simulations yeah what what what kind of did you try some different parameters, what else did you what did you see.

153
00:39:44,100 --> 00:40:00,090
Caroline Godfrey: I think like you always think you'll end up with more trees, if you have a higher percentage for tree but that's not really the case because that also just leaves too much more widespread fires like that's the whole reason that we do control burns in fire country to.

154
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:00,600
Marisa Eisenberg: write it.

155
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:10,560
Caroline Godfrey: Creation tree, you know, to have a line that'll stop the fire and to keep the concentration of trees and brush and whatnot lower so you there's kind of a sweet spot of like.

156
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,250
Caroline Godfrey: Growing enough trees to have trees, but.

157
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:22,650
Caroline Godfrey: You want like the smaller sporadic fires that just kind of keep things at an equilibrium and not these massive wildfires.

158
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:34,140
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah exactly like if you make the tree grows too high, you actually just get like continuous fire forever like you know, because the trees are always growing back enough to kind of keep making more spotter for the flame.

159
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:44,220
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah no replanting more blank spaces, that makes sense yep exactly okay good what else any other things that kind of looked interesting.

160
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:59,100
Marisa Eisenberg: Any I want to like a quick one interesting behavior that I always like to show out it's a little hard to see.

161
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:04,320
Marisa Eisenberg: But i'm going to share my screen and, hopefully, you can see it if you if you set the tree growth.

162
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:11,970
Marisa Eisenberg: To be quite rapid you can sometimes see spiral waves in this it's hard, because sometimes they annihilate each other before it.

163
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:18,240
Marisa Eisenberg: happens, but do you see sometimes that it looks like the fire is kind of spiraling and.

164
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:24,240
Marisa Eisenberg: There will be times, where you can there was just a good little spiral just there, but do you see that kind of there's a little bit of a.

165
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:33,540
Marisa Eisenberg: spiral shape to some of these fires that will happen, and there was a there was a good, there will be like a kind of a spiral thing that goes on.

166
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:42,780
Marisa Eisenberg: And this is a cool model that can make it can, if you run it with like 100 actually make it a really big world if it would do let's try doing this.

167
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:52,980
Marisa Eisenberg: it's a fun thing because you can get spiral waves, maybe I need to make the fire a little less likely.

168
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,380
just go like that.

169
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,330
Marisa Eisenberg: Happy burn.

170
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:12,870
Marisa Eisenberg: Well it's still hard because they just keep running into each other, but you can get spirals out of this which is kind of fun, there was a good little spiral in the front of their you can see them sometimes they make like interesting little spirals.

171
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:22,830
Marisa Eisenberg: And you get also these occasional giant fire waves that go by and yeah Okay, so let me go back to the other thing so i'm.

172
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:34,860
Marisa Eisenberg: Here we go So what about so I, this is a good model for talking about modeling by analogy, and which is the idea that it's often the case that.

173
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:46,230
Marisa Eisenberg: There are certain mechanisms that show up even across very different fields of study that you could kind of.

174
00:42:47,730 --> 00:43:05,160
Marisa Eisenberg: You can make analogies across models from one thing to another thing and use the same model or adapt a model of a forest fire to represent something very different, so what else could this type of model, maybe be used for could you adapt this forest fire model to be something else.

175
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,430
Nicolle Krebs: Maybe like a spread of disease.

176
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:17,940
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah totally yeah yeah exactly so you could you could.

177
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,680
Marisa Eisenberg: This this model operates.

178
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:34,560
Marisa Eisenberg: Just like an infectious like you're susceptible when you're a tree you're sick you're infected when your fire and you're recovered when you're an empty spot right so it's actually basically an si our model right so.

179
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:43,470
Marisa Eisenberg: In this case, you have 100% chance of getting sick as soon as one of your neighbors is sick, but basically it's a it's an si our model.

180
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:54,960
Marisa Eisenberg: And so, so yeah so that's that's a perfect example and what else, so an epidemic or a pandemic exactly the plague yeah exactly yeah any of those kinds of things yeah what else could you use this to model.

181
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,310
Rishi Chanderraj: doesn't waver in the stadium.

182
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:13,530
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah yes it's a great one for that exactly that's another like good local contagious process right.

183
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:25,710
Marisa Eisenberg: You know I wave and then you aware of you know, or whoever is next to me right, so a wave in a stadium is perfect, I often for that kind of thing really actually wondered if you could get um.

184
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:34,830
Marisa Eisenberg: If you could get a like a wave in a stadium to show the kind of like sometimes I think you do kind of see fragmentation of.

185
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:46,320
Marisa Eisenberg: Like it'll be going, and then it kind of gets screwed up and so then like you kind of two ways that will mess one another up, and so, so it totally works for that and and yeah exactly so.

186
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:53,160
Marisa Eisenberg: In the chat can eat it was nothing like this was really only apply for a highly infectious disease and not a low infectious disease.

187
00:44:53,370 --> 00:45:06,840
Marisa Eisenberg: that's totally true if you wanted to make this kind of more reflective of a more low lower infectious disease, you need to change the percent chance that a tree catches, you know so here wait, let me share my screen.

188
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:13,050
Marisa Eisenberg: Sorry it's kind of frenetic with the i'll just pause here stop fire and.

189
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:19,380
Marisa Eisenberg: So here when we have it, if at least one of my neighbors are fire I just turned into fire.

190
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:26,580
Marisa Eisenberg: Instead, what you'd really want to do is say, instead of just automatically turning into fire you'd want to set some low probability.

191
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:37,470
Marisa Eisenberg: That, if my name, if I have a contact, who is infected I myself get infected it's not 100% chance right, so this is, this is a very infectious disease, but you could adapt it.

192
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:46,830
Marisa Eisenberg: and change this to instead of just turn into fire I say with an x percent chance I turn into fire so maybe with.

193
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:59,550
Marisa Eisenberg: I don't know a 10% chance, or something so if I have a neighbor who's on fire, I have a 10% chance of catching fire or a 50% you know, whatever it might be right, and so you could adapt this to kind of be more.

194
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:07,380
Marisa Eisenberg: more like a lower infectious disease, and if you did that you might want it to be that the fire doesn't just immediately burn away.

195
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:14,700
Marisa Eisenberg: Maybe it waits a couple of turns so you stay infectious for two or three turns or something, and that would slow it all down as well, so.

196
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:25,380
Marisa Eisenberg: it'll I mean it'll make you more it will give you more opportunities to infect so you'd have to adjust the probability, but you know that kind of thing, so you could adapt this to be something more of.

197
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:45,060
Marisa Eisenberg: A less transmissible disease but yeah as it stands it's a very transmissible disease, because it's 100% chance of transmitting right so yeah so that's a good point to you and one other thing that I think this is a nice is a nice analogy for this, you could also use this model to represent.

198
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:56,460
Marisa Eisenberg: Like muscle tissue firing or neurons firing right, so you could like you could imagine essentially when a neuron or a muscle tissue cell.

199
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:08,700
Marisa Eisenberg: fires or contracts it, it has it can it can fire, but then it has a refractory period where it can't fire for a little bit of time and then it becomes able to fire again and so.

200
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:19,050
Marisa Eisenberg: A neuron that is able to fire would be like the tree when expiring is the fire and then, when it's an empty cell that's in the refractory period right and so.

201
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,710
Marisa Eisenberg: When if you think about this as like muscle tissue.

202
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:34,680
Marisa Eisenberg: You know, when your neighbor fires, then you know it often propagates it so you get this kind of like, if you like, think about the heart right the way that the heart contracts there's a there's a there's a.

203
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:47,220
Marisa Eisenberg: In that case, of course, there's we have like the Sino atrial and atrial ventricular nodes that propagate an electric signal that moves across the whole heart but it moves across the heart, they all contract and then it.

204
00:47:47,850 --> 00:48:03,720
Marisa Eisenberg: It it, they have a refractory period, which is actually quite a bit like if you if you take this model and you kind of let me reset it with all trees, and you know if you imagine.

205
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:17,310
Marisa Eisenberg: A single fire here, and then we hit play you get well in this case because there's all these other places that fires can kick off me turn this off he said.

206
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:28,320
Marisa Eisenberg: If you do this, you get that's very much like the way a heartbeat propagates across the heart muscle tissue right, so you could imagine.

207
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:38,250
Marisa Eisenberg: You know if this down here is the Sino atrial note, or something like that, then you get a propagation they all go into refractory period afterwards, and then they become ready to fire again.

208
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:43,830
Marisa Eisenberg: And it turns out that that's kind of an interesting analogy because.

209
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:59,010
Marisa Eisenberg: If you so okay all right, I guess, I forgot, so you can see spiral waves large traveling waves other patterns, so we talked about infectious disease dynamics information flow, you could you could model this as all these kinds of different things.

210
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:07,530
Marisa Eisenberg: The cardiac tissue piece is kind of interesting because it turns out that this one No, this is just a.

211
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:09,720
Marisa Eisenberg: gift of.

212
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,020
Marisa Eisenberg: An electrocardiogram but, but so this it turns out that.

213
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:25,680
Marisa Eisenberg: So the normal rhythm has the heart, has a D polarization waves that contracts, the Atrium and then contracts, the ventricle like we've talked about but.

214
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:35,340
Marisa Eisenberg: The heart can undergo a lot of different bifurcation so meaning transitions to other kinds of behaviors like a raise me as and away here hang on.

215
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:46,110
Marisa Eisenberg: Oh interesting could apply to cancer So could you use this by analogy, you could think about it as a cancer cell like sort of having the fire be cancer cells invading or something like that.

216
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:56,970
Marisa Eisenberg: Where you could imagine that the cancer cells sort of displace the existing tissue it's tricky I think you could think of ways that it could apply you'd have to think carefully about sort of what.

217
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:00,480
Marisa Eisenberg: The tree versus the empty space, maybe it's sort of like.

218
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:11,550
Marisa Eisenberg: I guess after it could be like net chronic tissue maybe is the empty space sort of after the cancer cells have kind of invaded there, but maybe there's not I don't know.

219
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:17,970
Marisa Eisenberg: I think you could probably think about how to kind of analogy at come up with an analogy with cancer, but you'd have to kind of.

220
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:28,050
Marisa Eisenberg: Think through exactly what it would mean but yeah you could imagine, maybe the fire sort of being something like invading tumor cells and then maybe new chronic tissue or something.

221
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:42,990
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah that's an interesting question I don't know um but yeah But OK, but thinking briefly about sort of this cardiac muscle tissue idea it's so you have sort of your normal bump bump bump bump of the of the of the heart.

222
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:55,560
Marisa Eisenberg: But the heart can transition into having a arrhythmias and it turns out, so this is, for instance, a electrocardiogram of tachycardia so a faster heart rhythm.

223
00:50:56,310 --> 00:51:06,210
Marisa Eisenberg: and moving into ventricular flutters so that's when your ventricles are sort of fluttering and not actually able to properly beat to what's called ventricular fibrillation.

224
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:15,630
Marisa Eisenberg: Which is where you have sort of this disorganized attempting to beat and it turns out that a lot of these changes in behavior which are called.

225
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:26,010
Marisa Eisenberg: In a math term would be called bifurcation can be in turn can be understood in terms of spiral waves and period doubling bifurcation and all kinds of different dynamics.

226
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:38,430
Marisa Eisenberg: It turns out that, for instance let's see if I have it here yeah OK so i'm going to play these silly gifts, so it turns out that a lot of let's do this one actually so like the Fed, for instance.

227
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:50,250
Marisa Eisenberg: A lot of these come from situations where the normal electric activity that ought to be being guided by the Sino atrial Beethoven Tricolor node.

228
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:56,490
Marisa Eisenberg: stops working correctly, so what happens is that in a lot of these situations, what happens is that.

229
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,450
Marisa Eisenberg: The the like let's say a wave is moving down the heart.

230
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:13,290
Marisa Eisenberg: And it doesn't quite finished before the next one starts the now you have multiple just like we saw in the model we have multiple fires kind of flaming at the same time and burning out you hold these kind of disorganized spiral waves.

231
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:17,100
Marisa Eisenberg: The same thing can happen when you're in V fib and.

232
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:30,600
Marisa Eisenberg: you end up getting disorganized spiral waves that look very much like what we were seeing in the forest fire model which is kind of interesting So these are disorganized spiral waves of electrical activity, because you have.

233
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:32,910
Marisa Eisenberg: Like a not clean.

234
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:44,610
Marisa Eisenberg: Movement of that one big wave of electricity moving across the heart tissue if it gets blocked by something you know if there's a little bit of scarring or something in the in the muscle fibers or or in the muscle tissue.

235
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:53,850
Marisa Eisenberg: or something like that happens, you can get these disorganized waves that that end up actually kind of looking a lot like what we were seeing in the forest fire model, so I think it's a nice example of how.

236
00:52:54,840 --> 00:53:03,420
Marisa Eisenberg: There are often these kind of fundamental mechanisms that are driving a system of interest, and if you can kind of catch on to that, then it can help you think not just about.

237
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:12,150
Marisa Eisenberg: Your system, but how insights from other systems could help you understand your system, maybe there's something about how we treat.

238
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:20,520
Marisa Eisenberg: Forest fires that could be useful for thinking about you know cardiac arrhythmias or or vice versa, you know and so thinking about those kinds of things.

239
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:30,090
Marisa Eisenberg: You know, there are i'm not i'm unfortunately i'm not gonna remember the word was it ablation I think does anybody here and md probably um so.

240
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:45,570
Marisa Eisenberg: So there are there are like treatments, for instance, for, if you have longer term cardiac it like if you have a long standing cardiac arrhythmia they will do things that are kind of like the way that you burn a fire break.

241
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:48,480
Marisa Eisenberg: It with forest fires you'll blake part of the tissue.

242
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:52,140
Marisa Eisenberg: as a way of trying to stop those disorganized electrical sort of.

243
00:53:52,770 --> 00:54:07,650
Marisa Eisenberg: spiral ways from passing through all the time and kind of keep that into an organized single electrical ways that will pass through and it's really the same idea it's actually so there's some interesting parallels that you can often find with these kinds of things yeah.

244
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,580
Caroline Godfrey: relation is correct.

245
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:09,330
Okay.

246
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:19,020
Marisa Eisenberg: I was like I couldn't for a second I couldn't remember the word but anyway yeah good okay yeah yeah are you in scrubs right now so okay yesterday yeah.

247
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:31,620
Marisa Eisenberg: awesome um okay good good so yeah so anyway so um yeah okay good, so there so so just kind of wanted to kind of bring that as a thing as you start to build models.

248
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:40,560
Marisa Eisenberg: Keep like you'll you'll start to develop sort of an internal catalog of fundamental mechanisms like this, like the idea of.

249
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:50,010
Marisa Eisenberg: susceptible or you know at risk and then like active and then refractory kind of thing with a contagious phenomenon is.

250
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:58,950
Marisa Eisenberg: Very common and shows up all the time and, like different things about there are a lot of these kinds of mechanisms that you'll find about feedback loops and things like this.

251
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:09,300
Marisa Eisenberg: that once you start to notice the parallels you'll be able to kind of use that to your advantage and come up with ideas by seeing something in one field that might be useful as an analogy so.

252
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:19,620
Marisa Eisenberg: there's danger there to that just because it seems analogous doesn't always mean that it will work or that that's actually sort of really what's going on, but as a as a kind of way of.

253
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:28,950
Marisa Eisenberg: Giving yourself a little bit of inspiration or intuition, I often find this is helpful okay so Questions about any of that.

254
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:53,700
Marisa Eisenberg: I wanted to give you all a chance to build a model from scratch and we'll get to to building agent based models in net logo and we can do some with our to if we want to, but I wanted us to start with something kind of easy, so this is a I just put it in the chat, this is a blank.

255
00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:04,500
Marisa Eisenberg: agent based model with that emoji simulator and, and so what I want you to do is we'll take maybe I don't know 510 minutes something like that.

256
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:13,590
Marisa Eisenberg: And I want you to build this is a classic simple voting model it's not a very realistic voting model but it's it's an interesting one.

257
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:28,320
Marisa Eisenberg: So in this voting model, there are two parties or candidates options, whatever you want to think about it as and everyone will start so you can choose which to emoji I think the poop emoji has default, but you can put whatever emoji and you want to choose.

258
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:39,750
Marisa Eisenberg: And so pick two I recommend taking two with like different colors like so that that way they're visually easy to see or did very different shapes or something like that and.

259
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:47,910
Marisa Eisenberg: so that you can easily tell the difference when you're just looking at the grid, everyone will start with some random initial preference and then what they're going to do.

260
00:56:48,390 --> 00:57:01,590
Marisa Eisenberg: Is that each individual will tally so they'll count up the the the opinion or the votes of their neighbors and if more than half of their neighbors are voting the other way they'll switch.

261
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:08,460
Marisa Eisenberg: And so code up that mark that idea as a model, there are actually a few different This is like a little too vague.

262
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:16,140
Marisa Eisenberg: To specify really a single model, so we may end up with a couple of different flavors of models like a coded but code this up as a model.

263
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:30,330
Marisa Eisenberg: And then um let's see what happens, how does it, you know what and how What do people end up voting for you know all those kinds of things so let's take does this make sense as a thing to do and you'll have to kind of explore this little.

264
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:41,010
Marisa Eisenberg: simulator thing but try it out, you can pick what size grid you want or the population that you want, you can kind of decide that for yourself but let's take.

265
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:51,420
Marisa Eisenberg: 10 510 minutes i'll check in at five minutes, and then we can see how far we're going and or how far we've gotten and and yeah build this little model so we'll pause here for just a second.

266
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:18,150
Marisa Eisenberg: This is they've changed it, so the default isn't the poop emoji anymore it's now like cats and flowers or something it's probably probably better.

267
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:54,930
Marisa Eisenberg: Hopefully, everybody kind of caught on if you make you click make a new thing you can make more kinds of.

268
00:59:55,290 --> 01:00:08,220
Marisa Eisenberg: of agents and then underneath that there will be a little plus new and it'll show like in there, you can decide what rules, you want them to operate under and all that kind of stuff so people can explore.

269
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:46,200
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah good, you should get a neat yeah you can get a cool get good like sort of Cabo is actually a really good description I haven't called that before those yeah.

270
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:56,550
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, well, so it sounds like our did most people manage to get it sort of something kind of implemented and it's it's sort of working.

271
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:59,370
Marisa Eisenberg: We need another minute or two.

272
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:07,410
Please kind of.

273
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:09,300
Marisa Eisenberg: fish.

274
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:18,870
let's see okay.

275
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:25,080
Marisa Eisenberg: Anything interesting you observed and most people get the sort of camel pattern.

276
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,680
Marisa Eisenberg: Or did you get other things yeah.

277
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:39,720
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, so I see some I saw yeah enclave neighborhoods yes totally exactly, there are some interesting patterns that way too yeah yeah yeah.

278
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:54,210
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, so but probably hear it, let me, let me share my screen probably many of you are seeing something kinda like this, I just coded it while we were also sitting here so like where you get kind of a start random, and then they kind of settle into something.

279
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:00,120
Marisa Eisenberg: sort of along these lines, sometimes you can get it, so that they.

280
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:08,580
Marisa Eisenberg: there's like a like if you change the way it works if you if you make it at least I think whoops.

281
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:10,080
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah.

282
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:22,470
Marisa Eisenberg: This yeah, then you can get these little funny So if you if you interpret So when I in the rules that said if more than half of their neighbors are voting the other way they switched.

283
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:42,300
Marisa Eisenberg: If you make it at least half their neighbors are voting the other way, you can get these interesting fluffy fluffy things were there there's there's a tie, essentially, and so they keep flipping back and forth between between the two different situations you put it back whoops.

284
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:49,950
Marisa Eisenberg: But yeah you can, if you start with a population that's different to you get different kinds of patterns right So if you have empty space.

285
01:04:50,640 --> 01:05:01,950
Marisa Eisenberg: The empty space doesn't affect at least the way we've coded it here the empty space doesn't affect their votes right, and so you end up getting these kind of clusters with blank spots sort of tending to be around them.

286
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:13,080
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah but so okay did everybody kind of get something that looks roughly sort of like that does that match your intuition, for what you would expect the smile to do.

287
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:27,210
Marisa Eisenberg: Sometimes people think that it will tend towards a sort of like winner takes all all or nothing, and you know where the whole system should shift should kind of settle towards one thing or another.

288
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:38,610
Marisa Eisenberg: And it kind of does that locally right like you know it does end up that in your local area you're very likely to have the same boat as everyone who's around you.

289
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:45,330
Marisa Eisenberg: But globally it ends up being sort of half and half I think there's some interesting things you can think about with this model in terms of sort of.

290
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:54,120
Marisa Eisenberg: I don't know information bubbles, and you know that kind of thing about who you talk to, and therefore, how you think the world works, but but anyway.

291
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:58,080
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, so.

292
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:04,110
Marisa Eisenberg: Anybody try playing with the proportion there's some interesting stuff that can happen that way too.

293
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:21,000
Marisa Eisenberg: So when you set it to be biased, you know if it's half and half you usually get something sort of roughly half and half, but if you set it to be biased, you can get these interesting situations where you don't actually see.

294
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:42,690
Marisa Eisenberg: Once you get past a certain point so here if it doesn't stay reflective of the percentage you start with right essentially like if you if you bias it towards water, for instance, here, and the it's not like this is, you know roughly maybe 25% plants to start right.

295
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:56,310
Marisa Eisenberg: And and 75 ish let's say percent water roughly, but when you actually run the thing out the eventual percentage is quite a bit lower of plants right and the plants are really actually only able to stick around.

296
01:06:57,030 --> 01:07:09,720
Marisa Eisenberg: Because of the edges right there's they don't have any neighbors on this side and so that gives them a little bit of a heads up or a you know, a sort of an extra.

297
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:15,330
Marisa Eisenberg: advantage if you make it wrapped, I feel, how you do that in this.

298
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,250
Marisa Eisenberg: Anybody know.

299
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:20,250
Marisa Eisenberg: I guess maybe they are.

300
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:31,440
Marisa Eisenberg: It is it does anyone remember has even noticed, if this is such a way to, I guess, maybe you can't make it wrapped, but if you make it wrapped it might be that you couldn't have any.

301
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,500
Marisa Eisenberg: sort of plants survive at all so there's an interesting.

302
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:45,000
Marisa Eisenberg: What you'd call a bifurcation, meaning a sort of qualitative change in behavior once you get far enough away from half and half it ends up that the sort of winner take all structure.

303
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:54,810
Marisa Eisenberg: means that one side or the other, will tend to really sort of when the entire the entire population kind of interesting.

304
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:06,510
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, so just thought I would sort of bring that up it's a fun model if you want to like explore sort of how these different how simple rules like this can lead to kind of interesting behavior.

305
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:08,190
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay.

306
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:20,130
Marisa Eisenberg: um there's a bunch of other emoji and agent based models, if you want to explore other ones there's a there's a ton here i'll put this in the chat.

307
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:38,880
Marisa Eisenberg: And you can explore and there's links there it's the forest fire model again but there's links to lots of lots of other ones, the procedurally generated beaches, one is very relaxing if you ever want to find fun, but anyway okay so.

308
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,770
Marisa Eisenberg: Questions about that sort of emoji a vm saying.

309
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:48,090
Marisa Eisenberg: Questions about the behavior of any of those models, or any of that kind of stuff.

310
01:08:51,210 --> 01:09:02,670
Rishi Chanderraj: it's not really like it so like that simple rules, but the only way you're able to see what emerges is just a simulated there it is like because because there's so many individual.

311
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:10,290
Rishi Chanderraj: Agents don't want it it's impossible to know like an analytic solution, about how it would end up in front of him.

312
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:20,580
Marisa Eisenberg: Exactly exactly yeah and and if if if you I teach in the winter in the spring semester winter semester at Michigan a teacher.

313
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,140
Marisa Eisenberg: an agent based modeling class.

314
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:30,840
Marisa Eisenberg: And there are analytical tools, you can use to kind of get out of it, but you can't really I mean it's just to like you can make mean field models that sort of roughly get at some of these things but.

315
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:39,090
Marisa Eisenberg: But they they often are they won't actually show you the full you know sort of picture of what you're actually going to get when you run the simulation.

316
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:49,290
Marisa Eisenberg: Like you say, the only way to do it is just to simulate it it's a it's kind of a perfect example of that like unknown knowns idea we understand the mechanisms perfectly because we're putting them in ourselves.

317
01:09:49,560 --> 01:10:00,360
Marisa Eisenberg: But we just don't have the brainpower to be able to imagine what is going to be the outcome of them, and so you have to just use a computer and so yeah it's an interesting it's an interesting system.

318
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:10,290
Marisa Eisenberg: But yeah cool okay good so let's talk a little bit about some of the different features and kinds of things that you'll often observe in agent based models.

319
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:18,960
Marisa Eisenberg: And then we'll talk a little bit about how we sort of documentation based models and what kind of the like how to sort of structure and agent based model with your building.

320
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:33,090
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, so interactions obviously are pretty key most agent based models involve some amount of interactions between agents and you know that gets implemented in lots of different ways.

321
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:50,160
Marisa Eisenberg: In different models, you know infectious disease models evolution invasion markets voting all these different kinds of ideas and there's a let's see I didn't even think about it, do I have net logo on this computer yes okay good.

322
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:58,350
Marisa Eisenberg: So we'll we're not going to do, I think, too much with net logo actually today I just don't think we're going to have time but.

323
01:10:59,610 --> 01:11:13,080
Marisa Eisenberg: I did want to just show show you a little bit of sort of how net logo works and then that way, if you want to do some of the agent based model questions in the lab you can do it, and so net logo is a.

324
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:23,970
Marisa Eisenberg: Is a language that's built for agent based models and we'll show a couple of different examples as we're kind of going through this little example section using let me.

325
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:30,000
Marisa Eisenberg: Open the virus on a network okay simple.

326
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:38,970
share.

327
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:52,290
Marisa Eisenberg: So net logo is a is a it's it's it feels almost kind of old timey in a way, like it's got a its got a it's a it's a fun kind of it, you essentially your model is like a little APP.

328
01:11:52,860 --> 01:12:03,090
Marisa Eisenberg: So you build your model with like a little interface that has a setup so, for instance, in this case it's a model of a virus spreading on a network of individuals and so.

329
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:11,370
Marisa Eisenberg: It visualizes it and you can decide what sort of plots and things like that you want usually on the sort of front page the interface page you.

330
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:21,060
Marisa Eisenberg: You you set a bunch of the parameters that you think you might want to play with and then there's a code tab over here, which is where all the code for the model actually goes and so.

331
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:32,040
Marisa Eisenberg: we'll kind of dig into this a little bit more later, but I just wanted to kind of get you all sort of introduced in that logo it's a really nice language for doing agent based models it I.

332
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:41,730
Marisa Eisenberg: I would caution that most of the time when you want to do this for sort of research and you end up kind of moving to bigger things you probably are going to move to something like Python or.

333
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:47,610
Marisa Eisenberg: If people do stuff in our or often it's more like Java, but um.

334
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:59,790
Marisa Eisenberg: But you can or c++ or something like that, but you can you can do a lot with that logo and there's plenty of time I know plenty of people who do lots of like research modeling with that logo too so.

335
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:05,130
Marisa Eisenberg: it's a very friendly language and it's a nice it's a nice one if you want to build an agent based model.

336
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:17,760
Marisa Eisenberg: So anyway, so you this This example shows how one instance of interactions with an agent based model, so we simulated an si our model earlier this week.

337
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:24,270
Marisa Eisenberg: Here we're going to simulate a agent based model it's really kind of actually a network model of.

338
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:46,290
Marisa Eisenberg: disease spread where what we're going to do is you start with a set of randomly chosen initial three you can change how many you know you want the and how big you want the initial outbreak to be, but so an initial three infected nodes and then, if you hit go the disease will propagate.

339
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:56,070
Marisa Eisenberg: And so you can see there's three classes for individuals they can be susceptible infected or resistant and.

340
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:05,070
Marisa Eisenberg: The resistant ones here are are grayed out, they have a after they become infected they have some probability of going back to being susceptible or becoming resistant.

341
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:13,470
Marisa Eisenberg: And you can see how the network has a virus basically sort of transmits across the network and and it's interesting in this example.

342
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:20,130
Marisa Eisenberg: So you can see how the network structure and those stochastic at the randomness.

343
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:31,980
Marisa Eisenberg: mean that you get dynamics that are very similar to what you would see from a differential equation model of spread infection spread, but not exactly right, so you get sort of a epidemic curve.

344
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:42,180
Marisa Eisenberg: The number of susceptible drops down the number of infected goes up and then comes back down the number of resistant comes up eventually the epidemic sort of burns itself out.

345
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:55,410
Marisa Eisenberg: So it's got sort of a lot of the same qualitative features, but it's not exactly the same and, of course, if you run the infection twice it doesn't always turn out the same so in this case the epidemic actually died out so drastically right.

346
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:09,420
Marisa Eisenberg: If you run it again, you know you'll get different dynamics each time and so it's a nice example of sort of how you can you can play with the way that the network is structured and you'll see that you get different.

347
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:15,840
Marisa Eisenberg: Dynamic patterns of how the disease spreads so like here we'll let this one finish you get this kind of.

348
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:23,400
Marisa Eisenberg: When when the epidemic kicks off and actually manages to spread throughout the whole network, you get a sort of characteristic.

349
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:30,060
Marisa Eisenberg: At the curve, where you have a you know, a kind of the in number of infected goes up and then eventually comes back down to zero.

350
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:39,060
Marisa Eisenberg: And you get this kind of sort of typical thing, where the number of susceptible drops down the number of resistant comes up eventually the thing burns itself out, etc.

351
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:44,700
Marisa Eisenberg: The way that that plays out if you change the structure of the network so keep the number of nodes the same let's say.

352
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:58,830
Marisa Eisenberg: But let's make the degree, so instead of being connected to, so I think this was an average no degree of six let's make it so that they have an average no degree of I don't know 15 and now you have a way more connected network right and so.

353
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:06,570
Marisa Eisenberg: you'll see that this it travels through the network much, much faster right because the network is a lot more connected so.

354
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:16,890
Marisa Eisenberg: i'm an agent based model or a network model like this, even though it's capturing some of the same process as that differential equation si our models that we modeled before.

355
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:24,690
Marisa Eisenberg: And now you can see how the actual contact network structure that people are up that the disease is operating on.

356
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:32,670
Marisa Eisenberg: You know, affects the way the dynamics happen, and you know the dynamics are really sort of much the same as you would see from a differential equation, but.

357
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:41,640
Marisa Eisenberg: The, but there are subtleties there are the qualitative sort of pattern is much the same, but there are differences depending on how the network is structured right and so.

358
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:57,870
Marisa Eisenberg: You can you could capture some of that in the in the parameters you chose, for your differential equation, and things like that, but it gives you a way of sort of exploring some of these things, so you know, so you can also let's try one more let's make the average no degree like.

359
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:07,350
Marisa Eisenberg: Three sure something smaller so now, you get something like this, where the network is actually so broken up that.

360
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:15,660
Marisa Eisenberg: Some of these can't go very far right, this infected person, they can only in fact this other infected person and then so you're not going to get if I hit go.

361
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:22,200
Marisa Eisenberg: Your it's not going to do much right it just can't because of the way the The thing is connected if we make the.

362
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:32,700
Marisa Eisenberg: See if we do it this way, you know, even if you make it a very large group, and you know there's only so far that it can really spread, because the network doesn't have that much time activity.

363
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:43,530
Marisa Eisenberg: And so the network structure can affect the way that the virus spreads and so you can sort of explore that here with an agent based model.

364
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:45,000
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay.

365
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:54,030
Marisa Eisenberg: So this this this model, by the way, if you download that logo and then you go, let me share my whole screen.

366
01:17:54,900 --> 01:18:11,370
Marisa Eisenberg: Actually, so if you download that logo and then you go to the models library there's a bunch of models that they have that you can try out and play with and fiddle with the code and all that kind of thing so there's a virus on a network one.

367
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:15,930
Marisa Eisenberg: You know and there's lots of different network examples there's.

368
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:25,050
Marisa Eisenberg: social science examples there's all kinds of different different things here different models that you can sort of fiddle around with so just as a thing that you can kind of try.

369
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:33,360
Marisa Eisenberg: And we'll look at a couple of others, today, but if you want to play around with some agent based models there's a lot of pre built examples that are often kind of fun.

370
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:45,600
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, so so that's the virus on the network example and i'm going to skip sugar escape, but I do recommend if you want to play around with some of these net local model sugar escape is a classic.

371
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:59,790
Marisa Eisenberg: it's an economic model of economic interactions between individuals and the environment, and how distribution of resources can affect the population and so anyway it's an interesting one, so in this model.

372
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:15,060
Marisa Eisenberg: The environment has a resource called sugar and then individuals need to collect sugar in order to survive and and so depending on who is initially positioned where and how good they are at collecting sugar you.

373
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:32,550
Marisa Eisenberg: You get all kinds of interesting data so anyhow so interactions are common feature of agent based models, as we saw from the some of these other yeah that that that the the virus model is it a network model is that what you're asking.

374
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:51,720
Marisa Eisenberg: Oh sugar escape it's not it's not a network model it's a it's more of a grid style model so i'm sure people have probably done network versions of it but, but the classic sugar scape that I think is built into that logo is that it's not a network and yeah.

375
01:19:52,860 --> 01:20:06,000
Marisa Eisenberg: So, other things that are common to agent based models are flows and movement so it's all the agent based models often include movement of individuals or you know, whatever substances, what have you resources.

376
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:14,460
Marisa Eisenberg: Across space often so, for instance, there are lots of agent based models around network net for me not network neighborhood structure.

377
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:25,590
Marisa Eisenberg: And how people move around, through this through cities or neighborhoods or things like that there's also lots of agent based models about traffic flow and things of that nature.

378
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:34,110
Marisa Eisenberg: there's some good flocking models about sort of how birds and how you get those kind of promotions of starlings and things like that i'm going to actually skip that, though.

379
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:46,170
Marisa Eisenberg: This is a fun one i'm going to show this one, this is a very simple traffic model and whoops hang on just a second to the wrong thing.

380
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:50,550
Marisa Eisenberg: share my screen.

381
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:57,840
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, so this is a very simple traffic model oh wow zoomed in clearly.

382
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:00,930
What happened here.

383
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:02,910
Okay.

384
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:08,760
Marisa Eisenberg: sounds like a zoom out, but just not seem like it looks.

385
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:20,520
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay well apparently it's just very zoom and Okay, so this is a, this is a like a kind of classic traffic model.

386
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:28,860
Marisa Eisenberg: And there are lots of interesting models like this, this is a model of traffic jams on like a highway or a freeway and.

387
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:38,400
Marisa Eisenberg: And, and so what I like about this is it's got an interesting piece, let me restart it because eventually a traffic jam always does, build up hearing.

388
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:47,880
Marisa Eisenberg: Real hoops and so, if you one of the features that I think is interesting about this model is that you can explore how much politeness affects.

389
01:21:48,480 --> 01:22:08,400
Marisa Eisenberg: Traffic jams flow and and if you if people are too polite and too willing to slow down in order to let people into lane, you can see that it actually causes more traffic jams, then then otherwise there's it an appropriate level of politeness, and that that I guess one should.

390
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:20,970
Marisa Eisenberg: Otherwise it causes trouble for your traffic, which is kind of a just an interesting feature, so what I did here is I changed if you, you have your sort of model running I just restarted it if you up the politeness.

391
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:25,890
Marisa Eisenberg: Fully then as people get on on this on round everyone always moves to let them in.

392
01:22:26,370 --> 01:22:35,220
Marisa Eisenberg: And, and it causes a huge traffic jam to start to build up which I just thought is kind of interesting but models like this, you can use to explore how.

393
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:43,200
Marisa Eisenberg: You know, traffic jams form, how they move, you know you can see, actually here that it's kind of interesting if I make this politeness not quite so extreme.

394
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:55,650
Marisa Eisenberg: You could, but you can see it happening here this traffic jam way back here started over here because of the unread and then it moves like a wave through the truck through the the freeway system right it moves backwards as people.

395
01:22:55,980 --> 01:23:08,220
Marisa Eisenberg: Like you know essentially someone here slows down, and so this person slows down so, then this person, etc, and it propagates back to the thing, so you can explore how waves of traffic jams and things like that propagate.

396
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:13,230
Marisa Eisenberg: In in in agent based models oh yeah here we go sorry.

397
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:25,320
Marisa Eisenberg: There you so there's the link for that guy so just some interesting examples so flows and movement are another very common features that gets implemented in a lot of agent based models and.

398
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:35,910
Marisa Eisenberg: another kind of common thing that you have to deal with when you're working with an agent based model is that when you're building an agent based model.

399
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:49,920
Marisa Eisenberg: And the lack of of sort of a formal standardized structure means that there are many, many choices that you have to make, all of which mean assumptions.

400
01:23:51,390 --> 01:23:58,890
Marisa Eisenberg: For how you want to structure your models so what kinds of agents are you going to have how many How are they going to be distributed.

401
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:09,030
Marisa Eisenberg: What properties are they going to need what kind of environment, are you going to simulate is it going to be a grid, or do you want to use some kind of GIs map kind of thing is it a one dimensional two dimensional three dimensional.

402
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:15,120
Marisa Eisenberg: there's lots of different decisions and choices that you're going to have to make when you start to build agent based models.

403
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:22,710
Marisa Eisenberg: And so you know, for instance, you need to be thinking about sort of who will interact with whom and who will interact with the environment and so.

404
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:35,490
Marisa Eisenberg: It often ends up that there's sort of a lot of terminology and things like that that can kind of help you in thinking through all of this ways that you might want to structure your agent based model so.

405
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:38,040
Marisa Eisenberg: there's a.

406
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:45,510
Marisa Eisenberg: there's a nice framework for this, so you know, fundamentally, basically, remember, we said at the beginning there's sort of three.

407
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:52,050
Marisa Eisenberg: Things that you're going to really kind of want to think about your agents your environment and the rules are interactions that they operate by.

408
01:24:52,470 --> 01:25:03,000
Marisa Eisenberg: it's often really useful to start by sort of on paper or in a document sort of laying out these and building some diagrams or tables for how your agent based model was going to work.

409
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:16,410
Marisa Eisenberg: This also helps you with making your model reproducible and so to help with this there's a nice framework, called the party frameworks that I find really useful so party stands for properties actions rules time environment.

410
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:32,850
Marisa Eisenberg: And so, your agents are defined by their properties actions and rules and then you also have to define how time is going to operate and how your environment is going to work so let's talk a little bit about this party framework so.

411
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:41,190
Marisa Eisenberg: Your your your agents are often they're they're typically sort of something that are discreet and self contained.

412
01:25:41,490 --> 01:25:51,030
Marisa Eisenberg: They have different properties or states, they often operate sort of independently, they take local information and execute the pre designed rules based on that local information.

413
01:25:51,390 --> 01:26:06,450
Marisa Eisenberg: They can often interact with one another interact with the environment, and so they might also be adaptive all kinds of different things, but so you you basically want to design your agents and think about the rules that they're going to use to operate all their fair sort of.

414
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,890
Marisa Eisenberg: actions and properties and what have you and so.

415
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:23,340
Marisa Eisenberg: The design of them is basically sort of usually you're thinking about the properties or attributes of the agent so when we talked about the party framework properties actions rules, so the properties that that your agent have.

416
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:34,260
Marisa Eisenberg: So what states can they take on do they have static or dynamic kinds of properties, so can they change their preferences or their situation over time.

417
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:43,440
Marisa Eisenberg: In that logo, you would there's a there's different ways of sort of implementing this, this is actually we're not doing just take this out.

418
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:56,310
Marisa Eisenberg: Then there's also their actions, or sometimes this gets called their methods so how the sort of state of the agent their properties and their state.

419
01:26:56,640 --> 01:27:06,450
Marisa Eisenberg: And and their interactions with other agents in the environment, translate into what they're going to do so, this can also be used to update their attributes I.

420
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:12,390
Marisa Eisenberg: jump in here so i'll take that out, and you can kind of capture This basically sort of like this.

421
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:21,060
Marisa Eisenberg: So an agent has a bunch of attributes so they're there so, for instance, maybe I five an agent and we're thinking about an infectious disease process then.

422
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:32,010
Marisa Eisenberg: I have my level of immunity or self susceptibility to this infectious disease, I have some sort of attribute about how much contact i'm having with other individuals.

423
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:39,570
Marisa Eisenberg: Maybe I have attributes like how frequently do I wear a mask or something like that you know how often do I take protective behaviors.

424
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:45,120
Marisa Eisenberg: And then there's there's you know, so I might have preferences about my.

425
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:49,410
Marisa Eisenberg: Contact level or masking or what have you and then there's behaviors so.

426
01:27:49,680 --> 01:28:00,900
Marisa Eisenberg: How often do I actually go out and see people do you know how often do I contact them do I get sick all of those kinds of things so behaviors what happens to the agent and how they interact with the environment.

427
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:07,110
Marisa Eisenberg: And so agents will have sort of basically a set of rules that govern their states and what they're doing.

428
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:19,200
Marisa Eisenberg: And then they'll interact with other agents or interact with the environment in order to kind of implement those things, so the agent is really agents are really this properties actions rules.

429
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:39,840
Marisa Eisenberg: is usually where sort of the agent design goes in this party framework, and then I guess I don't actually have a slide for time and time is really sort of usually kind of short in this part A framework usually time is really just a question of are you going to do you want to have time.

430
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:50,550
Marisa Eisenberg: operate sort of continuously is time going to operate in discrete steps is everyone synced so that there are like turns essentially so.

431
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:57,960
Marisa Eisenberg: Everyone set everyone has whatever happens to them at this time, and then we do the next time step and we update everybody, at the same time.

432
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:08,280
Marisa Eisenberg: Or is it more like agents will update kind of randomly and asynchronously as they move, so you there's decisions like that that you'll need to make about how time works in your model.

433
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:17,610
Marisa Eisenberg: And then decisions about your environment so um you know you can choose lots of different kinds of environments that you want your agents to exist in.

434
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:31,530
Marisa Eisenberg: They could exist in space so maybe 2d or 3D space they could exist on a grid, they could exist as part of a network, and you can also bring in GIs information so a lot of agent based models out there.

435
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:41,760
Marisa Eisenberg: Use actual population census information and GIs data to decide where people live, and where they work there's a nice.

436
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:50,070
Marisa Eisenberg: package called Fred that a group of people at the University of Pittsburgh put together.

437
01:29:50,550 --> 01:30:04,110
Marisa Eisenberg: population data on where what the population density is across the US, you know sort of all all across the US and what commuting distances people typically have four different regions in the queue up in the US for.

438
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:14,850
Marisa Eisenberg: Work and school and things like that, and the age structure of the populations, all those kinds of things and they built a nice package called Fred that lets you implement.

439
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:26,730
Marisa Eisenberg: GIs driven agent based models, where you have a it'll automatically you say what location and it will automatically build you a population that has a base set of rules.

440
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:34,290
Marisa Eisenberg: about how they commute and how they move around and what they do and then you can add into that you know kind of the kinds of things that you want to build for your.

441
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:48,270
Marisa Eisenberg: particular question and so people do a lot of stuff like that so where they'll use GIs data to kind of drive how how their agents, you know sort of move and and live in in the environment.

442
01:30:49,470 --> 01:31:02,400
Marisa Eisenberg: So here's just like some pictures of different examples of some of these kinds of different things, all sorts of different stuff Okay, I wanted to questions about that and then we'll dive into the showing model, maybe with more details.

443
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:05,070
That make sense.

444
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:16,110
Marisa Eisenberg: So the take home is really just that, like you know, there are a lot of decisions that when you start to build an agent based model, and it can rapidly get quite.

445
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:21,210
Marisa Eisenberg: tricky to make all the there's a lot of different sessions, that you have to make about exactly how you're going to structure it.

446
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:28,650
Marisa Eisenberg: And those decisions can have implications for how your models going to behave you want to really kind of think through them and document them and all that kind of thing.

447
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:45,450
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, so I wanted to talk, we talked yesterday I think about the shelling model which is this kind of very simplified model of neighborhood segregation and and I wanted to kind of.

448
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:54,870
Marisa Eisenberg: To kind of talk a little bit about this model and sort of how the sort of parte framework and.

449
01:31:55,890 --> 01:32:08,310
Marisa Eisenberg: Some of the choices about environment and rules and stuff like that just kind of use a real world simple example to sort of illustrate how how that would play out so just as a reminder.

450
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:23,040
Marisa Eisenberg: The rules of this model is that there's two kinds of agents red and blue you place them randomly initially each agent wants some percentage of their neighbors to be the same type of them, and if they don't have that then they'll move to a new location.

451
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:30,660
Marisa Eisenberg: And like I said, let when we first introduced the shelling model, this is a extremely kind of.

452
01:32:31,470 --> 01:32:45,960
Marisa Eisenberg: simplified and and really kind of wrong model of like there are so many real world factors that actually contribute much more strongly to neighborhood segregation and I would not take this as a very sort of real world.

453
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:55,740
Marisa Eisenberg: model of neighborhood segregation at all, because you know, at least in the US, there are a lot of other factors that are at play, but.

454
01:32:56,280 --> 01:33:02,040
Marisa Eisenberg: But just as an interesting example of kind of a simple set of rules, the shelling model is kind of useful so.

455
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:14,070
Marisa Eisenberg: So, so the shelling model goes like this, so remember We saw this Oh, I think this gift has a weird thing yeah sorry it changes color in the middle, for some reason, and so i'll just stop it here.

456
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:22,410
Marisa Eisenberg: So, remember, we saw this last time that it you start with randomly placed agents and then.

457
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:38,970
Marisa Eisenberg: As they move around you get this emergence of neighborhood segregation that happens, because the initial randomness has some clubs of all one type or another and then.

458
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:52,830
Marisa Eisenberg: If there's a clump of red or a clump of flu a cluster here, then you know the other type of agent can't move into that area, because they need at least some percentage to be the same type of them and so.

459
01:33:53,490 --> 01:34:01,080
Marisa Eisenberg: it ends up leading to sort of neighborhood segregation um so it's an interesting model and.

460
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:08,610
Marisa Eisenberg: The I wanted to just sort of talk through sort of how would we if we were documenting this was sort of the parte.

461
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:17,400
Marisa Eisenberg: Framework What would we need to kind of document and how would we think about this, so the agents are obviously the.

462
01:34:17,970 --> 01:34:26,220
Marisa Eisenberg: Individual people who can be either red or blue, they will have properties so they're red or blue they'll have a fraction of neighbors who they want to be the same.

463
01:34:26,490 --> 01:34:34,320
Marisa Eisenberg: they'll have their current location and they'll have whether or not they're happy in their current location, so do they do, they plan to do they have.

464
01:34:34,830 --> 01:34:42,330
Marisa Eisenberg: The desired fraction of neighbors have the same type as that right, and so, so that would be sort of the properties of the individuals.

465
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:50,430
Marisa Eisenberg: Their actions are they can either move or stay the rules that they use are sort of how do they decide whether or not to move or stay.

466
01:34:50,670 --> 01:34:59,970
Marisa Eisenberg: And and we'd have a lot of questions there, so you know what percentage, do we want the agents to require in order to stay in their current location.

467
01:35:00,630 --> 01:35:12,330
Marisa Eisenberg: What order, do you want to evaluate the agent movements, you know so do they all this let's say I met time step one do I move all of my agents, at the same time.

468
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:24,180
Marisa Eisenberg: Or you know, and then, if I do, how do I decide which places are empty and which places are not or do I move them out a random order you know how do you how do you coordinate.

469
01:35:24,450 --> 01:35:33,600
Marisa Eisenberg: who's moving where, and you know sort of how so let's say you know, for instance let's suppose that this agent, and this agent both would like to move.

470
01:35:33,930 --> 01:35:42,510
Marisa Eisenberg: You know how do you decide who gets moved to which location and make sure that you don't have two people moving to the same spot or you know all of those kinds of questions right so.

471
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:48,570
Marisa Eisenberg: So there are a lot of questions just in the initial sort of setting up of the rules.

472
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:59,820
Marisa Eisenberg: That you have to decide about how you evaluate your agent movements and those aspects time in the showing model usually is in discrete steps, but you could do it as a continuous time model.

473
01:36:00,150 --> 01:36:10,740
Marisa Eisenberg: And the environment in the shelling model is a grid, but you know you'd have to make decisions about things like what size grid, do you want, what do you want to do with the boundaries so, for instance.

474
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:16,380
Marisa Eisenberg: To common choices with the boundaries of a grid model and an agent based model.

475
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:27,900
Marisa Eisenberg: Or to either sort of have the grid edges just be the end of the universe, and so people on the edge just don't have any neighbors on one side or to rock what they call wrapped edge boundaries and so.

476
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:36,060
Marisa Eisenberg: that's what they did here, you can see, you can see that, actually, if you look at the end this neighborhood.

477
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:51,660
Marisa Eisenberg: Their neighbors on the top side are these guys right, so this is actually the top edge of this little red neighborhood and similarly this little red neighborhood is actually the edge of that right, and so.

478
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:58,260
Marisa Eisenberg: there's a wrapped boundary thing happening here and so that's one of the choices that you can make about your environment.

479
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:04,980
Marisa Eisenberg: With the shelling model, you know, there are questions we mentioned before, what order, do you apply the rules in.

480
01:37:05,190 --> 01:37:15,810
Marisa Eisenberg: Where do you move people if they're unhappy So do you move them to a random location, do you move them to somewhere that they'll that has a higher percentage of their same type What do you do and.

481
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:26,370
Marisa Eisenberg: there's also even simple questions about how do you decide who's your neighbor So do you only count before immediately next to you or do you count the corners to right so.

482
01:37:27,210 --> 01:37:33,630
Marisa Eisenberg: This is often called a rook neighborhood, and this is a clean neighborhood there's also they also call these.

483
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:45,810
Marisa Eisenberg: More involved noi Minh neighborhoods I don't remember, which is which but anyway, these kinds of decisions are common things that you have to think about when you're building a new agent based model and okay.

484
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:51,930
Marisa Eisenberg: So right, so this is the What do you do about the borders, etc, so.

485
01:37:53,100 --> 01:38:05,100
Marisa Eisenberg: These kinds of decisions like this can actually affect your outcome, you know, one of the things that is tricky about agent based models is that because.

486
01:38:05,730 --> 01:38:18,300
Marisa Eisenberg: They have this they have this interesting emergent phenomenon thing, where you build simple rules you put them together and then you simulate it and you observe the interesting emergent behavior that comes out of it.

487
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:33,330
Marisa Eisenberg: And the problem with that is that assumptions that don't have anything to do with the question you're actually trying to answer can also cause emergent behavior that affects your outcome so maybe because you chose.

488
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:36,780
Marisa Eisenberg: A rap boundary versus a hard boundary.

489
01:38:37,230 --> 01:38:49,860
Marisa Eisenberg: That could actually affect your outcome right and you didn't really care about the rap boundary versus the you know hard boundary but whatever you happen to pick ended up affecting you know the outcome that you see so.

490
01:38:50,370 --> 01:38:58,620
Marisa Eisenberg: You have to really be very careful when you're thinking about how you set up your agent based models and it's important to do a lot of sensitivity analysis, by which I mean.

491
01:38:58,830 --> 01:39:07,860
Marisa Eisenberg: Trying it both ways are a couple of different possibilities, so that you can as you're building the models that you can determine whether you know, make sure that the.

492
01:39:08,190 --> 01:39:22,020
Marisa Eisenberg: behavior you're seeing is robust to different decisions that you might make about your assumptions and Okay, so that is my little spiel about cautionary tales for building agent based models.

493
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:36,600
Marisa Eisenberg: I was going to have us do the first exercise of the lab which I guess actually it's time for the break so that's actually perfect timing so we'll pause here, and then we can take a break, are there questions about any of the stuff we talked about so far.

494
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:50,190
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, so let's pause for 15 minutes and then we'll come back and we'll do a few if while you're on your break you want to get started we're going to I think next do the.

495
01:39:50,730 --> 01:40:02,820
Marisa Eisenberg: The first part, the shelling model part of the of the lab and so so yeah so it was possible come back at 315 and we'll go from there cool.

496
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:05,010
Marisa Eisenberg: Thanks.

497
01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:09,570
Marisa Eisenberg: Alright, so let's see.

498
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:23,400
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, yes, so welcome back so I wanted us to do a little bit of the lab, but I think actually rather than coding it totally from scratch i'm.

499
01:40:24,210 --> 01:40:45,810
Marisa Eisenberg: The the what you call it the the emoji simulator actually has a version of the showing model already pre built so i'll just put that into the chat here, and so I think, so let me just open the lab if you go to the page for today and you.

500
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:55,410
Marisa Eisenberg: So if you click the agent based modeling and networks day and you click this lab for you'll see.

501
01:40:56,520 --> 01:41:06,990
Marisa Eisenberg: This the lab and and the first problem on it is basically a sort of shelling model kind of thing it has you building the shelling model from scratch yourself.

502
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:16,770
Marisa Eisenberg: But rather than doing that I think let's try running let's just use the existing build of the shelling model that is already built in.

503
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:27,900
Marisa Eisenberg: And so let's take we're going to do a sequence of things so maybe first let's take five minutes and everybody tried playing around with so take the showing models that's there.

504
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:40,380
Marisa Eisenberg: and try altering the number of neighbors that they require to be like themselves, you know try changing it from one to eight, so you know they this shelling model.

505
01:41:40,830 --> 01:41:52,590
Marisa Eisenberg: considers all the eight spots around the individual to be their neighboring spots and so try changing this from one to eight and kind of see how it affects the way.

506
01:41:53,430 --> 01:41:56,550
Marisa Eisenberg: The dynamics perhaps we'll do that for like I don't know.

507
01:41:57,060 --> 01:42:10,140
Marisa Eisenberg: Two or three minutes four or five whatever something some small number of minutes and then let's talk about that and then we'll do the next part of the lab you know we'll just kind of step through it do a little analysis of the shelling model and then we'll go from there, so.

508
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:17,580
Marisa Eisenberg: If you want to build your own version of the showing model feel free but yeah we can just use this one, for now, was there a question.

509
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:35,130
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay i'm just hearing things okay good so um take two minutes and play around with a number of neighbors and then run the model for each of those different numbers of neighbors and then let's see what we get and then we'll talk about so i'll pause it.

510
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:44,820
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, so did everybody get a chance to try different numbers of different levels of preference sort of different numbers of neighbors required to be the same.

511
01:45:46,830 --> 01:45:53,070
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah Okay, so what What did you notice did does the behavior change as you shift the number of neighbors required to be the same.

512
01:46:04,590 --> 01:46:10,620
Marisa Eisenberg: They only need one of their neighbors to be the same does that act differently than if they need four or if they need seven.

513
01:46:11,730 --> 01:46:25,680
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah yeah it's very different right so um did other regions of that parameter that tend to lead to more or less sort of segregation of the of the neighborhoods in the in the model.

514
01:46:35,190 --> 01:46:52,950
Marisa Eisenberg: Yes, yeah yeah yeah exactly so um yeah so there's sort of two versions, where you tend to get more yeah less segregation that's exactly so here, let me share my screen and we can let's just play with this for a second, so what you might have noticed is that if you oh good.

515
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:54,390
See.

516
01:46:56,250 --> 01:47:07,920
Marisa Eisenberg: Exactly either a diverse stay state or constant migration yeah perfect that's great yeah So if you set the number of neighbors that they need to be the same to be small you tend to get pretty.

517
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:17,070
Marisa Eisenberg: You know if they only require one of their neighbors to be similar to them, then you know it doesn't change very much from the initial random configuration basically all the.

518
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:35,580
Marisa Eisenberg: In this case, mice and hamsters are happy to be wherever and so you know there's a little bit of resettling but it mostly sort of stays the same, and if you make it to right and then now when you start it, you can start to see a little bit of clumping but it's still pretty.

519
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:37,530
Marisa Eisenberg: You know kind of.

520
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:51,660
Marisa Eisenberg: Non segregated there's a lot of hamsters in mice that live near one another, if you move it to three that's where you really start to see a shift so once they require three of their neighbors.

521
01:47:52,560 --> 01:48:07,290
Marisa Eisenberg: To be similar type of the same type as them then now you start to see these blocks forming of all mice are all hamsters and then, once you set it to four, then you get you know pretty strong obvious.

522
01:48:08,310 --> 01:48:15,720
Marisa Eisenberg: clumps forming of mice or hamsters the other direction that apostles was noting there.

523
01:48:16,290 --> 01:48:29,280
Marisa Eisenberg: Is that is you get your constant migration, so if you move this up, so you know at five you know they can kind of still mostly sort of find a space once you start to get up to like six you get.

524
01:48:29,730 --> 01:48:35,430
Marisa Eisenberg: If they need six neighbors to be the same, the thing is just too dense with this population density.

525
01:48:36,090 --> 01:48:40,290
Marisa Eisenberg: And so you know it ends up that they can't really you get these kind of like.

526
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:48,810
Marisa Eisenberg: Shifting globs of mice and hamsters they can't really quite ever exactly settled there's sort of a couple of.

527
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:57,750
Marisa Eisenberg: blogs that sort of, say, mostly the same, but the edges really kind of wander around a lot and they they tend to sort of shift over time and, once you set this up to really high levels.

528
01:48:58,020 --> 01:49:15,300
Marisa Eisenberg: of you know, they want seven of eight neighbors to be mouse or hamster then no one is ever happy and they're always just constantly moving right, and so you start to get things like this now the I don't know if any of you played around with the population density at all.

529
01:49:16,650 --> 01:49:29,160
Marisa Eisenberg: You know if we bring this back down to something like six of my neighbors need to be the same, then, if you make the population density less wow that's getting a little too wild sorry everybody some intense.

530
01:49:29,670 --> 01:49:36,180
Marisa Eisenberg: You make the population density less they ought to eventually, oh no other way other way around, it has to be big enough they ought to eventually be able to kind of.

531
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:45,420
Marisa Eisenberg: find some well there's a some of it there's some of this that they can eventually select five you can play around with this and get different kinds of behavior.

532
01:49:45,630 --> 01:49:53,700
Marisa Eisenberg: If you tweak the number of neighbors required to be the same, and you fiddle with the population density, so if you, you can kind of fiddle with this and sometimes you can find.

533
01:49:53,910 --> 01:49:58,260
Marisa Eisenberg: sweet spots where they can eventually kind of settle in something that they're reasonably happy with.

534
01:49:59,190 --> 01:50:05,250
Marisa Eisenberg: Other times, not so much let's see what happens if we do this if you said it really empty, and they need five of their neighbors then.

535
01:50:05,490 --> 01:50:12,150
Marisa Eisenberg: They never eventually they will start to clump up a bit, but you know they have to randomly jump all to have.

536
01:50:12,510 --> 01:50:23,130
Marisa Eisenberg: You know all of their neighbors be the same, and you know that's quite difficult, and so you can, if you play around with the population density, you can get some interesting different patterns that form Okay, but this is a very frenetic.

537
01:50:24,870 --> 01:50:40,740
Marisa Eisenberg: simulation so i'm going to pause it there, but so you can get some interesting dynamics there's sort of this range in the middle of if they if they have a certain range of neighbors that if they want that many to be the same as them you tend to see.

538
01:50:42,450 --> 01:50:45,300
Marisa Eisenberg: You know neighborhood segregation form.

539
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:47,550
Marisa Eisenberg: And then there's sort of.

540
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:49,500
Marisa Eisenberg: Two sort of.

541
01:50:51,210 --> 01:50:55,170
Marisa Eisenberg: behaviors at the extremes where either there's a very diverse.

542
01:50:55,860 --> 01:51:04,650
Marisa Eisenberg: Non you know more integrated non segregated steady state when you have when they don't really care that much about what whether their neighbors are the same or not.

543
01:51:05,310 --> 01:51:11,040
Marisa Eisenberg: Or if they if they strongly want their neighbors to be the same they're never satisfied, and so, then they just constantly move.

544
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:17,640
Marisa Eisenberg: The there's an interesting thing I don't want to I don't really want to do the whole lab because I think it's kind of.

545
01:51:17,970 --> 01:51:29,520
Marisa Eisenberg: long and I don't know that we need to kind of really dive through all of this, but I did want to point out one interesting thing about how we specify our rules, so, and when we described the.

546
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:37,980
Marisa Eisenberg: The the the showing model, you know we kind of said it in in words where we said that you know.

547
01:51:38,730 --> 01:51:51,000
Marisa Eisenberg: Each agent is happy if a certain percentage of their neighbors are the same type of them, and if that is true, then they'll stay in their current location, if that if it's false i'll move to a new location, you could envision.

548
01:51:51,900 --> 01:52:07,140
Marisa Eisenberg: a slightly different rule where maybe each type of animal wants instead of wanting at least X number of neighbors to be the same type of them, they want no more than why number of neighbors to be the opposite.

549
01:52:07,860 --> 01:52:14,370
Marisa Eisenberg: And if you implement that rule you get some interesting different dynamics so.

550
01:52:15,510 --> 01:52:38,460
Marisa Eisenberg: The original shelling simulator that we loaded from Nikki case hang on here okay so had the rule was if less than four neighbors are the same time, then move, and you know move to a new location and if we change that rule I rather than.

551
01:52:39,690 --> 01:52:45,540
Marisa Eisenberg: Everybody sort of doing this yourselves i'll just show what happens if you change that rule to.

552
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:55,680
Marisa Eisenberg: What if if more than so if i'm a mouse if more than four of my name, so the original one was is less than four of my neighbors are my same type, then I moved.

553
01:52:56,190 --> 01:53:06,810
Marisa Eisenberg: let's change it to if more than four of my neighbors are the opposite type, then I moved right, and so, if more than four of my neighbors are a hamster or a mouse then move to a new location.

554
01:53:07,140 --> 01:53:20,760
Marisa Eisenberg: And if you switch it to be that it's interesting actually so this book, you know this rule if they want the same type gives you this very clear segregation pattern.

555
01:53:22,050 --> 01:53:26,610
Marisa Eisenberg: If you have it be that they want no more than.

556
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:32,460
Marisa Eisenberg: Four of the opposite type it's interesting you get this right.

557
01:53:33,810 --> 01:53:36,660
Marisa Eisenberg: I don't know what do people think of this does this look the same.

558
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:39,510
Marisa Eisenberg: What seems to be different.

559
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:47,340
Marisa Eisenberg: it's a it's a similar rule it's the kind of thing that you could imagine someone hearing a verbal description yeah empty spaces.

560
01:53:47,610 --> 01:53:59,940
Marisa Eisenberg: You could you could hear a verbal description and you might implement the shelling model either this way or this way, but they actually end up playing out quite differently so yeah Victoria, do you want to say more that's that's exactly it.

561
01:54:01,860 --> 01:54:12,210
M. Victoria Salgado: No, nobody goes in one model, you want people like you around in the order what you want is you don't wanna run around people that is different to you, but you don't get if you're alone.

562
01:54:12,750 --> 01:54:15,420
Marisa Eisenberg: For exactly exactly exactly so.

563
01:54:15,630 --> 01:54:19,800
Marisa Eisenberg: In this model empty spaces are perfectly acceptable you just don't want.

564
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:31,680
Marisa Eisenberg: Too many of the other type and so it's interesting as a result, because empty spaces are acceptable, they don't move as much because many of them start off near empty spaces, they still do clump up but.

565
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:39,600
Marisa Eisenberg: They don't build these big tight clusters like you see here where they're very sort of clumped.

566
01:54:40,260 --> 01:54:49,890
Marisa Eisenberg: Because they don't mind the empty space and so it's still the case that you get segregation and you know there's sort of clustering of Meissen and hester's.

567
01:54:50,130 --> 01:54:58,860
Marisa Eisenberg: But it plays out very differently, because of the empty spaces so just wanted to kind of point that out as a little thing to kind of get us thinking about how.

568
01:54:59,970 --> 01:55:08,190
Marisa Eisenberg: How the details of how exactly you interpret a verbal description of the rules can affect what the dynamics, you see, are.

569
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:14,550
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay cool alright so Questions about any of that stuff.

570
01:55:18,330 --> 01:55:27,270
Marisa Eisenberg: we're gonna make sense and I that that's sort of the wrap up, I think, for this kind of intro to agent based models and.

571
01:55:27,930 --> 01:55:35,160
Marisa Eisenberg: i've got some stuff here that's kind of a summing up of some of the issues with agent based models, you know that we've been talking about over the course of this session.

572
01:55:35,490 --> 01:55:50,940
Marisa Eisenberg: One thing that I do want to kind of note here when we did this intro to agent, because we really haven't done a lot of real detailed coding we've been using this emoji simulator or some of these logo examples that are already pre built and one thing that is is is sort of.

573
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:59,580
Marisa Eisenberg: a note of caution about agent based models when you're really building them from scratch in something like our or Python and.

574
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:04,890
Marisa Eisenberg: Most real world sort of real estate agent based models that are used for research.

575
01:56:05,490 --> 01:56:18,630
Marisa Eisenberg: Are are a big task and so you're going to definitely have bugs as you work on it and you need to be thinking about as you start to build your model, how are you going to verify that your code and your model.

576
01:56:19,260 --> 01:56:27,600
Marisa Eisenberg: are doing are correct and are doing what you think they're going to do so unit testing and kind of breaking your model down into small modules.

577
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:35,760
Marisa Eisenberg: That you can test and work through and make sure that they are doing things correctly is really important, particularly with agent based models because.

578
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:47,370
Marisa Eisenberg: They don't have a sort of standard framework like Markov models or differential equations or things like this that kind of have a lot of pre built packages like D solve and all of this kind of stuff that let you kind of.

579
01:56:48,210 --> 01:57:03,180
Marisa Eisenberg: rely on existing sort of standardized thing so you're often building a lot of stuff yourself, and so you need to be very careful that way, so I skipped through a lot of this we've we've really sort of talked about it already in this session.

580
01:57:05,250 --> 01:57:15,180
Marisa Eisenberg: And i'll wrap up that you know agent based models it's particularly important to be doing parameter sampling and sensitivity analysis, because.

581
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:34,050
Marisa Eisenberg: There is so there's so much range of possible dynamics that you can see in the model that it's important to explore the parameter space and sort of see what different kinds of behaviors you can encounter so i'll sort of wrap up there with this slide deck.

582
01:57:35,700 --> 01:57:48,060
Marisa Eisenberg: And then let's transition over let's talk a little bit about a particular like more specific kind of agent based model really but that's called network models and then we'll talk a little bit about.

583
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:54,450
Marisa Eisenberg: The how to deal with sort of the high dimensionality of a lot of these kinds of models and sort of how we think about that.

584
01:57:56,820 --> 01:58:00,300
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah let's see here, I wonder if we should.

585
01:58:01,980 --> 01:58:12,090
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay we'll do that so yeah we'll stick to the order okay so Questions about that sort of intro agent based model stuff before we do networks.

586
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:15,030
Okay.

587
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:32,730
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, so um so let's talk a little bit about network models So these are really kind of one flavor of agent based models really um but there's a lot of specific theory and you know sort of.

588
01:58:33,870 --> 01:58:38,130
Marisa Eisenberg: Like understanding that has been built for network specifically.

589
01:58:38,700 --> 01:58:52,650
Marisa Eisenberg: That we can use in this in this type of agent based models that's that's very helpful and networks can also be used with all different kinds of bottles to you can build networks of differential equations or stochastic models are authentic so.

590
01:58:53,490 --> 01:59:01,590
Marisa Eisenberg: networks are super flexible, there are lots of different kinds of relationships from very concrete to very abstract that you can represent it as a network.

591
01:59:02,610 --> 01:59:15,090
Marisa Eisenberg: networks are have a long history in math and computer science in the form of graph theory and so there's a lot of methods and approaches that have already been developed for thinking about networks and so that's really convenient for us.

592
01:59:15,930 --> 01:59:20,370
Marisa Eisenberg: there's a lot of different models, a lot of models that you might think of can.

593
01:59:20,730 --> 01:59:26,730
Marisa Eisenberg: be written out or thought of as a network and this perspective can often help you kind of understand the model so.

594
01:59:26,970 --> 01:59:36,060
Marisa Eisenberg: there's a, for instance there's a huge theory just on networks of differential equations there's also lots of theory on networks from a sort of more agent based modeling kind of perspective.

595
01:59:36,300 --> 01:59:41,070
Marisa Eisenberg: there's lots of lots of good stuff when it comes to sort of the network's view of things and.

596
01:59:41,610 --> 01:59:54,150
Marisa Eisenberg: Examples include things like so you know links between Twitter followers or Facebook friends or web pages family trees friendship networks contact networks collaboration networks um.

597
01:59:54,450 --> 02:00:07,770
Marisa Eisenberg: I don't know how many of you have heard of the air dish number or the bacon number is that a thing any of you have ever heard of so so I see why not Okay, but so that erudition number is Paul air dish was this mathematician who was.

598
02:00:09,180 --> 02:00:20,490
Marisa Eisenberg: He was kind of a weird guy he he had an apartment or a house, but he never really stayed there, he would basically just like wander around and show up at your door and be like hey.

599
02:00:21,570 --> 02:00:30,690
Marisa Eisenberg: Can I stay with you let's write a paper and basically sort of wake up here and you'd collaborate with him, while he was there and then he'd wander off to the next place and so um.

600
02:00:33,210 --> 02:00:33,570
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah.

601
02:00:34,590 --> 02:00:43,380
Marisa Eisenberg: So so yeah so he was so prolific in his collaborations that people came up with something called the edge number, which is.

602
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:55,170
Marisa Eisenberg: Air dish himself had an average number of zero and then anyone who collaborated with color just had an outage number one and then, if you collaborated one of his collaborators, then you had a nurse number two etc.

603
02:00:55,470 --> 02:00:58,710
Marisa Eisenberg: And so, people have done this for a lot of different kinds of collaboration so.

604
02:00:59,340 --> 02:01:12,090
Marisa Eisenberg: There are bacon numbers, the so how how how many steps, how many movies away, are you from having been in us in a movie or a TV show with Kevin bacon all these different kinds of things like this and.

605
02:01:12,810 --> 02:01:15,960
Marisa Eisenberg: there's also, of course, food webs gene regulatory networks.

606
02:01:16,350 --> 02:01:24,600
Marisa Eisenberg: financial relationships just diplomatic relationships and then it in a more sort of abstract setting people use networks to understand causality so.

607
02:01:24,810 --> 02:01:31,500
Marisa Eisenberg: Probably many of you have worked with dads directed basically graphs and for thinking about causal in France.

608
02:01:32,070 --> 02:01:35,850
Marisa Eisenberg: or language or things like this there's a lot of different uses of networks.

609
02:01:36,210 --> 02:01:45,240
Marisa Eisenberg: That said, I think it's important to also say, sometimes people get a little carried away with the whole network thing just because you can think of a way to represent your model as a network.

610
02:01:45,510 --> 02:01:56,250
Marisa Eisenberg: doesn't actually make that a meaningful representation of the system, you want us to think about it, we know what can the network perspective sort of gain you and how it can be useful and OK, but so.

611
02:01:57,420 --> 02:02:09,510
Marisa Eisenberg: So so networks, allow us to examine how non homogeneous interaction structures of fact that I am so you know most compartmentalize models like differential equation models or.

612
02:02:10,020 --> 02:02:18,990
Marisa Eisenberg: compartment stochastic compartment and models assume that every individual is interacting sort of randomly with every other individual.

613
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:29,730
Marisa Eisenberg: And networks, allow us to see what happens if we don't make that assumption if we if we explore more realistic interaction patterns and so.

614
02:02:30,180 --> 02:02:39,450
Marisa Eisenberg: Lots of network models are aged based models, but they're also all other different kinds of models so when it comes to thinking about modeling with networks, I like to kind of.

615
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:44,040
Marisa Eisenberg: I borrowed this from say on this book and it's I think it's a nice framing so.

616
02:02:44,970 --> 02:02:50,940
Marisa Eisenberg: it's useful to think about are you thinking about a dynamic that happens on a network so maybe.

617
02:02:51,270 --> 02:03:00,330
Marisa Eisenberg: The process occurs over some sort of fixed network structure that static and you're looking at how that static network structure affects what happens with this process.

618
02:03:00,630 --> 02:03:10,110
Marisa Eisenberg: Or are you trying to model, the dynamics of the network itself so are you modeling how the network changes with time how friendships form and dissolve or whatever different things like this.

619
02:03:10,470 --> 02:03:15,570
Marisa Eisenberg: Or are you thinking about something that's an adaptive network, so this is where you're looking at.

620
02:03:17,010 --> 02:03:26,730
Marisa Eisenberg: Both the processes that are happening on the network and how the network changes and how those two things feedback to one another, so maybe processes happening that are happening on the network.

621
02:03:26,970 --> 02:03:32,790
Marisa Eisenberg: effects the structure of the network, which affects the processes that happen on the network, and so you have this sort of feedback loop.

622
02:03:33,060 --> 02:03:44,940
Marisa Eisenberg: Between the two, so I find this to be a kind of useful framing of thinking about network dynamics are you really thinking about dynamics on networks or dynamics of networks or both.

623
02:03:46,290 --> 02:03:50,730
Marisa Eisenberg: So when it comes to networks there's a bunch of like initial jargon.

624
02:03:51,780 --> 02:03:55,230
Marisa Eisenberg: That we just have to sort of work, our way through so there's there's.

625
02:03:55,230 --> 02:03:58,260
Marisa Eisenberg: Some some jargon that we're going to kind of cover here really quickly.

626
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:06,000
Marisa Eisenberg: So a network is often also called a graph and it's composed of nodes and edges, so a node is.

627
02:04:06,420 --> 02:04:15,420
Marisa Eisenberg: The circle of that in the network, you know, a vertex is often what it's called this can be a person or a Community or a location.

628
02:04:15,750 --> 02:04:25,530
Marisa Eisenberg: Whatever all kinds of different things, a gene, you know, etc, and an edge is a connection between two nodes, and so there are lots of different types of networks.

629
02:04:26,430 --> 02:04:37,410
Marisa Eisenberg: You can have directed graph or a directed network, and this is where your edges have a direction associated with them so for so, for instance, we often think of friendship networks as being.

630
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:54,450
Marisa Eisenberg: All two way but friendships actually can it's it's it's often you know not it's not uncommon when you're serving people about their friendships that one person will report someone else has a friend and that person won't actually report, the first person as a friend necessarily.

631
02:04:55,890 --> 02:05:03,990
Marisa Eisenberg: And so you can you can have these directed graph this is this picture is kind of an interesting directed graph example.

632
02:05:05,070 --> 02:05:25,740
Marisa Eisenberg: it's very hard to see the arrows on this line, maybe they've admitted them here, but this was a paper by Mark Newman and I forget ball, who was the first name of ball is but anyway, and they did an interesting paper on social status in high schools and they found that you can recover.

633
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:32,040
Marisa Eisenberg: So if you ask high school students to describe the social status of.

634
02:05:33,210 --> 02:05:38,670
Marisa Eisenberg: You know if you if you if you explore the social status of individuals within a high school Group and

635
02:05:39,030 --> 02:05:53,070
Marisa Eisenberg: And then, and you ask students about who their friends are you can recover the status ranking from who they report as their friends so high school students will in this study will tend to report.

636
02:05:53,640 --> 02:06:03,000
Marisa Eisenberg: Higher ranking people as their friends and so you get this directed graph where people who are lower status, whatever that means really but.

637
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:10,050
Marisa Eisenberg: You know, will tend to report, people who are higher up, and so you can get this kind of interesting sort of social hierarchy out of.

638
02:06:10,530 --> 02:06:15,600
Marisa Eisenberg: High School damn X, which only makes me very glad that that part of my life is over but anyway.

639
02:06:16,050 --> 02:06:27,510
Marisa Eisenberg: So you know, so I thought that was kind of an interesting a network directed graphing the other classic of course example of a directed graph is just disease transmission, you know if.

640
02:06:27,900 --> 02:06:36,540
Marisa Eisenberg: I transmitted disease to someone, you know that they don't transmit it back to me necessarily so, you know there's disease transmission is often the directed network.

641
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:47,850
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, you can also have waited networks so you're you, you can have a way to graph where you assign a number to an edge or a node.

642
02:06:48,450 --> 02:06:55,110
Marisa Eisenberg: This is pretty common for a lot of models, maybe the parameter value or an association strength those kinds of things are often.

643
02:06:55,440 --> 02:07:08,430
Marisa Eisenberg: The weight that gets assigned you can also think of the weight as a type or a state, instead of a number like si and are or a cancer stage or something like that this is a very common thing to see in systems models for networks.

644
02:07:09,450 --> 02:07:20,970
Marisa Eisenberg: You can have connected talk about whether graphs are connected or disconnected and lots of things like this loops etc and i'm one thing to note.

645
02:07:21,540 --> 02:07:35,850
Marisa Eisenberg: The neighborhood of a node is all the nodes who are connected to it so that's just a piece of jargon that I think is useful to have so if I say the neighborhood of node for that means nodes three six and five because those are all the nodes that it's connected to.

646
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:37,560
Marisa Eisenberg: oak.

647
02:07:39,660 --> 02:07:47,970
Marisa Eisenberg: trees and for us, so a tree is just a connected graph so everybody is connected to everybody else, but it has no cycles so there's no.

648
02:07:48,690 --> 02:07:59,580
Marisa Eisenberg: closed loop path in the in the in the graph so a tree would be something like this, a forest is a set of multiple so it's not connected, but it still has no cycles.

649
02:07:59,970 --> 02:08:10,290
Marisa Eisenberg: And as a little example of something that is you know, a couple of examples of trees so evolutionary trees are networks that are obviously trees.

650
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:24,150
Marisa Eisenberg: This is a different one that is almost a tree, except for one loop, this is from a little project that I did a long time ago, but does anyone remember there was that has anyone ever seen this there's this idea that.

651
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:39,810
Marisa Eisenberg: If you start on a random Wikipedia page and click the first link eventually you'll reach philosophy Is this something other people have seen, and this was a thing for a little while here, let me just let me share back to this here.

652
02:08:43,980 --> 02:08:44,070
yeah.

653
02:08:45,270 --> 02:09:01,050
Marisa Eisenberg: So if you go, the idea is, if you go to a random Wikipedia page any we could put something in but you see where is there's I know there's a lot, you can go to a random page somewhere on here it is random article, so you go to a random Wikipedia page speaker.

654
02:09:02,340 --> 02:09:08,400
Marisa Eisenberg: And the idea is that if you click the first link that's not in italics or parentheses or sort of.

655
02:09:08,730 --> 02:09:15,420
Marisa Eisenberg: weird in any other way, like a location or something just the first plane regular link, so in that case, it would be Washington DC here.

656
02:09:15,720 --> 02:09:30,420
Marisa Eisenberg: And you just keep doing that then eventually you'll reach the page for philosophy, so we ignore this because it's all it's Alex, and so the first link here is capital city so then we go here municipality administrative division.

657
02:09:31,410 --> 02:09:43,380
Marisa Eisenberg: sovereign state political entity that's in bold collective identity longing emotional mental states mind.

658
02:09:44,550 --> 02:09:59,520
Marisa Eisenberg: Normal non wow eventually area philosophy okay so um So the idea is that if you take a random Wikipedia page and keep clicking the first plane link that's not bold or italics or anything else.

659
02:09:59,790 --> 02:10:09,330
Marisa Eisenberg: Eventually you'll reach the page for philosophy, and so I was curious to study this and so wrote a script that would scrape Wikipedia, and this is just a little graph.

660
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:13,800
Marisa Eisenberg: That that does it and you can see, you get something like a tree that.

661
02:10:14,130 --> 02:10:20,100
Marisa Eisenberg: From a bunch of different random pages eventually you reach philosophy which is in here, it turns out that philosophy.

662
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:26,340
Marisa Eisenberg: it's not exactly a tree because philosophy points to something too, and so you get a little tiny loop.

663
02:10:26,640 --> 02:10:39,990
Marisa Eisenberg: Of like philosophy science and existence or something like that I don't remember what it is, but you know there's some little little bitty loop there but um but it's almost a tree, and so I thought that was kind of a fun example of a tree and okay so.

664
02:10:40,470 --> 02:10:51,450
Marisa Eisenberg: So that's some some some other kind of jargon one other thing to talk about is what's called the adjacent see matrix, so this is a very common way of representing a network.

665
02:10:52,830 --> 02:11:05,160
Marisa Eisenberg: So you can represent your network as a matrix where an equivalent to drawing a picture of your network, you can reconstruct the network from the matrix and vice versa, and basically what you do is you just.

666
02:11:05,610 --> 02:11:18,240
Marisa Eisenberg: Put a zero or one, and if this is node 123456 and 123456 playing this way you put a zero or one if there's a connection there or not right and so that just captures the.

667
02:11:18,450 --> 02:11:35,550
Marisa Eisenberg: pattern of connectivity between your nodes in your network, and you can do the same with a directed network or a weighted network, where you just you know you just you just put in the weights, instead of a one or a zero and that kind of thing it turns out that.

668
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:38,010
Nicolle Krebs: A Jason seem agencies.

669
02:11:38,250 --> 02:11:48,330
Marisa Eisenberg: are really useful for a lot of different network properties and they end up being often a really convenient way to represent your graph, and so I just wanted to sort of.

670
02:11:48,930 --> 02:11:54,930
Marisa Eisenberg: mention them along our way so that we could all kind of be a little bit familiar okay so.

671
02:11:55,560 --> 02:12:13,680
Marisa Eisenberg: I want us to do one quick piece of lab three a together or well we'll take a minute and then we'll kind of talk about it's good just to get to get everybody a little bit familiar with the sort of networks things, so let me switch what i'm sharing again poo poo okay.

672
02:12:15,090 --> 02:12:15,810
Marisa Eisenberg: um.

673
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:24,030
Marisa Eisenberg: There it is so um so we're going to skip over this part and go down to three a.

674
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:35,490
Marisa Eisenberg: Where is three, and I mean it's not three part three, here we go gene expression network and cancer so we're going to use the I graph package, which is a.

675
02:12:36,390 --> 02:12:44,310
Marisa Eisenberg: Networks package that is for our So if you haven't if you don't have I graph installed in your.

676
02:12:45,120 --> 02:12:54,420
Marisa Eisenberg: version of our you'll need to install it so you'll go to the packages tab and click install and then type I graph and and you'll be able to install it there.

677
02:12:54,720 --> 02:13:03,240
Marisa Eisenberg: And so what we're going to do we're going to use the Ai graph package and we're going to look at a network of gene regulatory.

678
02:13:03,900 --> 02:13:15,720
Marisa Eisenberg: A gene expression regulatory network from cervical cancer cells cancer cells that's shown here it's from this 2007 SIS dmc systems biology paper.

679
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:35,910
Marisa Eisenberg: And if you go to the website there's a data set here called healing network connected dot csv and you can download this data set and make this bigger to see you all can see, so this healing network connected that csv you can download that guy.

680
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:37,590
Marisa Eisenberg: And then.

681
02:13:38,670 --> 02:13:45,750
Marisa Eisenberg: The code for sort of all this stuff is here, so you can load it into your your your.

682
02:13:46,740 --> 02:13:54,630
Marisa Eisenberg: workspace with this command, which is the one that we talked about earlier when we were talking about how to load data and all that kind of thing so.

683
02:13:54,960 --> 02:14:05,880
Marisa Eisenberg: Read see it read dot csv of this thing, and it will it will contain the adjacent see matrix for the main component I dropped these little teeny guys I just.

684
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:17,610
Marisa Eisenberg: lazy didn't bother with it, but just this big main component of the network, and so what I want you to do is just load the network and then install the graph package, if you haven't already and then.

685
02:14:18,030 --> 02:14:27,120
Marisa Eisenberg: there's you're going to make a network from the adjacent see matrix i'm just you can just borrow the copy these commands in and plot it.

686
02:14:27,390 --> 02:14:39,570
Marisa Eisenberg: And then I want you to just play around with the plot for like five minutes so we'll take five minutes there's some some code to make the network look a little bit nicer here um and then there's a bunch of kind of.

687
02:14:40,620 --> 02:14:46,020
Marisa Eisenberg: options that you can set So these are just all different options within that plot command.

688
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:58,110
Marisa Eisenberg: That you can try and so I want you to just like spend five minutes playing around with a real network loaded into your system and then and play with it so.

689
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:00,630
Marisa Eisenberg: Let me actually.

690
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:12,060
Marisa Eisenberg: Why don't we start it sort of together, just to make sure everyone gets the thing so did it was everyone able to download the csv file hopefully did that work okay.

691
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:30,180
Marisa Eisenberg: sounds like yes, so if you're if you're if you've downloaded the csv let me switch to our and maybe we'll just kind of do the first minute or two of it together and then you can play around with plot separately me make the font size bigger.

692
02:15:32,310 --> 02:15:39,360
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, there we go Okay, so what you're going to want to do is, you should have somewhere your.

693
02:15:41,100 --> 02:15:43,950
Marisa Eisenberg: This is the wrong place your.

694
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:58,800
Marisa Eisenberg: Music samples there we go the the file that you downloaded he learned network connected that csv so wherever you downloaded that healing network connected CSC make sure that you set that as you're working directory so that.

695
02:15:59,370 --> 02:16:06,480
Marisa Eisenberg: You know the the system will know that that's where your should be looking for things and then you can load up.

696
02:16:07,500 --> 02:16:08,220
Marisa Eisenberg: The.

697
02:16:09,690 --> 02:16:12,720
Marisa Eisenberg: thing let's just copy the senior so everybody can.

698
02:16:14,580 --> 02:16:26,310
Marisa Eisenberg: Keep that so set your working directory load your network data if you click this you'll see you get a big old matrix So this is the adjacent see matrix of all of the.

699
02:16:27,690 --> 02:16:39,870
Marisa Eisenberg: The different genes in that gene regulatory network, and so we have this big matrix and then, if you load the I graph package, I should have done that, at the beginning, actually.

700
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:43,470
Put that here.

701
02:16:44,940 --> 02:16:56,400
Marisa Eisenberg: So I load the I graph package, then now what you can do if you copy the first two lines from the code there you can make a.

702
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:09,300
Marisa Eisenberg: Network So here we go here's the healer network, you can see that it's got a we made that this little graph from Jason see matrix commanded that if we do plot oh right my sad.

703
02:17:10,980 --> 02:17:11,490
desktop.

704
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:16,110
Marisa Eisenberg: If we do plot, you can see that we get a kind of sad looking.

705
02:17:16,890 --> 02:17:24,570
Marisa Eisenberg: Network diagram so in the code that I gave you hopefully you all can get this This at least to run so take five minutes and just.

706
02:17:24,750 --> 02:17:39,120
Marisa Eisenberg: try and make this a little bit nicer play around with how you would plot a network and sort of try out different layouts and things like that, and just use a couple of minutes and let's just try that for a second so i'll pause on mute myself and you all can try it.

707
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:06,090
Nicolle Krebs: i'm sorry, what is the website that we're using.

708
02:20:07,260 --> 02:20:09,720
Marisa Eisenberg: Oh um Oh, the canvas site.

709
02:20:10,710 --> 02:20:13,320
Nicolle Krebs: Know to get the data.

710
02:20:14,070 --> 02:20:16,440
Marisa Eisenberg: Oh it's look it's linked on the canvas site.

711
02:20:17,220 --> 02:20:27,600
Marisa Eisenberg: And it should be under lab materials, there should be so in the agent based modeling page under lab materials, there should be a link CSP yeah.

712
02:22:58,620 --> 02:23:08,760
Marisa Eisenberg: everybody gets a plot to run at least able to load the network okay cool did you find any layouts that you particularly like i'm.

713
02:23:11,790 --> 02:23:12,390
Rishi Chanderraj: Not yeah.

714
02:23:13,050 --> 02:23:21,570
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah it turns out that graph layout is like a really hard like problem like it's it's actually a computationally difficult problem so yeah.

715
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:35,490
Marisa Eisenberg: I also you know I don't know I haven't there's there's different, you can see, the different layouts kind of play up different features of the network, which is kind of an interesting thing but but yeah okay good, well, at least if everybody was able to load the.

716
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:37,710
Marisa Eisenberg: Network and get it to plot that's great.

717
02:23:39,090 --> 02:23:43,230
Marisa Eisenberg: So we'll we'll do more with that never can just a minute, but let's so let's.

718
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:54,570
Marisa Eisenberg: let's keep going so um the the the thing I want to talk about next is sort of how what metrics like, how do we analyze networks and what can we use to kind of look at.

719
02:23:54,870 --> 02:24:06,270
Marisa Eisenberg: The structure of networks and understand how they're working and what's what they're doing so, there are a ton of different network metrics that have been developed of a range of different levels of complexity.

720
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:17,850
Marisa Eisenberg: that are used to characterize networks, both at the sort of individual level so at the level of individual nodes and edges and at the macro sort of overall network level and so.

721
02:24:18,360 --> 02:24:24,450
Marisa Eisenberg: Some of the classic ones simplest ones are things like just the size, so how many nodes and edges, are in a network.

722
02:24:25,830 --> 02:24:41,700
Marisa Eisenberg: Network density is one that gets talked about a lot, so this is the brac how many edges does this network have compared to the total number of possible edges, that this that it could have so if you have n nodes.

723
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:53,850
Marisa Eisenberg: Then you the total possible number of edges that you could have is n times N minus one, because every node could be connected to every other and minus one.

724
02:24:54,570 --> 02:25:05,550
Marisa Eisenberg: nodes that are that are out there and so over to sorry n times N minus one or two so so the total number of possible nodes is edges, is that.

725
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:15,870
Marisa Eisenberg: How many edges, do we actually have, and so, essentially, if you take our actual edges divided by the total possible edges that you could happen this network, you get the density of the network.

726
02:25:16,890 --> 02:25:24,150
Marisa Eisenberg: Another common metric that people use his degree, so the degree of a node is how many edges are attached to it.

727
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:36,870
Marisa Eisenberg: For directed graph you can have in degrees, so how many edges are coming in, and you can have out degree for like social support and friendship networks it's very common to have.

728
02:25:37,980 --> 02:25:49,800
Marisa Eisenberg: You know, you often care about in in degree for social support, so how many people would list you as someone that they view as an important or as a friend is often a better predictor of.

729
02:25:50,460 --> 02:25:57,180
Marisa Eisenberg: A range of mental health issues than out degree, so if I list a number of people as friends, but they don't listen to me back.

730
02:25:57,540 --> 02:26:11,070
Marisa Eisenberg: That might mean that I actually get less social support from them, then, if they if, then you know so counting how many people are have incoming links to me versus how many links, I have going out can mean different things.

731
02:26:12,180 --> 02:26:14,010
Marisa Eisenberg: And so degree, is a common thing to look at.

732
02:26:15,030 --> 02:26:21,390
Marisa Eisenberg: One of the one of the biggest kinds of things that oftentimes people look at when they're looking at.

733
02:26:21,960 --> 02:26:31,950
Marisa Eisenberg: nodes in the network is centrality of the nodes so you often want to know how central or important is a particular node which nodes within the network are sort of more critical.

734
02:26:32,190 --> 02:26:39,780
Marisa Eisenberg: For the network functioning or more important to the network in some way and so there's a lot of different ways that people measure centrality.

735
02:26:40,500 --> 02:26:50,790
Marisa Eisenberg: One of the ways that people measure centrality of a node is just to just to take the degree of that node so nodes that have higher degrees or higher in degree or out degree.

736
02:26:51,750 --> 02:27:01,470
Marisa Eisenberg: are more central is a common thing to do, but there's different measures as well, so closeness sensuality and is is gets at the idea that.

737
02:27:02,940 --> 02:27:09,720
Marisa Eisenberg: Perhaps important nodes are ones that have short path links to every other node in the network so.

738
02:27:10,590 --> 02:27:19,410
Marisa Eisenberg: Close to centrality basically takes if i'm a note in a network what's the shortest path for me to each other nodes in the network.

739
02:27:19,650 --> 02:27:26,760
Marisa Eisenberg: And so, if I have an average shortest path links to all the other nodes that's that's short that's small.

740
02:27:27,030 --> 02:27:39,180
Marisa Eisenberg: Then I must be tightly connected to every other node in the network and therefore i'm a very central node right, whereas if I have long path lengths for me to other nodes in the network, then.

741
02:27:40,470 --> 02:27:45,360
Marisa Eisenberg: i'm more distant from other nodes in the network and so i'm less central is sort of the idea.

742
02:27:45,870 --> 02:27:57,150
Marisa Eisenberg: So closeness and property is a common metric that people use between this mentality is also kind of interesting one, so this one is is kind of capturing the idea that.

743
02:27:58,140 --> 02:28:05,160
Marisa Eisenberg: Even if a node isn't necessarily close directly, you know close it path length to other nodes.

744
02:28:06,090 --> 02:28:20,700
Marisa Eisenberg: If it serves as a bridge between two large groups of nodes then it might be an important node and the network so between the centrality measures what fraction of the time, does the shortest path this path length.

745
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:24,570
Marisa Eisenberg: But so if i'm a note in the network and here's to other nodes.

746
02:28:24,990 --> 02:28:33,120
Marisa Eisenberg: let's take I said, take the shortest path from this note to this to this node what fraction of the time, does the shortest path between two other nodes passed through me.

747
02:28:33,420 --> 02:28:42,450
Marisa Eisenberg: If it passes through me a lot, then I act as a bridge between many different nodes and so, then I would be a more central node in the network and so.

748
02:28:42,930 --> 02:28:52,320
Marisa Eisenberg: So between the centrality is measuring you know how central our nodes based on how often they act as bridges and so yeah we.

749
02:28:53,100 --> 02:28:56,160
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah so that's that's sort of the idea there, and this is that.

750
02:28:56,970 --> 02:29:11,130
Marisa Eisenberg: One of those philosophy Wikipedia things it's hard to see actually I should really remake this it's hi i'm highlighting the notes here by between the centrality you can see that nodes that act as sort of like trunk lines that kind of.

751
02:29:12,630 --> 02:29:21,570
Marisa Eisenberg: connect up different branches of the network tend to be more brightly colored they're higher in terms of their between the centrality.

752
02:29:21,810 --> 02:29:30,330
Marisa Eisenberg: Then some of these other nodes that don't serve as bridges from one chunk of the graph to another, and so between the centrality.

753
02:29:30,990 --> 02:29:47,460
Marisa Eisenberg: Is there another kind of sensuality that you'll see a lot this is often Google pagerank is one version of this, but so I can vector sensuality so this this centrality idea is basically worked is on the principle that.

754
02:29:48,570 --> 02:29:54,660
Marisa Eisenberg: If I am connected to very central individuals, I should also therefore be.

755
02:29:55,410 --> 02:30:08,850
Marisa Eisenberg: Highly central or highly important, so if i'm connected to very important people then i'm probably also important and if you write down sort of the equations that describe that idea, so the importance of.

756
02:30:09,450 --> 02:30:16,860
Marisa Eisenberg: Each node is proportional to the importance of their connections and and you do the algebra that it turns out that.

757
02:30:17,700 --> 02:30:30,300
Marisa Eisenberg: That means that your sensuality is given by the eigenvector the largest eigenvalue of the adjacent to the matrix if you haven't when you're on that was just a bunch of gobbledygook if you have hopefully that's useful, but the main.

758
02:30:31,620 --> 02:30:47,190
Marisa Eisenberg: The main idea is really just sort of this idea that it's it's sort of like your importance is based on how how your your neighbors your your connected nodes how important they are, and so this cut this kind of like self reinforcing.

759
02:30:48,630 --> 02:30:59,880
Marisa Eisenberg: centrality idea, and so, if you if you take the same network and plot each of those different sensibilities on, so this is a you know sort of randomly generated network.

760
02:31:00,660 --> 02:31:13,140
Marisa Eisenberg: But in each one of these, the nodes are highlighted by their centrality with either degree closeness between this or eigenvector centrality and you can see that each of these different kinds of centrality.

761
02:31:14,400 --> 02:31:27,990
Marisa Eisenberg: pull out different features of the network right so degree, obviously, because it's the number of connections that each node has pulls out those really highly connected nodes that are kind of in the Center of a lot of different.

762
02:31:28,440 --> 02:31:38,610
Marisa Eisenberg: connections closeness sensuality gets you towards the middle of the graph because that's where you're going to have the shortest distance from each of these nodes to any other node in the network.

763
02:31:38,970 --> 02:31:44,250
Marisa Eisenberg: Between the centrality is interesting it captures if you notice here there's kind of a rift.

764
02:31:44,580 --> 02:31:51,390
Marisa Eisenberg: Between the left, half of the network and the right half of the network right and the highest between the centrality nodes.

765
02:31:51,600 --> 02:32:01,380
Marisa Eisenberg: tend to be the ones that are along that Canyon because they serve as bridges across the across the way from one side of the Canyon to the other so.

766
02:32:01,890 --> 02:32:05,070
Marisa Eisenberg: High between the centrality nodes will tend to be the ones that are.

767
02:32:05,580 --> 02:32:17,730
Marisa Eisenberg: sort of here along this sort of rift and I vector centrality ends up pulling out what sort of seems to be the Community that have connected nodes that are sort of most central and.

768
02:32:18,270 --> 02:32:21,900
Marisa Eisenberg: And it does that because remember it's got this self reinforcing property so.

769
02:32:22,170 --> 02:32:39,120
Marisa Eisenberg: If if if i'm connected to very central nodes, then I myself must be very central and so that self reinforcing property tends to mean that it finds sort of one connected community that seems to be the most central one and so that's what it kind of has highlighted here and so.

770
02:32:39,300 --> 02:32:40,500
Marisa Eisenberg: On different show you that.

771
02:32:41,460 --> 02:32:42,420
Rishi Chanderraj: So so.

772
02:32:43,440 --> 02:32:58,290
Rishi Chanderraj: In general, are these just like exploratory descriptive or like so just kind of like a framework to visualize patterns, or like as their influence that you're doing or like.

773
02:33:00,150 --> 02:33:12,510
Rishi Chanderraj: When interview it's like Oh well, can you say like test, if you will knock out like this X, Y or Z which how disruptive would that be to a network are you able to do stuff like that or just purely descriptive.

774
02:33:12,570 --> 02:33:14,910
Marisa Eisenberg: Well, you can do a lot of different things so.

775
02:33:15,180 --> 02:33:18,810
Marisa Eisenberg: It is often used as in a descriptive way so oftentimes it's.

776
02:33:18,810 --> 02:33:22,830
Marisa Eisenberg: kind of uses a descriptive thing but it's also often used so.

777
02:33:23,340 --> 02:33:33,870
Marisa Eisenberg: Like here's a workflow that happens frequently is that you are looking at like we actually just saw this i'm doing a project, right now, where we're looking at disease spread in.

778
02:33:34,410 --> 02:33:44,400
Marisa Eisenberg: networks of patient flow in a hospital and so you if you plot some of the central different mentalities what we found is that this disease spread tends to.

779
02:33:44,580 --> 02:33:56,250
Marisa Eisenberg: be associated with closeness and tragedy in this case so individuals note units within the hospital that are higher and closeness sensuality tend to have more exposure for infectious disease and so.

780
02:33:56,700 --> 02:34:00,120
Marisa Eisenberg: At least for this respiratory you know situation we were looking at, but so.

781
02:34:00,870 --> 02:34:10,110
Marisa Eisenberg: So if you do that, then you might use closeness sensuality as an intervention tool right, so you might say, okay so we're going to change the.

782
02:34:10,380 --> 02:34:21,750
Marisa Eisenberg: Cleaning or air filtration or whatever kinds of patterns for a higher centrality nodes and then you would see if that affects things so that's like a common kind of thing that these often get used for is it's.

783
02:34:21,990 --> 02:34:26,850
Marisa Eisenberg: A descriptive thing, but then it becomes like a variable that you use in some analysis right.

784
02:34:27,540 --> 02:34:31,950
Marisa Eisenberg: The other thing you can do, though, is like you're saying is say let's say I have a network.

785
02:34:32,220 --> 02:34:44,280
Marisa Eisenberg: And what happens if I remove every like I have a network of smokers and non smokers and what happens if I remove all the smokers from the network for some reason or the all the non smokers, or whatever you know what I mean.

786
02:34:44,610 --> 02:34:57,750
Marisa Eisenberg: Then, how does it change the structure of the network, and so there you can use these centrality things to sort of visualize Okay, what happened to my network after I did something to it, you know and kind of quantify how it changed.

787
02:34:58,650 --> 02:35:07,890
Marisa Eisenberg: And so yeah yeah yeah so that's the idea, but they they are kind of ad hoc which is kind of I think interesting I feel like a lot of the time.

788
02:35:09,510 --> 02:35:19,110
Marisa Eisenberg: And for me to I find frustrating that there is not a like for a lot of things that have a the mathematical field that networks has there is.

789
02:35:19,500 --> 02:35:25,920
Marisa Eisenberg: A true answer of sort of when you ask a question like what's the most central node.

790
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:35,430
Marisa Eisenberg: There is a long standing theory of this is the way you answer that question and networks has a lot of stuff where that's not really true there's several different possible ways that you can do it.

791
02:35:35,730 --> 02:35:41,640
Marisa Eisenberg: And it's kind of up to you, and so you know, usually usually, when i'm doing a network study.

792
02:35:41,910 --> 02:35:49,200
Marisa Eisenberg: i'll try several of the main centrality and I need some kind of sensuality metric i'll try several of the main sensuality metrics and then.

793
02:35:49,440 --> 02:36:01,530
Marisa Eisenberg: Like see which one correlates best with the outcome, I have of interest and then that's the one will use but um but there's not like a like it's this you know kind of a thing that yeah so that's kind of an interesting thing.

794
02:36:02,760 --> 02:36:17,400
Marisa Eisenberg: OK and OK so sensuality here's some of the main flavors of sensuality and related to that another thing that people often use for characterizing network structure.

795
02:36:18,180 --> 02:36:27,000
Marisa Eisenberg: Is the degree distribution, so the the degree sequence is the list of degrees for every node in the graph.

796
02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:41,040
Marisa Eisenberg: This is often used to determine the degree distribution are really most of the time you actually treat them as the same so the histogram of degrees in your of your network is is usually called the degree distribution so basically.

797
02:36:41,970 --> 02:36:49,320
Marisa Eisenberg: You look at each node in the network and you say how many nodes is it connected to, and then you make a histogram of that so there's you know.

798
02:36:49,650 --> 02:36:58,920
Marisa Eisenberg: 11 nodes that have a degree of two etc, etc, etc, and it turns out that that distribution can tell you a lot about the structure of the graph.

799
02:36:59,250 --> 02:37:04,200
Marisa Eisenberg: And one in particular like so one example of the kinds of things that it can tell you.

800
02:37:05,070 --> 02:37:13,200
Marisa Eisenberg: Is is this sort of scale free networks idea, which is a common kind of degree distribution that gifts that you'll see so.

801
02:37:14,100 --> 02:37:33,960
Marisa Eisenberg: scale free networks are where you have a power law degree, distribution and then they're called scale free because the this type of degree distribution doesn't have a sort of characteristics scale so rather than being shaped so with a network degree, so if you were mad to imagine degree.

802
02:37:35,070 --> 02:37:50,370
Marisa Eisenberg: And this is the number of nodes that have that degree, you know, a degree distribution that looks like this has a sort of characteristic degree, where Okay, most of the nodes in the network have a degree of around.

803
02:37:50,820 --> 02:38:04,350
Marisa Eisenberg: Five or whatever number, this is and and so, but scale free networks are surprisingly common are things that are kind of scale three ish I would say, are surprisingly common where they have a they have.

804
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:07,620
Marisa Eisenberg: Most of the nodes have very low degree.

805
02:38:08,550 --> 02:38:15,750
Marisa Eisenberg: But there's a long tail That means that there are these hubs where you have certain nodes that have very high degree.

806
02:38:16,020 --> 02:38:32,220
Marisa Eisenberg: And so it turns out that a lot of biological networks social networks Internet related networks, etc, have this kind of scale free ish property, where they have a lot of low degree nodes and then a smaller number but substantial still have very high degree nodes and so.

807
02:38:33,240 --> 02:38:37,920
Marisa Eisenberg: This is, I scan this from a book so it's kind of sad looking but.

808
02:38:38,700 --> 02:38:45,360
Marisa Eisenberg: This is getting at the idea, so you can see here that most of the nodes in the network have very few connections.

809
02:38:45,630 --> 02:38:59,610
Marisa Eisenberg: But there's a few hubs that have very large numbers of connections, and so it kind of changes the way that the network is structured when you have something like this if you connect nodes totally at random you'll usually get something where there is a more characteristic.

810
02:39:00,750 --> 02:39:04,410
Marisa Eisenberg: degree, and it has sort of this more kind of normal distribution you looking thing.

811
02:39:05,160 --> 02:39:16,380
Marisa Eisenberg: It whereas here what you get is a lot of nodes with low degree and then some of these hubs that have very high degree so here's a an example of a scale free network, and you can see, there are certain hubs that have very high degree and.

812
02:39:17,010 --> 02:39:21,660
Marisa Eisenberg: It turns out that this kind of random versus scale free network thing.

813
02:39:22,920 --> 02:39:36,690
Marisa Eisenberg: can really make a difference in how the networks function and what they do so when you have something that's a more like a random network, where it has kind of this sort of bell curve distribution of degree.

814
02:39:37,680 --> 02:39:51,450
Marisa Eisenberg: That might be more like how you might think of a road network across the US because there's four Cardinal directions most cities tend to have three or four links coming out of them, because you might want to go north, south, east or west.

815
02:39:52,410 --> 02:40:00,750
Marisa Eisenberg: Where and and so, and if you were taking a road trip, you would pass through each one of these cities as you move across the country um you know and so.

816
02:40:01,380 --> 02:40:10,470
Marisa Eisenberg: there's not really a hub, where everyone goes to I don't know whatever Denver, or something as they're moving across the country, you can kind of do it lots of different ways.

817
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:16,950
Marisa Eisenberg: But a scale free network is a little bit more like an airline network so here if you.

818
02:40:17,730 --> 02:40:35,700
Marisa Eisenberg: You have a couple of hub airports and then most most airports, if you just picked a random airport, most of them are small regional airports that mainly serve to connect you to the nearest hub, and then from there you go wherever you're going so if you live in, you know I don't know.

819
02:40:37,620 --> 02:40:42,120
Marisa Eisenberg: Well, I lived in Columbus for a while, so if you live in Columbus Ohio then.

820
02:40:42,900 --> 02:40:58,410
Marisa Eisenberg: Then you it's it's not a hub for Delta, for example, so you mostly fly either to Chicago or Detroit and then you take your New York and then you fly from there to wherever you're going or to the nearest hub to that, and then you connect to get right so.

821
02:40:58,920 --> 02:41:03,360
Marisa Eisenberg: So air air air travel networks tend to mostly be sort of small regional hubs.

822
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:14,340
Marisa Eisenberg: Those have very low degree, and then a few really large major hubs that service, the main connection points to other parts of the country, because if you're going to fly from Seattle to.

823
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:25,950
Marisa Eisenberg: Chicago you're not going to fly to get to know wherever this is to Montana to someplace else etc you're not going to do it like you would a road trip you're going to fly to a hub.

824
02:41:26,250 --> 02:41:34,140
Marisa Eisenberg: And then to another hat right like you take these single main kind of arcs across the country and so these that's how a power law.

825
02:41:35,580 --> 02:41:41,340
Marisa Eisenberg: degree distribution will tend to look more like this and a random degree distribution will tend to look more like this.

826
02:41:41,760 --> 02:41:58,620
Marisa Eisenberg: It turns out that that has some interesting implications for node failure which a lot of people have kind of theorized might be why biological organisms and perhaps social networks also tend to be more scale free So if you have a random network.

827
02:41:59,550 --> 02:42:09,480
Marisa Eisenberg: And and nodes occasionally fail at random within your network like a mutation or something if you imagine like a gene regulatory network or something like that.

828
02:42:09,870 --> 02:42:19,590
Marisa Eisenberg: And then, because they're all kind of equally important it's very easy to end up Disconnecting your network, which makes it kind of nonfunctional right.

829
02:42:19,950 --> 02:42:30,750
Marisa Eisenberg: But a scale free network, most of your nodes are not actually that critical to the to the functioning of the system, and so, if they fail at random, maybe you hit a hub occasionally but.

830
02:42:31,050 --> 02:42:37,800
Marisa Eisenberg: Most of the time you end up kind of taking up peripheral stuff that doesn't really affect the overall functioning of the network and so.

831
02:42:38,550 --> 02:42:43,080
Marisa Eisenberg: scale free networks tend to be more robust to random node failure now.

832
02:42:43,260 --> 02:42:51,870
Marisa Eisenberg: scale free networks are also though much more vulnerable to targeted attacks on specific nodes right So if you know you have a scale free network.

833
02:42:52,050 --> 02:43:03,690
Marisa Eisenberg: You can target the hubs and take out the network, very quickly, because those are the main connection points for for most of the network so it's kind of an interesting thing, but people have theorized that since.

834
02:43:04,440 --> 02:43:16,920
Marisa Eisenberg: You know a lot of mutation would sort of act as if you get if you have a deal a serious mutation that will act as a random node failure in the G network, and some people have theorized that perhaps the reason that.

835
02:43:17,790 --> 02:43:29,490
Marisa Eisenberg: team networks and things like that tend to show scale free kinds of behavior is because it makes them more robust to random node failed so I had is kind of an interesting thing but um okay so.

836
02:43:30,570 --> 02:43:39,990
Marisa Eisenberg: So skill free networks are kind of cool, though, the one thing I will say so, the way that you usually find check if you have a scale free network.

837
02:43:40,560 --> 02:43:49,680
Marisa Eisenberg: Remember, I mentioned it's a power law so it's this like exponential the probability of degree K is is some you know sort of power of it and.

838
02:43:50,040 --> 02:43:56,220
Marisa Eisenberg: The way that you find that then, if you have a power law distribution, if you take a log log scale it'll look like a straight line.

839
02:43:56,700 --> 02:44:02,550
Marisa Eisenberg: And, and so, people will take a log log scale of their degree, distribution and look and see if they see a straight line.

840
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:14,130
Marisa Eisenberg: And you have to be a little careful here a lot of things look kind of linear if you plot them on a log log scale it doesn't really mean that they actually are a lot of people have.

841
02:44:14,820 --> 02:44:25,050
Marisa Eisenberg: have done have noted that there's kind of some abuse of this like power law idea, people will do this is a real example, people will do things like.

842
02:44:25,800 --> 02:44:34,500
Marisa Eisenberg: Like fit only part of the distribution and say oh it's linear here, or you know kind of like sure it's kind of linear you know, like kind of like.

843
02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:43,230
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, I don't really think I would call this linear at all really on on the log log scale which is you know and so um so people.

844
02:44:43,770 --> 02:44:52,200
Marisa Eisenberg: kind of sometimes there was like a fad for it to be scale free and so people kind of pushed it and it's really probably not necessarily.

845
02:44:53,100 --> 02:45:04,830
Marisa Eisenberg: Interesting it's really, really not necessarily I saw that on the chat but yeah it's it's not probably really that everything is scale free it's it's often the case that it's actually just that.

846
02:45:05,160 --> 02:45:10,980
Marisa Eisenberg: There are hubs present in the system and that's kind of the phenomenon that we're really catching um.

847
02:45:11,460 --> 02:45:24,720
Marisa Eisenberg: So anyway, so I just thought I would kind of mentioned that um okay so with the centrality and degree distribution stuff I thought now would be a good time for us to do some degree distribution.

848
02:45:26,340 --> 02:45:36,120
Marisa Eisenberg: stuff ourselves with parts B and C of the of the lab so maybe let's take um I don't know.

849
02:45:36,870 --> 02:45:53,490
Marisa Eisenberg: Five minutes and then i'll check in and it'll probably take a little more than five minutes, but so five to 10 minutes let's say to do parts B and C, so let me just step us through what we're going to do here, so in this part what you're going to do the code is again almost all there.

850
02:45:54,540 --> 02:45:56,580
Marisa Eisenberg: So what you're going to do is you're gonna.

851
02:45:57,930 --> 02:46:02,400
Marisa Eisenberg: So you have this a Jason see matrix and so.

852
02:46:04,380 --> 02:46:10,350
Marisa Eisenberg: I want you to calculate the degree and then and then plot it.

853
02:46:11,580 --> 02:46:16,080
Marisa Eisenberg: So if you have I guess one quick thing if you have an adjacent see matrix.

854
02:46:17,130 --> 02:46:25,050
Marisa Eisenberg: You know, remember that it's marked with zeros or ones, if there if there is or isn't a link between the two things so.

855
02:46:25,860 --> 02:46:34,740
Marisa Eisenberg: If you some across the road or some across the columns you'll get the integrator the out degree right, and so, so I want you to.

856
02:46:35,340 --> 02:46:39,900
Marisa Eisenberg: Like see if you can take a couple of minutes and see if you can do it yourself and then we'll do it all together.

857
02:46:40,680 --> 02:46:54,000
Marisa Eisenberg: figure out how from the adjacent the matrix you calculate the degree of each node and then make the code is here to make a histogram of of your your no degree and and you can plot it.

858
02:46:55,050 --> 02:47:15,150
Marisa Eisenberg: You can plot it both sort of as a histogram and you can also plot it on a large scale, to look at the log log plot version and and so take a second to do that and then we'll talk about that piece, and then maybe after we do that, we can also do some plotting of.

859
02:47:16,260 --> 02:47:31,740
Marisa Eisenberg: The you can plot how how the network looks if you if you try highlighting the nodes by their different centrality measure so take a couple minutes and try it and then we'll do it all together as well, so i'll pause for a second.

860
02:48:22,050 --> 02:48:22,770
Marisa Eisenberg: Did anybody.

861
02:48:24,840 --> 02:48:41,040
Marisa Eisenberg: Any any luck did were you able to figure out degree stuff some yes okay good deal so um did you get a decent looking degree distribution, what do you think any sense of if you feel like it's scale free or no.

862
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:45,330
Marisa Eisenberg: it's too small to be able to tell really right.

863
02:48:46,530 --> 02:48:48,630
Marisa Eisenberg: Well yeah that's was it feel.

864
02:48:50,610 --> 02:48:54,390
Marisa Eisenberg: intuitively like it might be scale free I don't know ish.

865
02:48:56,310 --> 02:48:56,640
Rishi Chanderraj: yeah.

866
02:48:57,090 --> 02:49:13,320
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah Okay, so let me, let me share my screen here i'll share the whole desktop actually because my our is going to be sad and difficult to see so okay So hopefully, and so it turns out, so there's a couple of things to get some.

867
02:49:14,490 --> 02:49:18,150
Marisa Eisenberg: let's see I was playing with cloths earlier but show.

868
02:49:18,390 --> 02:49:21,330
Marisa Eisenberg: If you want to do the degree, distribution and.

869
02:49:21,510 --> 02:49:40,110
Marisa Eisenberg: You can get in degree and out degree with the column sums on the road sums of the Jason see matrix you can also actually just get the degree directly, if you do degree healer network, and it will spit out the degree of each node it has an industry, maybe it has one.

870
02:49:41,940 --> 02:49:45,960
Marisa Eisenberg: No Okay, it does it's something else, and maybe there's an option here.

871
02:49:47,970 --> 02:49:54,960
Marisa Eisenberg: Oh, here we go Okay, so you can actually that's cute Okay, so you can actually do in, and it will tell you the industry.

872
02:49:55,500 --> 02:50:09,900
Marisa Eisenberg: And out and it will tell you the degree, you can also just get it directly from the adjacent see matrix um but you know, so if we if we want to do it directly from the Jason see matrix you should get something like this, as your histogram.

873
02:50:10,350 --> 02:50:25,050
Marisa Eisenberg: And I don't know from this I can't really tell whether it looks scale free to me or not, but let's plot this same thing on a log log scale, and if you plot it on a log log scale, then you get this.

874
02:50:26,880 --> 02:50:46,110
Marisa Eisenberg: is pretty linear to me that seems you know decently linear it's not a lot of points so it's kind of hard to say, but I, my gut was like okay that looks reasonably scale free will say it that way, and you know hard to say, but it, but it looks kind of scale free ish let's say.

875
02:50:47,610 --> 02:50:54,000
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, so if you if you do that, you can you can kind of see what the degree, distribution and whether or not it looks scale free.

876
02:50:55,200 --> 02:51:02,460
Marisa Eisenberg: So next let's play around and i'm just going to do this, I did a little of the coding, while we were working.

877
02:51:02,970 --> 02:51:08,640
Marisa Eisenberg: let's play around with some of the different centrality measures and just kind of see how they look so.

878
02:51:09,300 --> 02:51:17,280
Marisa Eisenberg: You can calculate the degrees centrality like I mentioned, either from the row sums of the column sons, if you do that, you get.

879
02:51:17,940 --> 02:51:35,760
Marisa Eisenberg: You know, you can kind of see what the degrees of the different nodes are, if you look here, there are some that are you know kind of particularly high in their degree, so there are clearly some that have higher degree than others, and if you do closeness centrality it'll actually grumble.

880
02:51:35,760 --> 02:51:54,060
Marisa Eisenberg: At you because because it's a directed graph it it doesn't like the you know it doesn't know how to it gets annoyed because there isn't always a directed path between this node every node and every other node and so.

881
02:51:54,480 --> 02:51:59,130
Marisa Eisenberg: What i'm going to do is convert this into an undirected graph which basically just means.

882
02:51:59,310 --> 02:52:08,550
Marisa Eisenberg: ignore the directionality and if you do that, then you get you know sort of a range of different closeness and trolley values, these are you know sort of all sorts of different things.

883
02:52:09,480 --> 02:52:21,510
Marisa Eisenberg: You can calculate between the centrality and you get a number of different things here, and you can calculate eigenvector sensuality and it gives you a million different options, but if we go back up to the top.

884
02:52:22,320 --> 02:52:37,680
Marisa Eisenberg: You can see the various eigenvectors mentality values I think it's sort of hard to see what these are doing if we don't visualize so let's make some plots and take a look so if we plot the network i'm going to just plot the network and make the size of the nodes.

885
02:52:38,970 --> 02:52:49,590
Marisa Eisenberg: In this case is the degree, and so you can see that some of the nodes clearly have higher degree than others, and so the you know there's certain nodes that seems to be sort of more.

886
02:52:49,800 --> 02:52:54,810
Marisa Eisenberg: Central from a degree perspective and the network, if we do the same thing, but we plot it.

887
02:52:55,440 --> 02:53:03,540
Marisa Eisenberg: By closeness centrality times of big constant so that the the nodes look like they're reasonable size, you can see that.

888
02:53:04,320 --> 02:53:12,570
Marisa Eisenberg: I probably should have fiddled with the scaling a little bit, but you can see that some of the nodes are more central from a closeness sensuality perspective.

889
02:53:12,870 --> 02:53:23,400
Marisa Eisenberg: than others, and if we plot I forgot between this oh what am I doing this with MDS layout hang on just a second I want, what is it called wrap off.

890
02:53:24,480 --> 02:53:25,110
A little better.

891
02:53:29,070 --> 02:53:34,680
Marisa Eisenberg: So let's try it let's try closeness again real quick, but I just want to see how it looks with the graph off layout it's.

892
02:53:36,210 --> 02:53:50,670
Marisa Eisenberg: very old that's better Okay, so you can see some of the you know it's there still various different sizes, you can see that there's their higher closeness sensuality and kind of these central clusters if we change this to between this centrality.

893
02:53:54,330 --> 02:53:57,150
We need to do it undirected for this so maybe we should.

894
02:54:00,690 --> 02:54:07,140
Marisa Eisenberg: Remember what scale is this the small other fine okay we're gonna this might be.

895
02:54:08,280 --> 02:54:11,580
Marisa Eisenberg: kind of wildly varying in size let's see what we get here.

896
02:54:14,340 --> 02:54:29,280
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, so some of these are obviously, then the range on between the centrality is very large, and so this made a very silly looking plot let's take it, maybe let's say one 10th of between the centrality and then make that plot, the size of the nodes.

897
02:54:32,550 --> 02:54:38,640
Marisa Eisenberg: There we go okay so for between the centrality you can see that there are some nodes that are very.

898
02:54:39,390 --> 02:54:48,210
Marisa Eisenberg: Important from a between the centrality perspective that sort of act as bridges for a lot of the other nodes in their shortest path between and so.

899
02:54:48,810 --> 02:54:59,820
Marisa Eisenberg: Those nodes are kind of more central in the network from a bridge enos perspective and then, if we plot eigenvector sensuality and we make the size of the nodes based on eigenvector sensuality.

900
02:55:00,480 --> 02:55:17,940
Marisa Eisenberg: What you'll see is that it tends to find yeah it tends to find a Community or a cluster that seems to be kind of what it's viewing as the most central sort of driving cluster for that network so i'm just kind of wanted to a post this code in a minute, but just wanted to kind of.

901
02:55:19,050 --> 02:55:29,100
Marisa Eisenberg: show some examples of the centrality measures that we talked about with a real world network and okay other questions about any of that make sense.

902
02:55:30,300 --> 02:55:40,350
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay alright, if not, then, in the last 15 minutes or so and i'm going to let's talk a little bit about clustering and networks.

903
02:55:40,590 --> 02:55:50,940
Marisa Eisenberg: And maybe we'll get to a little bit on random networks we're definitely not going to finish all this stuff will do will do the rest of this tomorrow, it will get into sampling and dimensionality and all these things but.

904
02:55:51,840 --> 02:55:55,410
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, so let's talk about clustering in network so um.

905
02:55:55,980 --> 02:56:02,070
Marisa Eisenberg: So we talked about how you might think about the centrality of different nodes and how you'd measure the degree distribution.

906
02:56:02,340 --> 02:56:10,770
Marisa Eisenberg: One of the other common things that you often want to look about when you look at when you're trying to understand the structure of a network is one of the clusters in a network so.

907
02:56:11,130 --> 02:56:17,670
Marisa Eisenberg: there's a lot of different ways to look at clustering so you might want it, you might wonder something like.

908
02:56:18,780 --> 02:56:27,330
Marisa Eisenberg: How much do do do individuals in the nuts and the network cluster based on their traits so, for instance, do.

909
02:56:28,050 --> 02:56:34,290
Marisa Eisenberg: Popular people, people who have high degree tend to interact mostly a lot more with other popular people.

910
02:56:34,890 --> 02:56:48,840
Marisa Eisenberg: Or do if the if the nodes are associated with particular traits or covariance do they tend to be you know haemophilus so do smokers tend to be friends with other smokers do.

911
02:56:49,470 --> 02:56:54,840
Marisa Eisenberg: You know people who you know drink more attend to be friends with people who drink more.

912
02:56:55,290 --> 02:57:05,340
Marisa Eisenberg: You know those kinds of questions, and so you might wonder about how the structure of your edges is related to different properties of individuals.

913
02:57:05,610 --> 02:57:11,130
Marisa Eisenberg: You might also want to do something like Community detection so maybe, rather than trying to understand how.

914
02:57:11,370 --> 02:57:24,150
Marisa Eisenberg: The properties of individuals govern the clustering pattern in the network, you simply want to find what are the clusters that you know that you can find in the network, so you might want to do something like finding.

915
02:57:25,050 --> 02:57:31,200
Marisa Eisenberg: Usually people kind of define clusters as being groups of nodes that are more highly connected within the group.

916
02:57:31,440 --> 02:57:40,890
Marisa Eisenberg: and less connected between groups, so a cluster is a group of nodes that are very tightly coupled within that group of nodes and have fewer connections to the rest of the graph.

917
02:57:42,150 --> 02:57:52,050
Marisa Eisenberg: And so, for understanding, some of these different things there's a few different metrics one of the simplest ones that people often sort of start with is what's called the clustering coefficient.

918
02:57:52,350 --> 02:58:01,500
Marisa Eisenberg: And, and so this is really asking the question if i'm a note in the network, and I have some friends some connections to other people in the network.

919
02:58:01,770 --> 02:58:16,500
Marisa Eisenberg: How many of my friends are also friends, so how many of my connections are connected to each other, so if i'm friends with two people and they are also connected to each other, the three of us form a triangle so club checking clustering really.

920
02:58:17,250 --> 02:58:27,510
Marisa Eisenberg: is all about in this situation if you're thinking of it as how many of my friends are friends with each other, is really all about checking how many triangles there are in the network essentially.

921
02:58:28,440 --> 02:58:36,630
Marisa Eisenberg: So the global clustering coefficient is just how many triangles are there in the network over the number of possible triangles and that'll tell you what fraction of.

922
02:58:37,080 --> 02:58:49,830
Marisa Eisenberg: Friends of individuals are friends with one another, the local clustering coefficient is for each node what fraction of their neighbors of their connections are connected to each other.

923
02:58:50,400 --> 02:58:58,500
Marisa Eisenberg: Is the local clustering coefficient so that's one kind of simple clustering metric another one that gets used a lot when, particularly when you're thinking about.

924
02:58:58,920 --> 02:59:08,850
Marisa Eisenberg: attributes of nodes is what's called a sort of activity, so this measures, a sort of network level tendency for nodes to attach to similar similar notes so.

925
02:59:10,050 --> 02:59:20,430
Marisa Eisenberg: That similarity might be defined by an attribute like are they a smoker or nonsmoker or it might be defined by something like degree or all kinds of different sorts of things.

926
02:59:21,060 --> 02:59:29,160
Marisa Eisenberg: But basically, you what you do with a sort of activity there's there's various different ways to calculate it but they all sort of boil down to.

927
02:59:29,520 --> 02:59:34,440
Marisa Eisenberg: calculate the fraction of edges between nodes of the same type.

928
02:59:34,890 --> 02:59:43,140
Marisa Eisenberg: And Compare that to what you would expect from a random network, so if you have more edges between nodes of the same type of smokers.

929
02:59:43,380 --> 02:59:55,080
Marisa Eisenberg: are more are more often friends with other smokers than you would expect from a random network then it's a sort of it if it's less than you would expect from a random network, it will tend to be disorder and so.

930
02:59:55,920 --> 03:00:07,950
Marisa Eisenberg: The the the way that the specifics of how this gets calculated it ends up, meaning that the range of this is from the way it's sort of normalized it ends up being from minus one to one.

931
03:00:08,250 --> 03:00:19,980
Marisa Eisenberg: But the minimum value not every network can actually sort of reach a minus one of most disruptive it depends on the composition of the network there's some kind of subtleties here we can talk about it more.

932
03:00:20,730 --> 03:00:31,590
Marisa Eisenberg: If you if you want tomorrow or there's a great mark Newman, has done a lot on a sort of activity, and I think he originally developed the idea and and so he has this paper is a nice.

933
03:00:32,280 --> 03:00:38,400
Marisa Eisenberg: kind of intro to a sort of activity and once you kind of see how the calculation works, it makes us a little clearer but.

934
03:00:39,450 --> 03:00:46,410
Marisa Eisenberg: The basic idea is that it can generally range from minus one to one and and it will be positive if.

935
03:00:47,520 --> 03:00:51,810
Marisa Eisenberg: people tend to form more connections than than random.

936
03:00:52,470 --> 03:00:59,340
Marisa Eisenberg: Based on that tendency, so if two people have the same type are more likely to be connected together, then you'll have a positive number.

937
03:00:59,520 --> 03:01:12,630
Marisa Eisenberg: And if two people at the same time, are less likely to be connected together and know have a negative number and so i'm just some examples to give us a little bit of sort of intuition about this so i'm.

938
03:01:13,650 --> 03:01:20,940
Marisa Eisenberg: Sorry assorted if network might be something like this one for political blogs, so this is a network of political blogs and.

939
03:01:22,170 --> 03:01:29,850
Marisa Eisenberg: And they're linked if they they're connected if they link from one to the other with one blog links to the other, and you can see that mostly.

940
03:01:31,050 --> 03:01:40,770
Marisa Eisenberg: You know left leaning blogs tend to link to other left leaning blogs and right leaning blog simple link to other right needs leading blogs, and so that that network is very assertive on.

941
03:01:41,280 --> 03:01:54,840
Marisa Eisenberg: Political you know sort of direction and, and so, but, but something like a heterosexual sexual network would be very distorted by gender, you know if you're in a heterosexual network, then.

942
03:01:56,010 --> 03:02:04,530
Marisa Eisenberg: Male individuals, would you know men would would link primarily with women, and so you know so then and vice versa, and so.

943
03:02:05,070 --> 03:02:16,560
Marisa Eisenberg: So there will be very few links between for women and women and men and men, if you're looking on me and if you're looking at a heterosexual network, then you know it's very distorted by gender and.

944
03:02:16,950 --> 03:02:32,490
Marisa Eisenberg: it's it's frequently the case that so social and sexual networks are assertive on a lot of properties, so this sort of gender thing aside it's often the case that many of the demographic traits of individuals there the degree.

945
03:02:33,300 --> 03:02:42,870
Marisa Eisenberg: behavioral traits all kinds of things tend to often be fairly assorted and so there's this like people oftentimes use the phrase birds of a feather flock together.

946
03:02:43,350 --> 03:02:51,000
Marisa Eisenberg: people tend to when you're talking about social networks, they tend to associate with people who are similar to themselves and so.

947
03:02:52,020 --> 03:03:01,440
Marisa Eisenberg: So those are some of the methods so sort of activity is one of the methods for sort of figuring out how much does the structure of the network kind of cluster on particular traits and.

948
03:03:02,130 --> 03:03:06,990
Marisa Eisenberg: modularity is for figuring out if you want to understand.

949
03:03:07,530 --> 03:03:18,000
Marisa Eisenberg: If you want to detect clusters within the network, you want to understand what are the clusters, I have a network, what are the clusters that exist in this network, so we want to find groups of nodes.

950
03:03:18,300 --> 03:03:26,190
Marisa Eisenberg: That have more within group edges than between group edges and those are sort of typically what we would think of as our clusters and so.

951
03:03:27,090 --> 03:03:35,910
Marisa Eisenberg: The sort of classic thought was initially sort of like well you want, if you want to find more within group edges and fewer between group edges.

952
03:03:36,180 --> 03:03:45,960
Marisa Eisenberg: Your sort of initial thought might be well why don't we just minimize the number of between groups find breaking of the network that minimize the number of between group edges.

953
03:03:46,290 --> 03:03:54,000
Marisa Eisenberg: But you know of course that ends up meeting that the simplest thing to do is just to put everyone in one Community, and then there are no connections.

954
03:03:54,180 --> 03:04:05,070
Marisa Eisenberg: To between group edges because there aren't any any between group edges, so what i'm what people have come up with is this idea of modularity and so modularity.

955
03:04:05,310 --> 03:04:23,250
Marisa Eisenberg: it's a similar kind of feel to sort of activity, what you do is you say Okay, what are the groupings of nodes that have more within group edges and fewer between group edges than would be expected from a random network, and so you find.

956
03:04:24,720 --> 03:04:29,850
Marisa Eisenberg: The fraction so with modularity you find the fraction of within group edges.

957
03:04:30,660 --> 03:04:41,250
Marisa Eisenberg: That, if you break the the network into this say Community structure what's the fraction of within group edges minus the fraction you would expect, at random.

958
03:04:41,700 --> 03:04:57,540
Marisa Eisenberg: And then the idea is basically you find the Community structure that maximizes this quantity so it'll it'll give you the most within group edges compared to what you would expect from a random a random.

959
03:04:58,590 --> 03:05:00,960
Marisa Eisenberg: Network and a random Community structure so.

960
03:05:02,070 --> 03:05:10,470
Marisa Eisenberg: So that's sort of the idea of modularity it's trying to find more within group edges fewer between group edges compared to a random network.

961
03:05:10,830 --> 03:05:18,540
Marisa Eisenberg: And, and it turns out that it works very well, you can use it for lots of different examples, the classic.

962
03:05:19,110 --> 03:05:26,520
Marisa Eisenberg: If you've taken a network theory class you've probably seen this network, this is a this is kind of a very it's a very random network it's a.

963
03:05:26,970 --> 03:05:39,300
Marisa Eisenberg: it's the karate club so there's this it's this it's a real world karate club that actually existed and there was an instructor and I think sponsor or someone who had originally set up the karate club and.

964
03:05:39,810 --> 03:05:44,910
Marisa Eisenberg: And they had a falling out the instructor and the original sponsor of the Kung fu karate club.

965
03:05:45,150 --> 03:05:58,500
Marisa Eisenberg: And they they broke up and the karate club split into two factions, and so they split into two groups feel like we're going to have a This is like the beginning of a karate kid movie but anyway, so the they split up and if you do.

966
03:05:59,070 --> 03:06:14,460
Marisa Eisenberg: The modularity thing, so if you figure out the Community structure by modularity it turns out, so the squares in this graph and the circles are who went with which group, and if you do the modularity Community structure.

967
03:06:15,240 --> 03:06:24,360
Marisa Eisenberg: algorithm it turns out that it finds those two groupings, exactly as the two groups that that it would predict the two communities within this network and so.

968
03:06:25,410 --> 03:06:33,030
Marisa Eisenberg: I think this one is maybe the instructor and one of these two is the sponsor so they were if you plotted their their sort of friendships.

969
03:06:33,840 --> 03:06:44,910
Marisa Eisenberg: And how often they hung out together, this was the network you got and then it turns out that when they split it matches very well with the modularity predicted.

970
03:06:46,140 --> 03:06:57,510
Marisa Eisenberg: communities, this is a another network of political books I don't remember which one is which way leaning, but these are books from Amazon and.

971
03:06:58,050 --> 03:07:08,190
Marisa Eisenberg: Live links between the nodes are commonly co purchase books, so if someone bought this book they were very likely to also buy these various other books and so.

972
03:07:08,700 --> 03:07:18,240
Marisa Eisenberg: So if you if you plot this network of books and purchase patterns, you can see that modularity splits this into four different communities.

973
03:07:19,260 --> 03:07:29,040
Marisa Eisenberg: I don't remember which one of these is left leaning right leaning but let's say a left leaning Community a right leaning community, and then the triangles are books that weren't politically.

974
03:07:29,370 --> 03:07:41,940
Marisa Eisenberg: affiliated in either direction their books on some other topics that aren't you know sort of political don't have a political leaning and and so you can see, there are these two kind of mixed middle ish communities that have.

975
03:07:42,750 --> 03:08:00,240
Marisa Eisenberg: Most of the non political non politically affiliated books, as well as a few various different things, and so anyway so it's an interesting and interesting method it lets you sort of figure out what the Community structure is within your network and the the one downside, with modularity.

976
03:08:01,260 --> 03:08:11,970
Marisa Eisenberg: It was historically kind of difficult to maximize and was very slow there's been development of spectral methods based on linear algebra that have made this a lot faster.

977
03:08:13,260 --> 03:08:18,690
Marisa Eisenberg: But there are still issues with it turns out that it's an NP hard problem to actually find.

978
03:08:18,990 --> 03:08:28,110
Marisa Eisenberg: The Community that truly maximizes modularity, and so there are good methods, but it's hard to know whether you've actually found the true best Community structure.

979
03:08:28,350 --> 03:08:35,580
Marisa Eisenberg: And there's also an issue of Resolution limit so as the network grows larger it becomes harder for modularity based.

980
03:08:36,120 --> 03:08:45,330
Marisa Eisenberg: Community detection methods to find small communities, but you know overall modularity is one of the kind of nicer tools out there for figuring out Community structure.

981
03:08:45,840 --> 03:08:55,890
Marisa Eisenberg: Within a network um Okay, so I have a section on generating random networks but we're down to the last four minutes and I kind of wonder.

982
03:08:57,300 --> 03:09:09,600
Marisa Eisenberg: um maybe rather than diving into a new section will sort of start this tomorrow and maybe we'll wrap up here are there questions about any of this stuff we've talked about so far.

983
03:09:11,280 --> 03:09:19,980
Rishi Chanderraj: yeah what what kind of problems do you find that this approach is most helpful for.

984
03:09:20,520 --> 03:09:24,900
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah so if this is a month the modularity thing yeah.

985
03:09:25,170 --> 03:09:33,450
Rishi Chanderraj: yeah well, I mean modularity specifically and and also just generally like the network approach versus like another you know.

986
03:09:35,640 --> 03:09:40,200
Marisa Eisenberg: Oh yeah okay so so modularity specifically modularity is really often.

987
03:09:40,200 --> 03:09:41,190
Marisa Eisenberg: used for.

988
03:09:41,730 --> 03:09:47,520
Marisa Eisenberg: Like when you are trying to figure out like it's like when you're trying to understand what the structure of the network is so.

989
03:09:48,150 --> 03:10:01,680
Marisa Eisenberg: Like in that hospital modeling project that I mentioned earlier we've used modularity to find what are the communities within the hospital patient transfer network are their communities there, that would mean that there are sort of like.

990
03:10:02,190 --> 03:10:16,560
Marisa Eisenberg: units that tend to transfer patients between them more often, and so you know those would naturally be if you get a case of something in one of those units, the other ones in the Community would be the natural traces to look at her like Oh, you might also have this.

991
03:10:17,400 --> 03:10:24,690
Marisa Eisenberg: And so, so so things like that are common uses networks in general it's often driven.

992
03:10:25,440 --> 03:10:37,710
Marisa Eisenberg: By essentially if your data or your question has a network structure that you think might play a role in how things you know how the outcome of interest is playing out, then.

993
03:10:38,100 --> 03:10:48,450
Marisa Eisenberg: that's often like it often is sort of just sort of driven by that so like if you know in in my case, since i'm doing a lot of infectious disease stuff anytime that there's.

994
03:10:48,990 --> 03:10:53,820
Marisa Eisenberg: Like a network structure to the way that the transmission might play out.

995
03:10:54,390 --> 03:11:03,240
Marisa Eisenberg: And we get some information about that network structure it's often the case that you know that There probably is, but you just don't have any information about it, and so you know.

996
03:11:03,750 --> 03:11:08,880
Marisa Eisenberg: You know, every infectious disease has a transmission network or sometimes right and so.

997
03:11:09,180 --> 03:11:17,730
Marisa Eisenberg: If I don't have any information about it, it may not be worthwhile to try and take a network approach right, but if I have data on how that network is structured then.

998
03:11:18,090 --> 03:11:26,340
Marisa Eisenberg: That will kind of tend to me towards wanting to say okay well, let me take a look and see if it's playing a role in anything that we're seeing um I think.

999
03:11:27,690 --> 03:11:39,870
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah but it just kind of depends, is, I feel like it's often a useful thing to just sort of ask yourself as you're starting something if there is a useful network representation of this that might be helpful, but um but yeah but so that's kind of.

1000
03:11:40,560 --> 03:11:43,650
Marisa Eisenberg: I guess I don't know if that was helpful that was kind of a ramble but yeah.

1001
03:11:44,040 --> 03:11:50,850
Rishi Chanderraj: Well yeah I just I saw I do like I mean I I can kind of see like I do a lot of microbiome research.

1002
03:11:52,260 --> 03:12:03,570
Rishi Chanderraj: And so, like i'm kind of just trying to I mean i'm like i'm trying to think of like first if there's anybody that does this type of that type of analysis here and then also like.

1003
03:12:04,500 --> 03:12:18,510
Rishi Chanderraj: How would I apply it to you because I mean there's a ton of bacteria some together more often than others, but I don't necessarily have a clear grasp of how I would use that right right off the BAT but anyway.

1004
03:12:18,540 --> 03:12:33,090
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah so like, for instance, it might be interesting so like coexistence that works would definitely be so you could build a network that's a weighted network on how frequently do you observe these different species of bacteria together in a community.

1005
03:12:33,120 --> 03:12:44,820
Marisa Eisenberg: Right, and so you know, maybe you're I don't know what setting you're looking at the microbiome for, but you have many different patients or something oh yeah thanks, if you have to go it's our I know it's five So if you head out this really good.

1006
03:12:45,630 --> 03:12:53,280
Marisa Eisenberg: You know, but you may have many different patients, and so what fraction of the time, do you observe these two species, you know sort of coexisting in the same.

1007
03:12:53,910 --> 03:12:59,970
Marisa Eisenberg: Setting and then you would you'd end up with a weighted network that is the proportion of time that you observe.

1008
03:13:00,210 --> 03:13:10,200
Marisa Eisenberg: Each of those things, and so, if you looked at communities there, then the communities would give you frequent like groups of bacteria that frequently co occur right and so.

1009
03:13:11,040 --> 03:13:27,270
Marisa Eisenberg: You could find sort of like you could essentially find a way of sort of dividing up your overall network into Okay, these are the clusters that tend to appear together and you could look at things like in how does the network structure change if you take sick individuals with an illness.

1010
03:13:27,270 --> 03:13:31,020
Marisa Eisenberg: Yes, good rules are healthy, you know those kinds of questions yeah.

1011
03:13:31,080 --> 03:13:35,250
Rishi Chanderraj: or like I guess the one of the things I was thinking of is there is their metrics of like.

1012
03:13:37,560 --> 03:13:51,030
Rishi Chanderraj: The ways that you can measure disruption to network like because one of the things i'm thinking about like keystone species that might keep things stable like if you get rid of those then you've got a lot of disrupts a lot of.

1013
03:13:52,680 --> 03:13:56,340
Rishi Chanderraj: patterns, so I like it either i'm sure there are methods to.

1014
03:13:56,640 --> 03:14:08,970
Marisa Eisenberg: yeah so like you might, for instance, want to look at something like so maybe look at the centrality of your network, and that would tell you the most central species might be likely candidates for some of these kind of keystone.

1015
03:14:09,390 --> 03:14:21,090
Marisa Eisenberg: species, and then you could run some experiments, where you or you know do some simulations where you take that network and you knock out those you know remove those species and then see if.

1016
03:14:21,480 --> 03:14:36,180
Marisa Eisenberg: I mean it's hard to know like maybe, if you look at you might have to do something where you look at patients who you know who don't have that species of bacteria and see if there's a tendency towards either very different Community structures that emerge there or.

1017
03:14:37,320 --> 03:14:47,880
Marisa Eisenberg: Like lower density of bacteria in general, or perhaps more like this, you know, maybe you get more disconnectedness in the networks or things like that.

1018
03:14:48,570 --> 03:15:00,210
Marisa Eisenberg: it's you'd have to kind of think through what the right measure of disruption would be, but I think you could certainly use centrality to to at least initially, look at look at candidates for a keystone species.

1019
03:15:01,410 --> 03:15:11,460
Rishi Chanderraj: yeah I think you know if people like around here do that type of spider do you know anybody that like does that type of analysis for wanted to specifically or.

1020
03:15:11,970 --> 03:15:16,080
Marisa Eisenberg: So let's see so um so in terms of.

1021
03:15:16,830 --> 03:15:33,510
Marisa Eisenberg: The like so that so mark Newman, as a like from a networks person perspective he's like the guy who literally wrote the book and he's here so like you know he's super nice too so he's often a good resource he's very happy to consult on all kinds of random things and so.

1022
03:15:33,720 --> 03:15:38,040
Marisa Eisenberg: I don't he doesn't work on bacterial network, specifically, but he is here, and he knows like.

1023
03:15:38,160 --> 03:15:46,320
Marisa Eisenberg: everything there is to know so he's a good person to ask and there's also a number of people who do work on stuff like this, so I know you know, like so.

1024
03:15:46,800 --> 03:15:59,790
Marisa Eisenberg: In School of Public Health, at any rate, like Betsy foxman here does a lot of stuff with this kind of like she's not a math model or per se, but she has people in her group who often do a lot of this kind of stuff and I think i'm so.

1025
03:16:01,050 --> 03:16:03,960
Marisa Eisenberg: I i've only met him a couple times patch loss, I think, is insane.

1026
03:16:05,880 --> 03:16:11,220
Marisa Eisenberg: I think he does a lot of this kind of stuff I know he's developed some interesting analysis packages and things like that for.

1027
03:16:11,370 --> 03:16:20,220
Marisa Eisenberg: Some of these kinds of questions um the other person who actually would probably be great to talk to you about a lot of this Kevin would, if you know him and you interact with him at all.

1028
03:16:20,850 --> 03:16:22,380
Rishi Chanderraj: I haven't, no, no.

1029
03:16:22,440 --> 03:16:31,800
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay he's in biophysics and he he is does a lot of just like not just networks but complex systems and things like this and and he does a lot of kind of.

1030
03:16:32,160 --> 03:16:42,690
Marisa Eisenberg: Looking at bacterial communities and figuring out what the structure of the networks within them is and sort of that kind of thing, so he would probably be a good person to talk to I don't think I.

1031
03:16:43,920 --> 03:16:49,140
Marisa Eisenberg: Maybe, and you know what else uh it have you have you talked with in deca Roger proxy.

1032
03:16:50,220 --> 03:16:51,900
Rishi Chanderraj: um i've heard the name I haven't actually.

1033
03:16:52,410 --> 03:17:00,210
Marisa Eisenberg: Okay, he also does a lot of network stuff he teaches and networks class and he he does a lot of that kind of thing he's a little more um.

1034
03:17:00,930 --> 03:17:11,910
Marisa Eisenberg: I don't know like pure in terms of his like Matthew style but um but he does a lot of that kind of stuff too, and so he probably be a good person to talk to you okay cool.

1035
03:17:12,300 --> 03:17:13,680
Rishi Chanderraj: Well, thanks sorry oh.

1036
03:17:15,390 --> 03:17:15,810
Marisa Eisenberg: that's good.

1037
03:17:16,890 --> 03:17:17,820
Marisa Eisenberg: awesome cool.

1038
03:17:20,460 --> 03:17:24,990
Marisa Eisenberg: Well hmm other folks have questions i'll hang out otherwise.
