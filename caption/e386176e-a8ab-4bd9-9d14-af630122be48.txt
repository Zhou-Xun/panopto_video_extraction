00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,080
Hi there. I'm Melissa Creary. And I'm Paul Fleming.

2
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,620
And today we are on a journey. We're both faculty at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.

3
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,710
And we started our jobs at the same time back in 2016.

4
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,660
When we first got here, we were thrown right into the classroom and leaned on each other a lot to figure

5
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,530
out how to navigate new and tricky situations while teaching public health.

6
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,820
We also quickly got involved in efforts to make our institution more equitable.

7
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:58,110
We wanted to disrupt structural racism in our classrooms and our workplace, but didn't always know how to best do it.

8
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,540
Through all of it, we supported each other,

9
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,170
but we craved better guidance on how to become anti-racist teachers and anti-racist advocates at our institutions.

10
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:15,510
Which leads us here. We decided to help create this online resource on anti-racist teaching for people in public health or related fields.

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,750
We are not coming to you as experts in anti-racism.

12
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:25,560
We are coming to you as people who are on the journey on a path towards anti-racism in our own teaching and advocacy.

13
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,770
These woods are like the world where you're teaching,

14
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,230
and this path is like the journey we're all on as we explore and work towards anti-racist teaching.

15
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,840
We hope this resource will help you along your own path towards being an anti-racist teacher.

16
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:46,590
In fact, that is one of the core things we learned along the way that anti-racist teaching is not a destination.

17
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,340
It's not a series of checkboxes on a list that you can complete.

18
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,820
It's a lifelong journey towards greater justice and equity.

19
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,720
So we hope you'll join us on this journey where we'll head down different paths to explore various aspects of anti-racist teaching.

20
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,200
But first, we'd like to share a little bit about ourselves individually.

21
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,720
I'm Melissa Creary, and I'm currently a faculty member in the Department of Health Management and Policy.

22
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,730
I teach classes on public health infrastructure and health policy and race and culture.

23
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:23,370
Each of these classes has anti-racist foundations. I either teach about anti-racist methodologies, create anti-racist assessments,

24
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,920
or help my students talk explicitly about racism in the context of health policies and programs.

25
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,260
And I'm Paul Fleming. I'm a faculty member in the Department of Health Behavior and Health Education.

26
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,920
I currently teach classes on planning public health interventions,

27
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:44,320
the historical roots of health inequities and principles of community engagement. In the core required course,

28
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,780
I have tried to integrate anti-racist principles throughout and in my elective courses,

29
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:56,700
I planned these courses with principles of equity and anti-racism from the outset, but all of my teaching is a work in progress.

30
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,440
Now let's share a little bit about who we worked with to create this resource.

31
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,839
Along our journeys, we have had the privilege of meeting some leaders in our field who have helped us curate

32
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,610
materials and resources to help you along your own path towards anti-racist teaching.

33
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:20,150
We engaged a steering committee of faculty members and practitioners to help identify resources and approaches to becoming an anti-racist teacher.

34
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,499
We have been guided by folks at the University of Michigan Center for Research on Learning and

35
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,120
Teaching who have helped us think through best practices and teaching resources like this one.

36
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,160
We have consulted extensively with Dr. Whitney Peoples, who you'll see along our journey.

37
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,990
She is the director of Diversity,

38
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:44,790
Equity and Inclusion at our School of Public Health and has thought really long and hard about what anti-racist teaching means and how to do it.

39
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:54,030
And of course, the students. We conducted research with learners to understand the good, the bad and the ugly of their experiences in the classroom.

40
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,130
These students, as well as the ones we've had in our own classrooms, have shaped this resource.

41
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:07,350
Definitely, the students I taught in my very first year as a faculty member gave me a lot of critiques about racism embedded in the course.

42
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:14,790
And yes, they were hard to hear, but they really pushed me to seek out resources and helped me along my own anti-racist journey.

43
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,840
Student feedback has really helped me rethink how I approach teaching.

44
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,090
And speaking of critique and feedback.

45
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:28,560
We ask that you approach this material with an open mind and take what works and understand that some things may not resonate.

46
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,700
We welcome constructive feedback so we can work to make it better in the future.

47
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:39,950
So why do we think anti-racist teaching is so important? Well, we're going to delve into that throughout this entire course.

48
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,750
But briefly, we actually think that anti-racist teaching is a matter of life and death.

49
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,530
How exactly? Well, anti-racist teaching in health fields isn't just about teaching outcomes.

50
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,350
It's also about health outcomes in the real world.

51
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,520
If we teach in a way that is guided by anti-racist principles, then the health workforce will have an anti-racist foundation.

52
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,290
This means that they will fundamentally understand health problems from an anti-racist

53
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:11,390
lens and will ultimately make anti-racist decisions about how to allocate resources.

54
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,020
An anti-racist health workforce will ultimately lead to improve overall health and reduce health inequities.

55
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:26,030
The bottom line is that the work of practicing anti-racism as a teacher isn't solely about teaching and learning outcomes.

56
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,810
It is also about improving health outcomes outside the classroom walls.

57
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,040
All right. So now you feel the pressures of the world on your shoulders.

58
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,010
We didn't mean to send you in a tailspin, but becoming an anti-racist is a long and challenging process.

59
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,390
The materials included in this resource is just one step in that journey.

60
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:49,700
And we don't dare claim that you'll be an anti-racist teaching expert by the end of this experience.

61
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,010
We do hope that this resource will give you concrete tools to use in your own teaching practice.

62
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,580
It'll help you ask hard questions and engage in harder conversations with your peers and with your students.

63
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,740
In fact, we really recommend that you find a community to go through this material with you.

64
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:14,090
All right. So what can you expect from this resource? Well, we have four learning objectives for folks who move through this material.

65
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,459
After you go through these materials,

66
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:23,240
you should be able to describe the principles of anti-racist pedagogy and their importance for training of practitioners.

67
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:29,480
Recognize how classroom practices are linked with historical and contemporary manifestations of racism.

68
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:38,690
Assess your own teaching practices with an anti-racist lens and apply the principles of anti-racist pedagogy to your future teaching practices.

69
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:44,840
Practically speaking, this resource has several modules and each one is intended to take about a week to move through.

70
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,110
Although you can take as much or little time as you need,

71
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:55,370
the course includes a variety of materials and resources designed to provide learners with multiple ways to learn and engage.

72
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,600
You'll need several things: a journal, an open mind,

73
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,470
at least one critical friend to have conversation with, and some time.

74
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:10,610
We estimate about 3 to 4 hours per module for video or lecture content, readings, questions and self assessments.

75
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,140
As part of this training module, you'll see interviews, conversations, videos, lectures and scenarios.

76
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:26,570
We have combined these different resources with readings, articles, blogs and podcasts in an effort to make the course accessible and useful for you.

77
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:34,430
All right, so who is this 'you'? You might be an educator, a public health leader, a faculty member in public health.

78
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,140
But you might be interested in this training, even if you're not directly teaching in public health.

79
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,890
Maybe you're involved in teaching or training in nursing, history of medicine, library sciences, or any related field.

80
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:52,280
You might be somebody who trains the health workforce through workshops or somebody who does formal classroom teaching.

81
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,810
As you move through this resource, you may have moments of discomfort, moments where you do not know the best step forward.

82
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,330
We invite you to accept and expect discomfort by way of these principles.

83
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:12,560
We are thrilled to have you here and we hope this resource is useful to you and your own journey towards anti-racist teaching.

84
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,880
Thank you for being here with us and with each other. Let's get started.
