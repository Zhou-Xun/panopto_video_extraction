1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:08,820
Thank you, Kuyda, for pointing out that the audio and Commander Garza's thing wasn't working in Panopto.

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:14,820
I figured out why, and I also figured out why she couldn't see us from the classroom.

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,080
And it's because I can't run Panopto and zoom at the same time.

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,989
So I have to end Panopto and then upload to the Zoom guest lecture as an entirely

5
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,490
separate file because only one can like dominate the meeting at all at a time.

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,190
So today we have again a guest lecturer in this section.

7
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,620
We'll do the first half hour and then Dr. Zhao, too, will do the last hour.

8
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:51,600
And hopefully there'll be no tech glitches. Yes, she hasn't sent me her PowerPoint yet, which is why it's not on canvas, because I think she has to,

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,610
like redact some photos and stuff, like some personal photos and stuff like that.

10
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,640
So when I get it, it will be on there.

11
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:06,419
Okay. So picking up where we left off last week, just as a reminder,

12
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,810
we talked about how the U.S. established this like tiered hospital system in response to Ebola.

13
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,280
So the first level is called essentially a frontline health care facility.

14
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,120
And this is your basic, very basic emergency room.

15
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:28,800
So anywhere that can quickly identify and isolate patients under investigation with Ebola or other highly infectious disease,

16
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,580
they can give notice to facility infection control.

17
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,790
They have enough PPE to provide at least half a day to a full day of high level care.

18
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,330
And if needed, they can prepare patients to transfer to a facility with higher level capabilities.

19
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,940
So, I mean, I'm sure you all maybe remember back when this was happening,

20
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:58,260
they would ask travel screening questions like, have you recently traveled to like, you know, Sierra Leone, etc.?

21
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,450
And then now even at the doctor's office, they still get questions about like, do you have a fever right now?

22
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,690
Etc., all that. So I would say, like your frontline health care facilities are kind of like,

23
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,870
I don't know, you're like you're Trinity Health slash Saint Joseph's of an arbor, right?

24
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,320
Then the next level, again, these are hospitals that already exist.

25
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,309
So they're just given these new names. So this is an Ebola assessment.

26
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:29,520
Hospital is the next here. So they can safely receive and isolate a patient under investigation,

27
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,660
but they're deemed to have higher capabilities than frontline health care facilities.

28
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:42,750
So they're able to provide lab testing and coordinate for highly infectious disease testing and can give patient care for up to four days.

29
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:50,490
So this includes evaluation and management and then if needed, they can transfer to another high level facility again.

30
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,239
Then we have like what we consider like the top tier, which is the ETS.

31
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,160
These are Ebola treatment centers and this one can actually safely receive and isolate

32
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,740
a confirmed Ebola patient and has enough PPE for at least seven days of care,

33
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,240
has a sustainable, well-trained staff, and can maintain several weeks of care.

34
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,950
And CDC experts are ready to deploy here if they need help.

35
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,260
So this is like a very makeshift, high level isolation room, for example.

36
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:30,240
So the Nebraska biocontainment was considered an Etsy and one of the PE, a couple of the patients they actually had there for over a month.

37
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,639
The patient was considered a dry patient, so not like hemorrhaging or vomiting or anything, but had to stay in quarantine.

38
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,100
So it was a very boring time for him. They actually like got him in here,

39
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:51,899
requested an exercise bike and then they had like a little basketball hoop thing for him to like play with and just kill time, essentially.

40
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,610
But they had enough PPE to maintain among a month's worth of care there.

41
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,860
Oh, okay. I had this little video I forgot to queue up, so let me see what commercial comes along with it.

42
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:13,500
Yes. How to safely transport. So that's a great question.

43
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,720
Air or ground? Both either.

44
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:27,629
Okay. So guest lecture notes, it's until the end of way, end of the semester when Dr. Gibbs talks about it.

45
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,220
But in terms of like it depends on the infectious disease.

46
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:38,850
So if we're using Ebola as an example to transport them in an ambulance cabin,

47
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:46,860
essentially you line the ambulance cabin with a bunch of plastic sheeting that you like taped together with duct tape,

48
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,450
because generally the back of the ambulance cabin doesn't have airflow in there.

49
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:58,649
So the person's driving in the front have their own air circulation and it's not like moving back and forth between the cabin.

50
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,690
So the people in the front are generally okay.

51
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:09,479
But the biocontainment unit, they still had the drivers suit up in a full like level C suit with powered air purifying respirator,

52
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,360
like impermeable chemical resistance suits, gloves, all that good stuff.

53
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:21,239
And so the patient is trans transferred on like a gurney or what they call it, Stryker cot,

54
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:28,170
which is just what you see in the back of like an ambulance, depending on if they're wet or dry.

55
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,360
If they're a wet patient and hemorrhagic,

56
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:39,030
sometimes they're hallucinating and then they might need to be like sedated because they wake up confused and might be like aggressive or volatile.

57
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:46,290
If they're wet, they're generally transferred in like an isolation pod that you see,

58
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,670
like in movies and stuff, and that sits on top of a gurney or the Stryker cot.

59
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,050
And then the personnel that are in the back with them are also wearing PPE.

60
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,570
And then when the patient is transferred, they usually get moved not to the main hospital doors,

61
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,630
right, but a side door because you don't want to scare a bunch of people.

62
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,190
And then the ambulance has to be decon decontaminated and all that.

63
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:19,170
And then if they're transferred via air, usually it's like the State Department or like the military that uses their assets to

64
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,370
transfer a person because Delta Airlines doesn't want to like pick this person up.

65
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:23,790
Right.

66
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:32,489
But the complicated thing is that when you pull a person out of the plane and you don't have like that like tube thing that connects to the walkway,

67
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,570
when you go in the terminal,

68
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:41,070
if you have stairs that you have to walk onto the tarmac for like technically those stairs belong to the airport or the airline.

69
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:49,650
So at Nebraska, they had this issue where none of the airlines wanted us to like use their like stairway.

70
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:57,430
So essentially like the the they had to back a truck, bed up to the airplane door,

71
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:02,660
put a striker cot on it, lower the patient on it, and then like slide the moth.

72
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,070
It's complicated, but obviously not as intense for like COVID, for example.

73
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:15,090
Like people are just like flying next to you on the plane when Doctor Gibbs gives his life gas, like she was off.

74
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,799
Like, a lot of cool pictures, hopefully. Okay, let's make sure this has sound.

75
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,670
So this is a Nebraska biocontainment unit video. Just a short.

76
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:34,240
Some. We were built in 2005 and dedicated by Julie Gerberding of the CDC.

77
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:43,450
We were designed originally to protect against agents of bioterrorism, like weaponized Ebola, weaponized plague, smallpox.

78
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,620
And we are geared up for that. Those are probably the worst diseases we've see.

79
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:53,440
But there's always something new like SaaS or avian flu, something that's got a high mortality rate.

80
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:14,200
What we've done. One. The other good afternoon Team Sport is a volunteer of the fire service who is one one small concept.

81
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:23,370
Same deal here. We are really lucky to have a resource in this hospital and in our community to help protect us.

82
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:29,650
Our biocontainment unit at the University Medical Center will help protect us against a variety of infections.

83
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:39,129
Really, there are two parts of what you need to protect yourselves and your employees, health care workers against a severe infection.

84
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:48,520
First of all, you need a special unit like this one. No special airflow, seamless joints, Pastor Autoclave, a high security entrance and so forth.

85
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,019
And then you need employees.

86
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:58,840
And we have very well-trained, experienced employees that go through hours and hours of extra training on how to put on this special gear.

87
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,129
So you have a nice facility, but you'll see when when people are walking around,

88
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,150
when we're activated or doing a drill, they have what we call the spacesuits.

89
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,240
It's a complete containment. So it's a special breathing apparatus.

90
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,320
And these are hot and they're heavy and it takes some experience to work with.

91
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,340
So we need the protection from both sides. We have a lot of people that come here from the state, from the region.

92
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:26,500
The military has come here and they are interested in what we're doing.

93
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,899
So I think the hospital is really at the cutting edge and helping to protect our nation

94
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,760
against either a naturally occurring infection or a possible bioterrorist event.

95
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,050
So that's Dr. Phil Smith. He used to be the medical director of the Nebraska biocontainment unit.

96
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:53,360
I actually my first publication ever was with him assigned to clean out his office when he retired as a grad assistant.

97
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:57,890
But so the Nebraska backed him in, as I mentioned,

98
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:04,670
was one of the three existing official high level isolation units before the CDC came in with this designation system.

99
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,550
So like Dr. Smith mentioned in the video,

100
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:14,780
like the the be you essentially it was established after 911 and there was concerns about anthrax and all of that.

101
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:22,690
And people thought he was totally crazy for having this concept because it was millions of dollars.

102
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:29,600
This is it, Nebraska medicine. So it is its own dedicated wing on like the seventh floor of one of the towers.

103
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,409
It has its own elevator specifically that goes there, its own air handling system.

104
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:44,820
We have double pass through autoclaves on site, which came really in handy during the whole Ebola waste decontamination.

105
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:58,130
But like it, a lot of people saw it as a money sink because they weren't seeing patients in there between 2006 when it was finished, 2014.

106
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,440
And it's not like it was sitting totally empty. Right. So you had staff from all over the hospital who volunteered to be part of that.

107
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,070
Maybe you kind of like how people wanted you to be part and be a mess.

108
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,840
So when it's time to do training or exercises, they're released from like cardiology,

109
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:21,380
pediatrics, OBGYN to partake in these quarterly exercises and do these exercises.

110
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,260
I also got to participate in some. I mean, it's nothing like super snazzy.

111
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,960
It just looks like a regular hospital wing, except it's empty.

112
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:39,770
And then when you come in, there's double locking doors and there is like a shower facility in the front of lockers and all that kind of stuff.

113
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,419
But now, you know, it's still functional.

114
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:53,230
But now the Bhaskar medicine has an entire new training facility that they built for like $20 million that Commander Garza showed you.

115
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,430
She did an exercise at that exercise zone where she was wearing the full suit just a few weeks ago.

116
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:05,090
So they've really become like a major hub for high level isolation unit activities.

117
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,240
I had another thought. It's gone.

118
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:22,360
It might come back. So at the highest level is the regional Ebola or other special pathogens, treatment centers, or r e.

119
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:32,130
S PTC, not R-E-S-P-E-C-T, but they are considered like the tippy top.

120
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,209
So you have your Etsy, which there used to be about 56 in the country.

121
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,230
There's less than that now because a lot of them didn't sustain their capabilities

122
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,780
after funding expired in 2020 or they just totally got steamrolled by COVID,

123
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:53,020
right? So in each of the ten Department of Health and Human Services Regions, as Commander Garza showed you,

124
00:12:54,010 --> 00:13:00,100
there's one hospital in each region that's designated as the regional center.

125
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:10,120
So they absolutely should be able to provide care for anything that is Ebola, but also hypothetically any other category, a pathogen.

126
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:24,100
So here in DHS, DHHS Region five, which is Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Ohio are regional center is in Minneapolis.

127
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:32,889
So if there was anybody here who had like, I don't know, like matchup virus and they didn't know how to treat it at this hospital,

128
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,310
they would have to ground transport that person to Minneapolis.

129
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:44,829
Yes, I remember my train of thought. Now, speaking of anthrax, this what I do for fun.

130
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:51,549
On the weekend, I watched the documentary on Netflix about the anthrax, like the shadow of the outbreak.

131
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,660
Have any of you seen it? It's on your list.

132
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,570
Okay. It's an hour and a half. Super interesting.

133
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:09,940
I think it ties into like what we talk about in this class about who actually mailed out those anthrax samples to everybody.

134
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,770
Spoiler alert, it wasn't terrorists, domestic terrorists,

135
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:24,040
but the people who died from anthrax were like front line workers, mostly black people who worked at the Postal Service.

136
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,330
So very interesting, like one and a half hour documentary on Netflix and say, check it out.

137
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,790
I usually don't like documentaries where they have actors who reenact things,

138
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:43,950
but they had Clark Gregg, who played Agent Coulson from Marvel as the main guy.

139
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:49,600
So and then. All right, so they recently changed their name to National.

140
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,560
It used to be national Ebola Specialist Treatments Training Center,

141
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,480
but now it's national emergency and merging special pathogens, training and Education Center.

142
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:04,420
I used to be a part of me tech, but not anymore since I left Nebraska Med.

143
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,870
So this is funded by the Department of Health and Human Services.

144
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:18,219
And if you check out their website, essentially now they serve as a repository for best practices and information regarding any special pathogens.

145
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:25,150
So it is led by Emory, Nebraska Med and the New York City hospital systems, Bellevue.

146
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:37,389
But if you look at the repository, you have like Dr. Sara Madad at New York City, for example, or very early on in the monkeypox outbreak starting,

147
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:42,220
she would give like very brief weekly briefs on like what's going on, what's the state of things.

148
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:48,210
They also have a ton of exercise materials on there, and their team was going around to visit, you know,

149
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:54,910
each of the 56 Z's doing site visits to give them like recommendations on how to improve and stuff.

150
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:03,040
So this money was given to them from Asper and it was set to expire in 2020, which everybody was really worried about.

151
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,660
But then COVID happened and they realized, Oh, we actually do need this gel.

152
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,940
So that's why they've shifted focus a bit, but I'm glad that they've maintained these capabilities.

153
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,360
So in terms of public health, infectious disease care could be capabilities and capacity here.

154
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,950
I'll just briefly go over this. We have obviously the CDC.

155
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,780
So this is our nat nation's premier public health agency.

156
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,600
And it used to be called like all these different things.

157
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:39,639
So it started out as a malaria control, you know, center, and then it slowly shifted to communicable diseases,

158
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,670
to just diseases in general, because now they also do chronic.

159
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:50,530
So they do focus generally on, like I said, occupational safety and health, foodborne pathogens,

160
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:56,200
environmental health, health promotion, injury prevention and of course, infectious diseases.

161
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:08,920
They do have a federal select agents program, but this is more geared towards clinical capabilities and laboratories that are trans testing or trans.

162
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,320
Special agents.

163
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:18,600
They have an import program, permit program, and they work with the Department of Agriculture to regulate agents like we've previously talked about,

164
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,420
but they have to address more than 400 diseases, health threats, conditions, etc.

165
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:29,550
Now, they don't have any regulatory power whatsoever. As we've seen over the COVID pandemic.

166
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:36,059
The best that they can do is essentially provide recommendations to the public.

167
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:42,090
And Dr. BIDDINGER talked about how complicated that was because sometimes like you want to be like, right?

168
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:48,510
Or do you want to be like get in front of things? And that's kind of like the balance that you have to strike, right?

169
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,390
So they do have a national center for emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.

170
00:17:54,390 --> 00:18:03,090
And their tagline is Protect people at home and around the world from infectious diseases ranging from A to Z, anthrax to the Zika.

171
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:11,340
So last year, they obviously tackled COVID, the ongoing Ebola outbreaks in the DRC and Guinea.

172
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,680
There's always foodborne and animal contact disease outbreaks.

173
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,660
They developed a mobile friendly app to simplify data collection in the field.

174
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,390
They continue to track antibiotic resistance. They continue to build up the laboratory response networks.

175
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:36,239
They developed an advanced mosquito trap trap, and they have a podcast, which I don't listen to it.

176
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,070
But if you want the ID podcast, it's also their journal.

177
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,190
So, you know, here are their general ID functions.

178
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,780
I would say a lot of that has been halted during COVID 19.

179
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,040
I said I would say their main function right now is to try to just get back.

180
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:01,530
Public trust is what they need to work on, but they're still doing all this other stuff in the background.

181
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:09,180
And then I won't we won't we don't need to talk about the public health surveys, because Commander Garza already talked about that.

182
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:18,169
Okay. Now I have 5 minutes to talk before Mac comes on. Okay, so I'm going to move on now.

183
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,230
We're going to talk about some other countries. So.

184
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:27,000
Let's talk about the European Network for highly infectious diseases or your own Ed.

185
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:35,740
So the predecessor for your own Ed was what we call unit, the European Network of Infectious Diseases.

186
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:48,430
So much of this information actually comes from the original neural net coordinator, Dr. Francesco Fusco, for the Italian New Age, essentially.

187
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:59,170
So this was a co-funded project from 2004 to 27 in response to 2001 anthrax attacks and then 2003 stars outbreak.

188
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,640
And you're like the European Union basically acknowledge, okay, yeah, we are.

189
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,470
There's more infectious disease outbreaks to come.

190
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,309
So at the same time that like Dr. Smith here in the United States and like Emory and NIH were like, oh,

191
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:16,990
we shouldn't really think like get this at the forefront of our minds as it's going to be an issue.

192
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,000
The European Union was also like, yes.

193
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:28,360
So the main aims of you need were to cooperate, communicate and exchange information on highly infectious diseases.

194
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:35,800
Among clinicians, epidemiologists, public health experts to enhance preparedness specifically in Europe.

195
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,820
So this was an agreement, first of all, on what is a highly infectious disease.

196
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,580
There is absolutely no universal definition.

197
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,580
So if you look at the United Nations website,

198
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,580
they will tell you something different than the World Health Organization than even here in the United States.

199
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:02,960
Here I use the term highly infectious diseases. Some people now use the term highly hazardous communicable diseases.

200
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:09,520
In Europe, they use a high pathogen, high consequence pathogen.

201
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:13,730
So it's like all over the map in terms of the terminology.

202
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,920
And when you did start it, they had 15 participating countries.

203
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,450
So you can see them on the map here again, mostly from the European Union.

204
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:32,390
They also defined what are the correct procedures for donning and doffing PPE with age AIDS.

205
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,129
So what ensemble will you wear? What order will you put things on?

206
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:41,060
Is a huge argument between people. Like Do the boots go on first?

207
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:45,950
Do the gloves go out first? Do we need duct tape? As you saw in the new video,

208
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:54,530
they use duct tape to seal the gloves to this suit so that there is no possibility of like liquid permeation or potential exposure.

209
00:21:54,890 --> 00:22:03,530
They also inventoried what all of the high level isolation units had and what their capabilities were for intensive care.

210
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:11,390
And they had expert consensus projects to develop recommendations like pool together their best practices, essentially.

211
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:18,590
So then in 2007, they continued and became your own NID.

212
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:27,470
So they're action items because the first few years were just kind of like establishing an inventory, building rapport.

213
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:36,080
Then they started doing actual field recommendations where they set up facilities as reference centers or target hospitals.

214
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:41,030
They developed checklists essentially to assess capabilities and policies,

215
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:47,990
and they went around doing needs assessments and filling out like grant proposals and stuff for affordable improvements.

216
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,000
So they did continue through 2010,

217
00:22:53,780 --> 00:23:02,750
and this consensus network can be seen as a form of primary prevention in terms of like getting ahead of potential threats.

218
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:10,240
They identified 48 facilities in 16 countries.

219
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:17,080
So up until 2014, the United States only had three designated HLA use.

220
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:22,690
So here we are in Europe now with 48 facilities across 16 countries.

221
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:28,570
Germany, which is like the size of Texas, basically had like eight or nine already.

222
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:35,470
And they they basically came up with this agreement that like every X amount of kilometers,

223
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:41,200
we will have a designated HLA U or we will like build and establish one.

224
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:49,630
And so these countries, because they are part of the EU, were able to like work together in this consortium,

225
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:59,080
which is really nice because we, we are all like part of the United States, but it's still extremely fragmented, I would say.

226
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:11,050
So you can see here, like serving the facilities among the target hospitals, like the percentage of which had facilities,

227
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:21,220
facility security or that restricted access, you know, and some of them only had facility security only.

228
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:29,590
Some of them only had restricted access. So they like really inventoried every facet of the hospitals.

229
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,130
Okay. I'll let me finish this slide. So there's strengths.

230
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:43,830
We're being proactive about head management, forming consensus guidelines, providing referral centers to the whole geographic region covered.

231
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:51,260
And the 20 facilities actually had a chance to deal with real cases and not just practice.

232
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,890
So they had multidrug resistant and extremely drug resistant tuberculosis.

233
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:05,400
They did have SaaS cases, Lassa, Crimean-Congo, hemorrhagic fever, hantavirus and Ebola and almost all of the facilities.

234
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:12,570
By the time the network ended in 2010, had experience with at least persons under investigation.

235
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:20,189
Okay. I will pause there. And now I know to close this.

236
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,890
We'll watch these videos Thursday. I will stop.
