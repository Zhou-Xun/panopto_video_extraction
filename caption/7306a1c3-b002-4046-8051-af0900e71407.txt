1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,950
First. So I'm going to warn you before I press record.

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,080
All right. So announcements for today.

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:26,989
So first tomorrow, there is a symposium and I am going to disclose my conflicts of interest is co-sponsored by the center that I am a co-director of.

4
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,080
And I've been working very hard on this symposium for a long time.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,440
And I'm driving the speakers around to dinner in their hotel tonight.

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,190
So very invested. So please come. I've got these people around and then nobody shows up for their talks.

7
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:48,170
It will be very sad. So tomorrow morning at 10 a.m., there's going to be a panel discussion here in this room.

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,809
The three speakers, one is going to be Dr. Arnold Macho, who's a faculty in our department.

9
00:00:53,810 --> 00:01:02,660
And very while he actually trained under Dr. Thomas Francis, very long history in vaccine research and in epidemiology.

10
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:11,030
We also have Dr. Kathy Neuzil, who's the director of a big vaccine research center at the University of Maryland.

11
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:17,300
It's very influential on the international stage in terms of what vaccines get to what populations and when.

12
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:30,350
And then the third speaker we have, and it's going to be Dr. Scott Hensley from Penn and he is a more of an immuno immunologist vaccinologist side.

13
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:35,929
[INAUDIBLE] be talking about some basic research and some immunologic complications and

14
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,520
ideas that you sometimes struggle with when you're doing vaccines that have repeat dosing.

15
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,690
So all very relevant topics for today.

16
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:53,140
Typhoid vaccine, so I'm pretty excited about. Then.

17
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,630
Yeah. It's in the afternoon. I think it's 130 maybe.

18
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:05,170
Yes. We have a of the three winners of a student speaker competition are going to be

19
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,300
believe also in this this room are going to be presenting their abstracts from this.

20
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:18,640
It's this is also a good way to think about the presentation assignment that I'm going to introduce later today.

21
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,840
After the lecture, seeing examples, they'll have very good examples of how to structure abstract presentation.

22
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:34,530
And then after those talks in 1020, which is the removal of five, six, five,

23
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,580
and for those of you that are in five, six, five, that's going to be the main event for tomorrow.

24
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,350
That's going to be the Thomas Francis Lectureship.

25
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:50,920
And so you are going to learn more about Dr. Francis's role in the polio vaccine, roll out the influenza.

26
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:59,379
He basically invented the influenza vaccine. And so it is a kind of a long history that too.

27
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,960
So we award the Francis Medal in the lectureship to a notable scientist.

28
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:12,880
It doesn't happen, I don't think, every year. So this year the awardee is Jonathan Van-Tam.

29
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,620
It's a third. Recently knighted.

30
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:22,740
He's kind of the grouchy of the U.K., but with like a way better YouTube presence.

31
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,360
He's a very gregarious and, like, big, big personality.

32
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:40,440
And so I definitely urge you to come to the talk in the reception tomorrow evening for the Francis symposium,

33
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:48,240
and then also to see some of the like clip shows that the British press put together when

34
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,070
he stepped down from his position because he was very he was much loved and respected.

35
00:03:53,230 --> 00:04:00,299
So. That's the first announcement. Second announcements by the boosters.

36
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,629
We're about to talk about the Bible. And these stories are today's hot topics.

37
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,420
But don't let me forget that there is a so I have got an inside the inside scoop

38
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:15,629
that the flu pap a walk in vaccine clinic that that I think it's have mojo I think

39
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:24,630
it's now until 1230 they they have 300 doses of the baby booster in stock so looking

40
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,230
for it if you decide you get it after it's not required as part of the birthing,

41
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,120
you make your own decision. I've heard that they've got it in stock there.

42
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,010
So if you disappear because you're going to find it, I won't hold it against you.

43
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,350
I'm going to go after. So with me. All right.

44
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,330
No cursor. All right. Some students in the class.

45
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:56,780
Oh, and because I'm still learning everybody in phases, it takes me a little bit longer with the masks then,

46
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:06,420
you know, you're just kind of all blending in for me, so that's okay. So if you are newly joining us, I think read the articles up until today.

47
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,440
Don't worry about making up the workshop from last week.

48
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,770
It's something that is going to be a bit challenging to do on your own compared to.

49
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,069
So I think that one, if you just I know I can tell when people register for the class.

50
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,170
So if you really joined us.

51
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:29,080
Start with shop as your kind of turn in work and then let me know if I need to kind of give you more housekeeping operational updates.

52
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,090
Okay. There are a lot of announcements today and those are announcements.

53
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:41,140
Great. Hot topics. Okay. So first first hot topic.

54
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:49,000
And I have before we get into talking about the HIPAA and virus from last week,

55
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:54,280
we had a controversy break out and the this is the first time I've ever had a controversy on the two vampires

56
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:02,079
article break out last week about whether or not the virus retains its tail when it enters the cell.

57
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,100
I believe the groups are split 5050, whether or not the virus retains the tail.

58
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,749
And I have to say my to do list when I remind myself to go back and look at this kind of looks like

59
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:18,010
a child a children's book throughout the week like did you find virus keep its tail story one thing

60
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:27,760
is okay so I so I read this again and looked at the figures again and this is what I believe happened

61
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
so I'm going to the two man virus does not lose its tail and for people who are new to the class,

62
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,180
this is just an exercise in reading the literature, understanding how to find structural elements of a virus and why I'm not going to test you.

63
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,660
Ask you questions about two bad viruses out. Oh, but.

64
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,910
Yeah. Absorbed into that pocket.

65
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,750
What is? Uh.

66
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:13,580
So. I've said that that also has a healing feel to it.

67
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:24,290
Both of these separately released their contents. So if there's an inner lipid membrane that.

68
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:48,490
The official the official judges calls that I'm making is that the two hand does not lose its heel,

69
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,830
that both the caps had passed the local part and the Taylors independently releasing.

70
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,970
I want still attached. So. All right.

71
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,810
So Newbury, what made it a hot topic because it was a source of debate.

72
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:13,270
If anybody wants to debate. All right.

73
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,970
Let's jump to a Skype meeting. Is the.

74
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,450
Chatter, chatter in the news a little bit.

75
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,970
So did anybody watch these watch things?

76
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,250
Let's see. Okay, so.

77
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,360
It's. A couple of the like big points of conversation.

78
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,290
I mean, it sort of running through some of the big themes that emerge and and then we can

79
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:53,170
kind of discuss or definitely interrupt me with questions or thoughts that you have.

80
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,390
So one of the big things I think to remember is that.

81
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:09,520
Bivalent vaccines there. So this is a presentation that was shown during the meeting that I'm going to pull

82
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:16,660
a few slides from with these vaccines that they are giving on top of the COVID.

83
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,889
Web series in order to fit what they did.

84
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,129
You know that they're more reactor genic.

85
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:35,960
And we've had than we have for most of the vaccines. It's sort of similar to the shingles vaccine in terms of I hear a lot about the

86
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,310
reactions that people have afterwards in terms of fatigue or that kind of fever,

87
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:53,089
that sort of thing. Speaking of. And so there is not a lot of people hesitant to add more antigen content to the vaccine.

88
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:58,850
They don't want to add more quantity to the vaccine at this point in time because is concerned the higher you go with the dose,

89
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:06,080
the more the side effects are going to go up. And so with the Bivalent vaccine to add to strains into there,

90
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,240
now what we do with the flu vaccine because we don't we haven't had that problem with the way the flu vaccine is made.

91
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,989
We just keep adding strains. It's like three strains, four strains.

92
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,729
There isn't really a meaningful difference in the quality of antigen because of the way the flu vaccines work.

93
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:25,580
It's not an everyday vaccine in MMR. Any vaccine dose seems to matter for side effects.

94
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:38,010
It's kind of been the dose and they split in half. So the Bivalent vaccines are including half of this,

95
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:46,880
half of the quantity that's going to be half the micrograms of the ancestral or original strain that still nobody has a good name for both relative.

96
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:55,930
Yeah. There's. Then half of the energy content is going to be this new spike protein.

97
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:00,450
And remember, I think I mentioned this last week, this is a US formulation of a vaccines.

98
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,140
This is not what they're doing internationally. I think they're not entirely settled.

99
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:17,749
So. So this is split in half. Now there's some debate as to what how is that going to change?

100
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:23,510
Immunogenicity. Like how well the target works if the quantity of the target drops down like this.

101
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:30,440
However, it's sort of suspected that the other vaccines.

102
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:41,810
Puts your immune system on alert. So it could be just delivering a total of 30 micrograms or 50 micrograms.

103
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,190
Gets your immune system reactive, reacting to whatever's been delivered.

104
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:56,200
So. People need to keep in mind as we're sort of evaluating that effectiveness.

105
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:03,850
And a lot of people actually have a conversation with a reporter right after the conference.

106
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:09,999
Well, after this class. And there are so many questions about why don't we just adenoviruses the RNA vaccine?

107
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,930
Because every time we get a virus, we have. With where we are right now from a regulatory perspective.

108
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,900
And so it gets it gets tricky to start adding on subject.

109
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:33,320
So the the where is it you see FDA everybody is trying to move towards is you know here is where we are now if you're between five and 49.

110
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:43,310
I'm pragmatist, which is a very common vaccine vaccine recommendation schedule.

111
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,410
And then 50 and older have gotten prime prime boosters.

112
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,930
And so I've actually gotten a prime prime prime boost,

113
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,010
but and maybe even two boosters after that and the differences between the light green and that.

114
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:09,060
Or in those various vaccines spot where this wrong is here, where if you've never been vaccinated,

115
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:17,340
we give you two doses right now of the original formulation of the vaccine and then you boost with whatever is correct.

116
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:25,470
So you sort it as a starter package that everybody gets, but then you boost with whatever is the current, the current formulation that's circulating.

117
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:32,880
And when determining whether somebody is up to date on their vaccination or not becomes about

118
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:41,100
how long ago was your most recent booster and not how many doses did you get in between?

119
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:52,640
Right. Have you had. So now you were I think this happened after you would have all been toddlers.

120
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:58,040
But when we vaccinate an infant or a toddler against flu, they get two doses that first season.

121
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:05,810
And actually with flu, we know from previous research that it doesn't actually really matter what those two doses are,

122
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,910
as long as they've had the most recent strain before the season hits.

123
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,560
So you can actually give them the starter doses in the spring with last year's flu vaccine and have them ready for the fall.

124
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:27,710
So it's similar to that. You have the starter packages. But so this is actually, you know.

125
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,320
This is to authorize the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine based on safety and effectiveness.

126
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:43,420
The role of ACP and CDC is to weigh in on how it should be used and whether we're going to recommend it and we're going to recommend it.

127
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,860
It seems like kind of this soft, like recommend.

128
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:57,400
But in reality, the ACP recommendation also influences what the insurance companies pay for and what vaccines for children are publicly financed.

129
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:10,000
Childhood Vaccination Program What That Covers. So you have to have the ACP on board with a recommendation before you can go forward.

130
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,800
Reality of the US vaccine market hinges on ACP, even though FDA is fully authorized.

131
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:28,720
So the first we voted on 12 years and older with with the Pfizer got a recommended

132
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,550
12 years and older at least two months after the receipt of a primary series.

133
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:46,510
Now, this is like from a policy perspective, this is the sticky this is the spicy meatball on the bottom of Roberts, the chief health.

134
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,480
I don't know that we're going to be causing spicy meatballs.

135
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,600
This is the spice. People actually repealed the recommendation for receiving.

136
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,580
So they said they didn't say, just use up what you have and then switch when it's time.

137
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,399
They were like, No, you cannot use you cannot use your own boost your own boosters anymore.

138
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:13,010
So all the clinics they had back to school vaccine schedule, they all had to go and cancel them all yesterday.

139
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:16,280
Right. Because they repealed the recommendation.

140
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,790
Super trendy. If.

141
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,600
Like you wouldn't give somebody last year's flu vaccine doesn't make any sense.

142
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,130
So we don't want to give somebody last year's COVID vaccine.

143
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,940
However, the flu, we usually get a breather space in between the two.

144
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,990
We don't have to get into horses midstream like we're having to do so.

145
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:51,090
And then with Moderna that Moderna has been going to the FDA with products only at 18/1 and then they drop the age gradually.

146
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,260
It's sort of a different marketing and regulatory strategy of the two companies.

147
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,290
So Pfizer went 12 and 12 and moved there.

148
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,930
I went to the FDA with 18. So if you are in the 12 to 7.

149
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:15,190
We received Pfizer at this point for the. So this was really an important vote.

150
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:23,320
This was the meat of a thing. So you know that they had votes to recommend the two, but then going forward.

151
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,210
In this message. So are we really just going to focus on the flu strategy,

152
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,160
the prime time and then getting a booster in your we're paying attention to what you're supposed to us.

153
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:48,020
And if you notice how the White House and virtually and all of the talking heads in the various

154
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:54,890
public communication spaces the next day started positioning the COVID vaccine like the flu to say,

155
00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:01,340
now we're in annual vaccine territory and we're going to just tell you what vaccine you get.

156
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,230
So that's sort of where the story left off as of yesterday.

157
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,990
So you may have. Students.

158
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,140
I have thoughts and questions open, but I thought it was.

159
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:33,280
Oh, it does mutate fast. It appears it's changing faster than flu.

160
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,420
For two weeks, actually, we're going to talk about mutation rates today. So excellent.

161
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,690
Excellent. And high.

162
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:48,210
But by. I mean,

163
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,860
look back at the way that we thought about flu vaccine strategy for a long time as we

164
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,370
look at other parts of the world and surveillance systems to see what's spreading.

165
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:00,319
And then we make a flu vaccine that matches that and it usually gets a southern hemisphere.

166
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,440
Then the northern summer in the north is very predictable.

167
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,910
So. Well happens at the same time.

168
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:14,850
So we can't look at South Africa, for instance, which has a very advanced surveillance system and say, okay, we need a.

169
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,450
Now, that being said, with the money, they got this vaccine ready. The baby already like three months.

170
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:26,309
So it's pretty fast flu. The core?

171
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,320
I don't know. So I don't know where in the slides this came up.

172
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:38,870
The core goal of the study is different than we've traditionally thought about the food strategy in terms of what our goals are for the Indian system.

173
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:45,620
Where are the flu? It was like, let's get you, let's get you the exact virus that we predict is going to affect you.

174
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:51,370
So that's like the last three years, like that outbreak on campus that happened last fall is exactly,

175
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,080
you know, we like got everybody vaccinated and then it was the wrong street runs.

176
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:04,520
You talk about that in The New York Times, but for Kobe.

177
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:11,390
You. I was at work. So the strategy really is.

178
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,959
But. You'll see this.

179
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,320
When we do the immunology stuff, there'll be some stuff you'll get introduced to.

180
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:25,710
But when we give the immune system the same exposure over and over, over again, the vaccine exposure your immune system gets.

181
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:37,790
Slightly different versions of the virus like. Maybe I'm looking for justice straight.

182
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:43,250
And so the goal is to move in like this two dimensional,

183
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:49,320
three dimensional space energetically so that your body gets used to recognizing different versions.

184
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:57,050
And so, like, I sort of agree with that. Me.

185
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:06,069
Earlier what Dr. Walensky and the CDC said she's been very on message was saying get a booster because it broadens

186
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:12,700
your immune it doesn't say it protects you against by five because most people it brought your immune protection.

187
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:22,660
It kind of helps. So this.

188
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:28,240
Everybody get their flu vaccine and their. At the same time, like this week.

189
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:39,450
As a public, if you're in charge of a public health department, raise your hands if you would go with that strategy.

190
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,210
Oh, your clinics just to start co-administration. You didn't think she would.

191
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,670
So whatever you like, raise your hand if you go with the strategy.

192
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:55,340
Raise your hand if you would not go with the strategy and just offer the deal right now.

193
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:27,640
Their maternity unit units. I.

194
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:39,320
Labeling the vials in a way like if you're running a clinic, you.

195
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,090
And one vile to the unborn, one vile to be.

196
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:52,520
Right. And they're not, you know, they haven't really. So if there's a stepping back, you make the vaccine and then it goes to fill in facts.

197
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,959
So there's a fill and finish concerned with what the vaccine will be.

198
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:10,380
Different colors. There are other big issues. Like I am giving you the neon orange back for today.

199
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,700
Yeah, absolutely. Um, any other thoughts or concerns?

200
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:41,800
When I. And it may also make it difficult to say like, oh, these side effects are from the COVID vaccine.

201
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:51,530
We said a little bit, some people get flu like symptoms. Oh, but you're right.

202
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:59,420
So I think from a a acceptability perspective, there may be.

203
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:05,100
Although, you know, remember how many vaccines kids get at once. You.

204
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:09,320
With this there is this public perception, especially with.

205
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:17,130
EMMA Any vaccine being more reactive? Genic You know, like, I wouldn't give somebody of shingles vaccine or any vaccines.

206
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:26,330
Uh oh. I was just going to also say tracking adverse reactions, especially in severe reactions.

207
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:42,730
She had bruises. Challenging for like the DC system.

208
00:24:49,810 --> 00:25:10,370
I. You know, the missed opportunity is the most.

209
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,490
You have the opportunity to vaccinate somebody, you do it.

210
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:19,850
And even if the schedule's not quite right or you're not sure if they're going to come back for the next dose or,

211
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:27,700
you know, something like that, you always take the opportunity vaccinate. This has been a huge debate in the flu vaccine world, though.

212
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:34,010
It's just started happening with when they started researching the RSV vaccine even before COVID.

213
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:41,870
And so did anybody else have any thoughts for a lot of that stuff?

214
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,910
Let's go. One, two, three, four, five.

215
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:54,230
I hope your knees are down 70. So.

216
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,430
Oh, Chelsea. Chelsea. So let's see. Jackie, do it.

217
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:10,340
All right. Did I get everybody? Okay, let's go. In that order. I just.

218
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:27,870
All right, my producer and I. Yeah, that that's an excellent point.

219
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:36,690
So part of the play for the stakeholder in this conversation is the fact that the pharmacies make buckets of money when it's.

220
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:43,410
And they want for their business reasons to make sure that bucket of money happens at the best time of year for them.

221
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:47,219
Right. And then necessarily like. Right.

222
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:53,610
That's why there you see like some there's been some years when they were like, it's July perfect time for your flu vaccine.

223
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:06,440
The. And so together, incentivization through market forces is really interesting.

224
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,960
Yeah. As an assistant somewhere. I also got my boots.

225
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:18,139
I wasn't initially getting the flu shot today, but. Like that.

226
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:35,690
We're just going through the by the window. Yeah.

227
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,630
Yeah. It's going to be a thing.

228
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,430
Yeah. My main thing was like accessibility.

229
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:54,640
Like, a lot of, like, especially like rural places don't really have a really good accessibility to things like the vaccine.

230
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:04,170
That's obviously like. More like. Yeah.

231
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,900
Oh, get vaccinated if they only have to do that once versus three.

232
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,299
I didn't do that.

233
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:27,080
And so, like, I feel like living in a city like Ann Arbor, you have like this like privilege that it's like here, but like not everyone has that.

234
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:37,430
Yeah. Yes. I think that for me also brings up this idea of the public south public health clinic in these rural areas who, you know, the flu vaccine.

235
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,249
The vaccine are stored and dosed very differently, too.

236
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:47,680
And so it's a lot it is a lot of get a raise we have to that has to match with resources.

237
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:55,470
Yeah the point. Return to a.S.A.P.

238
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:12,580
But. It was a weird time of year for that to happen.

239
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,010
And I totally agree with you. Like, there's. I can see why they did it.

240
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:21,370
And I could see why the FDA probably pushed for that to happen. But like,

241
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:25,420
it's a weird it's a weird time of year for that because we know that three boosters

242
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:31,780
or three three doses are far more effective against any time the two doses.

243
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:38,500
So we know that two dose people are remain less protected, even if compared to the people that got an orchestra.

244
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,840
It's. There wasn't really a good answer.

245
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:53,040
She. I.

246
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:25,890
How? Well, then this actually might be detrimental because people are not certain.

247
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:39,910
What do you think you can do with beachfront flip flopping? Whether you like it or not, there's really real.

248
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:51,760
So, you know, it's just going to be like, okay, you know, I don't trust the.

249
00:30:54,810 --> 00:31:00,030
Sure. And it is that whole team, too. So it's like, you know, it actually, you know,

250
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:07,620
this whole I think the fruit of it in 2021 is a good example for I for the first little while they said please stagger them.

251
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,010
But then very quickly they reversed that. But that didn't come down through.

252
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,870
You know, it's very hard for people to stay off of another thing in the general public.

253
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:20,010
Yeah. You know, like providers like. I don't think that.

254
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:41,220
OPEC is, you know, the light. Um.

255
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:57,530
Did you watch the meeting? No. This week that we have very we have what I would add where I sort of think some of the disconnect is this fact is,

256
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:03,500
is that we've made the FDA very happy when either we tell you we've always televised them,

257
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:10,850
either on webcasts or on C-SPAN or whatever, but they have to be very technical discussions.

258
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,270
It is, but there's not an interpretation for the public.

259
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:22,060
And so they happened in this very, very technical space by very technical people in a way that's inaccessible,

260
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:26,000
not because it's like it's it's viewable with everybody, but it's a.

261
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:47,060
You agree with you on that? As you look at the COVID vaccine and they flu vaccine.

262
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,720
And then they told their friends or they died giving back.

263
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:05,790
Yeah. The seeds of that innocence.

264
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:11,610
Like, remember that time that they died after she tried to let her. Oh, yeah.

265
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:16,689
No, I think that I think that hesitancy, that's a challenge.

266
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:19,780
And then we also have this very reactive organic product.

267
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:25,470
Right? And so they they create this kind of perfect storm of inertia.

268
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:33,819
You know, you're going to talk more about what that post-vaccine reaction where that comes from,

269
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,810
too, because what you just had to sort of see where that how you.

270
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:50,250
I promise I'll get it back to orange. My concern is the flu vaccine.

271
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,890
In a normal year.

272
00:33:53,040 --> 00:34:02,549
I think, you know, the best time to get your flu vaccine is in October, maybe early November, because you the flu vaccine wanes like the protection.

273
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:06,330
Your antibodies will go down and it does not create very durable protection.

274
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,440
So the two reasons we have an annual flu vaccine campaign.

275
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:15,300
One is because we got to switch up the strain pretty often, but second is because the antibody production will decline over the year.

276
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:29,459
So. High dose optimally for COVID and for flu at the same time seems very challenging it seems is his right now right

277
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:38,730
now is a bit early unless you're living on a college campus right now is a bit early to get a flu flu vaccine in.

278
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:47,379
Right. RSV season happens at completely the wrong time. It so happened.

279
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,960
It was the one time of year. We don't know when that is going to be the.

280
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,499
See everybody right now because they're being recommending a vote.

281
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,180
And the flu season waits until April again like it did last year.

282
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:09,120
Then we're going to have people that are so far out from their flu vaccine dose before they are exposed to the flu.

283
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,300
So it's very it's super tricky. It's another one of those situations where there really aren't any good answers.

284
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:22,110
Like our whole old system is not really handling the all of the disruption the flu has had.

285
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:25,950
Now, Australia just had a flu season that was early for that.

286
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:33,870
So maybe we're having an early maybe even a flu in November, in which case I will be glad that everybody went and got their flu vaccines in September.

287
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:40,470
So it's really hard to tell if we're kind of in this really very disrupted system right now.

288
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:47,290
Okay. Parting thoughts.

289
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:59,000
The lecture, everybody. Last lecture. Look, I've got a lecture somewhere.

290
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:03,500
Anybody asks what you do. And embryology. She doesn't even lecture.

291
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:09,190
Then I go to. All right.

292
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:21,460
About the molecular clock and viral diversity is a is a setup for talking about the group on paper and getting it.

293
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:25,350
You're going to actually recognize a lot of the things that we've sort of talked about today,

294
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:28,969
which is this idea of like teasing the virus with the vaccine and how why.

295
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:34,549
That's a challenging. Use that term.

296
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:38,660
I'm referring to timescales for measuring virus evolution.

297
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:49,430
And these timescales are coming from the approximately constant rate of nucleotide or amino acid fixation.

298
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:57,680
So the these we are working from the assumption that a virus is changing at a predictable rate of time.

299
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,390
Predictable number of changes are happening per every replication cycle.

300
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:11,480
And that replication cycle then translates into transmission patterns and transmission events, which can then be translated on a population scale.

301
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,600
So if we can understand all of those layers,

302
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:22,160
then we can use the sequence of a virus in how much it is changed from time to time to understand kind of where it's spreading.

303
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:30,460
And concepts from phylogenetic trees.

304
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:36,969
So just sort of this quick, uh, phylogenetic tree crash course.

305
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:46,150
This is a habit. These are, these are sequences from a hepatitis C virus outbreak that happens in a hemodialysis clinic.

306
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:52,990
And they sequenced a whole bunch of stuff from various places,

307
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:59,770
actually was a series above was it was a series of outbreaks they eventually found once they did all the sequencing.

308
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:11,110
But by looking at the genetic clustering, you can look to see which are which patients essentially had viruses that were related to each other.

309
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,070
And you can also see right here, cluster three is all green.

310
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:23,440
All of these patients are they hemodialysis clinic were related to each other and not related to any other comparison community sequences.

311
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:30,760
But if you look, for instance, you know, you've got this closer relationship here in this red cluster between community and the outbreak.

312
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:40,060
Right here, you have this real intermixing pattern in your own sequences between what they got and what the community had.

313
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:45,069
So here is clearly this looks like a point source outbreak right here, there, here.

314
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:50,530
This looks like the this green looks like the introduction of the virus into a clinic that caused a bunch of infections.

315
00:38:51,100 --> 00:39:00,719
This right here, this is a bit messier. Right. So you can also use these types of analyzes, though,

316
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:07,740
on a broader population scale to make bigger inferences about how a virus has moved like really worldwide.

317
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,180
This is.

318
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:21,630
Justin Bieber's specifically about HIV and sequencing and how we can use sequencing to understand a different kind of origin stories behind HIV.

319
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:34,330
But if you look here. Different viruses appearing in different places.

320
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:41,080
And you see kind of when the the molecular clock pegs that event to have occurred in nature,

321
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:51,190
then we can kind of compare with where it came and in which places were where emergence happened before other places.

322
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:00,880
We're going to this is a this is an exercise that I always kind of position with caution

323
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:04,959
because remember and we're going to have this conversation a lot during this lecture,

324
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,370
but you can only make inferences about sequences that you put into your model.

325
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,639
Right? If you're not looking at other places, there may have been, you know, other sequences that have contributed.

326
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:24,190
So but this is the type of exercise that is done when we try to look at kind of where spread has gone internationally.

327
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,540
You've seen some of that theme come out in the paper that you wrote for today.

328
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:36,969
So but I'm going to a parking lot the the kind of origin and emergence of HIV into into a difference.

329
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:44,280
We're going to talk about this in more detail with some more that is a little bit later since we've done this.

330
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:51,090
Actually, this is a very recent paper. This is these red sequences.

331
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:58,180
These are sequences from the U of M student population on campus in fall of 2020.

332
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:06,070
So we use the C and all of the sequences that we can get from Washtenaw County to figure out the debate at the time and still is.

333
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:10,150
To what degree do student outbreaks, seed outbreaks in the community, you know,

334
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,870
are student outbreaks causing the elementary schools to close because there are so many students and they only you know,

335
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:24,650
they're only four blocks from the elementary schools. So what we did was and this is was led by we had a Maureen's group,

336
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:35,799
the look at the read sequences here and we basically look do these phylogenetic trees to see whether those

337
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:42,940
red sequences were sort of precursors to later sequences based on their evolution in the community.

338
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:49,899
So does it look like sequences in the community have evolved using their molecular clock from a starting sequence?

339
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,680
That was a student sequence. There were most of them were not.

340
00:41:53,680 --> 00:42:03,010
See, most of these red dots are dead ends. But there are some cases right here, for instance, where a red dot results in blue dots.

341
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,770
So results in more sequences in sequence in the community that look to be related to come from that sequence.

342
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,870
And really that was specific to the really huge cluster.

343
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:22,480
So if there was a sequence cluster that was 70 fives related or 100 related, then we would start to see community sequences, really.

344
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:31,970
An example of how this can be used. Where does this diversity come from?

345
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:36,700
So mutations, they arise from errors in the RNA or DNA polarized.

346
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,080
The errors themselves happen regardless of fitness.

347
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:50,700
This is something that's very important in the public dialog about variance and emergence and change, because viruses don't have intent there.

348
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,970
They are evolving in a certain way and purpose.

349
00:42:55,330 --> 00:43:03,220
You know, they are becoming airborne or becoming G.I. or becoming whatever, you know, in an attempt to evade it.

350
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:07,750
It's that these errors are products of these errors.

351
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:16,390
They may not survive or they may survive. And most errors that are made do not produce a viable virus.

352
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,120
It's those ones that do survive that end up becoming a found experience.

353
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:30,070
And we're going to have a whole lecture on how viruses as a whole emerge, how we go from errors and changes into an emergence of that.

354
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:35,229
But it's important to remember that there's not necessarily a directionality.

355
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:42,700
Viruses are pushed towards one thing or another. This is a rotation, especially when you talk about changes in mode of transmission.

356
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,400
So if you have, for instance,

357
00:43:45,400 --> 00:44:00,130
a virus that is a what example do we have a virus that requires very like context transmission, like fomite transmission.

358
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:05,290
And then there's often this talked about Ebola as a good example, that there's this talk of, well,

359
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:16,180
what if it goes airborne and that this sort of this implication that the virus is being pushed towards this other mode of transmission?

360
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,549
That's not really what happens. What happens.

361
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:27,400
It would be a random event in this here making thing that would create a successful progeny variant that would then start to replicate in any way.

362
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,700
You need a lot of other kind of pieces of the puzzle for it to really take off.

363
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:39,670
So that's where mutation diversity happens from the errors in the RNA polymerase, or it can happen through recombination.

364
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:43,670
We're going to talk in a moment. A lot of these.

365
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:51,490
So further mutation rate. When we think about the mutation rate, we can think about this on the individual scale.

366
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:56,120
And by this, I mean the individual variant or the individual cells.

367
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:02,400
So the number of mutations per nucleotide in the genome per cell that's infected.

368
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:07,120
So how many mutations are being made just in that single cell replication event?

369
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:16,730
We can also talk about it on the population scale. So how many mutations are we seeing per size of the genome per year in the population?

370
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:24,190
So that second example of HIV, that's the kind of calculation they're doing is how much change are we seeing in the viral population per year?

371
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:34,840
For the population scale, we have to think about, you know, things like natural selection is going to impact the fitness transmission dynamics,

372
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:41,290
population dynamics, how much people are changing their behavior and thus changing transmission patterns.

373
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:45,610
There's a lot that goes in a lot of assumptions that go into this population scale metrics.

374
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:52,700
But as I mentioned, mutations can be beneficial, deleterious or neutral.

375
00:45:53,750 --> 00:46:06,950
Mutations in Noncoding regions are are broadly viewed to be neutral that there is there is debate about that, but broadly deemed to be neutral.

376
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:10,850
However, non-coding regions and viruses are often uncommon.

377
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,989
We do sometimes see this in very large DNA.

378
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:26,660
Viruses like herpes simplex viruses have non-coding regions in it, but it's suspected that even non-coding regions have some structural functions in.

379
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:43,739
Iris in a situation where there is a constant mutation rate, this means that the viral each viral infection,

380
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:47,460
each infection in a person is actually a population of viruses.

381
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,150
Because you're having mutations happen in each of these cells with those replication events.

382
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:56,910
So you can think of every person as their own ecology and many, many viruses.

383
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:59,220
Right. Because they're all. You're producing many of these.

384
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:12,440
As the virus replicates in your own as a host, as an individual host, however, when you transmit to another person, you're only transmitting.

385
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:17,790
What's in your host to become the founding viruses in that host?

386
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,520
I'm not going to give you all of my viruses.

387
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:25,560
I'm just going to give you whatever viruses are contained in this bit of snot that makes it familiar to you.

388
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:29,400
Right. And so that transmission.

389
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:40,830
Diversity. That is part of the transmission. And then once it gets to the new person, the diversity is going to increase back again.

390
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:45,270
Right. Only a few viruses are going to make it from me to the person that is infected by me.

391
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,610
And then they're going to have their own replication instead of mutation events and create their own population.

392
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:58,020
This is referred to as information bottleneck. How many viruses make it from one host to another?

393
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:06,210
It's what we call the bottleneck, and the bottleneck changes based on how transmission works.

394
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:10,290
So the bottleneck virus is not it's different.

395
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:18,840
It's specific to that virus. So the bottleneck that the real definitions of rapid represents the number of genetically distinct variants,

396
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:23,130
the degree of diversity that is transmitted during one single transmission event.

397
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:27,360
So bottlenecks can be wide, bottlenecks can be very narrow. You can do a lot.

398
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:32,070
You can move a lot of genetically distinct variants. You can move very few.

399
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:37,260
What are some things you can do as we sort of think about this kind of broaden our frame

400
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:41,400
to epidemiology as a whole as we think about the idea of transmission between hosts.

401
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:46,830
What are some things that could impact the size of the bottleneck that are sort of beyond the virus itself?

402
00:48:46,830 --> 00:49:03,319
But we think about how transmission. So an individual's immune system could both on how much is blocked on their hands,

403
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,860
but then how much how much they have viral control and the whole state.

404
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:11,890
So somebody has very low viral control. Then they've got more virus to sort of.

405
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,630
Oh, yes. Tell me more about. Someone.

406
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:39,360
Oh, yeah. Yes, that's a big yes.

407
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:44,260
So I think you add these pieces together and they all sort of work together to make your own.

408
00:49:48,100 --> 00:50:04,550
But the. An idea and move it into kind of more of this mode of transmission frame, too.

409
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:11,170
So, for instance, HIV is infectious enough that it can spread as part of one sexual contact.

410
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:18,400
So HIV has a very narrow bottleneck because it's really just like this kind of one transmission and it's happening.

411
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:26,260
But if we want to take the all the other side of the comparison and talk about and talk about

412
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:34,780
vertical transmissions of hearing needle exposure so the exposure of an infant while in utero,

413
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:42,620
that's going to be a very. But you can. I'm a mother.

414
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:48,050
Had a suitable viral load. Then you can have a very wide.

415
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:00,370
So the virulence of this, yes, it does work that way.

416
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:06,660
It works that way because if you don't need many of your viruses to start an infection,

417
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,370
then not many viruses are going to be transmitted and average infection.

418
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:14,790
So hepatitis is a good example.

419
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:30,420
You only need a few virions, so you're not going to have very big. From mutation to talking about recombination.

420
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:36,510
So recombination requires the co-infections of two different variants into a single cell.

421
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:43,860
So recombination means that we are combining pieces of multiple virions genomes into a single genome.

422
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:51,560
So in this example, I've got a blue virus, I've got orange virus, and working together they make blue orange virus.

423
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:55,590
So I've got some of the orange genome and some of the blue genome.

424
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:58,760
Actually, I think I probably originally intended this to be made simpler.

425
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,090
So we've got like Wolverine Virus in the bottom. It's got some of the males and some of the blue.

426
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:08,560
So. It's at the same time.

427
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:13,570
So it means two virions with different sequences have to enter the same cell.

428
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:20,559
This is more complicated than it seems. So for DNA viruses, recombination itself,

429
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:28,290
the combining of the two genomes is likely to occur similar to other DNA recombination processes that we see in other parts of nature.

430
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,960
So see breaking and rejoining of strands from different viruses.

431
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:38,139
For RNA viruses, though, we will often see what's called copy choice.

432
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:42,450
Recombination. What copies? Good.

433
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:52,000
I'm here. Well, cockpit voice recovered. And I've got the green virus right here.

434
00:52:53,170 --> 00:53:06,910
And my new virus, the polymer. You know, and then start speaking to the virus.

435
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:14,210
That's a copy Chaser combination, looks like. Oh.

436
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:21,290
Your other option, if you're already a virus undergoing recombination, is to do reassortment.

437
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:30,479
And reassortment is when we've got two variants that each have multiple segments of genomes and we mix up the segments between the variants.

438
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:38,000
And I'm going to show you a lot of examples. So first example, flu is the most famous.

439
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:43,310
It is not the only segment of virus in nature, but it is the most famous.

440
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:54,860
So this is a diagram of the emergence of influenza A H7N9, and this is one that came from the Aegean,

441
00:53:54,860 --> 00:54:03,890
came from an avian H7 with an unknown and a in the neuraminidase gene.

442
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:11,780
The DN and name came from an AVI, a different avian and nine strain with an unknown H.

443
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:19,430
And then there are also internal segments that were coming from a third avian virus that was known.

444
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,450
And so when you take apart and you analyze each of these segments,

445
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:33,440
they are coming from three different parts of of that sort of influenza ecosystem in avian, in birds.

446
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:44,159
So if we look at this, the human right here, Goodman is red.

447
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:50,480
It's coming from the red virus up here. And then you've got the blue virus right here is contributing neuraminidase.

448
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,160
It's a type nine erm and it is contributing and blue right there.

449
00:54:55,430 --> 00:55:01,339
Notice that they very smartly I like this how they color coded the outside the surface proteins of influenza

450
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:08,270
can be hemagglutinin neuraminidase and you can see that they've color coding that coded them accordingly.

451
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:13,200
So some of the surface proteins this is what is in most flu vaccines are the

452
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:19,690
matches the age here some of the surface proteins matches the blue and red here.

453
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:28,580
Then the green virus here is contributing a lot of these internal segments, including the nuclear protein, the matrix proteins inside that.

454
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:37,940
I an individual. How do we get to that cell?

455
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:43,640
You In order for that to happen, you actually need a host that's infected with two viruses.

456
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:51,380
Right. You need a host like this, this lovely pig here who is infected with a red virus and a blue virus.

457
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:58,100
And furthermore, it's not just that the host needs to be infected with the red virus, the flu virus.

458
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:03,680
This example of the pig here has a blue virus infecting this respiratory cell and a red virus like this.

459
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:08,600
You actually need both virions to infect the same cell itself.

460
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:16,070
So you both need two viruses, and those two variants need to make it to the same part of the host and the

461
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:19,970
same cellular receptor and enter the same cell in order for that to happen.

462
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:25,310
So there's a lot that goes into making sure that that happens, making sure that works.

463
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:33,620
But he. Back influenza emergence.

464
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:42,260
If you're going to have a recombination event, it means that you have a force that is able to be infected by both of these different types of viruses.

465
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:52,190
So when we put this reassortment and change that happens between viruses that affect different parts of the animal kingdom.

466
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:59,670
You need a you. And whoever had a bird influenza or UniSA,

467
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:05,050
you sort of need these animals that can cross receptors with many viruses from many different parts of the world.

468
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:08,530
Our friends are worried about that more than we talk about emergence.

469
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:15,060
Okay. So that is any questions there.

470
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:28,240
All right. We are going to pause here and work on the group workshop and I'm going to pause the recording.

471
00:57:41,881 --> 00:57:48,151
Horacio mentioned. What are the goals of this class as I want you to be able to read the literature and find porosity concepts,

472
00:57:48,151 --> 00:57:53,881
find core epidemiology concepts and understand them and interact with them critically, review them.

473
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:58,801
But one of the pieces of that is to be able to communicate what you have learned from the others.

474
00:57:59,251 --> 00:58:04,801
So you have two choices for this assignment or to spread them out throughout the semester.

475
00:58:04,921 --> 00:58:09,661
But I have restricted the number of signups so that not everybody can sign up for the last day.

476
00:58:10,171 --> 00:58:14,011
And I'd like you to do a ten minute presentation of the class.

477
00:58:14,011 --> 00:58:17,521
So read a paper and then your presentation.

478
00:58:18,481 --> 00:58:22,021
So you set up a date, you choose an article if you'd like help choosing an article.

479
00:58:22,021 --> 00:58:28,441
I'm happy to help. One week prior to your date, I'm going to open up a discussion board on campus,

480
00:58:28,441 --> 00:58:32,821
and your article is going to get posted there because your peers are going to read your article also ahead of time,

481
00:58:33,451 --> 00:58:40,771
and then you're going to present on your date and then following the presentation and submit your presentation slides to canvas as your assignment.

482
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:50,901
So you have. That the article as if you are an author presenting at a scientific conference presented in first person.

483
00:58:50,911 --> 00:58:56,101
We did this, we do that, stuff like that. I won't tell the authors that you're stealing their stuff.

484
00:58:57,061 --> 00:59:00,871
So we got introductions, methods, results, limitations, conclusions.

485
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:05,641
If you want some examples of what that looks like, I can find some recordings or some sites to look at.

486
00:59:06,271 --> 00:59:10,801
Second option is going to be what I call a stakeholder briefing.

487
00:59:11,401 --> 00:59:14,581
Tell us ahead of time who what audience you would like us to be.

488
00:59:14,701 --> 00:59:17,751
Are we the Health Department? Are we the White House?

489
00:59:17,761 --> 00:59:23,521
Are we, whoever you are, presenting this information to us because you want us to make a decision.

490
00:59:23,971 --> 00:59:27,661
So you're going to set up your site a bit differently. It's going to be a broad introduction.

491
00:59:27,661 --> 00:59:30,781
The findings from the paper. Why does it apply?

492
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:36,001
What's your ask? What money thing policy are you asking for because of this paper.

493
00:59:36,571 --> 00:59:42,171
So that's your second option? I will. In the interest of time, um.

494
00:59:42,601 --> 00:59:50,281
What am I going to do? I will post a couple of examples of these types of types of slides I've made in the past for stakeholder briefings,

495
00:59:51,211 --> 00:59:54,690
so you can choose between those two styles of presentation.

496
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:57,091
I think when you post your paper, let me know what style you're doing.

497
00:59:57,661 --> 01:00:07,381
So make sure you sign up today before you go to just a couple of other for next.

498
01:00:09,701 --> 01:00:16,361
Well, at the home page next week we are going to dove into a very crashy crash course in immunology.

499
01:00:18,311 --> 01:00:24,431
Sounds to me the fastest you've ever learned immunology. So you have got two readings for.

500
01:00:25,811 --> 01:00:31,901
We're going to discuss them at the end of the week on Wednesday. Like the first reading in this class, these are doozies.

501
01:00:32,351 --> 01:00:40,361
These are going to be above the level that some of you are at in terms of microbiology and immunology.

502
01:00:40,361 --> 01:00:45,101
And that's okay. Get as far as you can and we will have group discussions with these articles later.

503
01:00:45,671 --> 01:00:48,580
I also want to point out towards the end of the semester,

504
01:00:48,581 --> 01:00:55,481
we have a couple of remote sessions to remote sessions because I will be teaching you from a flu meeting in Belfast.

505
01:00:56,711 --> 01:01:03,520
Healthy, interesting. And before that, September 21st, I'll be in town.

506
01:01:03,521 --> 01:01:07,330
But we'll have an interactive workshop with Dr. Katie Kostek,

507
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:14,351
who has done a lot of work in antigenic mapping and will read some of her papers and she's going to take you through a workshop before that.

508
01:01:14,351 --> 01:01:18,071
So just in the future, remote session, October 24th, we'll also be remote.

509
01:01:18,491 --> 01:01:20,921
We still have this room on remote days.

510
01:01:20,921 --> 01:01:26,531
So if it works for you to come in with headphones, I know in speech it's hard to find a space to do a remote session.

511
01:01:26,771 --> 01:01:30,791
When you've got in-person classes, you can still use this room to sit down and plug in from there.

512
01:01:31,511 --> 01:01:32,921
Oh, okay.

513
01:01:33,491 --> 01:01:43,481
I think that breaks your read to read those immunology papers for next week and I'll take a look at your workshop answers and and wrap that up.

514
01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:45,911
Okay. Thank you, everybody.
