1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:11,760
So now I would like to talk about ACCESS our organization and talk about our model

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,030
and how we address health disparities specifically in the communities that we serve.

3
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,200
ACCESS has been around for over 50 years, actually

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:32,370
sadly, this year is our fiftieth anniversary. And if it wasn't a pandemic, we would probably having a be having a huge gala and a party.

5
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,900
But because we are public health, we're obviously not going to be doing that.

6
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,250
So I hope you'll join me in celebrating our fiftieth anniversary this year

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,630
in 2021. ACCESS was started by a group of volunteers,

8
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:54,000
people in the community who saw this need and this growing population of immigrants who were coming in.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,920
And they did not have a good idea of how to navigate the system in the United States.

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:07,770
And these volunteers were young people that were being approached by a lot of their neighbors, friends and families to help fill out forms,

11
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:18,600
to help them get connected to services just because they spoke English and were accustomed to the United States system.

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:26,640
And that's how ACCESS began. Those volunteers ended up getting a store front and then they ended up growing the organization,

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,470
trying to find some funding to officially create programing that could link people to benefits.

14
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,110
Today, ACCESS has over 150 programs, 400 plus employees.

15
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,300
We not only exist locally, but also have national influence.

16
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,810
Among our programs is a Arab American National Museum,

17
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:59,820
which is a Smithsonian affiliated program that really it's a museum that captures the immigration experience of Arab Americans.

18
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,130
We also have a national network for Arab communities.

19
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:13,770
So we provide through this program, we provide technical assistance to other smaller Arab organizations around the country

20
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,870
that are interested in building their programing and building an advocacy platform.

21
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,530
So really, from that small storefront organization,

22
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:32,430
we have popcorned into this huge organization that provides all these services is on national advocacy platforms,

23
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:42,120
and it really has become an area subject matter expert on the needs of Arab communities.

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,280
So I did talk about a little bit. This is actually outdid, it's 50 years

25
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:53,280
It says 48. One thing I didn't. So we are the largest Arab-American nonprofit in the US.

26
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:00,100
And we actually have 11 locations and 150 programs.

27
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:13,350
That also needs to be updated I guess. The mission of ACCESS is to to empower communities to improve their economic, social and cultural well-being.

28
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:20,520
And our vision is a just and equitable society with the full participation of Arab Americans.

29
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,660
If you look at the ACCESS logo, there's three words under it.

30
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,640
And the word the word that's most important is empower.

31
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:36,750
So it's assisting, improving and empowering. And this is a really, really important part of our model.

32
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,010
And I want you to kind of keep that in mind as we move forward with these slides.

33
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:47,700
And I'm going to talk about it more when we talk about the CHRC and ACCESS model.

34
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:53,580
So we have many divisions at ACCESS

35
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:01,620
and a lot of the divisions address the specific health and human services that are provided to our community.

36
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,780
So we have a youth and education division, social services division.

37
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:14,610
We have employment and training division. The division that I represent is the Community Health and Resource Centers.

38
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:21,630
So that's kind of what I'm going to focus on today, because we certainly don't have time to focus on all of the other programmatic divisions.

39
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,040
But using the Community Health and Research Center as a case study,

40
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:35,280
I'll be able to talk to you more about how we center vulnerable communities in our service provision.

41
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,650
So the Community Health and Research Center is one of the largest divisions at ACCESS.

42
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:52,440
We have sixty five plus programs and the focus of the programs is providing service in a culturally and linguistically competent manner.

43
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:59,490
It's very it's very hard to talk about programs without categorizing them so that they become more tangible.

44
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:07,500
Right. So the easiest way to group our programing is healthy minds, healthy bodies and healthy communities.

45
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:16,090
The goal of the Community Health Research Center is to provide a one stop shop for all of the needs for a person that comes in.

46
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,010
And this is a really, really important factor for us.

47
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:24,090
So we provide we have several behavioral health programs.

48
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:33,090
We actually have a behavioral health clinic at ACCESS with close to 3000 mental health clients.

49
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:43,200
We also have specialty programs in behavior help. We provide services to victims of survivors of torture and victims of crime,

50
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:49,710
as well as refugees and immigrants that are looking for just general mental health.

51
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,900
And we provide we provide a medical clinic.

52
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:00,030
So we actually have a primary care clinic on site in two of our locations in two

53
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:06,730
different counties so that we can give access to primary care to vulnerable communities

54
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:12,780
In a as far spread manner as possible and then the program that intertwines

55
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:18,270
with both behavioral health and physical health is our Healthy Communities program,

56
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,740
which is public health.

57
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:30,150
So within this, we you know, we run a ton of education campaigns which have become increasingly important in the context of the pandemic.

58
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:36,900
Talking to people about how to be healthy and safe, doing diabetes prevention classes,

59
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:44,610
doing HIV support groups, doing you know even a domestic violence prevention programing,

60
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:57,490
you know, talking to families, talking to lawmakers, as well as faith leaders on how us as a community can prevent violence in our community.

61
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:03,040
The CHRC model is centered around, like I mentioned before

62
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:15,340
Our goal is to center the most vulnerable in our community and provide them care in the way that it's easy for them. In the United States

63
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:25,570
Health care is very centralized. A lot of the times our programing is focused on a large hospital systems, you know,

64
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:36,280
general billing and payment models that are central and that are guided by corporations as well as government agencies.

65
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,840
Our goal is to work to decentralize and decolonize health.

66
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:50,390
And the most the way in which we do that is we make if somebody comes through our door, we make sure that we meet every need that they have.

67
00:07:50,390 --> 00:08:04,100
We make sure that we are not just solving their issue, but also helping them be more self-sustained and be able to solve future issues and help others,

68
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:14,840
and we make sure that our voice is heard not just in our regional circles but also on the national level.

69
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:25,460
So it's really important for us to be there as an example of an organization that that is for the community and by the community.

70
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:33,380
And the three key things that we do, which I've kind of talked about already, but is integration, empowerment and research and advocacy.

71
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:46,910
So let's kind of dig into it a little bit more. So I think the easiest way to refer to this is that integrated care is that when at ACCESS

72
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:55,070
A success story is not that somebody came in and they had a need and be fulfilled that need, its that somebody came in

73
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:03,920
They had a need. We fulfilled their need. And then we empower them to become somebody who can help others in fulfilling their needs.

74
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,790
And this is a really, really important part of the ACCESS success story.

75
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,660
And then other thing that's really important is that when somebody comes in,

76
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:25,280
let's say they come into a primary care clinic and they have a fever and a cold, which nowadays I am nervous about saying that because we're in Covid times.

77
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,050
But, you know, somebody has a fever and a cold. They come into the primary care clinic.

78
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,920
They will work with a primary care and get the medical care.

79
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:42,380
But in that process, there would be somebody at a clinic who will assess them for all of their social needs that maybe there.

80
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:48,830
So let's say you do a little assessment and you find out that they are facing eviction

81
00:09:48,830 --> 00:10:00,140
or they live in an unsafe home environment or their child is being bullied at school.

82
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:05,420
So we try to keep make assessment of all the different things that impact

83
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,760
this person and try to get coordinate so that we can resolve these issues.

84
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:17,380
And in doing so, what we end up doing is we we end up empowering the person.

85
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:27,370
So in my empower slides, it's very hard for me to cut things down because there are so many amazing, incredible stories at ACCESS.

86
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:34,750
This is actually a picture of one of our peer coaches. His name is Nader.

87
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:46,890
Nader currently works as a peer coach, which means that he works with clients that are struggling with addiction and he himself is in recovery.

88
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:56,950
And because he had this has a lived experience, he knows all of the social factors that come in the way off,

89
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,980
you know, of of trying to find that pathway to recovery.

90
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,970
When you're facing addiction. So it's very hard.

91
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:15,940
If you don't have a job or a plan or some sort of a goal or a future dream for you to think about how to start that that struggle,

92
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:26,640
you know, towards recovery. He you know, him and so many others that ACCESS are people that started as clients.

93
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:34,350
And then we help them solve the issue. We help them empower them to become somebody who can help others.

94
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:43,980
And then we ended up hiring them so that they can continue that work. So this circle of empowerment is a very key portion to the story ACCESS.

95
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:50,060
There's some other examples here, too. So on the left, here is pictures from our clubhouse. Clubhouse

96
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:55,140
Is an adult day center for people with serious mental illness.

97
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:01,500
And right now, you would think what's going on with the clubhouse and the pandemic, it is in full steam.

98
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:12,240
Virtually. Our staff members of the clubhouse have been working with the clients or we call them members because they're equal part

99
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:19,980
of the clubhouse to make sure that we fulfill the digital gap and that they are able to engage in virtual services.

100
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:26,220
So the clubhouse does all these programing to make sure that these individuals have a productive

101
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,530
day and that they eventually connected to employment and are able to become self-sufficient.

102
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:38,130
And one of the things they did years ago, which continues to this day, is they started a community garden.

103
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:47,250
They found out that a lot of the clubhouse members were really, really interested in gardening and getting their hands dirty.

104
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,870
So they started this garden and it became it just flourished.

105
00:12:51,870 --> 00:13:01,320
I do not have a green thumb, so I stay to this day impressed by the amount of produce that this garden was able to produce.

106
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:08,560
And it was there was so much produce and they didn't know what to do with it because they were cooking some of it, but they can't cook at all.

107
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:17,820
And the members of the clubhouse came up with this idea of making baskets of produce and distributing it to families of need in the community.

108
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:25,380
So they looked through our client profiles, looked at the vulnerable clients and ended up distributing food.

109
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:34,070
So, again, that circle of empowerment. And then it doesn't just work in these feel good stories.

110
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:40,500
The circle of empowerment is really important because it is a key to social mobilization.

111
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,410
So, you know, when you're working with clients that are suffering from a disease,

112
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:53,370
that it has a stigma attached to it, they will work a lot better with somebody who has that lived experience.

113
00:13:53,370 --> 00:14:02,100
So we talked about Nader, who is successfully working with clients in recovery and is able to talk to him openly because he is in recovery himself.

114
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,600
But then also, for example, our breast and cervical cancer program.

115
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:17,520
You know, when we first started that program, not a lot of people wanted to join the program because there's a big stigma for cancer in the community.

116
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:25,530
So we started doing a lot of community community clinics, going knocking on doors trying to get women in.

117
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:34,590
So women started coming in for their breast exams. But then this one time this woman came in and we found out that she had a lump.

118
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:38,880
And the staff kept trying to call her, you know. You know, you've got to come.

119
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,040
You've got to get additional care. And she refused to take any phone calls.

120
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,390
So our director actually went to her home and he said, What are you doing? You're going to die.

121
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:56,740
And she said, no, I can't have anyone in the community find out what's going on because I have two daughters that are not married.

122
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:03,820
So we didn't even think about that context, you know, that that could impact her,

123
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:09,020
you know, her ability to take that preventative service or take care of that lump.

124
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:16,640
So when that happened, we realized that we really need to have people who can be role models for the clients that are coming in.

125
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:22,480
So our breast and cervical cancer program is now staffed by survivors of breast cancer who

126
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,000
go to people's homes much like a community health worker model and help navigate them,

127
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,350
hold their hand when they first find out they have cancer and help take them through

128
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:39,510
the whole process so that they're able to get the care they need without stigma.

129
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:48,570
So I'm I'm actually I want to talk very briefly about research, but we'll go go into it further in my next section.

130
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:53,610
So Arab Americans are not considered a minority when it comes to federal agencies.

131
00:15:53,610 --> 00:16:03,060
So one of the things that is extremely important is that we created a platform where research could be collected,

132
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:08,820
where people are collecting research about Arab Americans could be combined there.

133
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,220
So about 20 years ago, we started a summit.

134
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:20,850
It was a conference that brought together not just local but global researchers and public health leaders that

135
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:27,900
are either interested in collecting research on Arab Americans or that are doing research on Arab Americans.

136
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:37,260
So the last two summits we had in in you know, in 2015, we actually took our summit to overseas to the MENA region.

137
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:43,950
We had a summit in Muscat, Oman, with 140 presenters and 400 plus attendees.

138
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:52,920
And then we brought it back to D.C. in 2018 with 186 and 400 attendees.

139
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,700
So these people come these presenters come to these summits,

140
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:02,480
they present their research and then we preserve that research by publishing a proceeding's journal.

141
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,340
And this proceeding's journal is extremely important for those of us who work in programing for Arab Americans,

142
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:14,550
because you can actually that is the source to get any data because it's all community based research.

143
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:20,730
So this became a really important part of our process. And this is how our research initiative started.

144
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:27,300
And when we went to D.C., we really started thinking about the intersectionality between research and advocacy.

145
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:34,680
And, you know, we like started building a research strategy and

146
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:44,120
I'm actually gonna stop here because I will talk a little bit more about our research strategy and how that impacts our programing today.

147
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,720
In a minute.
